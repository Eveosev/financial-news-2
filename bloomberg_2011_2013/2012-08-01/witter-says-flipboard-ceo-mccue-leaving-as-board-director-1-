Twitter Inc., the microblogging
service, said Flipboard Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mike McCue
is departing as a member of its board of directors.  McCue, who joined the board in 2010, thanked co-founders
 Evan Williams  and Jack Dorsey for his time on the board in a
message on the site.  “It was amazing to be part of the board,” he wrote on
Twitter. “You’re truly changing the world.”  McCue’s departure follows Twitter’s announcement last year
that directors  Fred Wilson  and Bijan Sabet, who backed the
company as venture capitalists, were stepping down. McCue’s
Flipboard, a tablet application that displays news and
information from online sources, is benefiting from offering
content from Twitter, even as the microblogger has made efforts
to encourage users to visit its own services.  “Thanks for the time, enthusiasm and passion you’ve
brought to everything happening here,” Twitter Chief Executive
Officer Dick Costolo said in a message to McCue on Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
