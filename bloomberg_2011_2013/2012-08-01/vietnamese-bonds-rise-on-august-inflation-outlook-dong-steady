Vietnam ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the benchmark five-year yield to the lowest level in
more than three weeks, after the government forecast inflation
would ease this month. The dong was little changed.  Consumer prices  may fall in August from July on lower food
and fuel costs, Vu Duc Dam, chairman of the Government Office,
said at a press conference in Hanoi late yesterday. Inflation
slowed 0.29 percent last month from June, official data show.  “Easing inflation will give the central bank room to
reduce  interest rates ,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior
fixed-income dealer at Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for
Industry & Trade. “Investors will likely increase bond
holdings.”  The  five-year yield  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 9.77 percent as of 4:07 p.m. in Hanoi, the
lowest level since July 6, according to daily fixing prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,865 per dollar, compared with 20,868
yesterday, according to data from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank set the currency’s  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
