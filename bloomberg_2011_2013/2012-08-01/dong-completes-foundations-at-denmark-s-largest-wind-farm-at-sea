Dong Energy A/S, the world’s largest
developer of offshore wind power, completed the installation of
111 foundations for turbines at its Anholt project in  Denmark .  Dong completed the work on schedule late last month, the
Danish utility said today in an e-mailed statement. The
Fredericia-based company plans to begin installing the turbines
in early September.  The 400-megawatt project will generate enough power to meet
4 percent of Danish demand, making it the nation’s largest wind
farm off shore, according to Dong. It said in March 2011 that
retirement funds PensionDanmark A/S and PKA A/S bought a total
50 percent of Anholt for about 6 billion kroner ($991 million).  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
