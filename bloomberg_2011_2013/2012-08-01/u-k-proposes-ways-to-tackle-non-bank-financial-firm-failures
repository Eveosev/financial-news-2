The U.K. government set out proposals
to limit the fallout from the failure of financial institutions
other than banks.  The Treasury began a consultation today on ways to protect
the financial system in the event of a failure of the networks
that connect market participants -- investment firms, central
counter-parties, payments systems and insurance companies. The
consultation does not assume that a resolution regime will be
necessary for each sector, the Treasury said.  “This consultation underlines the government’s commitment
to maintaining the U.K.’s position as a preeminent global
financial center, while also ensuring that the financial-
services sector is able to provide essential services to the
wider economy without posing a risk to financial stability,”
Treasury minister  Mark Hoban  said in an e-mailed statement
released by his office in  London .  The move is a response to the recommendations of the
Independent Commission on Banking, a blueprint for banking
reform that has largely been accepted by the government. The
consultation runs until Sept. 24, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
