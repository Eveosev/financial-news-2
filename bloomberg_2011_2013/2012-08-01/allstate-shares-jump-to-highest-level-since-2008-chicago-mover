Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. auto and home insurer, rose to the highest level
since 2008 after second-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates
amid lower costs tied to natural disasters.  The insurer surged 6.6 percent to $36.56 at 10:09 a.m. in
New York, the biggest advance this year. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was 87 cents a share,
exceeding the 52-cent average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg, the Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said
yesterday in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson, 54, has been seeking
rate increases and expanded into selling car coverage directly
to consumers over the Internet to boost profitability. Allstate
had advanced 25 percent this year through the close of regular
trading yesterday, the  best performance  in the 24-company  KBW
Insurance Index (KIX) , after slumping about 60 percent in the five
years ended Dec. 31.  “While Allstate is no longer the deeply discounted name it
once was, we believe we are still early in the company’s long-
term revaluation story,” Josh Stirling, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein, said in a note to clients today. As “the logic of
its strategic repositioning becomes clear, investors’ skepticism
will wane,” he said.  Catastrophes cost Allstate $819 million in the quarter,
compared with $2.34 billion a year earlier when tornadoes wiped
out profit. Net income was $423 million compared with a loss of
$624 million in the second quarter of 2011.  Allstate’s operating return on equity for the 12 months
ended June 30 climbed to 11.4 percent from 3.2 percent a year
earlier, according to a  presentation  on the company’s website.
The insurer has set a goal of 13 percent by 2014.  “We still feel good about getting to 13 percent” by 2014,
Wilson said during a  conference call  with analysts today to
discuss the company’s results. “To the extent we get there
sooner, we’ll just make our shareholders even happier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
