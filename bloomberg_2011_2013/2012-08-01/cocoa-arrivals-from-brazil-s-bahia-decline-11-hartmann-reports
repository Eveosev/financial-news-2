Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, slipped 11 percent as farmers withheld
supplies on speculation prices may rise, analyst   Thomas Hartmann  said.  Deliveries to shippers and processors fell to 70,858 bags
in the week to July 29, Hartmann said in a report yesterday.
That compares with 79,554 bags the reported a week earlier. A
bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Total arrivals across
Brazil were 103,578 bags from 108,780 bags bags a week earlier.  Bahia accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa output and
94 percent of grindings in the past five years, Hartmann said in
an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia and heads the group’s statistical service
on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
