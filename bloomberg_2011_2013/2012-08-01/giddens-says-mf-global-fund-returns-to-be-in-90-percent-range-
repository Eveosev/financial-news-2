MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)  brokerage
customers, facing a $1.6 billion gap in funds, will probably
recoup at least 90 percent of their money, according to James W.
Giddens, the trustee overseeing the unit’s liquidation.  “I think we’re comfortable saying that additional
distributions should certainly be in the 90 percent range,”
Giddens said today at a U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
hearing in  Washington . “It’s going to be an uphill fight to
get, as I indicated, to 100 percent.”  Giddens commented after  Louis Freeh , bankruptcy trustee for
MF Global’s holding company, said it was his belief that
customers would eventually recoup all their money.  “All of the customers of MF Global Inc. eventually will be
made whole” by the brokerage trustee, Freeh said in testimony
submitted for the hearing, which he isn’t attending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
