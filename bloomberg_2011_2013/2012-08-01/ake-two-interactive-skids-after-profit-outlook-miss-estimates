Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) ,
publisher of the “Grand Theft Auto” video games, fell as much
as 7.5 percent after reporting first-quarter results and a full-
year outlook that fell below analysts’ estimates.  Take-Two fell 6.4 percent to $8.22 at 12:26 p.m. and traded
as low as $8.12, marking the biggest intraday drop since
November. The stock is at lows not seen since August 2010.  Like most video-game publishers, Take-Two has struggled to
build momentum in its packaged-goods business. “Spec Ops 3”
and “Max Payne 3” sales were below expectations, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick said in an interview.
The company is delivering fewer new titles, and has relied on
reviews to pique interest, he said. “Max Payne” sales were
particularly disappointing in light of its high scores.  “There’s no doubt the consumer is becoming more discerning
with their dollars,” Zelnick said. “I’m disappointed but
encouraged by our upcoming release schedule.  Competitor  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-largest U.S.
video-game publisher, reported fiscal first-quarter sales
yesterday that fell 6.3 percent.  Take Two, based in  New York , reported a first-quarter net
loss of $110.8 million, or $1.30 a share, compared with loss of
$8.71 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier, according to a
 statement  yesterday. Excluding some items, the loss was $1.16 a
share in the period ended June 30, almost double the average 66-
cent estimate of analysts.  Sales fell 32 percent to $226.1 million and were below the
$255.7 million average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Digital Sales  Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 33 percent
year-over-year and accounted for 14 percent of net revenue,
driven by ‘‘Sid Meier’s Civilization” franchise and “Grand
Theft Auto.” During the quarter, Take-Two also began testing
service for an “NBA 2K” online game in  China .  For the year, Take-Two forecasts profit of $1.75 to $2 a
share, excluding items, below the $2.25-a-share average  estimate 
of 15 analysts. Its forecast for sales of $1.7 billion to $1.8
billion was below the average estimate of $1.82 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
