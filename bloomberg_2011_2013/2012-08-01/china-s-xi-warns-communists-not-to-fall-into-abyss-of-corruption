Chinese Vice President  Xi Jinping , in
line to take over leadership of the 82 million-member Communist
Party later this year, warned in a speech that personal
extravagances and corruption by cadres could undermine the
party’s hold on power.  “The ancients said that if history is any guide, for any
country or household, austerity breeds success while luxury
leads to failure,” Xi said in a June 28  speech  published today
in the party magazine Qiushi. “We Communists should heed this
warning.”  Xi’s comments came in a speech about how the Chinese
Communist Party can sustain itself and continue to build on
successes it has overseen in building up China’s  economy . Xi,
59, also emphasized the need for so-called intra-party
democracy, in which the party’s members, who make up more than 6
percent of the country’s population, feel “relaxed” about
making candid suggestions on how the party should govern.  Xi’s comments come before this year’s Communist Party
congress, which will pick a new generation of leaders who will
govern  China  for the next decade. The party has been rocked this
year by the biggest political shakeup in two decades with the
suspension of former Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai from the
ruling Politburo and the indictment of his wife, announced last
week, for the murder of a British businessman.  Xi said that some party members were focused on the
“pursuit of personal pleasure,” engaging in feasting and other
activities that led them into the “abyss of corruption.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
