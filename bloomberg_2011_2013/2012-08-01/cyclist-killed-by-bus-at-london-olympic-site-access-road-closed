A man was arrested after a cyclist
was killed in a collision with a bus carrying members of the
media near the main site of the  London  Olympics, police said.  The man, in his mid-60s, was detained “on suspicion of
causing death by dangerous driving” after the 28-year-old
cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene at 8:14 p.m. local time
yesterday, London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement.  The collision, which caused closures on the Olympic road
network, occurred at the junction of the A106 and the A12, part
of which runs through the northern part of the Olympic Park in
east London. The police said they expect formal identification
of the victim today.  “The police are investigating the accident and our
thoughts are with the cyclist’s family,” the local organizing
committee of the games said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
