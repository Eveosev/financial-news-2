South  Korea ’s bonds rose, building on
a run of four monthly gains, as data showing a slide in exports
and the slowest inflation since 2000 fanned speculation the
central bank will cut  interest rates . The won climbed to a four-
month high before a Federal Reserve meeting ends today.  Overseas sales  fell 8.8 percent in July from a year earlier,
the biggest contraction since September 2009, the government
reported today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 3.7 percent decline. Consumer  prices  rose 1.5 percent,
less than all 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  snapped a four-day rally even as overseas funds  bought 
more Korean equities than they sold for a fourth day.  “With consumer-price gains falling toward the 1 percent
level and exports posting the biggest decline this year, there
are expectations that the  Bank of Korea  will cut rates
further,” said Travis Choi, a fixed-income analyst at Woori
Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul . The Bank of Korea
unexpectedly lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 3 percent last month.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent notes due June 2015
slipped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.83
percent at the close in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
That follows a 45 basis point drop in July that was the biggest
decline for a benchmark three-year note since 2008. Three-year
debt futures rose 0.03 to 106.00 and the one-year interest-rate
swap fell three basis points to 2.85 percent.  The won rose 0.4 percent to 1,126.60 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,125.20
earlier, the strongest level since April 3. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped four basis points to 7.77 percent.  “Exporters sold dollars today to repatriate overseas
earnings carried over from last month, and we saw foreign
investors selling the greenback ahead of Fed meeting results,”
said Choi Sung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency trader at Woori Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
