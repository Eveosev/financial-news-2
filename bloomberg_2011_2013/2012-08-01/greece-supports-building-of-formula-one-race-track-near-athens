Greece  is backing a private project
to build a Formula One motor racing track in the port city of
Piraeus, near  Athens , the  Sports Ministry  said.  Hellenic Grand Prix races in Drapetsona, a former
industrial area of Piraeus, would improve prospects for tourism,
create jobs and strengthen the countryâ€™s place on the
international stage, Costas Tzavaras, deputy education,
religious affairs, culture and sports minister, said in an e-
mailed statement.  Formula One Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone 
supports the idea of F1 races in Drapetsona and will visit the
proposed site for discussions, according to a statement on the
website of  Dielpis Formula1 , which is supervising the project.  Greece approved plans in May last year to build a race
track near the western port city of Patras for staging Formula
One, motorcycle and go-kart racing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
