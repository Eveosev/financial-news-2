     Aug. 1 (Bloomberg) --Treasuries fell, boosting yields from
almost record lows, after the  Federal Reserve  declined to boost
monetary stimulus while indicating a sluggish economy may prompt
further steps to boost growth.  Before their next central bank meeting Sept. 12, Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues will assess reports
on unemployment in July and August, and the  European Central
Bank  may take steps to ease  Europe ’s debt crisis at a meeting
tomorrow. Eighty eight percent of economists expected U.S.
policy makers to refrain today from starting new bond purchases,
while 48 percent said the Fed will announce the buying at its
September meeting, according to the July 25-27 Bloomberg News
survey.  “They’re saving their limited remaining ammunition for a
time when there’s more stress,” said Daniel Dektar, the chief
investment officer at  Chapel Hill , North Carolina-based Smith
Breeden Associates, which oversees $6.5 billion. “The Fed wants
to keep rates low. On the margin rates aren’t going anywhere
unless the outlook for growth or risks changes substantially.”  The U.S. 10-year yield  rose  five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 5:17 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2022 fell 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face amount, to
102 1/32. The 30-year yield also increased five basis points to
2.60 percent.  Economic View  “Economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first
half of this year,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
today at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in  Washington .
“The committee will closely monitor incoming information on
economic and financial developments and will provide additional
accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery
and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a
context of  price stability .”  Central bank policy makers kept their target interest rate
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent through 2014.  “This meeting was about discussing what they would do if
they decided to do it,” said Dominic Konstam, global head of
interest rates research in New York at Deutsche Bank AG, one of
21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the Fed. “The
lack of policy initiatives right now keeps yields lower and
continues to keep the risk-off mind set in place.”  Treasuries securities reached record low yields last week,
pushing the yield on the 10-year note to 1.379 percent on July
25 amid concern the  European debt crisis  was slowing the global
economy. The 30-year bond yield touched a record 2.441 percent
on July 26.  Debt Returns  U.S. debt of all maturities has returned 2.8 percent this
year, compared with 9.8 percent in 2011, according to indexes
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Their German
counterparts have returned 4.1 percent, while Spanish debt lost
5.1 percent.  The  U.S. economy  cooled in the second quarter as limited
job growth prompted Americans to curb spending while state and
local governments cut back.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, rose at a 1.5 percent annual rate after a revised 2
percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department data
showed in Washington on July 27. Household purchases, which
account for about 70 percent of GDP, grew at the slowest pace in
a year.  Jobs Gain  Companies in the U.S. added 163,000 workers in July,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services released today The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for an advance of 120,000.  The government will say Aug. 3 the  unemployment rate  held
above 8 percent in July for the 42nd-straight month, the median
estimate of more than 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg shows.  Developed nations’ central banks, from the Fed to the ECB,
have cut rates to record lows since 2008. The Fed’s benchmark
rate is in a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  The Fed’s QE program started with a November 2008
commitment to buy $500 billion of mortgage securities and $100
billion of debentures of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac . Policy
makers raised the purchase targets in March 2009 to $1.25
trillion of mortgage bonds, $200 billion of agency debt and
added $300 billion of Treasuries. In November 2010, the Fed
announced it would acquire $600 billion of Treasuries.  Price Levels  Indications that consumer prices will rise, measured by the
five-year, five-year forward break-even rate, means that
Bernanke has persuaded traders the U.S. will avoid the chronic
deflation that has slowed  Japan ’s economy since 1995. It also
complicates the central bank’s decision about starting more
quantitative easing to boost an economy that grew at the slowest
pace in a year during the second quarter. Commodity prices
surged during QE1 and QE2 in 2008 and 2010.  “If the economy stays status quo, they will do more,”
said Leslie Barbi, head of public fixed income overseeing $30
billion in fixed-income assets at Guardian Life Insurance Co. of
America in New York. “Europe is in crisis, but it’s global
economic data that has been fairly weak recently. It’s a
supportive factor that has created demand for Treasuries.”  The 10-year note will rise to 1.84 percent by year-end,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The low forecast is 1.35 percent and the high is
3.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
