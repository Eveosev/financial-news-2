Desenvix Energias Renovaveis SA, the
Brazilian renewable-energy developer, filed a lawsuit in  Brazil 
against  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) ,  China ’s largest turbine
supplier, alleging it stole software running 23 turbines
Desenvix purchased from the supplier, the Financial Times
reported today.  Desenvix initiated legal proceedings in response to a
lawsuit it faces by  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a Devens,
Massachusetts-based company that’s accused Sinovel of stealing
its proprietary wind-turbine software. AMSC is seeking to
inspect the turbines Desenvix purchased last year to determine
whether they contain stolen software, and the developer is suing
to force Sinovel to allow access, AMSC General Counsel John
Powell said in the  article . Sinovel didn’t comment in the
article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
