The directors of Lebanon’s state-run
electricity provider said the company can no longer do repair or
maintenance work because it has no access to the equipment it
needs, the official National News Agency said today.  In a statement carried by the agency, the Electricite du
Liban directors said work at the company will only resume after
contract workers seeking full-time employment end their sit-in
at the company’s headquarters. The crisis will lead to a power
blackout throughout Lebanon soon, the company said on July 30.  The workers, who have for months been demanding full
employment, have closed the company’s entrances and vowed to
escalate the situation until the Cabinet meets their demands.
Most areas across Lebanon have for years experienced power
rationing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
