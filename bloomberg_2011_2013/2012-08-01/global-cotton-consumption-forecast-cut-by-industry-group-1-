Global cotton consumption and output
will be lower than estimated last month, an industry group said.  Demand in the year starting Aug. 1 will be 23.17 million
metric tons, down from 23.53 million projected last month, the
Washington-based International Cotton Advisory Committee said
today in a report. Production will be 24.74 million tons, down
from last month’s forecast of 24.87 million, ICAC said.  Consumption will be lower as “the rate of global economic
growth is expected to remain slow, and because the high domestic
cotton-support price in China is encouraging mills there to
shift toward alternative fibers,” the group said.  Cotton futures have plunged 68 percent on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York  since reaching a record $2.197 a pound in March 2011
as demand tumbled in China, the world’s biggest consumer. The
fiber has dropped 23 percent in 2012, the biggest loss among the
24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Stockpiles in the season that started today will climb to
15.19 million tons, up 0.4 percent from last month’s estimate of
15.13 million, and 11 percent higher than a year earlier, ICAC
said.  In the year that ended July 31, Chinese stockpiles almost
tripled to 6 million tons, boosting global inventories to 13.628
million tons. This season, “stocks could accumulate at a faster
rate outside of  China ,” the group said.  “The projected accumulation of cotton stocks will weigh on
international cotton prices,” ICAC said. “The extent of this
downward pressure will depend in large part on how the Chinese
national reserve is handled and on the timing and amount of
additional import quotas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
