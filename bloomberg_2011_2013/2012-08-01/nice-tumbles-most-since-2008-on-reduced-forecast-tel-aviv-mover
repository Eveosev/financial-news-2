Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE)  fell the most since
2008 after the Israeli maker of analytical telecommunications
software cut its outlook for the year as the global economic
slowdown crimped demand for its products.  The  shares  of the Ra’anana, Israel-based company dropped 11
percent, the biggest decline since November 2008, to 126.70
shekels at the close in Tel Aviv. Nice’s American depositary
receipts slumped 11 percent to $31.98 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York ,
the largest retreat in three years.  Weaker demand in Europe and  China  is hampering sales at
some of the largest technology companies as  Applied Materials
Inc. (AMAT)  sliced its earnings forecast and  Acme Packet Inc. (APKT)  reported
an unexpected decline in preliminary sales. Global server sales
fell 2.4 percent in the first quarter, driven by a 14 percent
decline in western  Europe , according to a July 10 Bloomberg
Industries report by analyst Anand Srinivasan.  “We might see declines continue in next quarters as the
company needs to deal with competition and lower prices in a
slowing global environment,” said Tsahi Avraham, analyst at
Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Nice needs to
innovate itself to uphold growth and boost revenues.”  Nice reduced its 2012 revenue projection to a range of $890
million to $910 million from a previous estimate of as much as
$950 million. The company also lowered its 2012 outlook for
adjusted earnings per share to as much as $2.38. The mean
estimated of 11 analysts on Bloomberg was for earnings per share
of $2.44.  “We are following a more moderate and conservative
guidance approach since we are not closing deals at the rate we
wanted and customers are putting pressure on budgets,” Chief
Financial Officer Dafna Gruber said in a phone interview today.
“We still expect operating margins to remain intact.”  The shares trade at 13 times estimated earnings for the
year, compared with an average 11 times for stocks in the
country’s TA-25 benchmark stock index.  Clal on July 4 cut Nice to market perform from outperform
and reduced its 12-month price estimate 7 percent to $40. DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. today lowered Nice to market
perform and cut the share-price projection to $39 from $41.  The shares closed in  Tel Aviv  today at the equivalent of
$32.03.  To contact the reporter on this story:
