InterDigital Inc. (IDCC)  won an appeals
court ruling reviving its effort to force  Nokia Oyj (NOK)  to pay
patent royalties on the third generation of mobile-phone
technology. InterDigital rose to the highest since April.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit today
overturned a  U.S. International Trade Commission  decision that
cleared  Nokia (NOK1V)  of claims it infringed InterDigital patents, and
sent the case back to the agency for further review. The  ruling 
was posted on the court’s website.  The commission “erred in construing certain critical claim
terms in both patents,” the appeals court said. The patents in
the case, first filed in 2007, cover power control and high-
speed data transmission, InterDigital contends.  InterDigital has said it asked the ITC to block imports of
Nokia’s 3G phones because the Espoo, Finland-based company
refuses to pay patent royalties on networks that allow mobile-
phone users to hold videoconferences, download music and browse
the Internet. It has another ITC case pending against Nokia
scheduled for trial in October. Patent royalties accounted for
almost all of the $301.7 million in revenue InterDigital
reported last year.  “This strengthens their position in front of the October
trial,” said Kevin Stadtler of Stadtler Capital Management LLC
in  Fort Worth , Texas, which owns 18,000 InterDigital shares and
said Nokia should settle the case based on today’s ruling. “One
of the specific reasons they were unable to collect from about
half of the 3G licensing pool is Nokia, which has the biggest
share.”  InterDigital Gains  InterDigital  rose  $3.88, or 14 percent, to $31.18, its
highest closing price since April 25, in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  In the ITC case, the trade commission sided with Nokia,
saying the patents weren’t infringed. Nokia, whose sales have
declined amid smartphone competition from companies including
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) , had also claimed the  InterDigital patents  were
invalid.  The appeals court decision “confirms the strength of
InterDigital’s wireless research contributions and the
applicability of our patents to 3G technology,” InterDigital
Chief Executive Officer William Merritt said in a statement.
“This ruling represents a significant step toward our stated
goal of achieving $800 million in sustainable annual revenue
from licensing in the next three to five years. Technologically,
it validates InterDigital’s role at the heart of the future of
wireless technology.”  Reviewing Ruling  Nokia said it disagrees with the court’s decision.  “We are now reviewing the court’s ruling in detail and
will consider all legal options, including further appeals if
appropriate,” Mark Durrant, a company spokesman, said.  InterDigital’s second complaint at the trade commission
against Nokia also targets  ZTE Corp. (000063)  and Huawei Technologies
Co., accusing the Chinese phone-equipment makers of infringing
patents related to 3G wireless technology. That case involves
other InterDigital patents.  The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency whose job is to protect
U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, such as infringement
of intellectual property. It has the power to order products
halted at the U.S. border.  InterDigital put itself up for sale last year, and then
decided instead to sell portions of its patent portfolio. In
June, it agreed to sell about 1,700 patents to  Intel Corp. (INTC)  for
$375 million.  Patent Royalties  InterDigital, based in  King of Prussia , Pennsylvania, said
in its annual report that it received royalties from more than
half of all 3G mobile devices sold last year, including ones
from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Apple,  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  and
 HTC Corp. (2498)   Nokia had a license with InterDigital for second-generation
and some third-generation technology that expired in 2006. Nokia
paid $253 million in a settlement reached in 2006. The companies
were unable to reach a new agreement, InterDigital has said.  The case is InterDigital Communications v. ITC, 2010-1093,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
ITC case is In the Matter of Certain 3G Mobile Handsets and
components thereof, 337-613, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).  The pending ITC case is In the Matter of Wireless Devices
with 3G Capabilities, 337-800, ITC in Washington.  To contact the reporters on this story:
