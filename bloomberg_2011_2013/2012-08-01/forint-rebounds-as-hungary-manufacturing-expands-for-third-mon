The forint rebounded from the biggest
drop in more than a month as Hungarian manufacturing expanded
for a third month and on speculation the  European Central Bank 
will deliver on a pledge to defend the euro.  The Hungarian currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 280.65
per euro by 5:17 p.m. in Budapest, after weakening 1.3 percent
yesterday in the steepest decline since June 28.  Hungary’s purchasing managers’ index was 51.9 in July,
MLBKT, the company which compiles the data, said in a report
today. A reading above 50 on the PMI, as reported by the
purchasing managers of 100 manufacturing companies, indicates an
expansion in output. June’s PMI was 52.8. The ECB will announce
a policy decision tomorrow after ECB President Mario Draghi
pledged to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.  The forint may trade in the 277 to 288 forint-per-euro
range this week, depending on the steps the ECB will take, Peter Karsai, a Commerzbank AG trader in Budapest, said in an e-mail
today. “Whether the forint will trade in the stronger or weaker
end” of the range “will mostly be determined by  Mario Draghi ’s
speech,” he said.  The forint reached its strongest level in more than 10
months on July 30 after Hungary ended the first round of loan
talks with the  International Monetary Fund , which the
Washington-based lender said had been “constructive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
