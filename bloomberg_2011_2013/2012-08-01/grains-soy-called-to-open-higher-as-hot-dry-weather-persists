What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents higher per bushel as
hot, dry weather forecast for the western Corn Belt hurts U.S.
crops, Sterling Smith, an analyst at Citibank Global Markets,
said in an e-mail.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
on signs that hot, dry weather may curb yields further as plants
enter critical growth stages, Smith said. Soybean-oil futures
may open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open $1.50 to $3.50 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent higher as drought
curbs production in Russia and Ukraine, Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
