Douglas Kass, founder of Seabreeze
Partners Management Inc., said the business model for brokerage
firms no longer works and so he’s betting on  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) ’s shares to decline.  “The brokerage industry’s business model is broken,” Kass
said today in a radio interview with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt
on “ Bloomberg Surveillance .” “The group’s adverse secular
changes are going to translate into considerably lower industry
returns on invested capital and profits going forward.”  Kass said he’s “short” shares of Goldman Sachs, meaning
he’s borrowed stock to sell and plans to buy it back at a lower
price. “On any strength I’d be short some other stocks in the
group,” he said.  The industry’s return on invested capital fell to 8 percent
last year from 25 percent or higher in 2007, Kass said. “In my
spreadsheets I have it improving to no better than to 11 percent
in the next three or four years,” he said.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
58 percent of its revenue in the first six months of the year
from trading stocks, bonds, currencies and other financial
assets. The New York-based company last month reported its
lowest first-half revenue since 2005 and said it plans to cut
$500 million of expenses.  Goldman Sachs gained 0.2 percent to $101.12 at 12:06 p.m.
in New York. The firm’s shares have advanced 12 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
