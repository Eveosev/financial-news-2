Countries in financial distress in
the south of  Europe  fear leaving or being expelled from the
single-currency union in part because they are concerned they
will permanently lose the euro’s advantages, Hans-Werner Sinn
and Friedrich Sell wrote in the Financial Times.  This worry could be dismissed if the euro region were made
an open currency union, allowing exiting countries to have the
status of associated member, adopting their own currency with
the option to return to the euro at a later time, Sinn,
president of  Germany ’s Ifo Institute for Economic Research, and
Sell, a professor at Munich’s Bundeswehr University, wrote.  An associated member could get financial help from other
euro-area countries and could adjust its  exchange rate  quickly
to restore competitiveness and rejoin the single currency after
fulfilling reform commitments, they wrote.  “The European Exchange Rate Mechanism II could provide a
basis for such a currency ‘association,’” Sinn and Sell wrote,
noting that all countries that have adopted the euro since 2000
have been required to spend two years within ERM II at a range
of plus or minus 15 percent with respect to a central rate
against the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
