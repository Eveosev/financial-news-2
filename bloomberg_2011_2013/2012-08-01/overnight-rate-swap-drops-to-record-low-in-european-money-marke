An estimate of future average
overnight borrowing costs in euros fell to a record low,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap dropped to 5.4 basis points
at 8:48 a.m. in  London  from 5.6 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The European Banking Federation’s euro
overnight indexed average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending
transactions was set at a record 11.1 basis points yesterday.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell to
the lowest since July 27, 2011. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments
into the U.S. currency, was 41 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, or Euribor, from minus 42 yesterday. The
measure reached as low as minus 39 on July 30.  The one-year basis swap was 44 basis points, or 0.44
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 43. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros, according
to the same panel of banks that contribute to Eonia.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 337 billion euros ($415 billion)
yesterday from 336 billion euros the day before.  Three-month Euribor fell to a record 0.389 percent
yesterday from 0.401 the day before. The London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, for three-month dollar loans declined to
0.443 percent yesterday from 0.445 percent, the lowest since
Nov. 7. Libor is published by the British Bankers’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
