Sweden ’s krona surged, posting the
biggest gains of all major currencies, after a report showed  
manufacturing  unexpectedly expanded, damping speculation the
Riksbank will cut  interest rates  at its meeting next month.  The krona rose as much as 0.8 percent to 8.2979 per euro,
the highest since Sept. 11, 2000, and was up 0.5 percent at
8.3217 as of 1:15 p.m. in Stockholm. It surged almost 0.9
percent against the dollar to 6.7411, a three-month high. It
gained against all 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  An index based on responses from  purchasing managers  rose
to a seasonally adjusted 50.6 in July from 48.4 the previous
month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said today. A reading above
50 signals an expansion. It was estimated to drop to 47.7,
according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey.  “Following the surprisingly strong GDP number Monday this
gives further ammunition for unchanged Riksbank rates at the
September meeting and lends additional support to krona
appreciation,” said Claes Maahlen, head of trading strategy at
Svenska Handelsbanken AB in Stockholm, in a note today.  Sweden has been able to avoid a recession this year as
companies such as retailer  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  and Sandvik AB
have benefitted from demand outside  Europe  and as the central
bank cut interest rates. The economy expanded 1.4 percent in the
second quarter as increased exports of services offset a decline
in the export of goods.  Consumer spending  also rose.  The yield on Sweden’s two-year notes increased three basis
points to 0.9 percent.  Production Gains  After two interest rate cuts, the Swedish central bank has
kept rates unchanged since February as it weighs economic
strength at home with a potential recession in the euro area.
The Nordic country’s $500 billion economy generates about half
its output from exports, of which 70 percent go to Europe.  Swedbank’s production sub-index rose to 54.0 from 50.9
while the order index rose to 51.2 from 46.4. The employment
index increased to 47.7 from 46.7 and the delivery time index
advanced to 46.9 from 46.8.  “The Riksbank may take this as another sign that they
won’t have to lower rates in September,” said  Roger Josefsson ,
chief economist at Danske Bank A/S in Stockholm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
