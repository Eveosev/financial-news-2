Gasoline futures in New York rose
after U.S. fuel inventories declined on falling production and
higher demand.  Futures surged as much as 2.3 percent after gasoline
supplies declined 2.17 million barrels to 207.9 million in the
week ended July 27, the largest drop since May 18, Energy
Department data showed. Analysts forecast an 800,000-barrel
gain, the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Refiners
cut operating rates by 0.8 percentage point to 92.2 percent.  “The DOE number looked pretty bullish,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New
York. With “an increase in demand and decrease in production
you are going to get a draw.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 5.02 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.8245 a gallon at 10:48 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract is for reformulated gasoline,
or RBOB.  Futures gained as RBOB  inventories  fell to a 15-month low
in the PADD 1 region, which includes New York Harbor, the
delivery point for Nymex gasoline contracts. Gasoline imports to
the U.S. East Coast sank to 577,000 barrels a day, the lowest
level since the week ended May 18.  U.S. gasoline production  sank  3.1 percent to 8.98 million
barrels a day after outages at refineries including BP Plc’s
Whiting,  Indiana , and Valero Energy Corp.’s Meraux, Louisiana,
plants. Demand for the motor fuel was up 1.9 percent from a week
earlier, department data showed.  Distillate  stockpiles , including diesel and heating oil,
sank 974,000 barrels to 124.3 million last week.  Heating oil for September delivery added 2.12 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8692 a gallon.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 2.1
cents to $3.521 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the highest price since June 14. Prices have fallen 11 percent
from a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4, according to AAA, the
nation’s largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
