Edward DeMarco's  refusal  to allow principal forgiveness at  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  has led to renewed calls for his head. A little-known fact is that replacing DeMarco as acting director of the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  might not make a bit of difference, even if legal  hurdles  to his ouster could be surmounted. The 2008  law  that created FHFA restricts who can be appointed as the agency's "acting director." Under the law, President  Barack Obama  would have to choose among three deputy directors at FHFA, two of whom were hand-picked by DeMarco. And the third? It's DeMarco himself, who remains FHFA's deputy director for housing mission and goals. Obviously it's impossible to know whether the two deputy directors picked by DeMarco -- Jon Greenlee and Stephen Cross -- oppose principal reduction to the degree their boss does. But given the staff  analysis  FHFA released yesterday, the opposition to principal write-downs at Fannie and Freddie extends beyond the top boss. There's another way to get a new FHFA director. President Obama could circumvent the Senate (which has proved a stumbling block to previous nominations) and make a so-called "recess appointment." That would allow him to install an FHFA director while Congress is not in session, much the way  he did  with  Richard Cordray , who heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That's unlikely to happen for several reasons, the most glaring of which is that the election is just three months away. Republicans hate few things more than Fannie and Freddie. Installing someone in the top job overseeing the government-sponsored enterprises would seem a sure way to incite potentially damaging attacks from the opposition party. Obama has tended to tread carefully when it comes to recess appointments, using them more sparingly than his recent predecessors. As of Jan. 5, Obama had made 32 recess appointments, according to the  Congressional Research Service . President  George W. Bush  made 171 recess appointments, 99 of which were to full-time positions. President William Clinton made 139 recess appointments, 95 to full-time positions. Obama did actually nominate someone to replace DeMarco, tapping North Carolina Banking Commissioner  Joseph Smith  in November 2010. He eventually  withdrew  after Senate Republicans, notably Alabama Republican  Richard Shelby , opposed his nomination, expressing concerns that Smith would allow principal writedowns at Fannie and Freddie. As I  wrote  yesterday, DeMarco's opposition to writedowns defies economics. Unfortunately, Fannie and Freddie seem destined to follow his wrong-headed lead until at least November.
