Lebanon has lost more than $150
million in exports through its land crossing with  Syria  since
the beginning of the year, state-run National  News Agency  said,
citing Khaled Farshoukh, head of the Export Development Council.  Farshoukh said 40 percent of Lebanon’s exports travel
through Syria, the country’s only land access, the news agency
reported today. The last few months have seen the sharpest drop
in exports, with the number of trucks crossing the border
falling to 50 from about 300 a day, he said.  Exporters are having a hard time finding trucks willing to
carry goods across Syria, where an uprising against President
Bashar al-Assad has made the roads unsafe, he said.  “This has raised transport fees by about 50 percent,” the
news agency quoted him as saying. “Many insurance companies
have refused to issue policies on trucks, while some have raised
their fees more than ninefold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
