An  International Monetary Fund 
mission will visit Ukraine next month to discuss government
budget policy for next year, First Prime Minister Valery Khoroshkovskyi said.  Khoroshkovskyi met the IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  yesterday in  Washington , according to a press release
posted on the Cabinet’s  website .  Ukraine was forced to seek loans from the lender as the
economy shrank almost 15 percent in 2009. The IMF approved a
$15.6 billion bailout for the former Soviet republic in July
2010, the second in two years. Disbursements to Ukraine were
halted after the government failed to raise household utility
tariffs, a move the fund wanted to trim losses at state-
controlled energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  “Ukraine has fulfilled almost all the requirements,”
Khoroshkovskyi said. “Still, to raise tariffs for gas and heat
for household without a complex reform of relevant sectors of
the national economy will not bring about the expected effect.”  -- Editor: James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
