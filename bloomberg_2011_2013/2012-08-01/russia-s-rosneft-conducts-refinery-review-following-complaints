OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, conducted a review of its Komsomolsk refinery after
local residents complained of a foul odor.  The refinery is operating as usual and the government’s
industrial watchdog hasn’t detected heightened levels of air
pollutants, the company said today in a  statement  on its
website.  The Komsomolsk refinery is in Russia’s Far East and can
process 160,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
