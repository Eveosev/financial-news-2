The Australian dollar fell from a
four-month high versus its U.S. counterpart after the  Federal
Reserve  refrained from taking more action to stimulate growth,
reducing demand for riskier assets.  The currency weakened as the U.S. central bank reaffirmed
its stance that it would keep interest rates low at least
through 2014. Investors had speculated the Fed might signal a
third round of asset purchases. The  European Central Bank  meets
today after its president,  Mario Draghi , pledged last week to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the euro. New Zealand’s currency
declined as U.S. stocks fell.  “People were expecting some type of changes to be
announced,” Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.
He said he expects Australia’s dollar to fall without ECB action
today. “History has shown that they usually under-deliver, but
it seems that expectations are for them to be doing something
relatively meaningful,” he said.  Australia’s dollar dropped 0.4 percent to $1.0461 yesterday
in New York after rising earlier to $1.0543, the highest level
since March 27. It was little changed at 82.05 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, depreciated 0.2
percent to 80.75 U.S. cents. It rose 0.3 percent to 63.34 yen.  The ECB cut its key  interest rate  25 basis points, or 0.25
percent, to 0.75 percent at its last meeting July 5 amid the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent after
rising earlier as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
