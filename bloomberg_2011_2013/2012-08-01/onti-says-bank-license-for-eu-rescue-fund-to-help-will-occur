Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said that the European Union’s permanent rescue fund should be
granted a banking license, something he said is likely to
happen.  “I think this would help, I think this will in due course
occur,” Monti said today in Helsinki at a press conference with
Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen .  Katainen indicated that Finland would not back additional
powers for the bailout fund known as the ESM, saying that
Finland supported the rules as they are written and that they
weren’t open to interpretation.  Italy does not need a bailout from its European partners,
though “unrealistically” high interest rates may necessitate
intervention to try to bring down borrowing costs, he said.  officials should show as much respect for the independence
of the  European Central Bank  as has been shown by European heads
of government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
