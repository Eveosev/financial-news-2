Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  is in talks with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the  Department
of Justice  to settle probes into whether executives bribed
foreign officials.  “We are in discussions with the SEC and DOJ regarding
mutually resolving the government investigations,” New York-
based Avon said today in an SEC filing. “There can be no
assurance that a settlement will be reached or, if a settlement
is reached, the timing of any such settlement or that the terms
of any such settlement would not have a material adverse effect
on us.”  The world’s largest door-to-door cosmetics seller and the
government have been investigating potential violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which outlaws bribing foreign
officials. Some executives have departed the company in
connection with the probe.  Avon also said it is unable to estimate the amount of loss
it could incur if there was an unfavorable outcome to the
government investigations, compliance reviews and its own
internal probes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
