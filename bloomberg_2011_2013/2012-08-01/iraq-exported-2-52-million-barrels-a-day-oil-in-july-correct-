Iraq’s crude exports in July rose for
the third consecutive month to an average of 2.52 million
barrels a day, generating sales of $7.5 billion, the head of the
country’s State Oil Marketing Organization said.  Iraq shipped most of the crude from the southern terminal
of Basra, at an average rate of 2.22 million barrels a day,
Falah al-Amri said in a telephone interview from Baghdad. The
OPEC-member state exported 294,000 barrels a day on average from
northern  oil fields  through the Turkish port of Ceyhan and also
trucked 6,000 barrels a day to Jordan, he said today.  The average selling price in July was $96.50 a barrel, al-
Amri said.  Iraqi oil exports averaged 2.4 million barrels a day in
June and 2.45 million barrels a day in May, according to Oil
Ministry figures. Iraq holds the world’s fifth-biggest crude
reserves, based on BP Plc statistics that include Canadian  oil
sands . The government is seeking investment and expertise to
boost oil production and exports after years of conflict,
sabotage and sanctions. Iraq is one of 12 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
