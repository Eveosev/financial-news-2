The London Metal Exchange will
introduce new levels for the minimum amount of nickel and tin
that warehouses must deliver every day.  The new policy starts on April 1, 2013, the bourse said in
an e-mailed statement today following a consultation period with
warehouse companies. The exchange will convene its committee
reviewing delivery rates across all warehouses, it said in a
separate notice.  The LME board in April accepted in principle a proposal to
require warehouses to deliver at least 60 metric tons of tin or
nickel, or a combination of both each day. The exchange proposed
the rules amid concerns that long wait times may limit the
availability of the metals.  The LME, which has more than 700 storage points, revised
its delivery rules in April, doubling load-out rates to 3,000
tons for warehouse companies storing more than 900,000 tons at a
single location.  The committee, including Chief Executive Officer  Martin Abbott , Deputy CEO and Director of Compliance and Regulation
Diarmuid Oâ€™Hegarty and Head of Physical Operations  Robert Hall ,
is convening before a six-month review of the delivery rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
