Venus Williams is out of the singles
tennis competition at the Olympics, while her sister  Serena Williams  advanced to the quarterfinals in just 51 minutes today
at the All England Club in London.  Switzerland’s  Roger Federer  and  Stanislas Wawrinka , the
defending gold medalists in men’s doubles, fell to Andy Ram and
Jonathan Erlich of Israel, and the top three seeded men’s
singles players advanced to the quarterfinals.  Winner of the gold medal at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Venus
Williams fell to Germany’s Angelique Kerber 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5)
after squandering three set points in the first set and a
service-break advantage in the second. Serena Williams, who won
her fifth Wimbledon title on the same courts last month, cruised
into the quarterfinals with a 6-1, 6-0 victory against  Vera Zvonareva  of Russia.  “I was just playing unbelievable,” Serena Williams, who
hit 12 aces, told NBC. “I was nervous going into the match and
I didn’t speak to anyone and I had a bad practice. I had no idea
I would play like this.”  The Williams sisters have advanced to the quarterfinals in
the doubles tournament. The pair won gold in doubles in both
2000 and 2008.  Federer and Wawrinka, who won the doubles gold four years
ago in Beijing, fell 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.  Federer, the world’s top-ranked singles player, is
competing in his first tournament since winning a record-tying
seventh Wimbledon title in July. He advanced in singles with a
7-5, 6-3 win against  Denis Istomin  of Uzbekistan.  Djokovic Wins  Second-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia and third-seeded
 Andy Murray  of Britain rallied from one set down to advance to
the quarterfinals. Djokovic, winner of the bronze medal four
years ago, defeated  Lleyton Hewitt  of Australia 4-6, 7-5, 6-1,
while Murray beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.  One day after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France and Milos Raonic
of Canada set a record for the longest set in Olympic singles
history -- Tsonga took the deciding set 25-23 -- a similar
record was broken in doubles. Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares of
Brazil beat Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek of the Czech
Republic today 1-6, 6-4, 24-22. The 46 games were the most
played in an Olympics doubles set, breaking the previous record
of 36 set in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
