Ivory Coast  suspended taxes on
imported rice in a bid to prevent consumer prices from rising,
while neighboring  Mali  extended a similar subsidy.  Ivory Coast scrapped import tariffs on rice for three
months, a measure that will cost the government 7 billion CFA
francs ($13 million), spokesman Bruno Kone told reporters in
Abidjan, the commercial capital, today.  The West African nation consumes 1.6 million metric tons a
year, while it produces only 600,000 tons, he said.  Mali extended a subsidy on import taxes for the staple food
by two weeks until Aug. 20, Commerce Minister Ahmadou Toure told
state broadcaster Radio Mali today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
