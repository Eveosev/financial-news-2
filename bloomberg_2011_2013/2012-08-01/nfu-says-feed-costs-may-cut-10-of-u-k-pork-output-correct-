Surging feed costs may cut U.K. pork
output by 10 percent as producers are forced out of business,
the National Farmers Union said.  U.K. pig feed prices have increased by about 25 percent in
recent weeks because of poor crop growing conditions primarily
in the U.S., the Stoneleigh, England-based NFU said today in an
e-mailed statement, citing the National Pig Association. Farmers
responsible for 10 percent of the U.K.’s weekly pork output may
stop production if feed prices don’t moderate by Christmas,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
