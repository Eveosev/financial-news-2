The Los Angeles Dodgers designated
outfielder Bobby Abreu for assignment to clear a roster spot for
 Shane Victorino , who was acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies
yesterday at the Major League Baseball trade deadline.  Victorino, 31, is in the Dodgers’ starting lineup for
today’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, batting leadoff
and playing left field. The two-time All-Star will continue to
wear the No. 8 he had in Philadelphia, after Dodgers manager  Don Mattingly  switched his uniform number to 12, the team said.  Abreu, 38, signed with the Dodgers as a free agent on May 4
and appeared in 70 games, hitting .251 with two home runs and 17
runs batted in. Victorino had a .261 batting average with nine
homers, 40 RBI and 24 stolen bases for the Phillies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
