Gold futures for December delivery
slipped 0.4 percent to $1,608.60 an ounce at 8:45 a.m. on the
Comex in  New York , heading for a second straight decline.  Prices erased an earlier gain of 0.4 percent after a
private jobs report showed that companies added 163,000 workers
in July. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for an
advance of 120,000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
