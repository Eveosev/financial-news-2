JMB Energie Group  agreed to buy a
65.3 percent stake in  Aerowatt (ALWAT) , a French developer of wind and
solar power projects, from its three largest shareholders in a
deal that values the company at 36 million euros ($44 million).  Demeter Partners, Omnes Capital and Viveris Management SAS
agreed to sell shares for 18 euros apiece, according to a
 statement  on Saran-based Aerowatt’s website today. Based on the
total number of Aerowatt shares outstanding, the company would
be worth 36 million euros, according to a Bloomberg calculation.  The transaction requires approval from Aerowatt’s banks by
Sept. 14, the company said in the statement. Closely held JMB,
which also develops alternative-energy projects, then will be
allowed to make an offer for the remaining shares.  Aerowatt  rose  0.8 percent to 17.23 euros at the close in
Paris. The shares have gained 38 percent this year.  Aerowatt operates wind projects capable of generating 113
megawatts and solar farms that can produce 21 megawatts,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
