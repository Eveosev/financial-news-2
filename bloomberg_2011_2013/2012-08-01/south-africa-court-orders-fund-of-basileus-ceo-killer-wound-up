South Africa ’s  High Court  approved an
application for an investment fund run by Herman Pretorius, who
shot the chief executive officer of  Basileus Capital Ltd.  dead
before killing himself, to be wound up.  An investor in the fund and lawyer, Morne Strydom,  applied
for the sequestration after the July 26 shooting, Strydom said
by phone from  Cape Town . Judge Barton Fourie granted the order
today, he said.  Pretorius, 40, shot Julian Williams, 37, in the neck and
the chest, before shooting himself in the head, according to
Police Captain Frederick van Wyk. Pretorius and Williams had
been partners in Abante Capital, a Cape Town hedge fund.  The court will appoint a trustee for Pretorius’ RVAF Trust
on Aug. 3, Lambertus Von Wielligh Bester, a liquidator at
 Progressive Administration Pty Ltd.  and who applied to be the
trustee, said by phone.  “I have been told, and I haven’t been able to verify, that
there approximately 3,000 investors involved,” Bester said.  The Pretoria-based Financial Services Board started a
formal investigation into Pretorius last month, Financial
Services Providers Deputy Registrar German Anderson said on July
30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
