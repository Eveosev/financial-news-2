Most Asian currencies dropped before
policy decisions by the  Federal Reserve  and  European Central
Bank  and as Chinese manufacturing data trailed forecasts.  The  yuan  snapped a four-day advance as the Purchasing
Managers’  Index (MXAP)  for July released today was 50.1, compared with
the 50.5 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The Fed will
probably forgo announcing a third round of large-scale asset
purchases after it concludes a two-day meeting today, according
to another Bloomberg survey. The European Central Bank meets
tomorrow, after an official report yesterday showed the euro
area jobless rate held at a record-high in June.  “The market is fixated on the Fed and ECB meetings,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. “The Fed will stop short of guaranteeing a QE3. I
think expectations have gotten well ahead of anything the ECB
intends to deliver at this meeting.”  Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 9,470 per dollar
as of 3:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. China’s yuan dropped 0.11 percent to
6.3698, Thailand’s baht dropped 0.1 percent to 31.49 and the
Philippine peso declined 0.1 percent to 41.762.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index was little
changed, with its 60-day historical volatility at 3.82 percent
from 3.83 percent yesterday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of
stocks declined 0.5 percent, its first drop in a week.  Trade Data  The yuan fell by the most since July 23 even as the
People’s Bank of China strengthened the currency’s daily fixing
by 0.02 percent to 6.3305 per dollar.  “The latest PMI tells us  China’s economy  isn’t doing that
great,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst at China Merchants
Bank Co. in Shenzhen. “The yuan is weaker as the dimmer growth
outlook has spurred demand for the dollar.”  The rupiah dropped as a government report today showed
exports slumped 16.4 percent in June from a year earlier.
Economists predicted a 7.9 percent contraction in a Bloomberg
survey. Trade deficit widened to $1.3 billion, compared with a
shortfall of $486 million in May.  “Falling exports and rising imports will increase our
dependence on foreign currencies, which will weigh on the
rupiah,” said Artanavaro Gasali, the head of global markets at
PT Bank ICBC Indonesia in Jakarta.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won gained 0.4 percent to 1,126.60
per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan’s
dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.988 and India’s rupee
climbed 0.3 percent to 55.505. Malaysia’s ringgit was steady at
3.1145 and Vietnam’s dong was little changed at 20,865.  To contact the reporters on this story:
