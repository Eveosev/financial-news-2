Britain’s Olympic women’s pair won
the country’s first gold medal of the 2012 games as Helen Glover
and Heather Stanning led from the start of the rowing race.  Glover, 26, and Stanning 27, the first British women to win
a rowing gold, traveled the 2,000-meter course in 7 minutes,
27.13 seconds, leading at each of the 500-meter marks. Australia
finished 2.73 seconds back and  New Zealand  was third.  “I remember never ever ever thinking we’ve got this, until
we got across the line, and then I thought we’ve got this,”
Glover told the British Broadcasting Corp.  The U.S. pair was in fourth place, 0.2 second out of the
medals.  Ukraine won the women’s quadruple sculls, beating  Germany 
and the U.S. over the 2,000-meter course at Dorney Lake at Eton,
outside  London . Germany won the men’s eight event, with Canada
second and Britain third.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
