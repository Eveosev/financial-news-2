Cattle futures dropped in  Chicago ,
heading for the biggest two-day slump in almost seven weeks, on
signs of increasing beef supplies in the U.S. Hog prices fell to
a one-week low.  Steers  weighed  1,375 pounds (623.7 kilograms) on average at
slaughter last week, up 23 pounds from the same period a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. With heavier
animals and higher grain costs, feedlots have more incentive to
get rid of their inventory, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  “You’ve got to sell more cattle faster, and that puts more
meat on the market short term,” Schultz said in a telephone
interview from  Minneapolis .  Cattle futures for October delivery slumped 0.4 percent to
$1.2385 a pound at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would leave prices down 1.6
percent in two days, the biggest such drop since June 14.
Futures declined 3.3 percent in July.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained 0.4
percent to $1.392 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.7 percent to
79.7 cents a pound in Chicago, after reaching 79.5 cents, the
lowest since July 25. The price through yesterday was down 4.7
percent this year.  Wholesale  pork  fell 3.7 percent last month to 91.91 cents a
pound, and hog  prices  on the  spot market  declined 8.2 percent to
89.07 cents a pound, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
