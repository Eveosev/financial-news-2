Gasoline on the East Coast
strengthened after imports of the fuel dropped and inventories
of the grade made to regional specifications fell to the lowest
level in almost four years.  Total gasoline imports to the East Coast declined by
387,000 barrels a day to 577,000 barrels last week, according to
the Energy Department. Inventories in the region for
reformulated gasoline dropped 10 percent to 14.4 million
barrels, the  lowest level  since September 2008.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor gained 17.13 cents to 19.13 cents over
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in New York
at 1:59 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 9.66 cents to $3.0312 a gallon.  Two refineries in Europe reported fires. Lower production
on the continent can reduce imports to the U.S.  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR) ’s Milford Haven refinery in Wales is still
operating after a small fire yesterday in a process area of the
130,000-barrel-a-day plant, John Llewellyn, a spokesman, said
today by phone from the site. There were no injuries, he said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. said its Fawley oil refinery in the U.K.
is running normally after a fire at an electricity substation
yesterday.  The premium for RBOB in the  Gulf Coast  weakened 2.5 cents
to 2.5 cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  plans to start units at the Meraux
refinery in Louisiana “over the next several days,”  Bill Day ,
a company spokesman in San Antonio, said in an e-mail. The crude
unit is scheduled to return to service by the end of the month,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
