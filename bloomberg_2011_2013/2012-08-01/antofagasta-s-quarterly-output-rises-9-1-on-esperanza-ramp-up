Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said second-quarter output
increased 9.1 percent as the ramp-up at the Esperanza mine added
to production and Los Pelambres processed more ore.  Copper production climbed to 173,200 metric tons in the
three months through June from 158,700 tons a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement today. First-half
output was 336,000 tons, up 17 percent from a year earlier.  Copper companies are boosting production amid rising demand
for the metal used in cables and pipes. Antofagasta is seeking
to increase its production to about 700,000 tons this year from
640,500 tons.  Production at the Esperanza mine, where disruptions have
curbed the start of output since last year, rose 24 percent to
37,700 tons in the second quarter from the previous three
months, Antofagasta said.  Average ore processing at Esperanza climbed 13 percent to
79,700 tons a day from the previous quarter, reflecting “the
recovery in throughput following temporary issues with the
primary crusher feed conveyor in the first quarter,” it said.  Gold production advanced 14 percent to 72,600 ounces from
the previous quarter as output from Esperanza increased,
Antofagasta said. At Los Pelambres, production of molybdenum, a
byproduct of mining used to harden steel, rose 9.7 percent to
3,400 tons from the prior three months because of higher ore
grades.  Net cash costs rose to 99.3 cents per pound from 98.1 cents
the previous quarter on reduced costs at the Esperanza mine,
Antofagasta said.  The company’s shares  rose 2.4 percent to 1,098 pence by the
close of London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
