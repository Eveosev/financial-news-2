Ivory Coast , the worldâ€™s biggest
cocoa grower, has set up a stabilization fund designed to make
sure farmers will receive a minimum price for their beans.  President  Alassane Ouattara  signed a decree establishing
the fund, which already contains 29 billion  CFA francs  ($54
million), government spokesman Bruno Kone told reporters in
Abidjan, the commercial capital, today.  The government plans to increase the fund to 40 billion
francs before the main harvesting season begins on Oct. 1, Kone
said. The fund will not hold more than 70 billion francs, he
said.  The reserve is part of industry reforms that include
selling the future harvest through twice-weekly auctions before
the start of the crop season. The fund is meant to mitigate the
risks of the pre-selling system for purchasers, who have to
agree on a price months before the delivery of the beans,
according to the government.  Under the new plan, buyers must pay farmers a minimum cocoa
price equal to 60 percent of the international price as of Oct.
1, the government said when the policy was announced last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
