The trailing 12-month U.S. high-yield
corporate default rate increased to an estimated 2.8 percent in
July from 2.7 percent in the prior month, according to  Standard
& Poor’s .  Three companies defaulted last month, bringing the total
this year to 26, S&P analysts led by  Diane Vazza  in New York
wrote in a report today. The trailing default rate for U.S.
speculative-grade debt has risen from 2 percent at the end of
2011.  The extra yield investors demand to hold speculative-grade
bonds rather than government debt  declined  to 616 basis points,
or 6.16 percentage points, as of yesterday from this year’s high
of 723 on June 5, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. High Yield Master II index.  High-yield, high-risk, or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
