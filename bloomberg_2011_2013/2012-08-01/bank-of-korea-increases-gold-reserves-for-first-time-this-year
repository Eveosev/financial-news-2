The  Bank of Korea , which has the
world’s seventh-biggest  foreign-exchange reserves , boosted gold
holdings for the third time since June last year, joining
central banks from  Russia  to  Kazakhstan  in buying bullion to
diversify assets.  The bank bought 16 metric tons last month, increasing
reserves to 70.4 tons, according to Lee Jung, head of the
investment strategy team at the bank’s Reserve Investment
Division. Holdings increased by $810 million to $2.98 billion,
or the equivalent of 0.9 percent of total reserves, the bank
said in a statement today.  Central banks are expanding stockpiles after gold rallied
for 11 consecutive years as investors sought a hedge against
everything from rising inflation to  Europe ’s debt crisis to
slumping equities. Their purchases this year will probably
exceed the 456 tons added in 2011, the World Gold Council
estimates. Central banks and the  International Monetary Fund  are
the largest bullion owners with 29,500 tons at the end of last
year, or 17 percent of all mined metal, council data show.  “Central bank buying of gold is one of the pillars
supporting prices and it will continue,” said Nick Trevethan,
senior commodities strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “Asian central banks have a way to go in terms of
boosting their gold holdings. We see scope for further
accumulation.”  Gold for immediate delivery gained 2.5 percent this year
and traded at $1,602.05 an ounce at 3:13 p.m. in Seoul. Prices
averaged $1,593.68 last month and reached a record $1,921.15 in
September.  Korea Buys  The Bank of  Korea  bought 25 tons over a one-month period
from June to July last year, the first purchases in more than a
decade, and added a further 15 tons in November.  Kazakhstan plans to raise the amount of gold it holds as
part of its international reserves to 15 percent from 12
percent. The country’s gold reserves increased 1.6 tons in June
to 101.6 tons, according to data on the IMF website.  “We’ve already signed contracts for 22 tons,” Bisengaly
Tadzhiyakov, deputy chairman of the central bank, said June 7.
“The bank is ready to buy when suppliers are ready to sell.”  In Russia, Bank Rossii increased gold holdings to 29.5
million ounces (917.5 tons) in June, from 29.3 million ounces at
the end of May, the central bank said in a statement on its
website July 20. That would be the most since at least 1993,
when IMF data tracking Russian figures begins.  Still, UBS AG estimates that central bank net purchases of
gold were 116.2 tons for the first half of this year, about 38
percent lower than the same period last year, analyst Edel Tully
said in a July 26 report, citing IMF data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
