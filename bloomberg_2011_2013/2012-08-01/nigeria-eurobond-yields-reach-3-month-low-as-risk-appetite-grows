Yields on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of
Eurobonds reached the lowest in almost in three months as
appetite for riskier assets was boosted on speculation of more
global central bank action and oil gained.  Borrowing costs on the international debt of Africa’s
biggest oil producer due 2021 fell one basis points, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.33 percent as of 4:03 p.m. in London, the
lowest since May 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yields have declined 25 basis points since the start of July.  “The modest pickup in the Nigerian Eurobond mirrors the
relatively more favorable risk environment over the period,”
which is “illustrated by a rebound in the oil price, higher
equities and more appetite for risky assets,”  Samir Gadio , an
emerging-market strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in
e-mailed comments. “Despite the continued uncertainty
surrounding the future of the Eurozone, the overall global
market positioning has been somewhat more bullish since late
June.”  Oil in  New York  and London advanced in July for its first
month since April and March respectively and both gained today.
The  European Central Bank  will announce a policy decision
tomorrow after President  Mario Draghi  last week pledged to do
“whatever it takes” to preserve the euro. While the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee refrained from
introducing a third round of assets purchases at its June
session, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated last month that it’s
an option.  Naira  The naira fell 0.1 percent to 160.95 a dollar and yields on
domestic 7 percent bonds due 2019 fell two basis points to 16.10
percent, according to July 31 prices on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website.  The West African nation sold $250 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on
sale, according to the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  data
on Bloomberg. Dollars were sold from 155.86 naira to 155.92
naira each. The marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate, was 155.86 naira, compared with 155.84
naira at the previous sale on July 30.  “The naira seems to have stabilized in a 160-161 range and
is supported at these levels by the resumption of modest capital
flows into the fixed income market and foreign exchange sales
from  oil companies ,” said Gadio.  Ghana’s cedi rose 0.1 percent to 1.9541 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
