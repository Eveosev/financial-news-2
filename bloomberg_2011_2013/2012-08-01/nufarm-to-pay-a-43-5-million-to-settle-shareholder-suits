Nufarm Ltd., (NUF)   Australia ’s biggest
supplier of farm chemicals, agreed to pay A$43.5 million ($46
million) to settle shareholder lawsuits that accused the company
of providing misleading  profit forecasts  in 2010.  The settlement agreement, reached today 14 months before a
scheduled trial, must be approved by a judge before becoming
final, Melbourne-based Nufarm said in a statement today  One group  lawsuit  alleged a forecast provided on March 2,
2010, of earnings between A$110 million to A$130 million was
deceptive. The suit was filed Jan. 14, 2011, in a federal court
in Melbourne by  Slater & Gordon Ltd. (SGH)  on behalf of Australian and
international institutional and retail shareholders and followed
a Dec. 24, 2010, lawsuit filed by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers.  Nufarm cut its 2010 financial year forecast to between A$55
million and A$65 million on July 14 of that year, less than four
months after its initial outlook, saying adverse weather in
Australia, Europe and  North America  reduced demand for crop-
protection products. The shares fell 28 percent the next day,
the biggest decline in 16 years.  “We are pleased to put this matter behind us,” Nufarm
Chairman Donald McGauchie said in today’s statement.  The cases are: Gaby Hadchiti v. Nufarm Ltd. VID24/2011.
