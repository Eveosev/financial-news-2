Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. sales recovery
accelerated in July with the market’s biggest volume gain,
helping automakers stay on pace for their best year since 2007.  Honda,  Japan ’s third-largest carmaker, posted an increase
of 45 percent, beating the 41 percent average of eight analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 26 percent at
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which like Honda saw deliveries plunge after
natural disasters cut parts supplies a year ago, and 16 percent
at Nissan Motor Co. Toyota and Nissan also exceeded estimates.  “It really shows how loyal Honda buyers are -- more loyal
than we gave them credit for,” said  Jesse Toprak , an analyst at
TrueCar.com, an automotive pricing and data company in  Santa
Monica ,  California . “Not only is Honda winning back market
share, they’re doing it faster than anyone expected.”  Sales of new cars and trucks, a bright spot amid a tepid
U.S. economic recovery, grew 8.9 percent in July to 1.15 million
units, researcher Autodata Corp. said yesterday. The improvement,
buoyed by gains for Japan’s Toyota, Honda and Nissan, keeps  the
industry  headed for annual deliveries of more than 14 million,
the most in five years.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , among the fastest-growing brands in the
U.S. during the past three years, reported a 4.1 percent sales
increase, while affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s rose 5.6 percent.
The combined 4.8 percent gain for the two, which operate
separately, beat six analysts’ average estimate of a 0.9 percent
increase.  Market Share  Chrysler Group LLC, controlled by Italy’s  Fiat SpA (F) , led
gains for U.S.-based carmakers, with sales up 13 percent.
 General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S. automaker, reported a 6.4
percent decline and Ford Motor Co. said sales fell 3.8 percent.  U.S. market share for Japanese and South Korean automakers
rose to 46.9 percent last month from 42.8 percent a year earlier,
according to Woodcliff, New Jersey-based Autodata. Combined
share for GM, Ford and Chrysler narrowed by 4.5 percentage
points to 43.1 percent.  Honda and Toyota lost production and sales in the year-
earlier month after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in
their home country reduced shipments of vehicles and parts.
Flooding in  Thailand  later in the year worsened the disruption.  Toyota’s Comeback  Sales of the Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands rose to 164,898
from 130,802 a year earlier, the Toyota City, Japan-based
company said. Toyota’s Camry, the best-selling car in the U.S.
for more than a decade, had an 11 percent gain, while deliveries
of the four-model Prius line more than doubled to 16,643.  Lexus, which trails Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s BMW and
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz after leading U.S. sales of  luxury
vehicles  for 11 years before 2011, had a 25 percent increase,
led by its top-selling RX crossover.  “We’re right on the plan we had forecasted at the
beginning of the year,”  Mark Templin , head of U.S. Lexus sales,
said on a conference call yesterday. “It’s all predicated on
the launch of new products. We look for big things in the next
four months.”  Toyota’s U.S. sales through July rose 28 percent to 1.21
million, ahead of its 15 percent full-year target. Bill Fay,
group vice president of U.S. Toyota-brand sales, said the
company may revise the goal after August results are released.  Incentive Spending  Toyota led full-line automakers by reducing spending on
discounts and promotions by 24 percent to $1,849 per vehicle in
July, compared with an industrywide average of $2,482, Autodata
said. The company’s July market share was 14.3 percent, up two
percentage points from a year earlier, according to Autodata.  The automaker’s shares rose 2.5 percent at 12:58 p.m. in
 Tokyo . Nissan gained 2.3 percent and Honda added 0.1 percent.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.2 percent.  “The results are solid,” Koichi Sugimoto, Tokyo-based
analyst of BNP Paribas, said in a phone interview. “The
competition will get tougher in the second half this year, but
with new products in the market, they will still be on the track
of recovery from last year’s disasters.”  Honda’s surge last month was led by higher sales of Accord
sedans, Civic small cars and CR-V sport-utility vehicles. The
Tokyo-based company reported sales of 116,944 vehicles, up from
80,502 a year earlier.  Accord, the brand’s flagship model, edged back ahead of
Nissan’s Altima in July after trailing its rival for more than a
year. Accord sales this year totaled 183,817, compared with
183,703 for the Altima. Toyota’s Camry leads both, with sales of
243,816 through July.  Midsize ‘Dogfight’  A revamped Altima went on sale last month and a new Accord
is due in September.  “It’s a dogfight in the midsize sedan category,” said
Toprak, the TrueCar analyst. “It’s the most competitive segment
overall this year, by far.”  Accord sales rose 70 percent, Civic grew 79 percent and the
CR-V small crossover had a 47 percent increase. Honda’s July
market share rose to 10.1 percent from 7.6 percent a year
earlier, according to Autodata.  Deliveries for Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan were 98,341
last month, compared with 84,601 a year ago. The company’s
increase was helped by the revamped Altima and higher sales of
compact Rogue crossovers,  Al Castignetti , vice president of U.S.
sales, said in a telephone interview.  Nissan, Hyundai  Sales of Altimas should rise for the rest of the year as
production of the revamped sedan from plants in Tennessee and
 Mississippi  expands, he said.  “The inventory has been building a little slower than I
hoped,” Castignetti said. The company’s 26,602 Altima sales
included just 8,600 of new 2013 models, he said. Inventory of
the outgoing model is about 10,000 units at the start of this
month, so “the selldown is in extremely good shape,” he said.  Nissan’s market share was 8.5 percent in July, up from 8
percent, Autodata said.  Hyundai and Kia, both based in  Seoul ,  South Korea , may see
their U.S. sales “flatten out” for the rest of 2012 because of
limited inventory, said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for Kelley
 Blue Book  in  Irvine , California.  “Hyundai and Kia have grown so much the past couple years,
but they’ve finally reached the limits of what they’re able to
produce,” Gutierrez said.  While Hyundai’s 62,021 sales in July were a record for the
month, the company grew slower than the industry, cutting its
market share to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent a year earlier.
Similarly, Kia’s market share shrank 0.1 point to 4.2 percent
even as its sales rose to 48,074 from 45,504.  “A tight inventory situation might be a good problem to
have, but it’s still a problem,” Toprak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
