Czech manufacturing performance
worsened for a fourth month in July as companies continued to
book fewer orders from the country’s main export markets, an
industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 49.5 in July,
compared with 49.4 in the previous month, the bank said today in
an e-mailed report. A result greater than 50 signals improvement
in manufacturing performance, while a figure below signals
deterioration.  “New export business received in the Czech manufacturing
sector fell for the ninth month running in July, the second-
longest sequence in the survey history,” the bank said in the
report, compiled by Markit, a financial information services
company.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.8 percent in the first
quarter from the final three months of 2011, the second
contraction in as many quarters, as households cut spending in
response to a worsening economic outlook across  Europe . The
economy relies on demand for cars, auto parts and electronics
goods from the European Union, the market for about 80 percent
of Czech exports.  The central bank in  Prague  cut the  benchmark   interest rate 
to a record-low 0.5 percent in June saying the government’s plan
to introduce more measures aimed at cutting the  budget deficit ,
including tax increases, would further depress consumer demand
and tame inflationary pressures.  The decline in new orders was “modest” in July, while
production was stagnant and inflationary pressures continued to
ease, HSBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
