Argent Energy Trust, a Calgary-based
company seeking to buy oil-and-gas assets in  Texas , raised
C$212.3 million ($211.5 million) in  Canada ’s largest initial
public offering this year.  Argent sold 21.23 million units for C$10 each, with an
initial dividend yield of 10.5 percent, according to sale
documents dated today. Argent planned to sell 19.1 million to
21.3 million units for C$10 apiece, with a yield between 10
percent and 11 percent, according to July 16 sale documents.  Argent’s sale is the largest IPO of a Canadian-listed
company this year and the biggest since Dundee International
Real Estate Investment Trust’s offering in July 2011. Argent
plans to use the proceeds to buy oil and natural-gas properties
in Texas from Denali Oil & Gas Partners LLC.  Argent is the third company to adopt a corporate structure
that mimics Canada’s once popular income trusts, which wooed
investors with high-yield securities. Argent follows Eagle
Energy Trust and Parallel Energy Trust in becoming a foreign
asset income trust. The trust will start trading in Toronto this
month under the ticker symbol AET-UN.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Prokop declined to comment.  Bank of  Nova Scotia , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
Royal Bank of  Canada led a group of banks on the offering. The
banks have the option to buy an additional 15 percent after the
deal closes.  Canadian companies have raised $1 billion this year in
initial stock sales, the slowest since 2008. This year’s total
includes the $579 million IPO of Calgary-based Sunshine Oilsands
Ltd., which listed in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporter on this story:
