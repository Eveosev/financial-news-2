Oil options volatility climbed after
U.S. crude inventories dropped the most in seven months and on
speculation central banks will take steps to support the
economic recovery.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.3 percent at 3:05 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 31.1 yesterday.  Oil for September delivery increased 85 cents to settle at
$88.91 a barrel on the Nymex after the Energy Department said
U.S. crude inventories dropped 6.5 million barrels, or 1.7
percent, to 373.6 million. The  Federal Reserve  also said the
economy has slowed and foreshadowed new steps to boost the
weakening expansion.  “There’s a little bit of excitement anytime the Fed comes
out and says anything about rates, even if they say it’s
unchanged,” Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in  New York , said by telephone. “And there was kind of a
surprising inventory draw here today, so that boosted volatility
a little bit.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which fell 7 cents to 21 cents a barrel at
3:08 p.m. with 2,125 lots trading. September $85 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,010 lots changing hands as
they declined 21 cents to 90 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 56 percent of
the 105,632 contracts traded.  September $85 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 4,904 lots changing hands. They rose 38 cents to
$1.11 a barrel. September $98 calls declined 11 cents to 17
cents on volume of 4,540.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,758
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,303 lots and
December $120 calls with 38,845.  To contact the reporter on this story:
