European Union regulators dropped an
antitrust probe into marine-insurance agreements among groups of
ship owners, saying there wasn’t conclusive evidence that they
unfairly shut out commercial insurers.  “The market investigation was not sufficiently conclusive
to confirm the Commission’s initial concerns,” the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  The commission started a probe in 2010 to examine certain
provisions accompanying claim-sharing and joint-reinsurance
agreements. The protection and indemnity agreements previously
had a 20-year antitrust exemption that expired in February 2009.  The 13 members of the  International Group of P&I Clubs ,
based in  London , cover 95 percent of the world’s tankers,
according to Andrew Bardot, the group’s secretary and executive
officer. Members follow EU law to access the reinsurance pool,
he said in January.  The  International Group  of P&I Clubs welcomed the decision
on its  website  and said it’s working on some amendments to its
International Group Agreement. The group said it had cooperated
fully with regulators throughout the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
