Companies in the U.S. added more
workers than projected in July, indicating the job market was
holding up entering the second half of the year, a private
report based on payrolls showed.  The 163,000 increase in employment followed a revised
172,000 gain the prior month, Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services said today. The median estimate of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an advance of
120,000.  A pickup in hiring is needed to generate the wage gains
that would spur  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70
percent of the world’s largest economy. A Labor Department
report due in two days may show private payrolls rose by 110,000
in July, and unemployment held at 8.2 percent, according to the
median projection in a Bloomberg survey.  “It’s an encouraging sign that suggests there is growth
and companies are looking to hire,” said  James Knightley , a
senior economist at ING Bank NV in  London , who had projected a
gain of 150,000. “Job growth is still not rapid enough to bring
down the  unemployment rate  significantly.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 75,000 to
180,000.  Stock-index futures rose as investors awaited the outcome
of the  Federal Reserve ’s meeting for clues on more stimulus
measures to support the economy. The contract on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index expiring in September climbed 0.4 percent to
1,380.5 at 9:10 a.m. in  New York .  Another report today showed a measure of U.S. manufacturing
decreased in July to 51.4 from 52.5 a month earlier, according
to London-based Markit Economics.  Track Record  Since April 2010, ADP’s initial estimate has either
overstated or understated the Labor Department’s initial reading
on private payrolls by 72,000 on average. The average miss for
the Bloomberg survey’s median forecast of economists was 58,000.  The report “shows OK employment growth, but not fast
enough to dig us out of the hole we’re in,”  Joel Prakken ,
chairman of Macroeconomic Advisors LLC which produces the data
with ADP, said in an interview on CNBC television. “The labor
market is recovering only slowly. The economy is growing
lethargically.”  Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
conclude today a two-day meeting to decide whether the economy
needs additional stimulus to spur growth that has softened for
two consecutive quarters.  Bernanke Testimony  Progress in reducing the jobless rate probably will be
“frustratingly slow,” Bernanke told lawmakers in testimony in
July. He also said the central bank is “prepared to take
further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic
recovery.”  Companies paring back staff include  Callaway Golf Co. (ELY) ,
which in July said it will cut 12 percent of its global
workforce across all levels of the organization to reduce costs.  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, increased workers by 15,000, today’s
figures showed. Employment in construction rose by 5,000, while
factories added 6,000 jobs.  Service providers increased payrolls by 148,000 workers.  Company Size  Companies employing more than 499 workers took on 23,000
jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, added
67,000 positions and small companies increased payrolls by
73,000, ADP said.  Automakers are among those expanding.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
reliant on U.S. vehicle sales for more than half its profit,
said it is investing $40 million at its Greensburg, Indiana,
plant that produces the Civic compact and will hire 300 workers
later this year.  The Labor Department’s report on Aug. 3 may show overall
hiring, which includes government jobs, climbed 100,000 in July
after rising 80,000 in June, according to the Bloomberg survey
median. The jobless rate has held above 8 percent for 41
consecutive months.  The ADP report is based on data from businesses with more
than 21 million workers on payrolls. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC
in  St. Louis  produces the data with ADP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
