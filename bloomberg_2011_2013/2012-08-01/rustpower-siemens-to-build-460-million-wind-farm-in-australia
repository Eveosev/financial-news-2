TrustPower Ltd. (TPW) , a New Zealand
electricity retailer, appointed  Siemens AG (SIE)  as a development
partner for a A$439 million ($460 million) wind farm project in
the state of  South Australia .  The Tauranga-based company awarded Siemens the contract to
engineer and build supply infrastructure for the 90-turbine farm
near Adelaide, it said in a statement today. The project, to be
called Snowtown II, will be capable of powering about 180,000
homes in the region, the company said.  “The wind farm will be built with the most advanced
renewable energy technology on the market,” TrustPower Chief
Executive Officer Vince Hawksworth said in the statement.  Siemens will develop infrastructure that connects the wind
farm to the grid, according to the statement. The project will
be capable of generating 270 megawatts of energy and is expected
to be operating by the end of 2014.  The project formally reached financial close today, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
