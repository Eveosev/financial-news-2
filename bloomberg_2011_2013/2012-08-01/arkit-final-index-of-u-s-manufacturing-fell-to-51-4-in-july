The Markit Economics final  index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 51.4 in July from 52.5 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The final figure compares with an initial
reading of 51.8.  The  European debt crisis  and slower growth in  China  and
 Brazil  may limit demand for U.S. goods. At the same time,
American consumers are slowing their spending and businesses are
tempering equipment purchases.  The industry has weakened across the globe. U.K.
manufacturing shrank last month by the most in more than three
years, another report today showed. An index of factory output,
based on a survey by Markit and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  fell to 45.4 from a revised 48.4 in June,
Markit said.  Euro-area  manufacturing  contracted for a 12th month in
July, according to a separate report today. A gauge of
manufacturing in the 17-nation region fell to a 37-month low of
44 from 45.1 in June.  In China, a measure of manufacturing dropped in July to an
eight-month low. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index unexpectedly
fell to 50.1 in July from 50.2 a month earlier, according to the
Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of those American manufacturers who
respond to the poll of the more than 600 companies surveyed.  The gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The company
surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and
regions, including Europe and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
