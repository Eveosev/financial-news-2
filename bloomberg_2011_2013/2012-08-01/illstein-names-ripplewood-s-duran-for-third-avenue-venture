Millstein & Co., the turnaround
advisory firm started by former U.S. Treasury Department Chief
Restructuring Officer  Jim Millstein , hired private-equity
investor Michael Duran to help oversee a distressed investing
venture with Third Avenue Management LLC.  Duran, 37, joins as a managing director in New York where
he will help manage the joint venture’s principal investments,
Millstein said today in an e-mailed statement. He was formerly a
managing director at private-equity firm Ripplewood Holdings
LLC, where he was a member of the investment committee and
worked on deals including Western Multiplex Corp., Maytag Corp.,
D&M Holdings Inc. and Shaklee Global Group Inc.  Millstein, 57, who oversaw the bailout of American
International Group Inc. as an aide to Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner , formed Washington-based Millstein & Co.
last year. The firm has joined with investment group Third
Avenue, which bought a stake in Millstein & Co. in February, to
create a distressed investing fund.  “Control-oriented distressed investing will be the primary
area of focus,” Duran said in a telephone interview. The
venture comprises a combination of restructuring, distressed
investing and private-equity experience, giving it “a lot of
the right things you need to capitalize on the opportunities
that are going to present themselves.”  Duran said he is building a New York-based team to run the
investing venture. Before his 13 years at Ripplewood, Duran
worked in mergers and acquisitions at Broadview, a technology-
focused boutique investment bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
