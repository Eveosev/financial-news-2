Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
1.6 percent to 809,000 barrels a day last week, snapping a
record string of weekly declines, the Energy Department said.  Output rebounded to the highest level since the week ended
July 6 and jumped the most since June 8, the department said in
its weekly report. Stockpiles climbed 2.1 percent to 19.4
million barrels, the steepest gain since June 15.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol , a
measure of consumption beyond whatâ€™s mandated by the government,
slipped 1 percent to 5.38 million barrels a day, according to
the department.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.615 a gallon at 10:50 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
