Noureddine Malki, a former Arabic
translator for  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL) ’s Titan unit,
was sentenced to nine years in prison for gaining unauthorized
access to documents about military plans in  Iraq .  Malki was sentenced today in  Brooklyn , New York, federal
court for the second time over the matter, prosecutors said. He
was initially sentenced to more than 10 years in prison in May
2008. That penalty was reversed on appeal after an error was
discovered in calculations of his guideline sentencing range.  In August 2003, Malki used a fake identity to gain a
position as a translator for Titan, a contractor to the U.S.
Army, and obtain security clearances, prosecutors alleged. While
on assignment in Iraq, Malki obtained documents describing U.S.
plans for combating insurgents and a photograph identifying
troop routes.  “Significant breaches of national security must be
prosecuted aggressively,” Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the
Eastern District of  New York , said in a statement. “Today’s
resentencing ensures that he will spend nine years contemplating
the failure of his plans.”  James Glasser, a lawyer for Malki, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment on the sentencing.  The case is U.S. v. Malki, 05-cr-00845, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
