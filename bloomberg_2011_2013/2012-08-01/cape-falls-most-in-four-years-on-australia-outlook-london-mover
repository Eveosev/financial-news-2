Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of fire
protection, scaffolding and cleaners to energy companies,
slumped to the lowest in almost three years in London trading
after saying its business in  Australia  deteriorated.  The Singapore-based company fell 35 percent to 187 pence,
the lowest since September 2009. Cape said today the performance
in Australia will be “well below” its expectations, with
revenue and margins falling and delays to projects.  The slump will stop the company from meeting its goals for
the year and will probably continue into 2013, it said. Chief
Executive Officer Joe Oatley joined the company on June 29, a
month after the company took a 14 million-pound ($22 million)
charge from the Arzew liquefied natural-gas project in  Algeria .  The downgrade in outlook for Australia is “a disappointing
outcome given what appears to be a significant market for Cape’s
services,” James Thompson, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove,
wrote in a note for investors. “Our overweight recommendation
is heavily dictated by our assumption that this profit warning
is accurate enough to make it the last one for Cape.”  The U.K. business “continues to trade strongly” on long-
term maintenance contracts, while the Middle East shows “good
growth albeit at lower margins,” Cape said. The Algerian charge
in May remains sufficient to cover the losses on the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
