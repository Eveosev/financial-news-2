Bain Capital Partners LLC has agreed
to acquire 40 percent of outsourcing company  Genpact Ltd. (G)  from
General Atlantic LLC and  Oak Hill  Capital Partners LP, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Bain, the Boston-based private-equity firm that manages
almost  $65 billion , is paying near Genpact’s current market
value for the stake, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. At Genpact’s
market capitalization of $3.9 billion yesterday, the stake is
worth about $1.6 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The deal may be announced as soon as today, the people
said. Nandini Kochar, a spokeswoman for Genpact in  India ,
declined to comment in an e-mailed statement. Spokesmen for Bain
and Oak Hill declined to comment. Patricia Hedley, a spokeswoman
for General Atlantic, didn’t immediately respond to a phone
message and e-mail seeking comment.  Genpact began operations in 1997 as an India-based
computer-services unit of  General Electric Co. (GE)  that assisted the
U.S. company’s finance division. The Bermuda-based company still
gets a quarter of revenue from GE, President NV “Tiger” Tyagarajan said last month.  Oak Hill and General Atlantic acquired 60 percent of the
company, formerly known as GE Capital International Services,
for $500 million in 2004. The two funds, which have the right to
nominate two directors to Genpact’s board, sold some of their
investment during Genpact’s initial public offering in August
2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
