On Monday, shortly after winning an Olympic silver medal in men’s weightlifting, China’s Wu Jingbiao  broke down  during a live interview for the CCTV network. “I’m ashamed for disgracing the motherland, the Chinese weightlifting team and all those who supported me,” he sniffled. “I’m sorry!” As the stunned interviewer reached out to console him, Wu bowed in a dramatic expression of guilt and remorse for committing what has long been a cardinal sin in Chinese sports: failing to achieve gold in an Olympic event in which you are  heavily favored . Wu’s meltdown was well-timed, landing in the midst of an intense public debate over whether China is too obsessed with winning Olympic gold medals -- and only gold medals. On one side is a Chinese public increasingly impatient with state-run media that promote an aging view of Olympic success that values a gold medal as the only achievement worth noting. On the other side is that same state-run media and its unerring desire -- nicknamed "gold fever" by some -- for tangible, countable results. Of  China ’s state-run newspapers, none is more enthusiastic about gold medals than  the hyper-nationalist, Communist Party-owned and operated Global Times. On Monday, it ran  merely its latest editorial against those who would denigrate the  all-important pursuit of first place : On the last point, at least, the Global Times is correct: The Chinese public does indeed pay attention to the medal count, in part because they have  no choice. Since Saturday, no Olympic telecast, website or sports page has been complete without a  small table  showing just how many more gold medals the Chinese team has accumulated than the competition  -- and specifically, than the U.S. And what of the silver and bronze winners? They’re mostly forgotten. On Saturday, CCTV viewers watching the  women’s 10-meter air-rifle competition  witnessed an interviewer brush past Yu Dan, the Chinese bronze medal winner, to get to Yi Siling, the gold medal winner. China's microbloggers picked up on the egregious example of “gold fever.”  “This warm and quiet girl sensibly left without a fuss,”  tweeted a user  of Sina Weibo, China’s most popular microblog. “You paid for this nation’s fragile vanity.” During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it’s unlikely that “gold fever” would have been denounced in such explicit terms. After all, in the run-up to the event, the Chinese authorities spent considerable sums of money for the explicit,  stated purpose  of winning the most gold medals. Whether the Chinese people, in 2008, shared their passion for this goal is an open question. But this year, at least, there’s considerable evidence that they don’t care. On Sunday, for example, the well-known actor  Chen Kun  tweeted a photo of himself and 2011 French Open champion  Li Na . Li, as Chen’s followers certainly were aware, had just been knocked out of the  first round  of the Olympic women’s tennis singles competition. The  caption Chen wrote  was indisputably corny but worth noting because it's precisely the sort of thing a well-known actor would have avoided saying in the past: China’s first-place obsession dates back three decades, at least to the 1984 Los Angeles summer games -– mainland China’s first since 1952. Among the Chinese participants was  Zhu Jianhua , the nation's first international track-and-field star. Zhu was widely expected to win gold in the high jump, but he managed only a bronze. Meanwhile, back in  Shanghai , an angry mob  smashed the windows of his home . Hands were wrung over the act, but its underlying message remained: Olympic gold enhances national prestige. “A gold medal means you’ve won honor for the country, and only a gold medal deserves such notice,”  wrote the Jing Bao , an independent Shenzhen newspaper on Monday, in a mocking take-down of the attitude. "Silver and bronze mean failure and regret.” These days, the direct and implied expression of that attitude comes almost exclusively from the state-run media. In fact, before the London Olympics even the bureaucrats  who run China’s state sports administration went out of their way to make  public statements  that reduced pressure on athletes. Meanwhile, among China’s microblogging masses, there’s almost  universal support  and sympathy for Wu Jinbiao and his weightlifting silver medal. Crowds didn't appear to smash the windows of his home, and if they did, they’d be widely condemned on the Internet. Most remarkably, China’s microbloggers have started condemning state media and others who criticize the country’s athletes for not earning gold. A notable opportunity came on Sunday when the City Times, an obscure newspaper in Yunnan province, declared that Zhou Jun, a 17-year-old weightlifter from Hubei province, was a  “disgrace”  who had brought “shame” on China’s weightlifting team  when she failed at her first three attempts in the women’s 53 kg weightlifting competition. Her performance was labeled a last-place “DNF” -- or did not finish. Even if the failure  was worthy of being labeled a "disgrace," China’s microbloggers were quick to note, the fault was not Zhou’s but rather that of an  incompetent local sports bureaucracy  that chose to send her to the Games before she was ready . Predictably, China’s state-owned sports networks have avoided the subject of incompetent state-run sports bureaucracies in favor of more gold medal fanfares.  CCTV’s endless Olympics coverage remains fixated on gold-medal winners, even though most of China’s online population doesn’t seem particularly impressed anymore. “In today’s world, nobody will show more or less respect to the Chinese on the basis of how many gold medals they earned in the Olympics,”  tweeted  a self-identified nuclear scientist in Sichuan Province. “I don’t care about Olympic gold medals, either, because I know they’re irrelevant to our national power, the people’s daily life and their health.” (Adam Minter, the Shanghai correspondent for the World View blog, is writing a book on the global recycling industry.
