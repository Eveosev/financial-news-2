Senator  Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma
Republican, said he will block a vote in the Finance Committee
on an extension of miscellaneous tax breaks.  Coburn said today he would invoke a committee rule
requiring 48-hour notice. Committee chairman  Max Baucus , a
Montana Democrat, and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the panel’s top
Republican, announced early today that they wanted a vote on the
tax package tomorrow.  Baucus said he is seeking to get a consensus for action.  To contact the reporters on this story:
