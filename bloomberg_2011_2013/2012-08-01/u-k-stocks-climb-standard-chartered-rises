U.K. stocks  rose for the fourth time
in five days as companies from  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Taylor
Wimpey Plc (TW/)  posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Next Plc (NXT)  surged 6.5 percent as Britain’s second-largest
clothing retailer reported sales that exceeded projections and
raised its profit forecast. Standard Chartered and Taylor Wimpey
both rose more than 3.5 percent.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  led insurers
higher after its South African business reported higher profit.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 1.4 percent to 5,712.82 at the
close in London, extending its advance from this year low  on
June 1  to 8.6 percent as policy makers including European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to protect the euro.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 1.2 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.9 percent.  “Decent earnings are helping the U.K.,” said Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX Capital in London. “Better-
than-expected results from Next and Standard Chartered have
offset a nasty reading of domestic manufacturing.”  Stocks pared their advance after a U.K. measure of  factory
output , based on a survey by Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply, dropped to 45.4 in July from
a revised 48.4 in June. That was the lowest in 38 months. The
 median economist forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey was 48.4. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Fed Meeting  U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers will announce the
outcome of a two-day meeting after the close of European

percent increase in sales under its own brand in the 26 weeks
ended July 28, beating the 2.1 percent median estimate of seven
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Standard Chartered  Standard Chartered , the U.K. bank that gets most of its
 revenue from Asia , advanced 3.6 percent to 1,517.5 pence after

billion in a  Bloomberg survey . The lender also plans to increase
its branches in China and India as rivals falter amid the global
economic slowdown.  Taylor Wimpey gained 5 percent to 46.35 pence after the
U.K.’s second-largest housebuilder by volume more than doubled

the  average of three estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Old Mutual climbed 2.6 percent to 161.8 pence, dragging a
