Israel ’s consumer price-linked bonds
maturing in 2017 declined, lifting yields up the most in three
weeks, on speculation inflation will slow as economic growth
eases amid  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  The yield on the 1 percent inflation-linked notes due May
2017 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, the most
since July 11, to 0.34 percent at 2:24 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, declined less than one basis point to 225.
That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.25 percent.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said today the
country must take steps to prepare for the possibility of a
euro-zone collapse. Israel’s economy, which gets about 40
percent of its gross domestic product from exports, will slow to
3.1 percent this year from 4.8 percent in 2011, central bank
forecasts show.  “Inflation is expected to moderate as the situation in
Europe is not getting better,” said Oren Ossad, a trader at
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd., in  Ramat Gan , Israel.
“This environment is pushing yields up on consumer price-linked
bonds.”  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark notes due January
2022 fell two basis points to 3.92 percent, the lowest since the
notes were sold in March 2011. The yield declined 38 basis
points in July. Consumer price growth slowed to 1 percent in the
12 months through June, the lowest since August 2007, compared
with 1.6 percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said July 15.  The shekel increased 0.6 percent to 3.9595 a dollar. The
currency weakened 1.9 percent in July. Fischer said at a
parliamentary committee meeting in  Jerusalem  today that the
recent weakening of the shekel may help exports, which have
declined in recent months.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell two basis points to
1.94 percent. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds rose for
a fifth day, adding 0.2 percent to 267.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
