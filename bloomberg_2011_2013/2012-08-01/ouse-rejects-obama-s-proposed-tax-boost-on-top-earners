The U.S. House of Representatives
rejected, 170-257, Democrats’ proposal to raise income taxes on
top earners next year.  The plan, backed by President  Barack Obama , would extend
most of the George W. Bush-era income tax cuts while letting
them expire on Dec. 31 for individuals’ income exceeding
$200,000 a year and married couples’ income above $250,000.  The Democratic-led Senate passed a version of Obama’s plan
July 25. The Republican-led House plans to vote later today to
extend the expiring tax cuts for all income levels. The House
measure is H.R. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
