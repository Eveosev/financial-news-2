Massachusetts lawmakers agreed to
spend $1.39 billion on transportation projects, including roads,
bridges and rail improvements, in the waning hours of the 2012
legislative session.  The bill was sent to Governor  Deval Patrick , a Democrat,
for approval today after passing the Legislature as its formal
session wound down yesterday. It lists dozens of specific
projects, known as earmarks.  “There are many good things, earmarks that members
indicated as preferences within their districts on both sides,”
state Representative William Straus, a Mattapoisett Democrat and
the head of the Joint Transportation Committee, told State House
News Service.  The bill authorizes $685.3 million of borrowing, which will
be matched by federal support, Heather Friedmann, a research
director for the joint committee on transportation, said by e-
mail. A copy of the bill posted on the Legislature’s website
shows projects range from $225 million in highway spending to
$150,000 for the Yankee Doodle Bike Path from Billerica to the
Bedford town line, about 20 miles northwest of  Boston .  Lawmakers also passed a bill seeking to save $200 billion
in health-care costs over 15 years. Patrick has said he would
sign the measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
