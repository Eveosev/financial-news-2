Argentina should relax restrictions
on access to foreign currencies once the government completes a
$2.2 billion bond payment on Aug. 3, said Ignacio de Mendiguren,
head of the country’s biggest businessmen’s group, according to
online news service  Infobae .  De Mendiguren, speaking in a seminar, said that the
measures are unnecessary, given the country’s current economic
situation, the Buenos Aires-based news service said.  Over the past 10 months President  Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner  introduced restrictions on access to foreign
currencies, including a ban on most purchases by individuals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
