Brazil ’s trade surplus was $2.88
billion in July, the Trade Ministry said in a report published

forecast by 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The surplus was a result of exports that amounted to $21
billion in July and imports of $18.1 billion.  Brazil’s trade surplus in the first six months fell 45
percent from a year earlier to $7.1 billion, according to the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
