U.S. Mint sales of American Eagle
gold coins slumped to the lowest in three months in July.
Silver-coin sales also declined.  Sales of gold coins dropped 49 percent to 30,500 ounces
from 60,000 ounces in June, data on the Mint’s website showed.
That’s the lowest amount since April. In the first seven months,
sales slipped 42 percent to 374,000 ounces from a year earlier.  Investors postponed purchases as they await monetary policy
decisions from the  Federal Reserve  and the  European Central
Bank , according to Scott Carter, the chief executive officer at
Los Angeles-based Lear Capital. The Fed concludes a two-day
meeting today and the ECB convenes tomorrow. The U.S. Dollar
Index gained 1.2 percent in July as gold rose 0.6 percent.  “Purchases are on hold as people are waiting to hear from
 Europe  and the Fed,” Carter said in a telephone interview.  Silver-coin sales declined 20 percent to 2.28 million
ounces from a month earlier.  Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,620.20 an
ounce by 8:03 a.m. London time on the Comex in New York for a
3.4 percent advance this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
