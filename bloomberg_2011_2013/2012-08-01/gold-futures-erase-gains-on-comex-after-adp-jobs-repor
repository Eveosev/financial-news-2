Gold futures for December delivery
fell 0.1 percent to $1,612.40 an ounce at 8:22 a.m. on the Comex
in  New York .  Earlier, the price advanced as much as 0.5 percent before a
private jobs report showed that companies added 163,000 workers
in July. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for an
advance of 120,000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
