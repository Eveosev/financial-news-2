George Bory will start at  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  in September as head of credit strategy in the most
valuable U.S. bank’s capital markets and investment bank unit.  Bory joins Wells Fargo Securities in the newly created
position next month, reporting to Lee Brading, head of credit
research. He will focus on investment-grade and crossover
strategy research, and will “over time” broaden into high-
yield coverage, according to a press release dated today. Bory
will be based in New York and  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  “I am very excited about joining Wells Fargo,” Bory said
in an e-mail today. “Their strong position in the corporate
credit market and existing depth of resources provides an
excellent platform to develop a top-tier strategy product.”  The former global head of credit strategy at UBS AG
departed the Zurich-based bank last month.  “George is highly regarded in the investor community and
brings 20 years of credit strategy and analysis experience to
our platform,” Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research &
economics at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said in the press
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
