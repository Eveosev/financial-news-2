(Corrects user definition in second paragraph, downloads
time frame in fourth paragraph.)  Getting noticed on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s  App
Store  has become more expensive for developers this year, while
application downloads haven’t increased much, according to Fiksu
Inc., a digital  marketing company .  Developers who actively market their apps on the world’s
largest mobile-software marketplace spent about $1.44 to attract
each loyal user in June, an increase of 13 percent from a year
earlier, Boston-based Fiksu said in a  report  today,
Bloomberg.com reported on its Tech Blog. A loyal user opens an
app three or more times, according to Fiksu.  Competition between app developers is heating up as the
market matures and users have more choices among apps offering
similar features. Costs peaked in December at $1.81 per user as
developers tried to attract people who got an Apple device for
the holidays.  The 200 most popular free iPhone apps were downloaded 4.63
million times per day, on average, last month, an increase of
2.7 percent from June of last year, Fiksu said.  Apple has paid $5 billion to developers selling their wares
in the App Store and more than 30 billion apps have been
downloaded since the digital store’s opening in 2008,  Tim Cook ,
the company’s chief executive officer, said at a conference last
month.  Most developers aren’t complaining. Apps for Apple and
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  smartphone operating systems will generate $8.7
billion in revenue this year, up 60 percent from last year,
according to a  report  today by Flurry Inc., a mobile-research
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
