Ecobank Ghana Ltd. (EBG) , the biggest
lender by assets in the West African nation, rose to the highest
in more than three months after saying first-half profit
increased 63 percent.  The stock gained 1.7 percent to 3.05 cedis as of the close

37.5 million cedis a year earlier, it said yesterday. Net
interest income, the money banks make from loans, more than
doubled to 123.1 million cedis from 57.5 million cedis, the
lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
