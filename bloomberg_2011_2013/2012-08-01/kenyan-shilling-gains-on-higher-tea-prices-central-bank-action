Kenya ’s shilling gained for a second
day this week on improved dollar inflows from tea sales and as
the  central bank  curbed  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
0.4 percent to 84 a dollar as of 3:46 p.m., in Nairobi, the
capital.  “The Kenyan shilling has strengthened against the dollar
as the central bank continues to curb liquidity and dollars
inflows from tea are meeting the demand in the market,” John
Muli, a trader at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by
phone today.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 2.5 billion shillings
($29 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average yield of 10.724 percent, an official, who asked not to
be identified in line with policy, said today. African tea
prices rose for a third week, reaching an average of $3.07 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) from $3 last week, Tea Brokers  East Africa 
Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.  The bank also accepted 1 billion shillings in 14-day term
auction deposits at 10.85 percent, 550 million shillings of the
21-day tenure at 10.85 percent, and 50 million for 28 days at
10.75 percent, the official said by telephone today from
Nairobi.  Uganda’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,485 versus the
U.S. currency, while the Tanzanian shilling strengthened 0.3
percent to 1,580 to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
