Peru ’s  consumer prices  rose 0.09
percent last month, the national statistics agency said today.  The median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for 0.11 percent price rise after a 0.04 percent decline in
June. Annual inflation was 3.28 percent, compared with the
median estimate of 3.36 percent from 10 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The annual inflation rate in June was 4 percent.  Peru’s central bank has kept its key  interest rate 
unchanged at 4.25 percent for 14 straight months as inflation
eases and the economy expands at the fastest pace in  Latin
America . Any change in monetary policy probably will hinge on
the evolution of Europe’s debt crisis and  China ’s deceleration
and their impact on Peru’s economy, analyst  Hugo Perea  said.  “The central bank will continue in a wait-and-see mode,”
Perea, chief economist for Peru at BBVA Research in  Lima , said
by phone yesterday. “Internal demand is very solid, so in that
respect you don’t have to reduce  rates . While inflation has been
above the upper limit of the target range, in coming months it
will show a downward trend.”  Policy makers target inflation of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Gasoline prices fell 6 percent in July while bus fares
jumped 12 percent and food and beverages rose 0.3 percent, the
agency said in today’s e-mailed statement.  To be sure, a drought in the U.S. poses a threat to
consumer prices in Peru, where food and drink products
constitute 28.5 percent of the inflation index, Perea said. The
government’s index is based on a survey by the statistics agency
of businesses in the Lima Metropolitan area.  Corn futures for December delivery settled at $8.0525 a
bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday after
earlier touching an all-time high of $8.205.  Peru will post the fastest economic growth among major
Latin American economies this year, expanding 5.7 percent,
according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Latin American gross domestic product will climb 3.07
percent in 2012, exceeding the global average of 2.23 percent,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
