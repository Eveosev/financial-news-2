General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
posted surprising U.S. sales declines, slowing industrywide
growth in July, as Japanese automakers continued their recovery
and Chrysler Group LLC extended its run of monthly gains.  GM deliveries fell 6.4 percent and Ford light-vehicle sales
slipped 3.8 percent, according to statements yesterday.
Chrysler, controlled by Italian automaker  Fiat SpA (F) , increased
deliveries by 13 percent.  Honda (7267)  Motor Co.,  Toyota (7203)  Motor Corp.
and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  exceeded analysts’ estimated gains.  U.S. light-vehicle deliveries rose 8.9 percent in July to
1.15 million, according to researcher Autodata Corp. The gain
compared with the 1.17 million average estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The industry bolstered the  U.S. economy 
with first-half sales up 15 percent, setting a pace for more
than 14 million annual sales and the best year since 2007.  “I’d characterize the market as reasonably healthy,”  John Casesa , senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
said in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “That could change if the
U.S. economy goes south.”  Chrysler, on the rebound since emerging from bankruptcy
three years ago, has benefited from newer models such as the
Chrysler 200 sedan, Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle
and Fiat 500 small car. Sales increased to 126,089, the Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based company said in a statement. The 13
percent rise compares with a 14 percent gain that was the
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fleet Declines  GM and Ford missed 11 analysts’ average estimates for gains
of 2.1 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Deliveries to
fleet buyers, which include government agencies and rental-car
companies, plunged 41 percent for GM and 16 percent for Ford
from a year earlier, the companies said.  “GM and Ford both cut down on fleet sales, which we had
anticipated,”  Rebecca Lindland , an industry analyst for IHS
Automotive, said yesterday in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “We
sort of factored all those in and still saw some disappointing
results from both companies.”  Honda, based in Tokyo, led major automakers with a 45
percent rise in July deliveries, followed by gains of 26 percent
for Toyota and 16 percent for Nissan. The automakers beat eight
analysts’ average estimates for increases of 41 percent by
Honda, 25 percent by Toyota and 15 percent by Yokohama, Japan-
based Nissan.  Tsunami Rebound  Honda and Toyota lost sales in the year-earlier period
after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in their home
country disrupted shipments of vehicles and parts into the
second half of last year.  South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
combined to sell 4.8 percent more vehicles in July than a year
earlier, beating six analysts’ average estimate for a 0.9
percent increase. The Seoul-based automakers combined to
increase deliveries by 14 percent this year through June,
according to Autodata.  Light-vehicle sales in the U.S. climbed 14 percent to 8.43
million through July,  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata
said in an e-mailed statement. The seasonally adjusted
annualized rate was 14.1 million, matching the average estimate
of 16 industry analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Autodata revised sales rates for earlier this year to
reflect restated seasonal factors released yesterday by the
 Bureau of Economic Analysis . The adjustments  reduced  the
volatility of the monthly results.  The industry is on pace for a third-straight year of at
least 10 percent gains, the first such streak since 1973.
Chrysler’s 30 percent first-half increase led full-line
automakers.  Chrysler’s Recovery  “We all thought Chrysler’s objectives were impossible, but
man, they’re doing it,” said Sid Deboer, chairman of  Lithia
Motors Inc. (LAD) , the No. 9 new-vehicle retailer in the U.S. Chrysler
accounts for almost one-third of the dealer group’s sales.
“It’s just been a boon to us. It’s been a real run.”  The sales results further illustrate Chrysler’s recovery
since it emerged from bankruptcy in June 2009 after a rescue by
the U.S. government. The company’s results have buoyed Turin,
Italy-based Fiat, which is struggling with the fifth-straight
year of decline in the European car market.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  plans to build on
the company’s passenger-car sales gains with the Dodge Dart
compact car, which began arriving at dealerships in the second
quarter. Chrysler sold 772 Darts in July. Deliveries of the
Chrysler 200 and 300 sedans each rose by more than 40 percent.  No Slowdown  “We don’t see a slowdown in the second half of the year”
in U.S. industry sales, Chrysler Chief Financial Officer  Richard Palmer  said on a July 31 conference call.  Chrysler is counting on new models in the second half such
as the Dart and revamped Ram 1500 pickup to maintain its
momentum in the U.S. The company ran a national promotion in
July for all vehicles in its lineup that lets buyers defer
monthly payments for the first 90 days after purchase.  GM estimated a sales rate of 13.8 million to 14 million for
July, it said in an e-mailed statement. Chrysler estimated a 14
million sales rate for July in its statement. The company’s
projection includes medium- and heavy-duty trucks, Ralph Kisiel,
a spokesman, said in an e-mail. Excluding such vehicles usually
lowers the rate by at least 200,000 units.  GM fell 0.3 percent to $19.66 yesterday in New York, while
Ford slipped 2.2 percent to $9.04.  GM introduced an offer on July 10 for no-haggle pricing on
2012 Chevrolet cars and trucks plus a money-back guarantee on
all new Chevys to clear out end-of-model-year vehicles. That may
help move 2012 model year Silverado pickups off dealer lots.  Pickup Supply  The automaker said it entered July with more than five
months’ supply of full-size pickups as the Detroit-based company
stockpiled trucks to carry it through 29 weeks of downtime at
its four North American plants. The factories are being
renovated and retooled to make newly designed models next year.
GM said yesterday that it carried 136 selling days’ supply of
full-size pickups at the end of July.  GM’s Silverado deliveries fell 13 percent in July to
28,972, the company said. Sales of the GMC Sierra pickup dropped
12 percent to 11,105.  Deliveries of Ford’s F-Series pickups rose 0.4 percent to
49,314, according to the Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s
statement. Sales of the Fiesta subcompact fell 23 percent to
4,059 and the Escape SUV dropped 12 percent to 21,572.  “We like the pent-up demand piece that we’re seeing with
 pickup trucks ,”  Erich Merkle , Ford’s U.S. sales analyst, said
yesterday on a conference call. “We’re moving into what we
would call pickup truck season as we move into the second half
of the year.”  Global Sales  Slower growth in U.S. pickup sales in the first half helped
Toyota pass GM in global deliveries. The Toyota City, Japan-
based carmaker’s worldwide sales rose 34 percent in the first
six months of the year to 4.97 million, leading GM by 300,000
and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  by 520,000 deliveries. GM global sales rose
2.9 percent to 4.67 million during the first half while
Volkswagen’s increased 8.9 percent to 4.45 million.  Volkswagen, which set a target of more than 500,000 vehicle
sales in the U.S. this year, increased combined deliveries of
its VW and Audi brands by 28 percent in July. The gain exceeded
four analysts’ average estimate of 23 percent.  “We’re seeing the momentum continuing despite a pretty
competitive environment and this gradual economic recovery we’re
seeing across the country,”  Jonathan Browning , CEO of
Volkswagen’s U.S. sales unit, said yesterday on a conference
call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
