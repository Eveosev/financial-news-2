PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (PZ) , a consumer
products manufacturer, slipped to the lowest in two months after
reporting a 55 percent drop in full-year profit.  The stock declined for a second day, falling 2.1 percent to
24 naira by the close in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital,
the lowest since May 31.  Net income for the 12 months through May dropped to 2.54
billion naira ($15.8 million) from 5.7 billion naira, the Lagos-
based company said yesterday. Revenue rose 10 percent to 72.2
billion naira. The company proposed a dividend of 43 kobo per
share.  “This is disappointing as it fell below the market
expectation,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co., said by phone today. PZ  Nigeria ’s
dividend pay-out has been “stable” at about 70 kobo, and
investors expected it to maintain that, Adonri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
