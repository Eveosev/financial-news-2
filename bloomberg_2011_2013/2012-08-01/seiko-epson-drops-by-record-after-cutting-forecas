Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , a Japanese printer
maker, plunged by its daily limit to a record low in  Tokyo 
trading after cutting its profit forecast 64 percent because of
costs to settle a lawsuit by Motorola Mobility LLC.  The  stock  dropped by its trading limit of 100 yen, or 16
percent, to 529 yen, as of 2:41 p.m. on Tokyo’s stock exchange,
heading for its biggest decline and lowest closing level since
its June 2003 initial public offering. The benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average slipped 0.6 percent.  Seiko Epson’s image-device unit will pay $150 million to
Motorola Mobility to settle a lawsuit filed in 2009 seeking
damages from price fixing of liquid-crystal displays, the
Nagano, Japan-based maker of watches and printers said in a
 statement  yesterday. The company decided to settle after
considering factors such as the cost of continued  litigation , it
said.  Net income  may total 5 billion yen ($64 million) for the
year ending March 31, compared with its previous estimate of 14
billion yen,  Seiko Epson  said in the statement. The company also
cut its operating profit  forecast  20 percent to 28 billion yen
because of a slowing recovery in overseas markets including the
U.S. and  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
