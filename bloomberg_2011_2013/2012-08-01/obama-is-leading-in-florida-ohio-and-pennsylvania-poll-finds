President  Barack Obama  holds an
advantage over Republican  Mitt Romney  in three swing states
critical to the outcome of the presidential election, according
to a poll conducted by  Quinnipiac University ,  CBS News  and the
 New York  Times.  The telephone survey of likely voters in Florida, Ohio and
Pennsylvania also finds support for the president’s plan to
increase income taxes on upper-income Americans.  The swing-state polling finds Obama supported by at least
50 percent of the voters surveyed in all three states, with the
president leading Romney by 51 percent to 45 percent in Florida,
50 percent to 44 percent in Ohio and 53 percent to 42 percent in
Pennsylvania.  According to the polling institute at Quinnipiac in Hamden,
Connecticut, since 1960 no one has won election as president
without winning at least two of the three states surveyed.  Support for Obama’s proposal to allow the 2001 and 2003 tax
cuts to lapse for households earning more than $250,000 a year
ran at 58 percent to 37 percent in  Florida , 60 percent to 37
percent in Ohio and 62 percent to 34 percent in Pennsylvania.
Romney and the Republicans running the U.S. House want to extend
the tax cuts for all taxpayers, and Romney proposes additional
cuts in all income tax brackets.  Obama ‘Sweep’  The polling, conducted July 24 through 30, shows Obama with
an edge over his Republican rival in three crucial states weeks
before the Republicans convene for their nominating convention
in Tampa, Florida, the last week in August and the Democrats for
theirs in Charlotte,  North Carolina , the first week of
September. The election is Nov 6.  “The president is running better in the key swing states
than he is nationally,”  Peter Brown , assistant director of the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in a statement
issued today. Recent national surveys have portrayed a virtual
tie in support for the two candidates.  Brown pointed to improving economies in Ohio and Florida,
as unemployment remains above 8 percent nationally, as one
possible reason for the findings in those states.  The survey of 1,177 Florida likely voters has a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.9 percent, the survey of 1,168
Pennsylvania voters 2.9 percent and the survey of 1,193 Ohio
voters 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
