September Syncrude strengthened prior
to the start of  Alberta  upgrader work in the next two months
that will reduce supplies of the grade.  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  has scheduled six weeks of work at its Long Lake
upgrader in Alberta that will start in mid-August, the company
said July 19.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  has scheduled vacuum tower
maintenance at its upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta, in
September, according to a Jan. 31 investor presentation.  Syncrude’s discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate narrowed $4 a barrel to $1.50 at 12:01 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in Alberta into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $22.75 a
barrel below WTI. The grade’s discount has widened since
Enbridge Inc. shut its Line 14 July 27 after a leak. The pipe
helps distribute Alberta crudes to Midwest refiners.  Bakken oil’s discount narrowed $1 to $4 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark was
unchanged at $17 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet’s
increased 80 cents to $18.25.  Poseidon’s premium added 55 cents to $12.40 and Southern
Green Canyon increased $1 to $12 a barrel over WTI. Mars Blend
gained 60 cents to $13.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $15.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
