University of Wisconsin  running back
Montee Ball, a Heisman Trophy finalist last season, was
hospitalized after being attacked by five men in what police are
investigating as an “unprovoked assault.”  Ball, a 21-year-old senior who led college football’s top
level with 1,923 rushing yards and 39 touchdowns last season, is
expected to make a full recovery, coach Bret Bielema said.  Ball was jumped by five unidentified men while walking on
University Avenue at 2:15 a.m. today, according to an  incident
report  from the  City of Madison ,  Wisconsin , police department.
He was knocked to the ground and kicked by the men, who then ran
south toward the Kohl Center, where the school’s basketball and
hockey teams play.  Ball was taken to a hospital with head injuries and later
released. Police said it doesn’t appear that Ball, who is now
under the care and supervision of the school’s sports medicine
staff, knew his attackers.  “My concern right now is for Montee’s health and well-
being,” Bielema said in a  statement . “We will continue to
evaluate him as we approach the start of fall camp this weekend.
I do expect Montee to make a full recovery.”  Ball tied the National Collegiate Athletic Association
record last season with his 39 touchdowns, 33 of which were
rushing scores, in leading the Badgers to their second straight
Big Ten Conference title and Rose Bowl berth. He enters this
season needing 18 touchdowns to become the nation’s all-time
leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
