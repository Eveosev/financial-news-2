Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which has worked
to regain a reputation for vehicle quality after record numbers
of recalls, is recalling almost 780,000 sport-utility vehicles
and cars to fix a suspension arm that may rust and separate.  The recall covers 760,000 RAV4s, its top-selling SUV, from
the 2006 to early 2011 model years, the company said in a
statement today. The Toyota City, Japan-based automaker’s action
also covers 18,000 Lexus HS 250h hybrid sedans from the 2010
model year.  If nuts on the rear suspension arm aren’t tightened
properly during alignment service, excessive play may result in
rust, followed by wear and separation, Toyota said.  Customers will be notified by mail when a remedy is
available, Toyota said. Repairs will be completed at Toyota and
Lexus dealers at no charge, it said.  Toyota recalled 154,000 units of its 2010 Lexus RX SUVs in
June to fix and replace mats that can slip out of position and
interfere with accelerator pedals. The U.S. National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said on its website  the agency
asked for that recall  after learning of 97 reports of floor-mat
interference with the accelerator pedal.  Toyota,  Asia ’s largest automaker, has increased quality
checks and customer-complaint services after recalling more than
10 million cars and trucks worldwide following reports of
unintended acceleration beginning in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
