Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  may narrow
its focus after the shares posted the biggest slump this year in
the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index, acting
Chief Executive Officer Martin Klein said.  “We need to address the complexity of our business
portfolio so it is simpler for investors to understand and more
attractive for them,” Klein said today in a conference call
discussing second-quarter results at the Richmond, Virginia-
based company. He said the company’s share price and bond
spreads are “unacceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
