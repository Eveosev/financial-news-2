The pound fell to a two-week low
against the euro after an industry report showed U.K. factory
output shrank the most in three years in July, adding to signs
Britain’s recession is deepening.  Sterling dropped at least 0.4 percent against all 16 of its
major counterparts after  Nationwide Building Society  said
British  house prices  last month recorded their biggest annual
decline since August 2009. U.K.  government bonds  declined before
the  Bank of England  announces its policy decision tomorrow.  “The U.K. economy is in a pretty sad state and it makes
you wonder why anybody should buy the pound,” said  John Hardy ,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo  Capital Markets  in
 London . “There is a deteriorating picture for the currency
based on fundamentals.”  The pound depreciated 0.5 percent to 78.87 pence per euro
at 4:43 p.m. London time after falling to 78.94 pence, the
weakest level since July 13. The U.K. currency dropped for a
third day against the dollar, sliding 0.5 percent to $1.5599.  A gauge of U.K. factory output declined to 45.4 last month
from a revised 48.4 in June, Markit Economics said. The reading
was weaker than any of the 30 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.
House prices fell 2.6 percent in July from a year earlier, the
most since August 2009, Nationwide said in an e-mailed report.  The pound has depreciated 1.3 percent in the past three
months, the fourth-worst performer of the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 3.1 percent, and the euro tumbled 5 percent.  Moving Average  Sterling’s break through so-called support at 78.80 pence
per euro may pave the way for a decline toward its 55-day moving
average currently at 79.80 pence, according to  Michael Hewson ,
analyst at CMC Markets in London.  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.52 percent after rising as much as
eight basis points. The 4 percent bond due March 2022, dropped
0.495, or 4.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 122.08.  U.K. government debt returned 15 percent in the past year,
according to data provided by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
11 percent, and U.S. Treasuries rose 8.5 percent.  Inflation Outlook  The difference in yield between 10-year gilts and similar-
maturity inflation-protected securities, a gauge of the outlook
for consumer prices known as the break-even rate, shrank to the
narrowest in two weeks after an industry report showed shop-
price inflation slowed in July.  The yield gap contracted to as little as 2.32 percentage
points, the least since July 17. The spread has averaged 2.81
percentage points in the past five years.  U.K. retail prices rose 1 percent from a year earlier,
after gaining 1.1 percent in June, the  British Retail Consortium 
and Nielsen Co. said. That’s the smallest gain since 2009.  Declining inflation expectations may give the Bank of
 England  more room to introduce additional monetary stimulus to
spur growth.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  changed its forecast for U.K. stimulus and
now sees policy makers expanding their bond-purchase plan by 100
billion pounds by the end of March and cutting the key interest
rate by year-end.  The central bank will increase so-called quantitative
easing by 50 billion pounds in both November and February, and
lower its benchmark rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent in
November, London-based economists Melanie Baker and Jonathan Ashworth wrote in note to clients.  The Bank of England will keep its bond-buying program on
hold at 375 billion pounds and leave  interest rates  at a record
low 0.5 percent tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
