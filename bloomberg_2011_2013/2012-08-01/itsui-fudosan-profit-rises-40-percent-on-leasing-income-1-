Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,  Japan ’s biggest
developer, said first-quarter profit rose 40 percent after the
opening of two shopping centers in  Tokyo .  Net income  gained to 9.07 billion yen ($116 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 6.47 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said in a statement distributed through the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today. Sales rose 0.3 percent to 279.9 billion
yen from same period a year ago.  Mitsui Fudosan’s leasing profit gained 13 percent after
Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu and DiverCity, both located in Tokyo
Bay, opened in April and started contributing to the company’s
revenue. The Tokyo-based developer also consolidated profits
from special purpose companies, including its Tokyo Midtown
commercial, office and residential complex in the Roppongi
entertainment district.  “The visitors to the two shopping centers were better than
our expectation,” said Hiroshi Asai, the company’s executive
managing officer, said at a press conference in Tokyo today.  Mitsui Fudosan’s  shares  declined 0.5 percent to 1,519 yen
at the close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company announced
its results after the market close.  Operating profit for the company’s leasing business rose to
27.4 billion yen in the quarter from 24.3 billion yen in the
same period last year. Operating profit for the residential
business fell 18 percent to 2.7 billion yen as it shifted
apartment sales to the second quarter, it said.  Its competitor Mitsubishi Estate Co. yesterday said it more
than doubled its profit for the same period, citing stronger
home sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
