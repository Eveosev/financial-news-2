The entry of E.ON Ruhrgas into the
Slovenian gas market will probably cut prices of the energy
resource for companies, Finance  reported , without saying where
it obtained the information.  The German company will compete with Slovenia’s Geoplin
d.o.o. which controls about 70 percent of the country’s gas
market and GEN-I, the Ljubljana newspaper said.  Geoplin expects to lower  gas prices  from September after
talks with  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom, according to Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
