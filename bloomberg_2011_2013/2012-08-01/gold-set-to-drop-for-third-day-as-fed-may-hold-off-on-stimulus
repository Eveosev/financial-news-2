Gold declined after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  held off on increasing stimulus
measures, lowering demand for the precious metal.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  “will closely monitor
incoming information on economic and financial developments and
will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a
stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor
market conditions in a context of  price stability ,” it said
today at the conclusion of a two-day meeting. Earlier, a report
by ADP Employer Services showed companies in the U.S. added more
workers than projected in July.  “We saw a knee-jerk reaction, but the stage was already
set after we saw strong ADP numbers,”  Donald Selkin , the New
York-based chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.,
which manages about $3 billion of assets, said by telephone.
“There may be some announcement from the Fed either later this
month or next.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$1,605.10 an ounce in electronic trading at 3:20 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. The prices settled earlier at $1,607.30, down
0.5 percent.  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the U.S. central bank kept borrowing costs at a
record low and bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-
called quantitative easing.  The European Central Bank policy makers convene tomorrow.
President  Mario Draghi  said last week policy makers will do
whatever is needed to save the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
