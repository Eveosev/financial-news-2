Indonesia’s rupiah dropped by the
most in three weeks and  government bonds  fell as official data
today showed exports contracted and the trade deficit widened
more than economists forecast.  The nation recorded a trade shortfall of  $1.3 billion  in
June, compared with the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for a $530 million deficit. Overseas sales slid 16.4
percent from a year earlier, the most since September 2009.
Inflation accelerated to  4.56 percent  in July, the fastest pace
in 10 months, according to another report released today.  “We are bearish on the rupiah now,” said Mika Martumpal,
a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The trade
deficit will challenge our current-account balance, while our
capital account remains fragile as  Europe  continues to be a
concern.”  The rupiah fell 0.3 percent to 9,466 per dollar as of 3:36
p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. That was the biggest drop since July 12. Martumpal said he
revised his quarter-end forecast for the rupiah to 9,600 from
9,400 after the trade data. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was steady
at 7.5 percent.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due May 2022 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.72 percent, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. ING Financial
Markets predicts the yield will drop to 5 percent by year-end as
the central bank lowers borrowing costs. Inflation has averaged
4.2 percent this year, down from 5.4 percent in 2011, official
data show.  “Well-behaved inflation and weak global growth put a
policy interest-rate cut back on the table,”  Tim Condon , chief
Asia economist at ING in  Singapore , wrote in a report today. He
forecast  Bank Indonesia  will cut its  reference rate  by 25 basis
points to 5.5 percent before the end of September.  The central bank left its reference rate unchanged at a
record-low 5.75 percent for a fifth month in July, a decision
predicted by all 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
