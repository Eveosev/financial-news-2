Eloqua Inc. (ELOQ) , the maker of software
used by companies including American Express Co., rose as much
as 6.4 percent in its debut after raising $92 million in a U.S.
initial public offering, pricing the shares at the top of the
proposed range.  The stock advanced 3.5 percent to $11.90 after earlier
rising as high as $12.23. Vienna, Virginia-based Eloqua and
existing stockholders sold 8 million shares for $11.50 each, the
equivalent of a 25 percent stake. They earlier offered the
shares for $9.50 to $11.50.  Eloqua’s stock priced at about a 50 percent discount to
other publicly traded Web-based software developers as it sought
to enter a crowded field. Recent IPOs from  ExactTarget Inc. (ET) ,
 Bazaarvoice Inc. (BV)  and ServiceNow Inc. indicate investor demand
for the stocks, and Gartner Inc. predicts the business will
increase to $22.1 billion in 2015 from $12.3 billion last year.  The IPO price values Eloqua at about $368 million, or 4.4
times sales of $85 million in the 12 months through June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an
average of about 8.1 for a group of 14 other companies in the
software-as-a-service business.  Web-based software lets companies save money by using
programs via the cloud instead of storing them on their own
servers. Eloqua’s  products , which help companies tailor and
measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, range in price
from $2,000 a month for 4-10 users to $6,400 a month for 250
users.  Revenue at Eloqua jumped 40 percent last year to $71.3
million. In the second quarter of 2012, sales rose 39 percent to
$23.2 million from a year earlier. The company has more than
1,100 customers, including  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) , American Express
and Dell Inc.  Eloqua is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the
symbol ELOQ. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG led the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
