The  Archbishopric of Cyprus  increased
its stake in  Hellenic Bank pcl (HB) , the islandâ€™s third-largest bank,
to 16.4 percent from 13.7 percent, according to a  filing  sent to
the Cyprus bourse today.  The Orthodox Christian Church of Cyprus wants to invest
hundreds of millions of euros in the country, including its
banks, to sustain the economy and boost jobs, Archbishop Chrysostomos II said in April.  The church, the largest investor in Nicosia-based Hellenic
Bank, also has shares in  Bank of Cyprus PLC  and a minimal
holding in Cyprus Popular Bank pcl, Chrysostomos said at the
time. Other church institutions have a 7 percent stake in
Hellenic, according to a May 30 presentation by the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
