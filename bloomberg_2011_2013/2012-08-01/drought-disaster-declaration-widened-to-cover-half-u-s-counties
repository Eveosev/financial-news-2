The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
has  declared  more than half the counties in the country natural
disaster areas as drought sears millions of acres of pasture and
cropland.  The USDA today added 218 counties in 12 states throughout
the Midwest, Great Plains and South, bringing to almost 1,600 in
32 states the number eligible for government assistance for
losses caused mostly by drought. The government also expanded
the area of federally subsidized conservation land available for
emergency grazing to 3.8 million acres, and said crop-insurance
companies have agreed to a short grace period for farmer premium
payments.  “The assistance announced today will help U.S. livestock
producers dealing with climbing feed prices, critical shortages
of hay and deteriorating pasturelands,” Agriculture Secretary
Tom Vilsack said in a statement. “The Obama administration
intends to continue helping those who farm or ranch and live and
work in rural America through this period of hardship.”  USDA disaster declarations make farmers and ranchers
eligible for low-interest loans to help them weather the
drought, wildfires and other disasters. About 24 percent of the
nation’s corn crop was in good or excellent condition as of July
29, the worst assessment for this time of year since 1988,
according to the USDA.  Lower supplies are boosting costs for food companies from
 McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  to  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) 
and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  Food prices may rise as much as 4
percent next year, the USDA said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
