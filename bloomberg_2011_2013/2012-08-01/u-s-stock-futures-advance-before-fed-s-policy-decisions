U.S. stock-index futures advanced,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will rebound from two
days of declines, as investors awaited the outcome of the
 Federal Reserve ’s two-day policy meeting.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  rose 2.6 percent in  Germany .  Electronic
Arts Inc. (EA)  gained 1.9 percent after reporting a quarterly loss
that was smaller than estimated.  Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) 
fell 8.9 percent after second-quarter earnings missed
projections.  Futures on the  S&P 500  Index expiring in September climbed
0.3 percent to 1,378.1 at 7:38 a.m. in  New York . The  equity
benchmark  rallied 1.3 percent in July, its second successive
month of gains, as euro-area policy makers pledged to preserve
their common currency and speculation grew central banks will
take measures to boost growth. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures added 39 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,998 today.  Trading in  Europe  slowed before the Fed’s decision. The
number of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies was 35
percent lower than the 30-day average at this time of day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will probably forgo announcing
a third round of large-scale asset purchases today, and is more
likely to wait until September to unveil plans to buy $600
billion in housing and government debt, according to median
estimates of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Bernanke will leave the door open,” Larry Kantor, head
of research at  Barclays Capital , said on Bloomberg Television’s
City Central. “He doesn’t want to disappoint market
expectations too much but I don’t see the Fed making any move at
all this week.”  Stimulus Timing  Eighty-eight percent of economists say the  Federal Open
Market Committee  will refrain from starting new purchases.
Forty-eight percent say the FOMC will announce the buying at its
Sept. 12-13 meeting, according to the July 25-27 survey of 58
economists.  Investors should buy stocks before the Fed’s announcement,
if history is any guide, according to Bespoke Investment Group
LLC. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  has advanced on 20 out of the past 29 decision
days since the Fed pledged to keep  interest rates  near zero in
December 2008, a Bespoke study showed. Fed days accounted for
about 38 percent of the equity gauge’s gain during the period,
the data show.  A report at 10 a.m. in  Washington  may show the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s  factory index  rose to 50.2 last month
from 49.7 in June, according to the median estimate of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Fifty marks the dividing
line between expansion and contraction.  Job Report  Companies probably added 120,000 jobs in July, after hiring
176,000 in June, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before ADP Employer Services releases its
data today.  Dow Chemical, the biggest U.S. chemical company, rose 2.6
percent to $29.53 in German trading. A gauge of its European
peers climbed 0.8 percent. Dow shares have fallen for the past
four days in New York.  Electronic Arts gained 1.9 percent to $11.23 in German
trading. The second-largest U.S. video-game maker reported a
smaller quarterly loss than analysts expected and said it will
buy back as much as $500 million in stock.  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  may be active. The largest publicly traded
U.S. home and auto insurer posted second-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as costs tied to natural disasters
dropped.  Dreamworks tumbled 9 percent to $17.48 in Germany. The
independent film studio reported second-quarter results that
missed analysts’ estimates on lower-than-expected results
related to “Madagascar 3.”  Net income shrank 63 percent to $12.8 million, or 15 cents
a share. Analysts projected 25 cents, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
