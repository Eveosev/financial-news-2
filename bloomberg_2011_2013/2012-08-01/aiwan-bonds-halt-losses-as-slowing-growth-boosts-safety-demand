Taiwan ’s 10-year bonds rose the most
in more than two weeks on speculation slowing economic growth is
boosting demand for the relative safety of debt as global stocks
dropped.  Overseas funds sold $1.6 billion more Taiwanese equities
than they bought last month, taking net sales for the year to
$2.4 billion, according to exchange data. A government report
yesterday showed the economy contracted 0.16 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, following a 0.39 percent
expansion in the previous three months. Taiwan’s dollar climbed
before the  Federal Reserve  concludes a two-day meeting today.  “Some securities firms think it’s a good time to raise
their holdings of bonds,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “But you can see
yields aren’t dropping a lot as traders are concerned
quantitative easing by the Fed will induce rising consumer
prices in  Asia .”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.159 percent, the
biggest drop since July 13, according to Gretai Securities
Market.  Taiwan yesterday raised its inflation forecast for the year
to 1.9 percent from 1.84 percent and cut the export growth
estimate to 0.07 percent from 2.69 percent.  The  Taiwan dollar  climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.988 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.870 earlier, the strongest level in almost two weeks. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell three basis points to 3.63 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.389
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
