The U.S. men’s basketball team routed
Tunisia 110-63 to remain undefeated through two group games at
the London Olympics.  Kevin Love  and Carmelo Anthony led the U.S. with 16 points
each, while  Kevin Durant  contributed 13 points, 10 rebounds and
five assists as U.S. coach  Mike Krzyzewski  used every player on
the roster.  “My goal tonight was to try to get an equal number of
minutes for everybody in the game and try to get some different
combinations,” Krzyzewski told reporters after last night’s win
in London.  The Americans led 46-33 at halftime and outscored the
Tunisians, who are playing in the tournament for the first time,
64-30 during the second half.  Today in basketball, the U.S. women’s team takes on Turkey
in its second group-phase game. The Americans began their bid
for a fifth straight gold medal with a 90-38 rout of Angola.  The U.S. men, who have won 13 of the 16 Olympic tournaments
entered, beat France 98-71 in their first game.  Chris Paul  had a team-high seven assists against Tunisia,
while  Andre Iguodala  matched Durant with five.  The U.S. faces Nigeria, another Olympics newcomer,
tomorrow, before playing Lithuania Aug. 4 and Argentina, the
bronze medalist four years ago, in its final group-stage game
two days later.  Also yesterday in Group A, France defeated 2004 champion
Argentina 71-64, and Lithuania won 72-53 against Nigeria.  In Group B, Russia beat China 73-54, 2008 silver medalist
Spain defeated Australia 82-70, and Brazil overcame host Great
Britain 67-62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
