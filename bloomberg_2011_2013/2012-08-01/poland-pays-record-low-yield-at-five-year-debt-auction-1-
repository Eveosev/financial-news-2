Polish  yields  fell to a record at an
auction of five-year notes, spurring more borrowing than planned
and bringing the government closer to meeting all of this year’s
financing needs.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 4.41 billion zloty ($1.32
billion) of securities maturing in April 2017, compared with a
maximum target of 4 billion zloty, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. The notes were priced to yield 4.361 percent,
the lowest cost for the government to borrow for five years in
zloty, according to the ministry’s website that tracks auction
results since 1994.  Polish bonds have rallied this year as the country is
poised to expand at the fastest pace in the European Union while
pledging to cut the  budget deficit  below 3 percent of economic
output. The government has “in practice” secured 90 percent of
this year’s borrowing needs after the sale,  Piotr Marczak , the
head of Finance Ministry’s public debt department, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “We see that the positive trend in debt markets
continues,” Bartlomiej Wit, chief fixed-income trader at ING
Bank Slaski SA, said by phone from Warsaw. The auction shows
there is “strong interest from buyers,” he said.  Poland will meet all of this year’s borrowing needs by the
end of September, Deputy Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said
on TVN CNBC yesterday. The government plans to start raising
funds for 2013 budget in the fourth quarter, he told the
broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
