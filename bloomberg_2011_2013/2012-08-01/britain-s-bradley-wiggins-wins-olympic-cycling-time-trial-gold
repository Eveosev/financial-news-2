Bradley Wiggins, the first Briton to
win the Tour de  France , won the gold medal for the cycling time
trial at the London Olympics today.  It’s the fourth Olympic gold medal for the 32-year-old, and
his seventh in all. World champion Tony Martin of  Germany  was
second and Chris Froome of Britain came third.  Wiggins completed the 27.3-mile course near Hampton Court,
south of London, in 50 minutes, 39.54 seconds, 42 seconds ahead
of Martin.  His total Olympic record haul is a British best, surpassing
rower Steve Redgrave. Froome, Wiggins’s Team Sky teammate,
finished second in the Tour de France 10 days ago.  It’s the second gold medal for Britain today after Helen
Glover and Heather Stanning won the women’s pairs rowing event.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
