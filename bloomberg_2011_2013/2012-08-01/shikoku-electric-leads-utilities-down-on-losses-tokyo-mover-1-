Shikoku Electric Power Co. (9507)  fell as
much as 17 percent, the sharpest drop since at least 1974,
leading Japanese utilities lower in Tokyo after power companies
reported first-quarter losses.  Shikoku Electric declined as much as 210 yen, heading for
its lowest close since 1983. Kansai Electric Power Co. slipped
as much as 6.5 percent to 550 yen, while Chugoku Electric Power
Co. plunged up to 10.9 percent. The 17 member  TOPIX Electric
Power & Gas Index (TP17ELEC)  declined as much as 3.5 percent.  Shikoku and six other nuclear utilities in Japan this week
reported a combined quarterly loss of 268 billion yen ($3.4
billion) as the shutdown of atomic stations drove up fuel costs
to run oil- and gas-fired plants. All but two of  Japan ’s 50
reactors are idled for safety checks after the Fukushima nuclear
disaster caused by the quake and tsunami in March 2011.  Shikoku Electric was relatively overvalued, said Reiji
Ogino, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. who rated the company underperform on June 8.  “Today’s decline in Shikoku’s stock price could be
considered a correction,” Ogino said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. “Shikoku’s price-to-book ratio is 0.7,
the highest of any power company.”  Shikoku Electric posted a loss of 15 billion yen in the
three months ended June 30, the company said yesterday.  Kansai
Electric (9503) , the most dependent on nuclear among the country’s
power utilities, had a loss of 99.5 billion yen for the quarter,
compared with a 34.5 billion yen profit a year earlier. Chubu
Electric reported a quarterly loss of 12.5 billion yen on July
30.  With the exception of  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., none of
Japan’s nuclear plant operators provided a profit or loss
forecast for this fiscal year, citing uncertainty about nuclear
plant restarts and power saving effects on electricity demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
