The global sugar surplus for the
2012-13 will be 27 percent smaller than previously estimated as
rains delayed the crop in Brazil and dry weather threatens to
cut output in  India , according to ED&F Man Sugar Ltd.  Sugar supplies will be 4.5 million metric tons bigger than
demand, down from a previous forecast of 6.2 million tons, the
London-based trader estimates. That follows a surplus of 9.6
million tons in 2011-12. The estimates are on the basis of
national crop years, which begin when the harvests in each of
the producing countries starts being collected, said Jack
Hannon, a commodities research associate at the company.  “The crop in center south Brazil hasn’t progressed as
quickly as people were hoping,” he said by phone today. “The
scanty rains in India look like they will partially impact
production for next year, but it’s not a disaster there yet.”  The sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s center south, the main
growing region of the world’s biggest producer, reached 170.6
million tons from the start of the 2012-13 season through July
15, according to industry group Unica. That’s down 22 percent
compared with the same period last year. Growing regions got 200
millimeters to 300 millimeters of rain in May and June, beating
the 30-year average of 100 millimeters, according to Sao Paulo-
based forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  In India, the world’s second-biggest consumer and largest
producer, the crop is being threatened by a lack of rainfall.
The monsoon, which brings more than 70 percent of the country’s
annual rain, has been 19 percent below normal since June 1,
according to the  India Meteorological Department .  Sugar output in India may be 24 million tons in the 2012-13
season that starts there in October, as dry weather may result
in 2.5 million to 3 million tons less in the Maharashtra and
Karnataka states, Paul Bannister, head of sugar brokerage at
Marex Spectron Group in  London , said in a report on July 30.  Sugar climbed 8.2 percent in June and 7.8 percent in July
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  on speculation unfavorable
weather in producing regions would reduce supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
