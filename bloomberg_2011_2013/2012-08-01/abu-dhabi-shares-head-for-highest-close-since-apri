Abu Dhabi shares advanced to the
highest since April as companies in the United Arab Emirates
capital posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and
before  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT)  pays a dividend.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , the lender controlled by Abu Dhabi’s
ruling family that posted a 14 percent increase in quarterly
profit, gained 0.7 percent. Etisalat, as the phone company is
known, advanced for a fifth day. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained
0.4 percent to 2,516.60 at the close in the emirate, the highest
since April 12. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of stocks in the
region gained 0.2 percent.  “Investors are anticipating the Etisalat dividend, and
earnings have generally been strong for the second quarter,”
said Waleed Al Khateeb, the senior finance manager at Daman
Securities LLC in Dubai. “Volumes remain low as it’s the
Ramadan season.”  About 44  million shares  traded in  Abu Dhabi  today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of about 59 million. The Islamic
holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset
and business activity slows, is under way.  Etisalat, the company with the  heaviest weighting  on Abu
Dhabi’s index, reported a 17 percent increase in second-quarter
profit on higher revenue from foreign operations, beating
estimates. The company plans to distribute a  25 percent cash
dividend  for the first half, payable on Aug. 15. The shares
increased 0.5 percent to 9.44 dirhams, the highest since June
27, bringing a gain in the past five days to 3.1 percent.  First Gulf, whose quarterly results beat estimates, rose to
8.92 dirhams, the highest since May 7.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  advanced 0.3 percent, Qatar’s  QE
Index (DSM)  and  Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.2
percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose 1.3 percent, snapping a nine-
day retreat. Kuwait’s  gauge  was little changed and Bahrain’s
 measure  advanced 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
