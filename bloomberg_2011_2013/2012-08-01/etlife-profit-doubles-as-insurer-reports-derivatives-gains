MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said second-quarter profit more than doubled on
derivatives gains and growth in its international businesses
including  Japan .  Net income  available to common shareholders increased to
$2.26 billion, or $2.12 a share, from $1.07 billion, or $1,  a
year earlier , the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Profit excluding some investing results was $1.33 a
share, 9 cents more than the  average estimate  of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  is counting on
global expansion as he looks to cut costs and limit sales of
capital-intensive products in the U.S. Operating profit climbed
in the firm’s three  geographic regions , led by a 61 percent jump
in  Asia  as Japan life-insurance sales rose, the company said.  “Our underwriting discipline is paying off,” Kandarian,
60, said in the statement. “We’re successfully managing through
the low-interest-rate environment.”  Operating earnings from Asia were $275 million as premiums,
fees and other revenue in the region climbed 6 percent from a
year earlier, when results were hurt by the March 2011 tsunami
and earthquake in Japan, the insurer said.  MetLife bought American Life Insurance Co., with about
12,500 employees and operations in 50 countries, from bailed-out
insurer  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  in 2010 to expand
beyond the U.S.  Currency Fluctuations  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the second-biggest U.S. life
insurer, also benefited in the second quarter from growth in
Asia. Profit more than doubled to $2.2 billion as international
business improved and the  Newark , New Jersey-based company
recorded gains on derivatives that protect it against currency
fluctuations.  Prudential has been combining its Japan operation with two
life insurers it bought from New York-based AIG in February 2011
for more than $4 billion. Prudential’s international insurance
business posted $681 million in adjusted operating income,
compared with $500 million a year earlier.  The Japanese yen strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  in
the quarter, contributing to a $2.03 billion pretax net realized
investment gain, Prudential said yesterday in a statement.  MetLife’s  book value  rose to $56.83 a share from $53.37 as
of March 31, according to its statement. Net investment income
climbed to $5.2 billion from $5.1 billion a year earlier.  Derivatives Gains  MetLife reported $1.4 billion of net derivatives gains as
 interest rates  fell and the company’s credit spreads widened,
compared with a gain of $189 million in the second quarter of
2011. The insurer uses derivatives to guard against interest-
rate declines and currency fluctuations. The contracts can
produce gains when rates fall.  Operating earnings in the Americas were $1.13 billion,
compared with $1.02 billion a year earlier, as severe-weather
losses fell.  Second-quarter U.S.  annuity  sales were $4.84 billion, a 33
percent drop from a year earlier. MetLife is scaling back sales
of the equity-linked retirement products to limit risk tied to
stock market declines.  Kandarian is working to complete a sale of MetLife Bank
assets to General Electric Co. to limit U.S. oversight after the
 Federal Reserve  rejected his plan to raise the  dividend  and
repurchase shares.  The insurer hasn’t boosted the payout to shareholders since
2007, while Prudential increased its dividend in 2009, 2010 and
2011 and announced stock buybacks. Prudential isn’t subject to
the same Fed oversight  MetLife fell 1.1 percent to close at $30.43 yesterday and
was little changed at 6:40 p.m. in  New York  in extended trading
after results were announced. The shares have dropped 2.4
percent this year, compared with a gain of 6.7 percent for the
22-company  Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. (S5INSU)   To contact the reporters on this story:
