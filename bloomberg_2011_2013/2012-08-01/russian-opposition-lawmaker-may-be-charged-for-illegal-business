Russia’s Investigative Committee said
it has evidence of “illegal business activity” by Gennady
Gudkov, a lawmaker in the opposition  Just Russia  party.  The authorities may open a criminal case against Gudkov on
charges that carry a maximum penalty of two years based on the
results of its probe, it  said  on its website today.  President  Vladimir Putin , 59, who won another six years in
the Kremlin in March, has responded to the largest
demonstrations since he came to power in 2000 by tightening
controls over the Internet and non-governmental organizations
and prosecuting opposition activists and leaders.  Gudkov , a reserve colonel at the Federal Security Service,
or FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, in June
announced he was selling his private security business after it
came under pressure from the authorities. He didn’t answer calls
to his work or mobile phones from Bloomberg seeking comment.  When the first accusations were made by the Investigative
Committee in June, Gudkov  said  on his blog that they amounted to
a “new provocation taken against me as an active member of the
protest movement.”  Investigators established that Gudkov, who is also a deputy
head of the lower house of parliament’s  security committee ,
illegally engaged in business in  Russia  and was linked to
companies registered in Bulgaria and Gibraltar, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
