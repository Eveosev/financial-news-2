TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012)  increased
the capacity of a residue-cracking unit, known as H-Oil, at its
Kawasaki refinery by almost 11 percent to 31,000 barrels a day.  The expansions will diversify TonenGeneralâ€™s ability to
process various grades of crude, Kosuke Kai, a Tokyo-based
company spokesman, said today by phone.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry received
notification of the capacity change on July 25, according to a
government official, who asked not to be identified because of
internal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
