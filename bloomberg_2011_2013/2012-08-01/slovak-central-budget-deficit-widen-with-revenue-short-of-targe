Slovakia’s seven-month central-
budget  deficit  widened to 2.24 billion euros ($2.76 billion)
from 1.68 billion euros in the same period last year as revenues
fell short of target, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The east euro-region member collected 6.29 billion euros in
revenue by July, or 46 percent of full-year target, the ministry
said. Expenditures amounted to 8.53 billion euros, or 49 percent
of the 2012 projection.  The deficit represents 61 percent of the full-year target
for a 3.68 billion-euro shortfall, underscoring the need for
additional measures to meet fiscal goals. The government needs
to find 500 million euros in spending cuts and revenue increases
to ensure the 2012 budget gap won’t exceed the goal of 4.6
percent of economic output, Premier  Robert Fico  said July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
