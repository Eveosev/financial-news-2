Manufacturing in the Netherlands
remained below the 50 mark for a fifth consecutive month in
July, indicating a contraction, according to the Dutch institute
for purchasing and supply management, NEVI.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region remained stable at 48.9, unchanged from June,
Zoetermeer-based NEVI said on its website today.  The institute cited a drop in domestic orders and a slight
increase in unemployment while the volume of exports rose for
the first time in three months.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
