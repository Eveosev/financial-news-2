Allergan Inc. (AGN)  climbed the most in
almost a year after second-quarter earnings beat analyst
estimates and the company raised the lower end of its full-year
forecast.  Allergan rose 4.3 percent to close at $85.62 in New York,
the biggest increase since Aug. 23, 2011. Earnings excluding
some items of $1.07 a share beat by 1 cent the average of 22
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings for 2012 will be $4.15 to $4.19 a share, the
company said, increasing the lower end of the  outlook  by 2
cents. Botox sales increased 10 percent to $461.2 million in the
second quarter, while revenue from southern Europe wasn’t hurt
by the debt crisis, the company said.  “We have just some fabulous growth rates, even in the so-
called old  Europe ,” David Pyott, Allergan’s CEO, said on a
conference call with analysts.  Allergan has more than half the European breast implant
market share, which is split among 11 companies, Pyott said in a
telephone interview. Worldwide sales growth for Allergan’s
implants has been 14 percent in this year, he said.  The company’s sales benefited after French and German
officials in December recommended that women have surgery to
remove faulty implants made by Poly Implant Prothese SA of
 France . Women sought Allergan’s products as replacements, Pyott
said.  “The market doesn’t seem to have taken a hit, despite what
one would think would be negative perceptions,” Pyott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
