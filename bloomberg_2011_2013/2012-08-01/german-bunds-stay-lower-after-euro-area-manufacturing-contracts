German government bonds stayed lower
after a report showed euro-area manufacturing contracted for a
12th month in July.  The 10-year bund yield advanced four basis points to 1.33
percent at 9:05 a.m. London time. The German two-year note yield
rose two basis points to minus 0.08 percent.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area fell to
44 from 45.1 in June, London-based Markit Economics said today.
It had previously reported a reading of 44.1, with a level below
50 indicating a contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
