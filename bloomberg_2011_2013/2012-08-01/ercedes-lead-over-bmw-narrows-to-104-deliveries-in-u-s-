Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
namesake BMW brand, posting its first year-over-year sales
decline in more than two years, managed to outsell  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz in the U.S. last month, narrowing the distance
between the two competitors to 104 deliveries for the year.  BMW’s U.S. sales fell 0.5 percent last month from a year
earlier to 21,297, the Munich-based automaker said yesterday in
a statement. Mercedes sold 19,311 cars and SUVs last month, a
1.6 percent gain, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus sales rose 25
percent to 18,235.  “High summer is typically a time for vacations rather than
car buying which makes the July result satisfying, especially
with the unsteady economy and the very short supply of new
models in our dealerships,” Ludwig Willisch, head of BMW’s U.S.
unit, said in the statement.  Mercedes U.S. sales through the first seven months of the
year rose 14 percent to 147,905, according to the Stuttgart,
Germany-based automaker. BMW, which overtook Lexus last year to
become the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S., sold 147,801
through July, a 9.4 percent gain. BMW beat Mercedes last year by
2,715 deliveries.  Prior to July, Mercedes led BMW by more than 2,000 U.S.
deliveries for the year.  The sales results don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and
Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Targeting Repeat  Willisch has predicted that the brand will again finish No.
1 following the introduction of the redesigned 3 Series sedan.
Sales of the compact car line fell 11 percent in July to 7,653.
The automaker may see a sales boost later this year when it
introduces the all-wheel-drive version.  The “change to model year 2013 happened this summer and
the German factories had both the changeover and summer
shutdowns to deal with, so supply is really tight right now,”
Kenn Sparks, a BMW spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail.  All-wheel-drive  3 Series cars are being made for sale
starting in September, he said.  Willisch said that August will be “the tightest month as
we complete the model year transition.”  The last time BMW had a year-over-year sales decline in the
U.S. was in May 2010 when the company had limited availability
of the 5 Series and X3 sport-utility vehicle before redesigned
versions arrived at dealerships.  Incentives Reduced  BMW pulled back in incentive spending during July,
according to estimates by TrueCar.com, a website that tracks
auto sales. BMW’s average incentive spending fell 18 percent
last month from a year earlier to $3,248 per vehicle while
Mercedes spending rose 29 percent to $4,096.  BMW and Mercedes are both facing better challenges from
rivals in the luxury segment since vaulting into the No. 1 and
No. 2 positions last year after Toyota struggled with production
issues following natural disasters in  Asia .  “Competition is a big part of it even though people don’t
necessarily directly cross-shop Cadillac to BMW,” said  Jesse Toprak , an industry analyst with TrueCar.com, referring to
 General Motors Co. (GM) ’s luxury brand.  Cadillac sales rose 21 percent to 13,417 vehicles in July,
the Detroit-based automaker said in a statement.  Through seven months, Lexus sales gained 23 percent to
126,367. Toyota has targeted a 25 percent increase to 250,000
vehicles this year. The brand may gain sales from the new ES
sedan and RX crossover.  Audi, Acura  U.S. sales of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 28 percent
last month to 11,707, the company said in a statement.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part
of VW, sold 2,803 vehicles in the U.S. last month, a 1.3 percent
increase, the company said in a statement.  Sales of the Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand rose
36 percent to 12,825 last month, the company said in a
statement.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 6,975 Lincolns in July, an 11 percent
decline from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Jaguar Land Rover deliveries rose 14 percent to 4,331, the
U.K. brands, owned by Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , said in an
e-mailed statement.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 11,619 vehicles last
month, a 57 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama,
Japan-based company said in a statement. Pent-up demand is
boosting sales growth, Ben Poore, head of U.S. Infinti brand
sales, said in a phone interview yesterday.  “There’s no fear, at this point, in luxury,” Poore said.
“People are changing cars. We’re seeing that as a very positive
sign.”  Infiniti sales jumped 21 percent for the first seven
months, aided by demand for the new JX crossover and G cars.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty, but that is the new norm,”
Poore said. “That is the new norm for the last 24 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
