Suntory Beverage & Food  Asia , a unit
of Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd., offered to delist  Cerebos
Pacific Ltd. (CER)  in a transaction worth S$364.8 million ($293
million), it said in a statement today.  Suntory, which has about 82.6 percent of Cerebos, offered
S$6.60 a share in cash for the remaining 55.3 million shares it
doesn’t own in the Singapore maker of food products and health
supplements. The price represents a 23 percent premium to the
last traded price of S$5.38 on July 30.  Cerebos has a total of 317.3 million shares and additional
2.5 million options granted to employees, according to the
statement to the Singapore exchange today.  “The delisting and exit offer will allow the company to
realize cost savings by eliminating listing, compliance and
other related costs,” according to the statement. As a non-
listed company, “Cerebos will enjoy greater operational
flexibility and efficiency in implementing its strategic
initiatives.”  Cerebos has climbed 8.5 percent this year, compared with
the 15 percent advance in the Singapore benchmark  Straits Times
Index. (FSSTI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
