Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) ,  Europe â€™s third-
largest aluminum maker, is cutting capacity at plants where it
uses third-party metal to make orders for the auto and building
industries after suffering losses.  The company will shut 35,000 metric tons of remelting
capacity at its Sunndal plant in  Norway  and is considering plans
to curtail about 120,000 tons of capacity at its Aardal plant,
company spokesman Halvor Molland said by phone today. It will
increase primary aluminum production at Sunndal.  Hydro, which is seeking to reduce the cost of aluminum
production by $300 a ton, has been cutting production at non-
profitable plants this year. In July, the company said it would
close its 180,000 ton-capacity Kurri Kurri smelter in  Australia .  Hydro began talks with unions and management at Aardal
about cutting remelting output at the end of June, according to
Molland. No decision has yet been reached about the timing.  Hydro, which last year restarted 15,000 tons of the 100,000
ton-primary aluminum output curtailed at Sunndal in 2009, will
add 35,000 tons of production capacity at the plant from the end
of August through to the end of October, Molland said. The cut
in the remelting operations is planned to take place in the same
period, he said. Hydro plans to start the remaining 50,000 tons
at some point, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
