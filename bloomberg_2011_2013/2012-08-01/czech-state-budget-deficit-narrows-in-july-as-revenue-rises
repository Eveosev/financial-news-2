The Czech central state budget
deficit narrowed in the first seven months from a year earlier
as government revenue rose.  The shortfall totaled 51.7 billion koruna ($2.5 billion),
compared with 61.1 billion koruna in the same period of 2011,
the Prague-based  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The deficit represented 49 percent of the ceiling of
105.3 billion koruna set for this year.  Budget revenue increased 1.1 percent from a year earlier to
597.4 billion koruna, the ministry said.  Government spending 
dropped to 649.1 billion koruna, 0.5 percent lower from the
first seven months of 2011.  -- Editor: Alan Crosby  To contact the reporter on this story:
