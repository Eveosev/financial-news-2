Repsol SA (REP) , fighting to keep its
investment-grade rating, received government approval to sell a
business in Ecuador to  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  as part
of a 4.5 billion-euro ($5.5 billion) divestment program.  Repsol plans to dispose of Amodaimi Oil Co., a wholly-owned
subsidiary, to the Chinese company known as Sinopec, it said in
a statement in Madrid today. Amodaimi holds a 20 percent share
of block 16 and Tivacuno service contracts. Repsol will still
remain operator of the blocks with a 35 percent stake if the
deal goes through.  Repsol is trying to recover from the Argentine government
seizing its YPF business in April, which prompted  ratings
agencies  to cut the company to one level above junk. Repsol sold
a Chilean unit last week for about $540 million to reduce the
company’s debt.  The 1.85 billion euros of assets sold so far “aim to
improve the financial structure of the group,” Repsol said in
the statement.  Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, said receiving
government approval is the first step for the sale of the
business in Ecuador. The company declined to give a price for
the asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
