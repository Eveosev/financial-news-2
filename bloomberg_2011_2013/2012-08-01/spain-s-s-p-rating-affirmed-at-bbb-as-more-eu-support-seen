Spain ’s BBB+ credit rating, three
steps from junk, was affirmed at  Standard & Poor’s , which said
it expects the nation to continue receiving support from
European peers and the  European Central Bank .  The outlook is negative and the nation may miss its budget-
 deficit  target of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product this
year as the recession undermines tax collection, the company
said in a statement today. Debt will remain below 80 percent of
GDP beyond 2015 as loans to struggling banks will be
“mutualized” among euro-area governments, it said.  S&P said its “baseline scenario” is that Spain “will
continue to receive support, including financial, from its
European partners and the ECB.” Spain is “vulnerable to delays
or setbacks in the euro zone’s plans to pool sufficient common
resources,” it said.  Spain sought a European bailout for its banks in June of as
much as 100 billion euros ($123 billion) as the government
lacked the financing to shore up its lenders. Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  is fighting to keep enough access to markets to
fund the deficit, and has called for the ECB to buy Spanish
bonds and for EU nations to take steps to bring down borrowing
costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
