Slovenia started looking for buyers
of a majority stake in Adria Airways d.d., its sole carrier, as
the Balkan country seeks to reduce state aid to companies and
lower public debt.  Preliminary bids for as much as 75 percent of the Brnik-
based company are to be submitted by Sept. 10, a government
agency overseeing state assets said on its website today. The
government owns 70 percent of the carrier and the remaining
stake belongs to banks including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and
Abanka Vipa d.d.  Airlines in the Balkans, including  Croatia Airlines (CRALRA)  and Jat
Airways of Serbia, are seeking partners as economies in the
region falter and consumers cut back on travel while foreign
competitors including Irelandâ€™s  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and
Budapest-based Wizz Air Ltd. step up expansion.  Adria, a member of the  Star Alliance , received 49 million
euros ($60 million) from the Slovenian government last year to
continue operations. The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa 
has pledged to cut state aid to companies as the euro-region
nation seeks to lower its debt, which more than doubled since
the 2007 adoption of the euro.  Barons Financial Services SA, based in Geneva, will advise
on the airline sale, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
