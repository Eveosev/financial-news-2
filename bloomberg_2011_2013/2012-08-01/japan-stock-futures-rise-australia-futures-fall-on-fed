Japanese  stock   futures  rose after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will pump fresh stimulus if necessary
into the world’s biggest economy. Australian futures fell as the
central bank’s pledge disappointed some investors anticipating a
more definitive sign of further easing.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 1.2 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo after the yen retreated from a two-
month high against the dollar. Those of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, added 0.5
percent. ADRs of  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No. 2 lender
by market value, fell 0.3 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,670 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,630 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,660 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index slid 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington. Taiwan’s financial markets will be
closed today due to a typhoon.  “People would like the Fed to do more because I think it
would improve the market sentiment a little bit,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in Sydney
who manages more than $350 million. “But I think the fact that
the Fed is not doing anything and still saying they remain
prepared to, it’s not a huge negative. I think it’s neutral.”  Fed’s Inaction  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index dropped 0.3 percent in New York yesterday, when
the Fed refrained from adding to record stimulus even as
economic growth slowed.  The Fed’s inaction pushed up the dollar against the yen as
traders pared bets on further monetary policy easing. The yen
fell 0.4 percent to 78.44 per dollar yesterday after touching
77.91, the strongest since June 1. A weaker yen enhances the
value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters when
repatriated.  A report showed yesterday manufacturing in the U.S.
unexpectedly contracted for a second month in July, indicating a
mainstay of the economy was struggling to improve.  U.S. payrolls may have increased by 100,000 workers in
July, following an 80,000 gain in June, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of Labor
Department figures Aug. 3. The  unemployment rate  is projected to
hold at 8.2 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 8.3 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen as the U.S. and Chinese
economies slow. The regional benchmark index traded at 12 times
 estimated earnings , compared with 13.4 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 11.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The European Central Bank meets today, with President
 Mario Draghi  pledging policy makers will do whatever is needed
to preserve the euro.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. dropped 0.5 percent to 86.36
yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
