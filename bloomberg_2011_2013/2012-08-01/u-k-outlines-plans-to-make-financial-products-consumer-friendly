The U.K. government outlined plans to
make financial products more consumer friendly as it seeks to
restore public confidence in the industry after a series of mis-
selling scandals.  A government-appointed panel including former  Bank of
England  official Carol Sergeant;  Angela Knight , the outgoing
chief executive officer of the British Bankers’ Association; and
Otto Thoresen, chief executive of the Association of British
Insurers recommended banks create easy-access  savings accounts 
and standard 30-day notice periods to close accounts. It also
called for simpler  life insurance .  “The government is committed to putting the consumer back
at the heart of the financial system,” Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban  said in an e-mailed statement released by his office in
London. “Simple financial products offer a unique opportunity
to demonstrate that products can both be easy to understand and
meet customers’ most important financial needs.”  Public trust in the financial-services industry was damaged
by the 2008 credit crisis and a wave of scandals including the
mis-selling of consumer-credit insurance and the rigging of the
Libor market. The panel’s final recommendations will be
published in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
