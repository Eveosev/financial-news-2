Michael Foley joined the Western
Force Super Rugby team as head coach on a three-year contract a
day after quitting the  New South Wales Waratahs .  Foley, 45, succeeds Richard Graham, who stood down from the
Perth-based franchise in April. Foley resigned as Waratahs coach
yesterday after the team ended the season with a team-record
eight straight losses to finish 11th in the standings.  The Force finished second-to-last with a 3-13 record and
lost captain  David Pocock ,  Australia ’s national team skipper,
three days ago when he agreed to join the ACT Brumbies on a
three-year contract.  “This is an important period for the club and, while we’re
not looking to start from scratch, we’re looking to relaunch the
team,” Foley said in a statement. “While my expectations are
realistic, I’m very excited about this challenge.”  Foley played 50 Tests for the Wallabies and spent three
years as an assistant coach at the Sydney-based Waratahs before
taking on the top job for this season, where he guided the team
to four wins from 16 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
