Following are comments on new U.S.
sanctions against Iran from the Standard Club, a provider of
marine insurance for risks such as spills and collisions.  President  Barack Obama  announced an executive order on July
31 extending sanctions to buying Iranian petrochemical products,
providing material support to the National Iranian Oil Co. or
Naftiran Intertrade Co., and acquisition of U.S. banknotes or
precious metals by Iran’s government. The Standard Club
commented in a statement on its website.  “The U.S. wants to further isolate NIOC and NICO, which
are already sanctioned under U.S. law; these sanctions aim to
deter foreign financial institutions from continuing to deal
with them. Additional aims of the sanctions are to deter efforts
to circumvent existing U.S. sanctions and to further isolate
Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical industries. There are limited
exemptions for Iran’s trade partners who have significantly
reduced their purchase of Iranian crude oil.  “These sanctions are silent as to whether they apply to
shipowners carrying petroleum, petroleum products or
petrochemical products from  Iran . Equally it is not entirely
clear whether the sanctions apply to the provision of insurance
for ships carrying the relevant cargoes. The managers are
seeking further information in relation to the scope and
application of these sanctions and will keep members advised.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
