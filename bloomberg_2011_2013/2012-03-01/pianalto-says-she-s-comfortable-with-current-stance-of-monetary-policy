President  Sandra Pianalto  said she is “comfortable with the
current stance of monetary policy” and expects the economy will
expand at a 2.5 percent rate this year and 3 percent next year.  Inflation will probably be about 2 percent for “the next
few years,” Pianalto said today in a speech in Cleveland,
according to prepared remarks. Achieving maximum employment may
take four to five years “if the economy grows at the moderate
pace that I am anticipating,” Pianalto said.  Pianalto, who is a voting member of the policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said changes to the
economic outlook may prompt an increase in the benchmark
 interest rate  “sooner or later than late 2014.” Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers yesterday that interest rates
will probably stay low at least through late 2014.  “I would prefer nothing more than to support an increase
in interest rates before late 2014 on the basis of a brighter
outlook for economic growth,” Pianalto said in a speech to the
City Club of Cleveland. “But I’m not there yet.”  The current policy is “already quite accommodative” both
in terms of interest rates and the size of the central bank’s
 balance sheet , she said. Additional monetary stimulus could spur
inflation, while less action by policy makers “could risk
weakening an already slow expansion” and cause disinflation,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
