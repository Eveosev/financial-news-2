New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, rose for a second day after the
 Daily Telegraph  reported late on Feb. 28 that Polish rival
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA held talks to merge with NWR.  The stock rose 1.4 percent to 160.7 koruna by 11:08 a.m. in
Prague, adding to a 1.3 percent advance yesterday.  JSW hired Credit Suisse Group AG for initial merger talks
with BXR Group Ltd., a 64 percent owner of NWR, the U.K.
newspaper said. BXR may not accept a cash valuation of less than
800 pence a share, compared with 547 pence at  yesterday’s close
in London , according to the newspaper. JSW yesterday denied the
report.  “A takeover of NWR by the Polish company is very
unlikely,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in
Prague, wrote in a report to clients today. “We therefore
believe that the news is neutral for NWR shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
