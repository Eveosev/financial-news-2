OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, said fourth-quarter profit fell 39 percent after
recording a charge related to lower-than-expected reserves.  Net income of $1.35 billion compared with profit of $2.19
billion in the same period a year earlier, the Moscow-based
company said in a filing today. That missed the average estimate
of $2.69 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Lukoil recorded an impairment charge of $955 million in the
fourth quarter at its OOO Narianmarneftegaz venture with
 ConocoPhillips. (COP)  Lower production at the northern Yuzhnoye
Khylchuyu deposit due to “unanticipated geological reasons”
resulted in estimated field reserves falling to 142 million
barrels at the end of 2011 from 505 million barrels in 2008.  “It’s a paper loss reflecting the problems with the asset
which were already in the market,” Artem Konchin, an oil and
gas analyst at UniCredit SpA, said by phone from Moscow.  Full-year net income at Lukoil reached a record $10.4
billion. Russian oil producers have posted record earnings for
2011 after unrest in the  Middle East  pushed average prices for
the country’s Urals export blend to more than $100 a barrel.
TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest crude producer, announced record
profits yesterday.  Revenue rose to $133.7 billion in 2011 from $105 billion in
2010, Lukoil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
