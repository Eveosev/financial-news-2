Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  doesnâ€™t plan to shuffle his Cabinet, his spokesman  Peter Szijjarto  said, according to Nepszabadsag.  Szijjarto rejected a report in the Budapest-based daily
today which said that Orban is contemplating a government shake-
up by early May, once an agreement on financial aid is reached
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, the
newspaper said on its  website  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
