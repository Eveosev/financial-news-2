Germany ’s VCI chemical association,
which represents companies including  BASF SE (BAS)  and Evonik
Industries AG, cut its full-year forecast for sales and
production on lower expectations for economic growth.  Production will probably stagnate this year, while sales
will gain 1 percent on higher selling prices, the Frankfurt-
based association said in a statement today. That compares to a
December forecast for production to grow 1 percent and sales to
increase 2 percent.  “The economic fog is still relatively thick,” said Utz Tillmann, president of the VCI. “Uncertainties tied to the
sovereign debt crisis in  Europe  and the U.S. as well as repeated
retraction of growth forecasts by the research institutions is
putting pressure on sentiment in the  chemical industry .”  BASF, the world’s biggest chemical maker, surprised
analysts including Oliver Schwarz of M.M. Warburg and Peter Spengler of  DZ Bank  by predicting last week that earnings and
sales will rise again this year. Economic growth in emerging
economies such as  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and  China  will drive
revenue in the industry, VCI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
