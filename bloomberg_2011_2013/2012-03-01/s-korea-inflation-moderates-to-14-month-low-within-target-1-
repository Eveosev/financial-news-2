South Korea ’s  inflation  moderated to
a 14-month low in February and within the central bank’s target
range, bolstering the case for the central bank to keep
borrowing costs unchanged next week.  Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier,
matching the median estimate of 16 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey and following a 3.4 percent gain in January,
Statistics Korea said today in Gwacheon, south of Seoul. Prices
rose 0.4 percent from January.  South Korean inflation may accelerate above the
government’s forecast of 3.2 percent this year on higher  oil
prices  just as the nation’s economic growth is about to improve,
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week. The Bank of Korea
will hold interest rates next week for a ninth month, all six
economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  “The BOK remains concerned about  core inflation  and
inflation expectations, taking little comfort in the roll-down
of headline inflation given the favorable base,” Wai Ho Leong,
a senior regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore,
said before the release.  Leong said he felt more comfortable with his forecast of no
policy rate change this year as U.S. housing and labor market
indicators have been surprising to the upside, which will pass
through into activity from February onwards in Asia.  The benchmark Kospi stock index gained 1.3 percent on Feb.
29. Domestic financial markets were closed for a holiday
yesterday.  Core prices, which exclude energy and food costs, advanced
2.5 percent in February from a year earlier, today’s report
showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
