Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
 Europe  are poised to fall to a seven-week low as the number of
available tankers rises, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders and oil companies booked 11 ships for the two weeks
to March 15 and nine more are likely to be hired, according to
the median estimate in a survey yesterday of nine shipbrokers,
traders and owners who specialize in shipping the auto fuel.
That’s the fewest since the two weeks from Jan. 12.  Tankers carrying gasoline on the Rotterdam-to-New York
trade route are  earning  $15,594 a day, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange . Returns declined for a fourth day
yesterday and are down 25 percent since the start of the year.
The supply of tankers available to carry trans-Atlantic gasoline
cargoes increased by one to 29 vessels, the biggest tally for
the voyage in two weeks, according to the survey.  The ships, known as medium-range tankers, would be able to
haul about 6.3 million barrels of the fuel, or 449,000 barrels a
day, over the next two weeks. That’s 58 percent of the 780,000
barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the past year, according to
the  Department of Energy .  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each  tanker  would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons
of gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  Following is a table of ships chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                             March 1    Feb. 23     Change
