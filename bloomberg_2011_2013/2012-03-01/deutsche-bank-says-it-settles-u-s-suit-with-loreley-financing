Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, settled a lawsuit filed by Loreley Financing over
$440 million of collateralized-debt obligations purchased from
2005 to 2007.  Loreley Financing sued  Deutsche Bank (DBK)  in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan in October, accusing the bank of
defrauding it into buying CDOs that were “designed to fail.”
The litigation was discontinued with prejudice, meaning it can’t
be renewed, according to court documents filed yesterday that
didn’t disclose terms of the settlement.  Loreley Financing is a group of special-purpose entities
based in Jersey, the largest of the  Channel Islands , a U.K.
dependency known as a tax haven. The entities were formed for
long-term investing in CDOs, pools of assets such as mortgage
bonds packaged into new securities, Loreley Financing said in
the complaint.  Christian Streckert, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, confirmed the settlement and said the bank was
pleased to have resolved the dispute. He declined to comment
further.  The case is Loreley Financing ( Jersey ) No. 3 Ltd. v.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 652737/2011, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
