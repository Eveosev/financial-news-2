German plant and machinery orders
declined for a third month in January, reflecting weaker
domestic demand, the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 6 percent from a year
earlier after declining an annual 10 percent in December, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders fell 9 percent, while export orders slipped 4
percent. In the three months through January, orders fell 9
percent compared to the same period a year ago.  “There are signs that orders are stabilizing,” VDMA chief
economist Ralph Wiechers said in the statement. “That doesn’t
mean there won’t be negative numbers in the coming months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
