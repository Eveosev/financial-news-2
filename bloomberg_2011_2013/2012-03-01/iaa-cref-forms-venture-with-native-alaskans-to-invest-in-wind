TIAA-CREF, the manager of retirement
accounts for teachers, formed a joint venture with an Alaskan
Native American-owned holding company to invest in North
American wind power.  The venture, Capistrano Wind Partners LLC, is using $238
million from TIAA-CREF and  Cook Inlet Region Inc.  to acquire
three operating wind farms from a unit of  Edison International (EIX) ,
the Rosemead, California-based utility holding company said
today in a statement.  Capistrano bought the 61-megawatt Mountain Wind I and 80-
megawatt Mountain Wind II projects in Wyoming, and the 150-
megawatt Cedro Hill project in  Texas .  TIAA-CREF and Cook Inlet plan to invest a total of $460
million in the venture, which will eventually buy as many as
seven Edison Mission Group wind projects with a total of 500
megawatts of capacity. That includes the 42-megawatt Crofton
Bluffs and the 80-megawatt Broken Bow wind farms in  Nebraska 
that Capistrano expects to acquire when they go into operation.  Edison Mission Group owns 31 wind projects that are either
in operation or under construction in 11 U.S. states with a
total of 2,000 megawatts of capacity.  Marathon Capital LLC advised Edison on the deal, and
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP provided legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
