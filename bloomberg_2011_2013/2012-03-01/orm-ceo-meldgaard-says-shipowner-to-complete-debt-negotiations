Torm A/S (TORM)  Chief Executive Officer
Jacob Meldgaard said he expects the Danish owner of oil-product
tankers and commodity carriers to complete debt talks.  “I do expect we will be able to conclude our negotiations
with the group of lenders during the coming period,” Meldgaard
said on a conference call today. He spoke in reply after being
asked whether Hellerup, Denmark-based Torm would resolve
financial issues and remain a so-called going concern, which he
said it would.  Torm’s  annual report , published today, included a
“disclaimer of opinion” from auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
Ltd. about the company’s ability to remain a going concern. Debt
comes to $1.87 billion, Meldgaard said by phone. That compares
with a market value of 245.3 million kroner ($44 million).  The company agreed with its banks in December on delayed
loan repayments and a so-called covenant standstill. The
deferrals were extended two more times, with the last accord due
to expire today.  Torm reported a $453 million net loss for last year,
exceeding analyst estimates, according to the company. That was
the  third loss  in a row, figures compiled by Bloomberg show.  The company said it expects to defer debt repayments for a
fourth time as the current agreement expires. Torm operates
about 160 vessels, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
