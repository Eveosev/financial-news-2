The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 3 p.m. Mexico City time.  The IPC  index  rose 0.6 percent to 38,033.45.  Compartamos SAB (COMPARC*)  (COMPARC* MM), the holding company that
controls low-income lender Banco Compartamos SA, slipped 1.6
percent to 14.17 pesos. Compartamos has dropped in every session
since its Feb. 27 earnings report, when its 469 million pesos
($36.8 million) in fourth-quarter net income missed the estimate
of Banco Santander SA.  Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  , Mexico’s second-largest land-line
phone company, gained 1.9 percent to 4.37 pesos. Press reports
saying a recent Supreme Court decision could cost Axtel money
sent the “wrong message” and stock price declines resulting
from the reports may make it “more attractive,” Santander said
in a report dated today.  Industrias Penoles SAB (PE&OLES*)  (PE&OLES* MM), Mexico’s largest
silver producer, gained 2.4 percent to 652.63 pesos. Silver
futures for May delivery rose in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
