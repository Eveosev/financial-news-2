Viacom Inc. (VIAB)  Chairman  Sumner Redstone 
won’t attend the company’s annual meeting because of an
“unavoidable conflict.”  Redstone, 88, will address investors at the March 8 meeting
in  New York  in a video, Carl Folta, a spokesman, said today in a
statement. The absence isn’t health-related, he said.  The chairman, who controls Viacom and  CBS Corp. (CBS)  through his
National Amusements Inc., participates in shareholder meetings
and earnings calls. The Los Angeles resident attended the
Academy Awards on Feb. 26, and on March 28 will be  presented 
with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  “Due to an unavoidable conflict, Mr. Redstone will be
addressing shareholders on a video presentation,” according to
the statement issued by Folta.  Investors won’t view Redstone’s absence as a cause for
alarm, analysts David Joyce at Miller Tabak & Co. and David Bank
at RBC Capital Markets said in e-mails.  Viacom, owner of MTV and Paramount Pictures, gained 2.5
percent at the close of  trading  in New York. The Class B stock
has climbed 7.5 percent this year. The Wall Street Journal
reported the story earlier today.  CBS declined to comment on Redstone’s plans for its annual
meeting, set for May 26 in New York. The owner of the most-
watched  broadcast network  rose 1.5 percent to $30.35 today and
has gained 12 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
