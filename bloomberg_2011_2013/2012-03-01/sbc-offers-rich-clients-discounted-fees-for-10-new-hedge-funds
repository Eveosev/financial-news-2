HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Geneva-based
private bank is offering clients discounts of about 25 percent
on fees charged by 10 new hedge funds.  “These newer funds are the next generation, the new life
of the industry,” Peter Rigg, head of HSBC’s alternative
investment unit and a member of the private bank’s executive
committee, told reporters in Geneva today. “In the early days
they really have to perform.”  HSBC can negotiate down fees in the  New York , Paris,  London 
and Asia funds, which together manage $200 million, said Rigg,
who declined to identify the managers. Private clients provide
part of the $38 billion invested by HSBC in alternative
investments such as hedge funds, private equity and real estate.  To attract capital, hedge fund startups often agreed to
lower the fees they charge investors, Citigroup Inc. said in a
report earlier this week. The traditional 2 percent of assets
and 20 percent of profits declined to 1.5 percent and 15
percent, respectively, according to the report.  Hedge funds  are mostly private pools of capital whose
managers participate substantially in the profit from
speculation on whether asset prices will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
