Chinese stocks traded in the U.S.
rose, led by  Seaspan Corp. (SSW) , after data showing that
manufacturing expanded for a third month bolstered the outlook
for the world’s second-largest economy.  Seaspan, a Hong Kong-based container ship operator, soared
to a 10-month high as plans to boost a quarterly dividend and
buy back shares spurred two analysts to reiterate “buy”
recommendations. Macau casino operator  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (MPEL)  traded at a 2.5 percent premium to Hong Kong shares as
gaming revenue soared 22 percent in the city. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S.
added 0.4 percent to 108.61 yesterday in New York.  China ’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose to 51.0 last month,
from 50.5 in January, government data released yesterday showed.
Above the 50 level that is the threshold for expansion, the
February reading was the highest since September and beat a 50.9
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 measure sunk 8.3 percent last year as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and sluggish U.S. growth damped prospects
for the world’s largest exporter, where the economy expanded at
the slowest pace for 10 quarters at the end of 2011.  “The PMI was obviously encouraging and China is going to
have a soft landing in decent growth,” Greg Lesko, who manages
$700 million at Deltec Asset Management in  New York  including
investments in Chinese stocks, said in a phone interview
yesterday.  Seaspan surged 7.2 percent to $18.51 in the U.S., the
highest level since May 2.  Boosted Dividend  The company said on Feb. 29 that it will increase quarterly
dividend payments by 33 percent to to 25 U.S. cents per share
and that payouts to stockholders in 2012 will total $1 per
share, according to a statement issued after U.S. markets closed
on Feb. 29. The board of Seaspan also approved a plan to buy
back as much as $50 million of common shares without an
expiration date.  Analysts at Dahlman Rose & Co LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald LP
reiterated their “buy”  recommendations  on the stock yesterday,
while strategists at Credit Suisse Group AG and  Wells Fargo &
Co . rated Seaspan shares “neutral” or “market perform.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., was little changed at $40.32
yesterday, after advancing 3.8 percent last month. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 0.6 percent to 1,374.09, extending a
three-month rally, after government data showed that U.S.
jobless claims declined to a four-year low.  Mindray Upgraded  Mindray Medical International Ltd. (MR) , China’s biggest
medical-device supplier, advanced 4.5 percent to $31.98 in New
York trading, the highest level since Aug. 9. CLSA Ltd. analyst
Jacqueline Mei upgraded her recommendation on the shares to
“outperform” from “underperform” on Feb. 29 while nine other
analysts maintained ratings of “buy” or “outperform,” after
the company released fourth-quarter results.  Mindray, based in Shenzhen, said in a Feb. 27 statement
that fourth-quarter sales rose 25 percent from a year ago to
$264.1 million, beating the $259.2 million  average  of five
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company will pay a 40-cent cash dividend per share in
April from its 2011 net income, which rose 7 percent from the
previous year to $166.6 million. Mindray forecast adjusted net
income will climb at least 13 percent this year, more than the
average growth rate predicted by 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Gaming Revenue Increase  Melco Crown, which runs casinos in the world’s biggest
gaming hub, advanced 3 percent to a six-month high of $13.01.
Gaming revenue in Macau, the only Chinese city where public
gambling is allowed, increased 22.3 percent in February from a
year ago to 24.3 billion patacas ($3 billion), the city’s Gaming
Inspection and Coordination Bureau said yesterday.  Melco’s American depositary receipts, each representing
three common shares, traded 2.5 percent above stock listed in
 Hong Kong , from a discount of 0.5 percent on Feb. 29.  Macau gambling shares may deliver 30 percent to 50 percent
returns this year, Billy Ng, a Hong Kong-based gaming analyst at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television yesterday. Melco Crown is returning 35
percent in 2012.  Chinese economic growth is expected to slow to about 8.5
percent this year, from 9.2 percent in 2011, China’s Ministry of
Industry and  Information Technology  said on Feb. 29. Policy
makers are already loosening monetary policy to ease access to
credit for smaller businesses, cutting the amount of cash large
banks need to keep in reserve for the second time since December
on Feb. 24. Benchmark rates have been on hold since July.  ‘Loosen More’  “They are going to loosen more on the fiscal side than the
monetary side because they still want to see housing prices
stay,” Deltec Asset’s Lesko said.  Home prices  in China posted the biggest decline in 19
months in February as the government pledged to maintain curbs
on property,  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the nation’s biggest real-
estate website owner, which began compiling data in July 2010,
said in an e-mail yesterday.  China Eastern Airlines Co. (CEA) , the country’s third-largest
carrier by market value, rose 2 percent to $19.37 yesterday,
rising for the third day. The ADRs traded 0.5 percent higher
than  China Eastern ’s Hong Kong stock, which was unchanged at
HK$2.99, the equivalent of 38.6 U.S. cents. The airline’s
Shanghai-traded shares added 0.5 percent to 4.31 yuan yesterday,
or 68 U.S. cents.  ‘Robust’ Earnings  Investors should buy shares of China’s air carriers as the
companies have a “robust” earnings outlook for this year and
are trading at or below book value, HSBC Holdings Plc. analyst
Zhe Wei Sim wrote in a report yesterday. He upgraded China
Eastern to “overweight” from “neutral.”  ADRs of  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , China’s second-largest video
website, tumbled 19 percent, the most since the company’s
initial public offering in the U.S. on Aug. 16 and the biggest
decline on the Bloomberg China-US 55 measure yesterday. The
Shanghai-based company reported a net loss in the fourth
quarter, from profit in the previous three months. The ADRs
closed at $12.89 yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 26.  Tudou incurred a net loss of 148.9 million yuan ($23.6
million) in the last quarter of 2011, compared with a loss of
263.7 million a year earlier and net income of 52.5 million yuan
in the three months to Sept. 30 last year, the company said in a
statement yesterday after U.S. markets closed.  The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed at
2,426.12, after increasing 5.9 percent in February. The  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  in Hong Kong advanced 1.4 percent to 21,387.96
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
