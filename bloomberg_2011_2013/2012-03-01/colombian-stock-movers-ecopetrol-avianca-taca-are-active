Aeroperlas, the  Panama  City-based unit of Avianca Taca, ceased
operations in Panama, citing “the need to retool the airline’s
business model based on trend analysis and current market
conditions,” according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The 43-year-old company said it seeks to design a new model
of operations in the future, without giving further details. The
company said it had 113,222 passengers in 2011, a 2 percent
increase from the year before.  Avianca Taca said it will continue other international

fell 0.8 percent to 5,170 pesos.  Colombia extended into a second day a search for workers
kidnapped during development of an oil pipeline near the
Venezuelan border. The workers may have been kidnapped by the
Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional guerrilla group, according to an
army official who can’t be identified because of military
policy.  No one has taken responsibility for the kidnapping in the
Arauca region, where Ecopetrol is investing in the Bicentennial
pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
