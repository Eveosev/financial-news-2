The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  should seek permission to inspect Iran’s Parchin base
from military authorities rather than the country’s Atomic
Energy Organization as there are no nuclear activities there,
the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported, citing AEO
chief Fereidoun Abbas.  IAEA officials were denied access to Parchin base last
month, raising concern over a weapons component to the country’s
atomic program that the U.S. and Israel have signaled might
prompt an attack.  To contact the reporters on this story:
