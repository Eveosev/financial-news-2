Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest bank, said profit declined for the first time in
more than a year after it recorded litigation costs related to a
 Ponzi scheme  in  Florida . The lender boosted its quarterly
dividend 5.9 percent.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 fell 5.3 percent to
C$1.48 billion ($1.5 billion), or C$1.55 a share, from C$1.56
billion, or C$1.67, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a statement.  Toronto-Dominion recorded costs of C$171 million for
litigation related to disbarred Florida attorney Scott Rothstein,
who admitted running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. The bank lost
a $67 million jury verdict in January over an investor group’s
claims the lender helped Rothstein.  Excluding the litigation reserve and other one-time items,
Toronto-Dominion said it earned C$1.86 a share. That topped the
C$1.77-a-share average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The bank boosted its quarterly dividend to 72 cents a share,
from 68 cents.  Toronto-Dominion rose 0.6 percent to C$80.83 in trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday. The shares have risen 6
percent this year, compared with a 5.5 percent gain on the 10-
member  S&P/TSX Banks Index (STBANKX) .  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. Toronto
time to discuss the results. To listen, visit
