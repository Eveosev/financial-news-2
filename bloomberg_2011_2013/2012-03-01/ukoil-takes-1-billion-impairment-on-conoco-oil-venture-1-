OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, recorded a $955 million impairment charge after a
venture with  ConocoPhillips (COP)  found less oil than expected.  Lukoil had the charge in the fourth quarter at its OOO
Narianmarneftegaz venture with ConocoPhillips, it said in a
statement. Lower production at the northern Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu
deposit due to “unanticipated geological reasons” resulted in
estimated field reserves falling to 142 million barrels at the
end of 2011 from 505 million barrels in 2008.  “It’s a paper loss reflecting the problems with the asset,
which were already in the market,” Artem Konchin, an oil and
gas analyst at  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said by phone from Moscow.  Net income of $1.35 billion compared with profit of $2.19
billion in the same period a year earlier, the Moscow-based
company said in a filing today. That missed the average estimate
of $2.69 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Full-year net income at Lukoil reached a record $10.4
billion. Russian oil producers have posted record earnings for
2011 after unrest in the  Middle East  pushed average prices for
the country’s Urals export blend to more than $100 a barrel.  Caspian Reserves  Lukoil increased natural-gas reserves at the Sarmatskoye
field in the Russian section of the Caspian Sea by 46 percent in
2011 to almost 1 billion barrels under Russian standards, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer  Leonid Fedun  said at an investor
presentation in  London .  Proved, probable and possible oil reserves increased 4.6
percent to 23.6 billion barrels, according to the  presentation .  The company will announce a new dividend policy at a March
14 presentation of its 10-year strategy in London, Fedun said.
Revenue rose to $133.7 billion in 2011 from $105 billion in
2010, Lukoil said.  Lukoil has expanded in West Africa, Iraq, Venezuela and
 Vietnam  after domestic taxes and laws limited access to Russian
resources. That may mean additional expenses as international
prospects lack the benefit of geological data inherited from the
Soviet era.  The cost of failed wells almost doubled to $417 million
last year, Lukoil said. Dry wells, as they are known, cost $181
million in Ghana, $149 million in the  Ivory Coast  and $27
million in Vietnam, Lukoil said.  Offshore drilling results from the Ivory Coast are expected
in 2013, Fedun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
