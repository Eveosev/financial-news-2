Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO) , Mexico’s second-largest
land-line phone carrier, posted its first advance in eight
sessions after Banco Santander SA downplayed speculation that a
recent  Supreme Court  decision could cost the company money.  The stock rose 1.9 percent to 4.37 pesos at 3 p.m. local
time in Mexico City trading, breaking the longest streak of
consecutive declines since the period ending Nov. 25.  While Axtel lost a court ruling this week, it was the first
in a series of similar decisions and is itself unlikely to cost
Axtel money, Santander said in a research note dated today.  Press reports sent the “wrong message” about the
decision, according to Santander. “Axtel owes 1.5 billion”
pesos, said a headline yesterday in  Mexico  City newspaper
 Reforma , while daily El Universal  wrote  that the Supreme Court’s
decision “represents risks for Axtel.”  “Any stock price weakness that might occur as a result of
these local reports could make the stock more attractive,”
Santander analysts led by Gregorio Tomassi said.  Axtel shares lost 16 percent in the seven sessions through
yesterday, while the  benchmark IPC  index of 35 Mexican companies
slipped 1.3 percent.  Mexico’s Supreme Court is reviewing four cases involving
the fees Axtel had to pay dating back to 2005 to connect calls
to the clients of mobile-phone companies. The cases will
determine whether Axtel overpaid or underpaid for those fees by
reviewing the methodology government regulators used to
determine the rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
