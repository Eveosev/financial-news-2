(Corrects headline and first, third and fourth paragraphs
to remove references to abandoning the well, adds company
statement in last two paragraphs.)  Houston American Energy Corp. (HUSA) , the
oil producer that reported net losses for the first nine months
of last year, fell the most since 2002 after reporting that it’s
plugging the lower portion of a well in  Colombia  after tool
failures.  Houston American  declined  35 percent to $7 at the close in
New York, the biggest drop since Nov. 26, 2002.  Houston American will seal the deeper portion of its
Tamandua #1 well and instead will further evaluate formations
closer to the surface, according to a statement today.  The company, based in Houston, will move the drilling rig
to one of two possible locations after completing the well.  “I would like to make it clear to our investors that the
Tamandua #1 well is not being abandoned,” John F. Terwilliger,
chief executive officer of Houston American, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Current ongoing operations are to make a completion
attempt in the C-9 and C-7 sands,” he said. “As previously
reported, the Tamandua #1 well exhibited hydrocarbon shows in
the C-7 and C-9 sands, and logged approximately 200 feet of net
resistive sands in the C-7 formation and approximately 140 feet
of net resistive sands in the C-9 formation. We are eagerly
awaiting the results from these completion attempts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
