New U.S. operating standards imposed
in the wake of the reactor meltdowns in Fukushima,  Japan , last
year may prompt owners of single nuclear plants to consider
selling them,  PPL Corp. (PPL)  Chief Executive Officer William Spence
said.  Requirements that are more efficiently met by owners of
multiple plants may lead companies that own a single plant to
sell it, Spence said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters
in New York yesterday. PPL has no such plans and views its
2,289-megawatt Susquehanna nuclear plant 70 miles (113
kilometers) northeast of Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , as a key
strategic asset, Spence said.  The five-member  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  is weighing
rules to improve safety at 104 operator U.S. nuclear reactors
and may issue its first Fukushima-related orders by March 9,
 David McIntyre , an NRC spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  “There will be a lot of companies like ourselves that will
have to look hard at their role in nuclear,” Spence said.  A 9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami March 11 caused
explosions and a loss of power at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, leaving storage pools unable to keep
spent fuel-rods cool and triggering meltdowns and radiation
leaks. Trapped hydrogen gas from water molecules fractured by
radiation ignited, causing explosions.  Venting Systems  The NRC’s upcoming rules are expected to address concerns
highlighted by a  task force  in July that plant owners don’t have
sufficient instruments to keep nuclear-waste cooling pools safe
and must take steps to withstand power losses, according to
 proposals  by NRC staff made public Feb. 17.  Regulators may require sturdy venting systems to relieve
pressure in  General Electric Co (GE) .-designed reactors similar to
those that failed at Fukushima. PPL’s plant has two such
reactors.  “ Capital requirements  for hardened vents and ongoing
modifications we’d need to make at Susquehanna are going to be
very manageable,” Spence said.  The U.S. trade group, the  Nuclear Energy Institute , on Feb.
12 proposed that plant owners operating in the same region be
allowed to pool portable emergency equipment such as back-up
pumps and generators.  Operational requirements that increase costs, such as
dedicated emergency response crews, might make single plants
less competitive than groups of reactors, Spence said.  PPL and 13 other companies each operate a single nuclear
plant, according to NRC data.   Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S.
reactor operator, also has nuclear plants in Pennsylvania.
Exelon operates 17 reactors at 10 sites.  Power Rebound  U.S. power prices, depressed by a shale-driven glut of
natural gas, may rebound in 2015 as coal-burning plants capable
of powering millions of homes close because they can’t afford to
operate under new air-pollution rules, Spence said.  PPL, which derives about 40 percent of its power from
nuclear plants and hydroelectric projects, expects as much as
17,000 megawatts of power plant capacity to be shut in its
Pennsylvania market as a result of the rules, Spence said.  An economic rebound may also benefit PPL, Spence said.
Profit from generating power have shrunk as wholesale
electricity prices have fallen since 2007. The average benchmark
power price in the PJM market, the largest in the U.S., was
$40.53 a megawatt-hour in the fourth quarter, down from $70.08
in the last quarter of 2007.  “It’s been slow and sluggish, but there are signs that
things are slowly improving with demand,” Spence said.  Spence, who was named PPL’s CEO in November, said the
company isn’t actively seeking acquisitions as it absorbs recent
purchases of regulated utilities in Kentucky and the U.K.  To contact the reporters on this story:
