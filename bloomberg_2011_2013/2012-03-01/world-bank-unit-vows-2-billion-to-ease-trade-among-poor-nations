The International Finance Corp. is
adding $2 billion in financing to help buy food and energy in
poor countries hit by rapid price volatility.  The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, said it is
investing $1 billion in the new Critical Commodities Finance
Program to support global trade in commodities and to ease
energy imports. The organization is also adding $1 billion to
its Global Trade Liquidity Program. The first $250 million of
commodities money is being disbursed through Societe Generale
SA, the IFC said in a statement.  “Many developing countries are vulnerable to food-supply
shortages and price spikes because of difficulties importing
essential equipment, fuel, and fertilizers,” said IFC Chief
Executive Officer Lars Thunell in the statement. The new program
“will provide much-needed support at a time when capital is
becoming scarce for many businesses in developing countries.”  Agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa needs to double
for the region to become self-sufficient in food, according to a
study sponsored last year by businesses including  Monsanto Co. (MON) ,
 DuPont Co. (DD) ,  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  and  Deere & Co. (DE)  Rising
food costs in 2010 and 2011 contributed to riots in North Africa
and the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
