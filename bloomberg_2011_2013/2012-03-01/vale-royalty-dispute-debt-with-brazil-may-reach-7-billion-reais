Vale SA (VALE5)  and the Brazilian government
are close to an agreement on a dispute over unpaid royalty
payments that may reach 7 billion reais ($4.09 billion), Mines
and Energy Minister Edison Lobao said.  The Brazilian government is analyzing documentation
provided by  Vale , the world’s largest iron-ore exporter, and
expects to reach a conclusion on the amount of overdue payments,
Lobao told reporters in Brasilia today. The amount owed, which
was 4 billion reais in 2008, may reach 7 billion reais including
penalties and interest, he said.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, has been fighting tax claims
from the government amid growth in its exports and rising
minerals prices. The company and  Brazil ’s National Mineral
Production Department failed to reach an agreement by an initial
October deadline. Talks were extended an extra 60 days earlier
this week to bring an end to the dispute.  The company estimated its liability could be as much as
7.88 billion reais ($4.6 billion) in an April 28 filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Brazil is also looking
for additional tax payments on profits at Vale’s foreign
operations, according to the filing.  A Vale official declined to comment about the minister’s
statement today.  Vale  gained  1.1 percent to 42.95 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo . The shares have gained 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
