Singapore â€™s stockpiles of  fuel oil 
rose to the highest level in nine months, according to data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
increased 0.3 percent to 21.8 million barrels,  International
Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said in an e-
mailed statement today. Supplies are at the highest level since
May 18.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline increased 3.9 percent to 11.7 million barrels.
 Middle distillates , a category that includes gasoil and
kerosene, fell 3.3 percent to 11.09 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
