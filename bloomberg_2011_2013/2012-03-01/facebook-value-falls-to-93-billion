Facebook Inc.’s implied value
dropped 5 percent to about $93 billion in the auction of a fund
that holds shares of the social-networking company’s stock.  The sale yesterday set a price of $40 apiece for 125,000
units of the fund, according to an e-mailed statement from
 SharesPost Inc. , which managed the auction. A Feb. 14 fund
auction valued Facebook at about $98 billion.  Facebook, which filed for an initial public offering on
 Feb. 1 , is said to seek a valuation of as high as $100 billion.
The implied valuation based on private-market transactions may
change depending on the actual share count after the IPO.  Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Menlo Park,  California-based
Facebook , declined to comment on the auction.  San Bruno, California-based SharesPost, which lets
investors trade shares of companies before they go public,
estimates Facebook has 2.33 billion shares outstanding,
including stock tied to options that may be issued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
