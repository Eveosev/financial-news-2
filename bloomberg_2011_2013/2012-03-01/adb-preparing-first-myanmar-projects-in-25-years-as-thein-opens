The  Asian Development Bank  is
preparing to fund projects in Myanmar after 25 years, joining
other multilateral agencies and governments entering the nation
as the former military dictatorship accelerates reforms.  “We are certainly gearing up for re-engagement,” Rajat Nag, ADB managing director-general, said in an interview in his
office in  Manila  yesterday. “We have started exploratory work,
we’ve had missions going to Myanmar. The development challenges
of the country are huge: infrastructure, social sector. They
need a lot of support and capacity building.”  President  Thein Sein , who took power last year after a
general election in 2010 ended half a century of military rule,
has released political prisoners and signed a preliminary cease-
fire with the country’s largest armed rebel group, prompting
Western nations to consider lifting sanctions. Myanmar may be
Asia’s “next economic frontier,” the  International Monetary Fund 
has said, highlighting greater investor interest in the
resource-rich nation.  The ADB is seeking approval from its shareholders to
formally begin infrastructure and development projects in
Myanmar, and will work with other agencies including the  United
Nations  and the World Bank, Nag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
