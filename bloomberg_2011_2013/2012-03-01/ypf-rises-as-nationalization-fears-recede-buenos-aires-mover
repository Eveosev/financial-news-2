YPF SA (YPF) , Argentina’s largest energy
company, rose the most in a decade after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner didn’t address a potential nationalization
of the company as speculated in local media reports.  YPF surged 17 percent to 146 pesos in Buenos Aires trading,
the most since Jan. 2002.  Fernandez announced no takeover or measures against YPF in
her speech to Congress today. Newspaper Ambito Financiero
reported yesterday she could announce a takeover or intervention
in Buenos Aires-based YPF in the annual speech to Congress,
without saying where it obtained the information. The government
has been putting pressure since January on  oil companies  to
increase investments after fuel imports doubled last year.  YPF plunged 14 percent between Feb. 28 and 29, the biggest
two-day slide since March 2009, on the nationalization
speculation. The stock has declined 34 percent in the last 12
months, more than a 20 percent drop in Argentina’s benchmark
Merval index.  Argentina and  Spain ’s governments formed a working group to
resolve their “differences” over YPF, Spain’s Industry
Minister Jose Manuel Soria said today before Fernandez’s speech.
YPF’s majority stakeholder is  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest
energy company.  YPF’s board meeting on Feb. 23 was declared “irregular”
yesterday by the country’s securities regulator after three
government officials were barred from attending the meeting with
Roberto Baratta, the government’s board representative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
