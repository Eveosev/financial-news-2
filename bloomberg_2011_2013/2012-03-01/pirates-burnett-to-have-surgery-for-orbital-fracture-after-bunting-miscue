Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher  A.J.
Burnett  will have surgery tomorrow to repair a fractured right
orbital bone, an injury suffered yesterday when he fouled a bunt
attempt into his face.  The Pirates said it isn’t known how long Burnett, who was
acquired from the  New York Yankees  on Feb. 19, will be out.  Burnett, 35, went 11-11 with a 5.15 ERA last year, when he
allowed a career-high 31 home runs and set a Yankees record with
25 wild pitches, the most by any Major League Baseball pitcher
since the start of the 2000 season. In three seasons in New
York, Burnett went 34-35 with a 4.79 earned run average.  The Yankees are paying about $18 million of the remaining
$31.1 million on his contract that expires after the 2013
season, ESPN has reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
