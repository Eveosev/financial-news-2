Venezuela ’s President  Hugo Chavez  is
on the road to a full recovery following an operation he
underwent in Cuba this week to extract a lesion, Vice President
Elias Jaua said.  Jaua, who called into a program on Venezuelan state
television, said he spoke with Chavez by telephone today during
which they discussed matters of state. He said Chavez had eaten
soup and his voice was full of energy.  “Good evening, my compatriots,” Chavez wrote on his
Twitter account. “Here I am, taking flight like the condor.”  Jaua said yesterday that the operation to remove the lesion
from the same pelvic area from which doctors removed a cancerous
tumor last year had gone ahead without complications and that
tests on the lesion would indicate the best course of treatment.
Chavez, who is seeking re-election in October after 13 years in
power, has declined to say exactly what kind of cancer he has or
allow access to his medical records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
