The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission asked for public comments on whether government
officials may block mobile-phone service.  The Bay Area Rapid Transit agency in  San Francisco  drew
“sharp criticism” for interrupting calls last year, and
federal authorities are interested in whether legal or policy
guidance is needed, the FCC said in a statement today.  BART  said Aug. 12  that it limited phone service because
protesters of a fatal shooting by agency police threatened to
“use mobile devices to coordinate their disruptive activities
and communicate about the location and number of BART police.”  The FCC in its statement today said “any intentional
interruption of wireless service, no matter how brief or
localized, raises significant concerns and implicates
substantial legal and policy questions.”  FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said in the statement that
“our democracy, our society, and our safety all require
communications networks that are available and open.”  Technology groups last year asked the FCC to declare that
local governments may not block mobile-phone service.  “Such interference with communications has a long history
of being used to suppress civil rights protests,” the groups
said in a petition to the agency in August.  To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in
