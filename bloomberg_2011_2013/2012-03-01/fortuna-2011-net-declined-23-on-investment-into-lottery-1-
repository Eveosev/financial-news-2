Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) , a
betting company in Poland, the  Czech Republic  and Slovakia, said
its profit for 2011 declined 23.3 percent as it invested in a
new lottery format.  Net income for the year fell to 13.3 million euros from
17.4 million euros a year earlier, the Amsterdam-registered
company said today in a statement released on the  Warsaw stock
exchange. (GPW)  Amounts staked rose 6.2 percent to 409 million euros.  The betting market proved “resilient” against any
uncertainties and developed according to expectations, the head
of Fortuna’s supervisory board, Jozef Janov, said in the
statement. In sports betting, the company kept sales margins and
its financial measures grew, Janov said.  Fortuna, which started a lottery project in July last year,
has been battling for market share with its biggest rival Sazka
AS, a former state lottery monopoly now run by financial groups
PPF AS and KKCG.  Net Estimates  “All in all, results were slightly below on the net profit
level compared with market consensus,” Ceska Sporitelna AS’
analyst Vaclav Kminek wrote in a note to clients today. The
“main” difference compared to our estimates is from “higher”
loss in the lottery segment, Kminek wrote. Kminek recommends
investors to “accumulate” shares.  Fortuna  fell  2.85 koruna, or 2.8 percent, to 100.3 as of
9:54 a.m. in Prague trading.  The net income was hurt by a loss of 7 million euros linked
with a start of the lottery unit, the company said in the
statement. The lottery business will begin to show a return in
the first half of 2013, the company said.  Fortuna plans to invest more into online betting in 2012
and mobile phone applications and sees the 2012 Euro soccer
championship as helping it consolidate its market in  Poland .  The bookmaker will continue to pursue a dividend policy of
70 percent to 100 percent of consolidated net income and will be
releasing information about the planned level of dividend in the
coming weeks, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
