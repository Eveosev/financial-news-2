The U.S. Commerce Department delayed
a decision on additional tariffs for Chinese solar-equipment
makers until March 19.  The decision, scheduled for tomorrow, is being postponed
because of the “extraordinarily complicated” investigation,
according to a notice in the Federal Register on Feb. 22. U.S.
solar-equipment manufacturers, led by  SolarWorld AG (SWV) ’s U.S. unit,
claim they are being harmed because  China ’s government uses cash
grants, discounts on raw materials, preferential loans and tax
incentives, and manipulates its currency to boost exports of
solar cells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
