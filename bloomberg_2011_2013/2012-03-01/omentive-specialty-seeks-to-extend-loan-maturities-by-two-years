Momentive Specialty Chemcials Inc (HXN) .
is seeking to extend maturities and boost the  interest rate  on
senior secured debt facilities due in 2013 and 2015.  The provider of chemical products for the automotive,
chemical, construction and transportation industries is looking
to push out the maturity to March 2015 on loans due in May 2013
and to March 2017 on facilities maturing in May 2015, it said
today in a regulatory filing. It may also delay the expiration
of a line of credit to December 2014 instead of February 2013.  Momentive may issue new senior secured debt as part of the
transaction, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said. Proceeds
from the loan will be used to repay outstanding borrowings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
