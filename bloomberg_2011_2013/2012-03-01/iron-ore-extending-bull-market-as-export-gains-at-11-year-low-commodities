Iron ore, the world’s second-biggest
commodity cargo after crude oil, is extending a  bull market 
after rallying 22 percent from a 22-month low in October as the
slowest expansion in exports in 11 years restricts supplies.  Seaborne supply will advance 3.8 percent to 1.09 billion
metric tons this year, the smallest gain since 2001, according
to Clarkson Plc, the largest shipbroker. Prices in China, the
biggest importer, may rise 10 percent to an average of $157.50 a
ton in the fourth quarter, the median of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Shares of  Vale SA (VALE) , which ships more
ore than any other company, will rise 19 percent to $30.42 in
the next 12 months, the average of 16 estimates shows.  New mines and expansions of existing ones are being
postponed by rising costs and licensing delays. Morgan Stanley
cut its forecast for export supply by 9.6 percent since October
and expects a 99 million-ton deficit in the seaborne market this
year, at least the ninth consecutive annual shortage. Vale will
report its second-biggest profit ever this year, the mean of 11
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “The wall of additional iron-ore supply that investors
have been fearing is going to be late,” said Neil Gregson, who
helps manage about $7.4 billion of commodity assets at JPMorgan
Asset Management in London. “ Iron ore  remains a tight market.”  Steel Index  Ore (TSIPIO62)  with 62 percent metal content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was at $143.20 a ton today, after a fourth
consecutive monthly gain, according to The Steel Index Ltd.,
which publishes steel, ore and scrap prices. The commodity is
measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture content.  Iron ore’s 22 percent advance since October compares with
an 8 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24
commodities and a 4.1 percent jump in the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities. Treasuries returned 2.1 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  Prices that rose sevenfold in eight years spurred new
products for investors. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group
AG started swaps in 2008 and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange
began futures in 2011. About $13 billion of swaps and options
were traded in the past three years, with 95 percent linked to
the Tianjin price, according to The Steel Index. Fourth-quarter
swaps traded at $129.94 today, SGX AsiaClear data show.  Rising prices may spur more production in  China . Imports
may drop as much as 14 percent this year, Wu Rongqing, the chief
engineer of the China Mining Association, said at a conference
in Beijing on Feb. 28. Its ore is typically about 25 percent
iron, compared with 60 percent in  Australia , increasing costs
for mining companies, according to Deutsche Bank. Inventories at
ports are within 2.7 percent of the record 101 million tons
reached Feb. 3, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co., a state-backed researcher.  Monetary Fund  Chinese steel consumption hasn’t rebounded since a weeklong
public holiday in January because of tighter credit and weaker
construction, MEPS (International) Ltd., a Sheffield, England-
based industry consultant, said in a report Feb. 27. The
nation’s economy, consuming about 65 percent of all seaborne
ore, will expand 8.2 percent this year, the slowest growth since
1999, the International Monetary Fund estimates.  Demand for iron ore may also be curbed by the debt crisis
in  Europe , where mills produced about 12 percent of the world’s
steel last year. The economy in the 17-nation euro area will
decline 0.4 percent this year, compared with growth of 1.5
percent in 2011, according to the median of 25 economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher prices may accelerate projects. Supply almost
doubled since 2003, compared with a 25 percent gain in mined
copper, Morgan Stanley estimates.  Delayed Projects  Delayed projects include Minas Rio in  Brazil , which Anglo
American Plc originally expected to open in 2009, and Simandou
in  Guinea , which Rio Tinto Group anticipates will start in 2015
rather than next year, as previously forecast.  Vale (VALE5)  said Nov. 28
it delayed the start of an $8.04 billion expansion at the
Carajas Sierra Sul mine in Brazil by two years to 2016.  Iron-ore mining costs rose at least 20 percent in Australia
and Brazil in 2010, according to UBS AG. Standard Chartered Plc
expects a 145 million-ton shortage this year as deliveries from
India drop 35 percent because of curbs on mines that don’t have
permits to operate and as the government raised export duties.
Exports from Brazil, the second-biggest shipper behind
Australia, will grow 7 percent, the slowest pace since 2008,
Morgan Stanley predicts.  Baltic Exchange  Slowing growth in exports means a continued glut in
shipping. Daily rates for  Capesizes (BCAVRT) , which haul about 80 percent
of all seaborne iron ore, slumped 78 percent to $5,976 this
year, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange, which
publishes costs along more than 50 maritime routes. The fleet
expanded 57 percent since the end of 2008 as iron-ore exports
advanced 30 percent, data from Redhill, England-based IHS
Fairplay and London-based Clarkson show.  Global supply needs to expand by at least 100 million tons
a year in the next eight years to meet demand and replace mines
that close, London-based Rio said in a presentation on Feb. 28.  China’s government announced plans in April to build 36
million affordable houses by 2015. Each uses about 3.3 tons of
steel, MEPS estimates. With 1.6 tons of ore needed to make a ton
of steel, the housing program implies demand for 190 million
tons of ore, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Construction
accounts for 55 percent of steel demand in China, MEPS says.  The Asian nation may also have to seek additional ore
supply from Australia and Brazil because of declining cargoes
from  Iran , which is subject to international sanctions over its
nuclear program. China’s ore imports from the country in January
were the smallest in two years, customs data show.  Ore Exports  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro , accounts for about 31
percent of global ore exports, while Rio has a 19 percent market
share and Melbourne-based  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  13 percent,
according to estimates from Bloomberg Industries.  The Brazilian miner will report  net income  of $21.38
billion this year, 5.6 percent below the record in 2011, analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Its shares rose 19 percent
to $25.56 in  New York  this year.  Rio gained 15 percent in London and will rise another 32
percent to 4,746 pence in the next 12 months, the average of 21
estimates shows. BHP advanced 3.3 percent in Sydney and the
average of 16 estimates shows it will add another 33 percent to
A$47.13 in the next 12 months.  “The market, even though supply is coming back a little
bit, will be constrained,” said  Michael Widmer , an analyst at
Bank of America in  London . “Almost every single mine that we
had in the pipeline has been delayed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
