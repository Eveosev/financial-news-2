Syria ’s central-bank assets are safe
from new European Union sanctions, the Syrian Arab News Agency
reported, citing Central Bank Governor Adib Mayaleh.  The bank had taken protective measures before the Feb. 27
EU decision to freeze its assets and ban trade in  precious
metals  and diamonds with Syria, he said, adding that the
sanctions mainly hurt Syrian citizens.  The central bank is awaiting the right timing to intervene
in the market to stabilize the national currency back at normal
levels after the rate spiraled due to speculation since unrest
spread across the country last year, Mayaleh said.  EU nations have also prohibited Syrian cargo-only flights
to the bloc as part of the tougher penalties against President
Bashar al-Assad’s government for its continued violent crackdown
on civilian opponents. In addition, they applied a visa ban and
an asset freeze on seven Syrian ministers. The 27-nation EU
imposed an oil embargo on Syria in September that is set to
start on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
