Slovenia’s Kapitalska druzba d.d.
and Slovenska odskodninska druzba d.d. failed to find a buyer
for a 25 percent holding in Splosna Plovba d.o.o., the country’s
shipping company that is majority owned by  Germany ’s Peter
Doehle Schiffarts KG.  The two state-owned agencies, which were seeking bids in
excess of 60 million euros ($80 million), said today in an e-
mailed statement from Ljubljana that Slovenska odskodninska
druzba must sell its holding by the end of the year to finance
liabilities.  The agencies said they set up a sell option for the stake
in 2007, when Peter Doehle bought a 28.6 percent holding in
Splosna Plovba, based in the coastal town of Portoroz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
