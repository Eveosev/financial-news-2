The  Philadelphia Eagles  placed the
 National Football League ’s franchise tag on receiver DeSean Jackson before he could become a free agent this month.  Jackson, a Pro Bowl selection after the 2009 and 2010
seasons, caught 229 passes for 4,085 yards and 21 touchdowns in
his first four seasons. He also ran for three touchdowns and
scored another four on punt returns.  The franchise label slots a salary for one year into a
formula that takes into account the pay for other top players at
that position. NFL.com said a receiver with the franchise tag
this year will make about $9.4 million.  “We want DeSean to be an Eagle for the long haul and this
is a step in the right direction to accomplish that,” Eagles
General Manager Howie Roseman said in a news release. “DeSean
is a talented player and a proven playmaker in this league.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
