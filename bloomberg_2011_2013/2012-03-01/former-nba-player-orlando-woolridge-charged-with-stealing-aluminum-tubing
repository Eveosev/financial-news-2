Former  National Basketball
Association  forward Orlando Woolridge was arrested on charges of
stealing aluminum tubing from a drill site in Louisiana.  Woolridge, who played 13 seasons with seven teams after
being drafted by the  Chicago Bulls  in 1981, was arrested on a
charge of theft of more than $1,500, according to Patrick Cobbs,
chief deputy of the DeSoto Parish Sheriff’s Office in Mansfield,
Louisiana.  He was released after posting a $2,000 bond. Cobbs said in
a telephone interview that he didn’t know whether a court date
had been set or if Woolridge had retained a lawyer.  Cobbs said he wasn’t sure of the date of the arrest. The
Associated Press said Woolridge was taken into custody on Feb.
24.  The 52-year-old Woolridge averaged 16 points and 4.3
rebounds a game after being drafted by the Bulls out of the
University of  Notre Dame  with the sixth pick. He was suspended
during the 1987-88 NBA season for substance abuse.  Woolridge has coached in the Women’s NBA and the American
Basketball Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
