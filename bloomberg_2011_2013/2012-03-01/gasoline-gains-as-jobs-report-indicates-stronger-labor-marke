Gasoline rose to a nine-month high
as first-time jobless claims matched a four-year low from two
weeks ago, and as crude oil rose after the U.S. escalated
warnings to  Iran  about its nuclear program.  Futures surged 2.9 percent as applications for  unemployment
insurance  decreased 2,000 in the week ended Feb. 25 to 351,000,
Labor Department figures showed today. The Standard and Poor’s
500 stock index rose as much as 0.8 percent in New York. Brent
crude oil gained 2.9 percent in  London  to the highest level
since July 2008.  “We continue to have bullish economic data and the stock
market seems to be saying all is well,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of trading advisory company Cameronhanover.com in  New
Canaan , Connecticut. “And Iran is moving ominously in the
background, casting a shadow on the oil market.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 9.45 cents to settle at
$3.3517 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Prices extended gains after the 2:30 p.m. close of floor
trading in New York, touching $3.3868 as Brent jumped to a 10-
month high of $128.40 a barrel on a report of an oil pipeline
fire in Saudi Arabia.  Brent oil for April settlement climbed $3.54 to settle at
$126.20 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
Exchange.  “The fear factor is still out there and there’s a very
strong Brent market right now,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Obama administration officials are escalating warnings that
the U.S. could join Israel in attacking Iran if the Islamic
republic doesn’t dispel concerns that its nuclear-research
program is aimed at producing weapons.  Military Options  Four days before Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
is scheduled to arrive in Washington, Air Force Chief of Staff
General Norton Schwartz told reporters the Joint Chiefs of Staff
have prepared military options to strike Iranian nuclear sites
in the event of a conflict.  “Geopolitics is still the No. 1 driver of prices,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York . “Who knows how this upcoming meeting in
Washington is going to come out. There’s a lot of skittishness
in the market.”  April-delivery heating oil gained 6.94 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $3.2753 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.7
cent to $3.738 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices
have increased 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
