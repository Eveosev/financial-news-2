The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for jobless benefits fell to a level matching
a four-year low, more evidence the labor market is healing.  Applications for  unemployment insurance  decreased 2,000 in
the week ended Feb. 25 to 351,000, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast 355,000 claims, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of
people on unemployment benefit rolls fell, while those getting
extended payments also declined.  Firing is on a downward trend as employers gain confidence
in the outlook for economic growth. A smaller number of job
reductions also puts those companies in place to hire additional
employees as demand picks up.  “Firing is not holding back the labor market,” said  Ryan Sweet , a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West
Chester ,  Pennsylvania , who forecast 350,000 claims. “Businesses
recognize that they don’t need to lay off any more people. Down
the road, they’re going to realize they need to hire more
people.”  A separate report today from the Commerce Department showed
 consumer spending  rose less than forecast in January after
little change the previous month.  Incomes Increase  Purchases climbed 0.2 percent, while incomes increased 0.3
percent. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a 0.4 percent increase in spending and a 0.5
percent rise in incomes.  Stock-index futures held gains and Treasury yields rose
after the figures. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index expiring this month climbed 0.3 percent to 1,368.0 at 8:56
a.m. in  New York . The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed
to 2.05 percent from 1.97 percent late yesterday.  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 345,000 to
370,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 49 economists. The Labor
Department revised the prior week’s applications to 353,000 from
the initially reported 351,000.  The four-week  moving average , a less-volatile measure, fell
to 354,000, also the lowest since March 2008, from 359,500.  A Labor Department official today said there was “nothing
unusual” that affected today’s figures.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
fell by 2,000 in the week ended Feb. 18 to 3.4 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
16,800 to 3.38 million in the week ended Feb. 11.  States, Territories  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.7 percent in
the week ended Feb. 18, today’s report showed. Seven states and
territories reported an increase in claims, while 44 had a
decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Job creation  has strengthened, with the pace of payroll
growth picking up from October through January. Headcounts grew
by 243,000 workers in January, the most in nine months, and the
joblessness dropped to 8.3 percent, Labor Department data show.  Payrolls will increase 170,000 a month on average in 2012,
according to the results of a survey by the  National Association
for Business Economics  released Feb. 27. Last year, they rose an
average 152,000 each month.  Even so, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
“the job market remains far from normal” when spoke he to U.S.
House hearing on  Capitol Hill  yesterday. The elevated
unemployment rate and a subdued inflation outlook warrant a
highly accommodative stance for monetary policy, he said.  Among companies firing workers is Blizzard Entertainment,
maker of the online game “World of Warcraft,” which is cutting
about 600 jobs. About 90 percent of the firings will come from
departments not related to video-game development, the Irvine,
California-based company, a unit of Activision Blizzard Inc.,
said in statement on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
