Ghana ’s budget deficit last year was
lower than targeted as revenue and grants exceeded expectations,
according to the ministry of finance and economic planning.  The gap was 4.3 percent of gross domestic product against a
target of 5.1 percent, the ministry said on its website today.
Tax collection exceeded the target by 15 percent at 9.8 billion
cedis ($5.8 billion), while revenue and grants together totaled
12.9 billion cedis, compared with a target of 11.9 billion, the
Accra-based ministry said.  Government spending  in West Africa’s second biggest economy
after  Nigeria  was 13.4 billion cedis, lower than a target of
13.5 billion cedis, the ministry said.  Ghana’s economy grew a projected 13.6 percent last year and
may expand 9.4 percent this year, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said in November. The country is the world’s second-
biggest cocoa producer and it became West Africa’s newest oil
exporter in December 2010 after production started at the
Jubilee field.  Duffor said on Feb. 20 that Ghana will probably have a
budget deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP this year, compared with a
target of 4.8 percent in the 2012 budget.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
