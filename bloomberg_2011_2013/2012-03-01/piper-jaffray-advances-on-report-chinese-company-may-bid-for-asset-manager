Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC) , the investment
bank and asset manager founded in 1895, jumped the most in four
months after Mergermarket said the company may be sold to a
Chinese securities firm.  Piper Jaffray advanced 5 percent to $25.82 at 12:05 p.m. in
 New York  after rising as much as 9.8 percent earlier in the
session for its biggest gain since Oct. 27. The Minneapolis-
based firm is in exclusive discussions with the Chinese company,
according to Mergermarket, citing a person familiar with the
matter. The report didn’t name the bidder.  A deal could include a takeover, buying a  stake  or forming
a joint venture, Mergermarket said. Jennifer Olson-Goude, a
spokeswoman for Piper Jaffray, didn’t respond to messages
seeking comment.  Piper Jaffray reported a net loss last year of $102
million, or $6.51 per diluted common share, as revenue dropped
14 percent to $458 million. The firm, run by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Andrew S. Duff, 54, cited lower  investment
banking  and institutional brokerage revenue.  The stock dropped 39 percent in 12 months through
yesterday’s close, leaving the firm with a market value of about
$490 million and trading for about 83 percent of tangible book
value. Piper Jaffray employed 1,011 people at the end of last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
