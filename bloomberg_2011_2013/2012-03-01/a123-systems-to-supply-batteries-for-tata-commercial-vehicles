A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)  rose after the
maker of batteries for electric cars and trucks said it will
supply packs for  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ’s commercial vehicles.  The  shares  climbed 5.6 percent to $1.90 at the close in  New
York  for their biggest daily advance since Feb. 10. They have
gained 18 percent this year, after falling 83 percent in 2011.  Tata,  India ’s largest automaker, will use the lithium-ion
battery packs on hybrid diesel-electric city transit buses in
the second half of the year, Waltham, Massachusetts-based A123
said in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “The addition of Tata Motors to our growing portfolio of
blue-chip customers reinforces our position as the leading
provider of lithium-ion battery technology for the truck and bus
segment,” Jason Forcier, vice president of A123’s automotive
group, said in the statement.  A123 supplies batteries for automakers such as Fisker
Automotive Inc.,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Daimler AG. Fisker,
A123’s largest customer, said Feb. 6 that it stopped working on
its Wilmington, Delaware, plant after the U.S. Energy Department
blocked access to a federal loan, citing unmet milestones.  Fisker said Feb. 28 it hired Tom LaSorda, a past president
of the predecessor of Chrysler Group LLC, as chief executive
officer. Fisker also said it may look for private investors to
revive the Delaware factory, where it planned to begin making
its second model, the Nina sedan, by next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
