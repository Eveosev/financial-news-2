Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
chose not to receive a salary when he took the position as head
of  Greece ’s interim government on Nov. 11,  Ta Nea  reported,
without citing anyone.  Papademos made the decision not to take a salary because he
was sensitive to the difficulties facing the Greek people, the
Athens-based newspaper said. The subject came up after Papademos
was questioned by journalists in Brussels yesterday, the
newspaper said.  The Prime Minister’s Athens office couldn’t confirm if
Papademos was receiving a salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
