Tata Communications Ltd. (TCOM)  is
considering a bid for  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/) , the fiber-
network operator that is also being evaluated by  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD) , a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The Mumbai-based company is holding discussions with banks
as it seeks to arrange a loan for the transaction, and has hired
Standard Chartered Plc to advise it on the potential purchase,
the person, asking not to be identified because the information
is private. Cable & Wireless has a market value of 765 million
pounds ($1.2 billion).  Cable & Wireless, which has replaced two chief executive
officers since June, has assets ranging from the largest British
core fiber network to an overseas enterprise unit. Vodafone,
 Europe ’s largest mobile-phone operator, said on Feb. 13 that it
was in early stages of evaluating an offer for London-based
Cable & Wireless.  The Times of India reported Tata Communications’s interest
in Cable & Wireless earlier today, citing an unidentified
person. Debasis Ray, a Tata Group spokesman, and Arijit De at
Standard Chartered declined to comment.  Cable & Wireless has surged 41 percent since the close of
trading before Vodafone disclosed its interest. The company’s
business in Europe would complement Tata Communications’s
operations in emerging markets including South Africa, the
Middle East and Asia, the person said.  The two companies in 2005 signed an agreement through which
Tata offers Cable & Wireless services to  Indian corporate 
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
