The ruble depreciated the most in
two weeks as Russia’s monthly tax period ended and amid
speculation the central bank is buying other currencies to stem
the ruble’s gains.  The ruble lost 0.7 percent to 29.2705 per dollar at the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest fall since Feb. 16. The
Russian currency was 0.4 percent stronger at 38.99 against the
euro and was little changed at 33.6443 versus the central bank’s
dollar-euro target basket.  The end of the tax period eased demand for rubles from
exporters looking to convert revenue from abroad to pay the
government. That reduced pressure on interbank rates and the
three-month  MosPrime (MOSKON)  rate banks say they charge to lend to each
other dropped 24 basis points to 6.54 percent.  “At the end of the month banks needed more liquidity in
rubles,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign exchange at
Otkritie Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Don’t forget the
central bank’s interventions, which are $250 million a day.”  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The central bank may be
buying as much as $250 million a day in foreign currencies to
slow the ruble’s advance after it passed 33.87 against the
basket Feb. 24, according to VTB Capital’s estimates.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the Russian currency at
29.6302 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 29.679 per dollar yesterday. The yield on  Russia ’s $3.5
billion of bonds due 2020 dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 3.95 percent, the lowest since they first
traded in April 2010.  The yield on dollar-denominated bonds due 2015 dropped 20
basis points to 2.337 percent. Eurobonds maturing the same year
issued by OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded 15
basis points less than yesterday at 3.567 percent, while the
yield on similar-maturity bonds from state gas monopoly OAO
Gazprom fell 17 basis points to 3.498 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
