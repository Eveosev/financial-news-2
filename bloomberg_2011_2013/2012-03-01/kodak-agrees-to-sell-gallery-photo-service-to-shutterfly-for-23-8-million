Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) , the photography
pioneer reorganizing in bankruptcy, agreed to sell its on-line
photo services to Shutterfly for $23.8 million.  Accounts of Kodak Gallery’s 75 million users in the U.S.
and Canada would be transferred to Shutterfly under the
agreement, which is subject to competing bids at an auction,
Kodak said in a statement today. Kodak Gallery allows users to
upload photos, organize galleries, order prints or photobooks,
and share pictures.  “This sale is consistent with our objective of focusing
Kodak on a core set of businesses,” Pradeep Jotwani, Kodak’s
president of consumer businesses and chief marketing officer,
said in the statement. The company said it will seek approval of
an auction procedure by late March.  Kodak will give customers who don’t want their photos
transferred the opportunity to opt out, according to the
statement. Those customers would retrieve their photos through
free downloads or by buying DVDs from Kodak Gallery.  Shutterfly, based in  Redwood City , California, and founded
in 1999, offers similar photo-related services and products such
as prints and galleries. Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, is
focusing its consumer business on retail and home printing
products, according to the statement.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S.
