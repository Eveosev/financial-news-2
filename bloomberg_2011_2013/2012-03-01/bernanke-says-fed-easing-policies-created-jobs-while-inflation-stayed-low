Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  defended the central bank’s easing policies at a Senate
hearing, saying they have helped to create jobs even as
inflation remained subdued.  “If you look back at so-called QE2 in November 2010, the
concerns at the time were that it would be highly inflationary
and hurt the dollar and not have much of an effect on growth,”
he said today in  Washington . “Looking back, I think those
actions played a constructive role.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
