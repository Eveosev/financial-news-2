Audi AG (NSU) , the world’s second-largest
maker of  luxury vehicles , is targeting 2012 profit “on par”
with last year’s record results as higher sales offset increased
spending on new models and factories.  Operating profit surged 60 percent to 5.35 billion euros
($7.14 billion) last year from 3.34 billion euros in 2010, the
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  brand said today in Ingolstadt,  Germany . Revenue
rose 24 percent to 44.1 billion euros, boosted by a 37 percent
gain in deliveries in  China , its largest market.  “For 2012 as a whole, we plan to achieve an operating
profit that will be on a par with the record year of 2011,
despite higher expenses,” Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek
said in a speech. The target depends on the economic environment
“not changing significantly.”  Audi’s earnings underscored its status as the number-two in
luxury car sales after passing  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in
deliveries last year. The VW unit, which has a goal of
overtaking leader  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  by 2015, posted a
profit margin of 12.1 percent, outpacing the 9 percent return on
sales at Mercedes.  “The outlook is comparable with Mercedes, but Audi has the
greater chance of beating that with higher earnings,” said
 Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler.
“Last year was certainly a top result.”  Shares Advance  Volkswagen  rose  as much as 2.40 euros, or 1.7 percent, to
142.75 euros and was up 1.5 percent as of 12:21 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The stock has gained 23 percent this year,
valuing the German carmaker at 62.3 billion euros.  To fuel its expansion, Audi plans to spend a record 13
billion euros over the next five years to develop new models and
increase production capacity, including expanding a factory in
 Hungary  and building a new plant in China. The company will make
a decision on where and when to set up a U.S. factory by this
summer, Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler said today.  This year, Audi plans to grow faster than the 4 percent
expansion of the global auto market, boosted by 18 vehicle
introductions, including a new generation of the A3 hatchback
and a four-door version of the A1 subcompact. Sales in China and
the U.S. will probably grow at double-digit percentage rates
this year, Stadler said.  To continue growth in China, Audi aims to extend its reach
to smaller cities by nearly doubling the number of sales outlets
there by 2013, sales chief  Peter Schwarzenbauer  said.  Audi sold more than 200,000 vehicles worldwide in the first
two months of 2012, an 8 percent increase from the previous
year, Stadler said, adding that carmaker will likely achieve its
goal to sell 1.5 million cars annually before its target in
2015.  Delivery times currently average about four months,
according to Schwarzenbauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
