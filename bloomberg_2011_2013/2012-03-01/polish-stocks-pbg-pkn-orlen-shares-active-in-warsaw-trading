Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained 0.2
percent to 2,320.89 at the close in Warsaw, the highest in more
than a week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PBG SA (PBG)   fell 2.2 percent to 62.75 zloty, the lowest
this week, after fourth-quarter profit at Poland’s third-largest
builder missed analysts’ estimates. PBG’s negative cash flow
from operations in the period “raised concern” about the
company’s debt financing, according to Robert Maj, an analyst at
KBC Securities NV in Warsaw.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)   dropped 0.5 percent to 35.33 zloty
after Poland’s largest oil refiner was rated a “new sell” at
UBS AG. UBS said the refiner’s valuation was “unattractive” in
the context of its “limited earnings momentum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
