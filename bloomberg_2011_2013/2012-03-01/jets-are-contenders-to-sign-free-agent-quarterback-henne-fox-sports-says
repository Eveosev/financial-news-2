The  New York Jets  are contenders to
add former Miami Dolphins quarterback Chad Henne to push current
starter  Mark Sanchez ,  Fox Sports said  without citing where it
received the information.  The Dolphins won’t make a contract offer to Henne when he
becomes a free agent on March 13, the  Florida Sun-Sentinel  said
last month. Henne, 26, was a second-round draft pick of the
Dolphins in 2008 and had a 13-18 record as a starter.  Henne, who lost all four of his starts last season before
being replaced by Matt Moore, would be reunited in New York with
former Dolphins coach Tony Sparano, who was hired as the Jets’
offensive coordinator in January.  Fox Sports said  Henne has emerged as the top candidate for
teams seeking a quarterback to compete and push their current
starter without being paid like a first-stringer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
