India ’s government filed a petition
with the  Supreme Court  seeking a review of its order to cancel
permits to run telephone services, Rakesh Sharma, a registry
official at the top court, said.  The Supreme Court Feb. 2 canceled 122 licenses, issued in
2008, in response to petitions from non-government organizations
and individuals questioning the validity of the  award which
sparked the nation’s biggest corruption investigation.  The court canceled permits held by companies including  Idea
Cellular Ltd. (IDEA) , Unitech Wireless Pvt., Etisalat DB Telecom Pvt.,
Loop Telecom Ltd., Videocon Telecommunications, Sistema Shyam
Teleservices Ltd. and S Tel Ltd. The court said Feb. 2 that the
companies may continue with their operations for four months.  -- With assistance from Malavika Sharma in  New Delhi .
