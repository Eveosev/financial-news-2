Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden, speaking after a meeting with euro-region counterparts
in Brussels, called the “overall assessment” on  Greece ’s
recent consolidation efforts “very positive.”  “Today was not a time for negotiations, today we just
wanted to see if Greece has implemented what we decided in
recent weeks,” Frieden told reporters. “Maybe some details
need to be verified by officials. But generally, the finance
ministers are of the opinion that Greece has done what was
expected of them so that the next steps can be taken.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
