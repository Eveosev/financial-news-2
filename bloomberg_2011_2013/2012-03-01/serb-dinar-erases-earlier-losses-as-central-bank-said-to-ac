The dinar erased earlier losses as
the central bank started selling euros after the Serbian
currency fell past 111 to the euro, three currency traders said.  The central bank started today’s market action after the
dinar dropped 0.5 percent to 111.3839 at 2:16 p.m. in Belgrade,
said the traders who didn’t want to be identified, in line with
bank policy.  The dinar was trading between 110.60 and 110.80 to the euro
after several rounds of selling, they said.  The National Bank of  Serbia  sold 188.5 million euros
($250.9 million) to banks in February to slow declines in the
dinar, triggered by concerns the government’s spending policies
are not in line with pledges initially made to the  International
Monetary Fund  under a $1.3 billion precautionary loan program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
