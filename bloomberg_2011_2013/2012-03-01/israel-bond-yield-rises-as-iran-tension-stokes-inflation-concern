Israel ’s benchmarks bonds fell,
pushing yields to the highest in more than two months, on
concern that tension between Iran and the West may boost energy
costs and fuel inflationary pressures.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January
2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.68
percent, the highest since Dec. 14, at 11:48 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .
The one-year break-even rate, the yield difference between the
inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government bonds of similar
maturity, fell four basis points to 273, implying an average
annual inflation rate of 2.73 percent. The index jumped 69 basis
points last month.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  will meet with
U.S. President Barack Obama next week to discuss  Iran ’s possible
pursuit of nuclear weapons. Israel raised the price of gasoline
for March by 5.1 percent, according to a Ministry of Energy and
Water Resources statement yesterday, following a 3.2 percent
gain last month.  “The mounting threat of Iran and the risk of increasing
oil prices is fueling inflation expectations,” said Gil Chen ,
a bond trader at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in
Tel Aviv. “Investors are shortening positions selling long-term
bonds to reduce risk exposure.”  Brent crude , benchmark for more than half the world’s oil,
rose 0.5 percent to $123.28 a barrel today, having climbed to a
10-month high on Feb. 24. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2 percent today
to $107.28 a barrel.  Inflation Accelerates  Consumer prices climbed an annual 2 percent in January,
beating the median 1.9 percent estimate of economists. Inflation
may reach 2.4 percent in the next 12 months, according to a
survey of economists released by the  Bank of Israel  on Feb. 19.
Accelerating inflation erodes the value of fixed-income
securities.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, gained two basis points
to 2.49 percent. The central bank’s monetary committee, led by
Governor  Stanley Fischer , left the benchmark lending rate for
March unchanged at 2.5 percent last month.  The  Tel-Bond 40 (TEL-B40)  index of corporate bonds was little changed
at 263.90. The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.7792 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
