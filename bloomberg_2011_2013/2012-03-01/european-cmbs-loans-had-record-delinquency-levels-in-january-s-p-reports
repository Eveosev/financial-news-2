Only 13 of 51 loans linked to
European commercial-mortgage backed securities were repaid when
they came due in January, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  “Record numbers of loans” entered the ratings company’s
delinquencies index during the month, S&P said today in its
February CMBS Bulletin. It has had 102 loans on the index,
through January compared with 63 a year earlier.  Less than 19 percent of loans by value were paid back when
they matured in January, a total 700 million euros ($933
million) of the 3.7 billion euros due. The value of unpaid loans
this year could be as high as 10 billion euros based on the
January delinquencies, the New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill
Cos said.  The small number of loans repaid in January “can only
compound the competition for finance that borrowers of newly
maturing loans will face in 2013, when they will be seeking 24.3
billion euros to meet their maturity obligations,” S&P said.  Seventeen CMBS loans went into special servicing in
January, almost 50 percent more than the previous monthly record
of 12 set in April 2011. Its special servicing index has 132
loans through January, compared with 81 at the same time last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
