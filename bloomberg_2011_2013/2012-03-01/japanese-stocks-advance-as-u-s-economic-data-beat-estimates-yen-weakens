     March 1 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  dropping for a second day, as the yen trimmed yesterday’s
decline, dimming the prospects for exporters, and on speculation
the market was overbought.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets 28 percent of its sales in
 North America , slid 0.6 percent as the yen rose.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
maker of construction machinery that counts  China  as its biggest
market, slid 2.8 percent on speculation a rise in mainland
manufacturing will reduce the need for further monetary easing.
 Softbank Corp. (9984)  led communications stocks higher after the
government awarded the mobile carrier a spectrum license to
expand its data capacity.  The  Topix Index (TPX)  lost 0.5 percent to 831.54 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo after rising as much as 1.2 percent
earlier today. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to
9,707.37. The gauge gained 10.5 percent in February, its biggest
monthly advance since December 2009.  “The yen is driving down equities this afternoon,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “Investors have been sensitive about
overheating in the market and they are selling to lock in
profits after the market digested major factors.”  Technical Indicators  The  14-day relative strength index  for the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  was
about 81 today, above the 70 level that some traders say signal
an asset may be overbought. The 25-day Toraku index, which
compares the number of advancing and declining shares on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, was 128.9 yesterday. A reading above 120
indicates a drop may be likely.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gave no indication of
further stimulus measures.  Japanese stocks rose earlier after data showed the  U.S.
economy  expanded more than forecast and business activity
accelerated, boosting the dollar. Shares also advanced after
Japanese companies unexpectedly increased domestic investment by
the most in almost five years.  ‘Fundamental Change’  “Investors see there’s less risk around, and they are
prepared to put more money back in,” said  Angus Gluskie , who
oversees more than $350 million at White Funds Management in
Sydney. “We might have to stop and think about an environment
where the  U.S. dollar  is rising and where  interest rates  in the
U.S. start to rise. That’s such a fundamental change.”  Shares reversed gains as the dollar fell 0.3 percent to
80.90 yen today after rising 0.9 percent yesterday. A weaker
dollar cuts the value of overseas earnings for some Japanese
companies.  Toyota fell 0.6 percent to 3,335 yen after climbing 2.2
percent.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , an electronics company that generates
10 percent of its sales in the U.S., lost 0.9 percent to 752 yen
after gaining 2.1 percent earlier in the day.  Komatsu slid 2.8 percent to 2,354 yen after China’s 
purchasing managers’ index  rose to 51.0 from 50.5 in January,
the third month of gains, according to the nation’s statistics
bureau.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , a machinery maker
that generates 26 percent of its sales in China, lost 1.2
percent to 1,678 yen.  Softbank Rises  Among stocks that advanced, Softbank rose 2 percent to
2,469 yen. Shares of  Japan ’s No. 3 mobile-phone carrier rose
after the Communications Ministry awarded it a new spectrum
license that will help it compete in data delivery. Larger rival
 NTT DoComo Inc. (9437)  added 0.5 percent to 139,500 yen, while  KDDI
Corp. (9433)  gained 1.2 percent to 522,000 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  has gained 18 percent from its Nov. 24 low as
monetary easing in  Europe , China and Japan fueled optimism the
global economy will avert a slowdown. The advance pushed the
value of stocks on the measure to 1.21 times book value, up from
1.03 in November. A number below one means companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4.2 percent to 24.37,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  (6665 JT) was unchanged at 7 yen after
plummeting 97 percent yesterday. The chipmaker filed for
bankruptcy on Feb. 27 with debts of 448 billion yen ($5.5
billion), according to a filing with the  finance ministry .  Shindengen Electric Manufacturing Co. (6844)  (6844 JT), a maker of
electric devices, slid 5 percent to 364 yen after cutting its
net-income forecast by 67 percent to 1.1 billion yen for the
year ending March 31, the company said in a filing, citing
waning global demand for chips.  TDK Corp. (6762)  (6762 JT) climbed 0.6 percent to 4,265 yen after
the electronic parts maker said it repurchased 2.4 percent of
its outstanding shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
