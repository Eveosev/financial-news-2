Simple Minds is going back to its
origins more than three decades ago.  The Scottish band will play five songs from each of its
earliest albums at  London ’s Roundhouse. Jim Kerr’s group debuted
with the underrated “Life in a Day” in 1979, and only became
worldwide stars of stadium rock after the release of the fifth
LP, “New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84).”  Fans will be treated to rare live outings of the tunes that
led up to “Glittering Prize” and “Promised You a Miracle.”  At the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, London NW1 8EH.

“Shame” has aimed his camera at another  New York  subject.  In “Static” (2009), Steve McQueen -- seated in a chopper
-- shoots the Statue of Liberty from the front, back and side,
highlighting her yellowing armpit. The towering icon is part of
 Tate Britain’s  “Migrations” exhibition: about how outsiders,
broadly defined, influenced British art.  Also in the video section (the show’s strongest segment) is
“Floating Coffins” (2009) by Zineb Sedira. It’s a stark vision
of ship carcasses drifting in a Mauritanian port which is the
point of departure for many illegal immigrants.  The exhibition’s definition of migrants stretches, somewhat
tenuously, to include Canaletto, who lived in  England  for nine
years, and Mondrian, who stopped over from 1938 to 1940 before
heading for New York.  “Migrations” is at Tate Britain through Aug. 12.

television series “Scrubs” -- can write, too.  His play “All New People” (which just opened in London)
is about a 35-year-old named Charlie who’s about to hang himself
in a New Jersey beach house when a string of visitors intrude.  The intruders could not be more different. One is a chatty
British illegal alien who works as a realtor on the sly. Another
is a pot-smoking fireman with a past career in education. The
third is a $15,000-a-night blond escort who complains that her
clients all look like Soviet ex-leader  Mikhail Gorbachev .  After a flat start, the play lifts off with the arrival of
Kim the New York escort (the excellent Susannah Fielding), who
turns a suicide setting into a source of uninterrupted laughter.  Braff -- who plays Charlie -- can act, too. “All New
People” is at the Duke of York’s Theatre. Information:

before or after the Duke of York’s. It’s inspired by the cafes
and street stalls of Mumbai in the early 20th century. The
flavors are authentic and the prices low. Information:

announced that she would take a sabbatical in 2015 to learn yoga
and Russian and maybe even go to clown school.  Catch her while you still can at the intimate Wigmore Hall
on Sunday, where she sings a Gallic repertoire that includes
Debussy and Faure.  Information:  http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk  or call
+44-20-7935-2141.  Alternatively, you can hear the Russian pianist Evgeny 
Kissin play Beethoven and Chopin at the Barbican Centre Friday 
night:  http://www.barbican.org.uk .  L’Autre Pied, near Wigmore Hall, is an informal restaurant
serving serious food. It’s a shame the pre-theater menu isn’t
served at weekends. The a la carte prices for the
establishment’s modern seasonal dishes now reflect the fact that
it holds a Michelin star. Information:
