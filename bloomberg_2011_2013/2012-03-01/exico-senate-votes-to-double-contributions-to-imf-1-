Mexico’s Senate passed a bill today
that more than doubles the nation’s contributions to the
 International Monetary Fund .  With 71 votes in favor, 10 against and 1 abstention,
senators approved the initiative to increase Mexico’s
contribution by 146 percent to about $14 billion. The bill will
now go to Mexico’s lower house.  ”The quota increase gives Mexico more influence to make
decisions on the board of the International Monetary Fund,”
according to a document published today in the  parliamentary
gazette.   The higher contribution follows changes in quotas agreed to
by IMF governors in 2010.  The Washington-based IMF has also been seeking $600 billion
from its members to be able to allow an increase in lending
resources of $500 billion, to protect the world from
consequences of the European debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
