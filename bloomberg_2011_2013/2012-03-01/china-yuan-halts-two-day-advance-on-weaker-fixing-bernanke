The yuan snapped a two-day gain as
the central bank weakened the daily fixing by the most in six
weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  failed to
signal new measures to stimulate the world’s largest economy.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.15
percent weaker at 6.3016 per dollar, retreating from a record.
The  Dollar Index (DXY)  gained as Bernanke affirmed yesterday interest
rates are likely to stay low at least through late 2014 without
offering any indication that further monetary easing is under
consideration. A government-backed report showed China’s
manufacturing improved for a third straight month.  “The fixing reflects a rebound in the greenback as another
round of quantitative easing looks unlikely now,” said Kenix Lai, a currency analyst at  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  in Hong Kong.
“China’s manufacturing data should be good news but investors
might want to look for another month of data to confirm the
recovery trend.”  The yuan fell 0.1 percent, the most since Feb. 6, to close
at 6.3002 per dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5
percent either side of the reference rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.03
percent to 6.2975. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
declined 0.06 percent to 6.2868, a 0.2 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose to 51.0 from 50.5
in January, official data showed today. The reading compares
with the median 50.9 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 24
economists. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  The PBOC reiterated it will improve the yuan exchange rate
mechanism and steadily promote yuan capital account
convertibility this year, according to a statement posted on its
website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
