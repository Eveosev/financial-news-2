The euro region’s temporary
financial backstop, the European Financial Stability Facility,
could be allowed to run “a few months longer than planned,”
 Volker Kauder , the parliamentary chief of  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian Christian
Social Union sister party, told  Die Welt .  There is no reason now to discuss an increase of the 500
billion-euro ($667 billion) ceiling for the European Stability
Mechanism, the backstop’s permanent successor from the middle of
the year, Kauder said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
