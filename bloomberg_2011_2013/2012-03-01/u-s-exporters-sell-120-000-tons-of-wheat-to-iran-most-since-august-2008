U.S. exporters sold the most wheat
to  Iran  in more than three years, the government said, raising
speculation that the Persian Gulf country may be boosting
stockpiles after production from last year’s crop declined.  The sale of 120,000 metric tons of hard, red winter wheat
is for delivery in the marketing year that ends May 31, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in an e-mailed statement.
The sale was the biggest since Iran  purchased  689,310 tons in a
deal announced on Aug. 15, 2008. The U.S. hasn’t exported any
wheat to Iran since a 54,267-ton shipment was sent in November
2009, USDA data show.  Iran’s production of wheat, the country’s biggest crop,
fell to 13.75 million tons in 2011, 13 percent less than a year
earlier, the USDA estimates. While Iran is facing international
sanctions over its nuclear program, U.S.  restrictions  provide
exemptions for “licensed exports of agricultural commodities,”
according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a division of
the Treasury Department.  “If Iran is concerned about commerce or shipping, any of
those kinds of things, as a result of sanctions or something
worse coming about, having adequate stockpiles of food in the
country may be an appropriate thing to do,” Vince Peterson, a
vice president of overseas operations for U.S. Wheat Associates,
a trade group focusing on developing export markets, said.  Oil Rises  The U.S. and  Europe  are moving to block Iranian oil sales
and transactions with its central bank. The U.S. and  Israel  say
they haven’t ruled out using force to stop Iran from obtaining
nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic says its atomic program is
peaceful and legitimate under international agreements. Iran
holds parliamentary elections tomorrow.  Crude-oil futures for April delivery rose 1.7 percent to
$108.84 a barrel at 2:29 p.m. today on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , up 11 percent this year. Wheat futures slid 0.6
percent to $6.64 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
climbing as much as 0.7 percent.  Iran may have purchased as much as 2 million tons of wheat
in the past month from international suppliers, Peterson said by
telephone from Arlington, Virginia. Arkady Zlochevsky, the
president of  Russia ’s Grain Union, said Feb. 22 that the country
may deliver 1 million tons of grain to Iran. Industry officials
in  India  also have discussed selling wheat to Iran, the Wall
Street Journal reported Feb. 28, citing unnamed sources.  The U.S. exported $53.035 million in agricultural products
to Iran last year, the least since 2006, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
