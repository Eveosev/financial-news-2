European Union leaders are planning
to sign an agreement at a summit starting today that “waters
down” the sanctions process against countries that breach
fiscal rules,  Welt said , citing the agreement.  The agreement states that only countries have the right to
file a suit and not independent institutions such as the
European Union Commission, the German newspaper reported. The
country that holds the European Council presidency as well as
its predecessor and successor are supposed to sue, Welt said.  While the rules stipulate which countries are supposed to
take debt violators to court, there are various exemptions from
the obligation, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
