Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) , a German
maker of generic drugs, said profit slipped 68 percent last year
because of one-time charges related to unpaid bills in  Serbia .  Net income retreated to 22 million euros ($29.3 million)
from 68.4 million euros in 2010, the company, based in Bad
Vilbel,  Germany , said in a statement today. Adjusted net income
climbed 10 percent to 146.6 million euros, it said. Adjusted
earnings per share reached 2.49 euros, more than the 2.35-euro
average of 18 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite difficult framework conditions in individual
national markets, particularly in Serbia and Germany, all
operational key earnings figures are expected to have
increased” in 2011, Stada said.  The German drug maker acquired Serbia’s Hemofarm Koncern AD
for 480 million euros in 2006, as part of a push to shift
manufacturing capacity as well as sales into eastern  Europe . In
November last year, the company announced a 96.9 million-euro
writedown before taxes during the third quarter for unpaid bills
from its Serbian business.  The company said today the “challenging framework
conditions” will probably continue in some markets this year.
Stada said it expects a “clear increase” in full-year sales,
helped by acquisitions, including the purchase of a branded
product portfolio from Gruenenthal GmbH over the past months.  The shares gained as much as 1.3 percent after the
announcement, erasing an earlier decline in Frankfurt trading.
The stock was up 0.2 percent to 23.02 euros at 1:43 p.m.  Stada proposed an unchanged dividend of 37 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
