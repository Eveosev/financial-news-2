Euro-region manufacturing output
contracted for a seventh month in February as the euro-area
economy struggles to rebound from a contraction in the fourth
quarter.  A  manufacturing gauge  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region rose to 49, a six-month
high, from 48.8 in January, London-based Markit Economics said
today. Thatâ€™s in line with a preliminary estimate on Feb. 22. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Manufacturers may see waning sales growth as euro-region
governments toughen spending cuts just as global demand weakens.
Euro-region unemployment may have held at 10.4 percent in
January, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
