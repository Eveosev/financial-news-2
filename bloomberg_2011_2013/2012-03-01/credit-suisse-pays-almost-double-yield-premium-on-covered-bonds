Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is paying
almost double the yield premium to issue $2 billion of covered
bonds than Switzerland’s second-biggest bank did less than a
year ago.  The three-year notes were priced to yield 105 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a banker
involved in the transaction. That compares with a spread of 60
basis points when the Zurich-based lender sold $1 billion of
five-year covered bonds in May.  “If you issue in dollars, you have to compete against the
Canadian players as well as the Australian and New Zealand
ones,” said Leef Dierks, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in
 London . “And as they have been rather active already, you have
to play by their rules.”  Banks issued $8.5 billion of dollar-denominated covered
bonds this year, taking the total to $141 billion in all
currencies, mostly euros. The notes, backed by mortgages or
public-sector loans and guaranteed by the issuer, allow lenders
to raise funds more cheaply than in the unsecured  debt market .  UBS AG (UBSN)  was the last European bank to issue covered bonds in
dollars, according to UniCredit SpA data. Switzerland’s biggest
bank, also Zurich-based, issued $1.5 billion in three-year
covered bonds on Jan. 19, priced to yield 135 basis points more
than swaps.  Marc Dosch , spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment citing company policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
