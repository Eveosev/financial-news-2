Hibbett (HIBB)  Sports Inc., a chain of
sporting goods stores dotting much of the Southeast, rose the
most since Nov. 28 as unseasonably warm winter weather sparked
more outside activity and spring shopping.  Hibbett closed at $50.96, up 4.1 percent in Nasdaq trading,
after earlier rising as much as 5.7 percent. The shares have
gained 13 percent this year, pushing the Birmingham, Alabama-
based retailer to the highest price since its 1996 public
offering. The company reports fourth quarter earnings March 9.  Sales a year ago were less than analysts expected after
cold, rainy weather kept some customers at home, Christopher Svezia, senior analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group LLC in
 New York , said today in a telephone interview. Milder
temperatures in the South may have boosted demand for athletic
shoes and gear, he said.  “Between the potential for upside in the fourth quarter
and strength in the industry, Hibbett is hitting their stride,”
Svezia said.  Warm weather boosted several U.S. retailers including  Gap (GPS) 
Inc. and  Target (TGT)  Inc., which both reported February same-store
sales gains that topped analysts’ estimates. Sales at Gap, the
largest U.S. apparel chain, climbed 4 percent, beating the
average projection for a 1.4 percent drop from analysts surveyed
by Retail Metrics Inc. Target, the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer, posted a 7 percent same-store sales gain, topping the
5 percent estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
