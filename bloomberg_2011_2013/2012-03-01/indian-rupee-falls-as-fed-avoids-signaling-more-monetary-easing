India’s rupee weakened, snapping a
two-day gain, after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from signaling
more monetary easing.  Funds pumped into the  U.S. economy  have filtered through to
Asia where  interest rates  are higher, with Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke reiterating yesterday that borrowing costs will
probably stay low through late 2014. Foreign investors added $5
billion to holdings of Indian stocks last month through Feb. 28,
exchange data show, the most since October 2010.  “Bernanke failed to offer an indication of further easing,
boosting the dollar,” Pramit Brahmbhatt, chief executive
officer of Alpari’s India unit in Mumbai, wrote in an e-mail
today.  The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 49.22 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
strengthened 0.9 percent last month, extending January’s record
7.3 percent advance.  Three-month offshore non-deliverable forward contracts
traded at 50.28 a dollar, compared with 50.06 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
