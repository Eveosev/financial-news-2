The National Gallery in London said
it purchased Titian’s “Diana and Callisto” jointly with the
National Galleries of  Scotland  for 45 million pounds ($71.7
million), ensuring the painting stays on public display.  The painting’s owner, the Duke of Sutherland, knocked the
price down by 5 million pounds, allowing the purchase to take
place with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund,
and other donors, the galleries said today in a joint release.  Another Titian -- “Diana and Actaeon” -- had been bought
from the Duke in 2009 by the two museums for 50 million pounds.
At the time, they had been given the option of purchasing the
second Titian for a similar amount by 2012.  “For more than a hundred years, these two great paintings
by Titian have been regarded as pre-eminent among the
masterpieces in private hands in the U.K.,” said National
Gallery Director Nicholas Penny. “We have been able to secure
both of them for the public.”  More than half of the price tag -- or 25 million pounds --
came from the National Gallery’s charitable reserves, mainly
from legacies to the gallery over the years.  The Heritage Lottery Fund gave 3 million pounds, and the
Art Fund, 2 million pounds.  “Diana and Callisto” will be on display at the National
Gallery in  London  for the next 18 months.  To contact the writer on the story:
