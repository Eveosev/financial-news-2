Enterprise Group Ltd. (EGL)  of Ghana, the
West African nation’s second-biggest insurer by market value,
said profit for the year through December 2011 more than doubled
as net premium income increased 45 percent.  Net income climbed to 17.5 million cedis ($10.3 million)
from 8.4 million cedis the year before, while net premium income
rose to 79.6 million cedis from 54.9 million cedis, it said in a
statement published in the Ghanaian Times newspaper today.  The results show the benefits the company derived from
merging with two other units in a reorganization two years ago,
said Derrick Mensah, a research analyst at Accra-based SIC
Financial Services Ltd. Enterprise Insurance Company Ltd., which
was listed on the  Ghana  Stock Exchange, merged with a life and a
real-estate business to become Enterprise Group Ltd in August
2010.  The company’s shares were unchanged at 35 pesewas at 12:19
p.m. in Accra, the capital.  The results could prompt demand for the stock and “it
should not be a surprise if the price touches 45 pesewas this
year,” Mensah said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
