Montenegro may turn to the
 International Monetary Fund  to improve its fiscal policies amid
slowing economic growth, the country’s  central bank  said after
the governor met with an IMF delegation.  “Representatives of the Fund expressed readiness that,
should Montenegro make a request for an arrangement, they can
start negotiations in a very short time,” the Podgorica-based
central bank said in an e-mailed statement today after the talks
with Governor Radoje Zugic. It also noted “deterioration of the
economic situation” in the country and among its key trading
partners.  The IMF advised that Montenegro “needs a protective fund,
fiscal reserves, to increase credibility of its policies,” the
central bank said. The smallest of the six former Yugoslav
republics unilaterally adopted the euro in 2002, so its
“instruments of monetary policies are limited,” according to
the statement.  The 14-day IMF visit that began last week is looking into
Montenegro’s macroeconomic and fiscal stability, banks and debt
stock, the  Finance Ministry  said last week.  Montenegro’s economy grew 2.5 percent last year to 3.27
billion euros ($4.33 billion), even as industrial production
fell 10.3 percent. Its budget gap was 143 million euros, or 4.37
percent of gross domestic product, while public debt rose 16.75
percent to 1.48 billion euros, or 45.3 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
