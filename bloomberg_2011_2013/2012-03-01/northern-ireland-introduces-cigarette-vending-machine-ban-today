Northern Ireland , one of four
countries within the U.K., will today introduce a ban on
cigarette vending machines across the region.  The measure, being overseen by Health Minister Edwin Poots,
was agreed by the 108-seat assembly as part of a plan to drive
down the number of young people smoking, according to an e-
mailed statement from the assembly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
