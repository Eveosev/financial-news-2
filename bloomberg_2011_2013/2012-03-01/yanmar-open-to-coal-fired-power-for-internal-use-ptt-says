Myanmar is open to using coal-fired
power for a planned $8.6 billion industrial zone in Dawei as
long as the electricity is used for domestic needs only, said
Pailin Chuchottaworn, chief executive officer of  PTT Pcl. (PTT)   PTT,  Thailand ’s biggest energy company, had planned to
invest in a coal plant in Dawei that would export power to
Thailand before Myanmar’s government scrapped the 4,000-megawatt
project earlier this year, Pailin said. The plant was in
original plans by  Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD)  for a deep-sea
port and business park in the Indian Ocean town.  Myanmar’s government is “against the idea of exporting
coal-based power to Thailand but they will allow coal-based
power for internal use,” Pailin said in an interview yesterday.
PTT, whose exploration arm is developing nine blocks in Myanmar,
stands ready to develop its oil and gas industry, he said.  Myanmar’s year-old government has scrapped two large-scale
power-plant projects since taking office as it undertakes
democratic reforms and improves relations with the West. Last
September, it suspended a China-backed $3.6 billion hydropower
station designed to ship electricity across the border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
