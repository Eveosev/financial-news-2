South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak 
reiterated his call for Japan to compensate Korean women forced
into prostitution during World War II, an issue that has
hindered relations between the two countries.  “I would like a more active stance from the Japanese
government on the comfort women issue as some of these women are
in their late 80s,” Lee said in a speech today in Seoul marking
the Independence Day holiday. “For the two counties to move
forward and cooperate as real partners, both need to face the
truth of the past.”  As many as 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and  China , were
forced into sexual servitude during the Japanese occupation of
Asia in the first half of the 20th century.  Japan  apologized in
1993 and set up a compensation fund that some victims rejected
because it was funded through private contributions.  Lee brought the issue up with Japanese Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  when the two met in December in Kyoto. Several
so-called comfort women and their supporters installed a bronze
statue of a young girl in traditional Korean dress in front of
the Japanese embassy in Seoul in protest on Dec. 13 and Japan
asked that it be removed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
