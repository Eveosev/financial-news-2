Sotheby’s (BID)  shares fell 9 percent
after auction revenue declined in the fourth quarter amid
European economic turmoil.  The New York-based art and collectibles auctioneer said
yesterday that quarterly net income fell 26 percent from a year
earlier to $71.5 million. It earned $1.04 a share, less than the
average $1.25 estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Auction and related revenue fell 11 percent to $274.9 million.  Sotheby’s Chief Financial Officer William Sheridan said
uncertainty inspired by the European economy --  Greece  is
negotiating the biggest-ever debt restructuring -- spooked some
potential sellers.  “If you have a Picasso and you’re concerned with what’s
going on in  Europe , you may just say, ‘Let me wait 12 months
until I see some stability there,’” he said in an interview.  For 2011 overall, Sotheby’s reported profit of $171.4
million, its best year since 2007. “You should focus on the
year,” Sheridan said. “The variability of what can happen in
each quarter is significant.”  Sotheby’s shares remain 25 percent higher this year. They
fell $3.59 to $35.75 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares had the biggest drop since they closed down
11.8 percent on Sept. 30, 2011.  Expenses for the quarter rose 3 percent to $167 million.
Quarterly revenue fell 11 percent, to $284 million.  Commission revenue in 2011 for every $100 in auction sales
declined 10 percent, to $16.60 from $18.30, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
filing cited “competitive pressures to win high value
consignments,” such as when the auctioneer shares its buyer’s
commission with a seller to win the right to sell a valuable
artwork.  To contact the reporter on the story:
