A measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend to one another rose for the first time in 1
1/2 months, a money market indicator shows.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 64 basis
points at 9:10 a.m. in  London  from 63 basis points yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s the first time the measure
has risen on a closing basis since Jan. 20.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars rose from a seven-month low. The three-month cross-
currency  basis swap  was 69 basis points below Euribor, from
minus 67 yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 5. The measure was 114
below Euribor at the start of the year.  The one-year basis swap was 56 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 55 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 475 billion euros ($632 billion) with the central bank,
down from 481 billion euros on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
