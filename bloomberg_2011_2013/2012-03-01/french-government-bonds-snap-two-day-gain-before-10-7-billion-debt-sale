Spanish two-year notes gained for an
11th day amid speculation banks used the proceeds of yesterday’s
 European Central Bank  cash offering to buy the nation’s
securities at an auction today.  The yield on  Italy ’s two-year notes dropped below 2 percent
for the first time since October 2010 as European Union finance
ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss measures to combat the
region’s debt crisis. French bonds also advanced after the ECB
lent banks 529.5 billion euros ($705.9 billion) under its
longer-term refinancing operation. German bunds fell as signs of
global growth sapped demand for safer assets.  “The Spanish auction seems good from a volume
perspective,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London . “The market is obviously fairly happy
with the uptake from the LTRO and what that means in terms of
supporting Spanish and Italian bonds.”  Spain ’s two-year  yield  declined 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 2.19 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
dropping to 2.15 percent, the least since November 2010. The 3.4
percent note due April 2014 gained 0.275, or 2.75 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 102.515. The 11-day gain is the
longest since November 2008.  Italy’s two-year yield fell 38 basis points to 1.76 percent
after reaching 1.68 percent, the least since October 2010.  Money ‘Channeling’  Spanish securities have returned 3 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian debt gained 11 percent, while German bonds were little
changed, the indexes show.  “We suspect that a lot of Italian and Spanish banks are
channeling a lot of that money into the sovereign debt,” said
Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels,
referring to the ECB’s operation. “We know that with the money
the Italian banks got at the end of December they upped their
portfolio of bonds and we think they will continue to do this.”  The ECB awarded 529.5 billion euros in three-year loans to
800 European banks yesterday, after supplying 489 billion euros
to 523 financial institutions on Dec. 21. Under the operation,
banks can borrow at the average of the ECB’s key interest rate,
currently at a record-low 1 percent, and use the funds to buy
higher-yielding assets such as Italian and Spanish debt.  Debt Sales  Spain and  France  sold a combined 12.5 billion euros of
bonds as ECB loans to banks helped spur demand, pushing
borrowing costs lower.  The Spanish auction met its maximum target, with 4.5
billion euros of bonds allotted. The nation sold 1.9 billion
euros of benchmark three-year bonds maturing in July 2015 to
yield 2.617 percent, down from 3.332 percent when the security
was last auctioned Feb. 16. France issued 7.99 billion euros of
debt, at the top end of the range targeted by the treasury.  French bonds rose for a third day, with the 10-year yield
dropping 11 basis points to 2.77 percent. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of similar-
maturity bunds shrank 15 basis points to 91 basis points. The
spread has narrowed from a euro-era record of 204 basis points
on Nov. 17.  Germany ’s bunds dropped as a U.S. report showed weekly
jobless claims declined to a four-year low, and Chinese data
showed manufacturing growth accelerated, sapping demand for
safer assets.  The  inflation rate  in the 17-nation euro area climbed to
2.7 percent last month from 2.6 percent in January, the European
Union’s  statistics office  said today.  Germany’s 10-year yield increased five basis points to 1.87
percent after rising two basis points yesterday.  Highest Volatility  Volatility in Greek debt was the highest in euro-area
markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and
10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The price of the nation’s 10-year bonds slumped to a record
on concern it will use collective action clauses to enforce
losses on bondholders.  The price of the 5.9 percent bond maturing in October 2022
dropped to 19.14 cents on the euro even after the International
Swaps & Derivatives Association ruled that insurance against
bondholder losses doesn’t need to be paid as yet.  “What the market is focused on now is whether the
activation of the collective action clauses will be a  credit
event ,” said Mohit Kumar, the head of European fixed-income
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London. “There is uncertainty
surrounding that and the ISDA can only rule on that after the
CACs are triggered.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
