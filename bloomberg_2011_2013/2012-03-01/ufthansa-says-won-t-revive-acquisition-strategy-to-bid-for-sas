Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  said it won’t
depart from a strategy of focusing on existing businesses in
order to pursue a bid for  SAS AB (SAS)  even if a competitor expresses
an interest in buying the Scandinavian carrier.  “The company’s acquisitions policy has not changed,”
Lufthansa spokesman Aage Duenhaupt said from  Frankfurt .  Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten reported earlier that
Lufthansa might “take another look” at Stockholm-based SAS
should competitors seek to bid, citing Harro Julius Petersen,
the German company’s manager for Scandinavia and the Baltics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
