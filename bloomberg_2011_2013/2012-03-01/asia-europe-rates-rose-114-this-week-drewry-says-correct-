(Corrects spelling of Drewry in headline.)  Container freight rates on Asia to
Europe trade jumped 114 percent this week, suggesting shipping
lines are having some success with their proposed increases,
according to estimates by Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.  The World Container Index’s subcomponent for freight rates
on  Shanghai  to Rotterdam trade jumped to $2,732 per 40-foot
container today from $1,276 a week earlier, Drewry said by e-
mail. The index is developed by London-based Drewry and the
Cleartrade Exchange.  Shipping lines, including the world’s largest,  A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) , have said they will increase rates to
restore profitability after the industry lost money last year.
Copenhagen-based Maersk, which lost 2.88 billion kroner ($521
million) in 2011, last month cut 9 percent of its capacity on
Asia-Europe trade to help make rate increases stick and has said
it may idle ships.  “We will need to see whether these rate increases will
stay or erode over time,”  Philip Damas , a director at Drewry,
said in the statement. “Our view is that there’ll be a
reduction of spot rates next week, but container shipping lines
have withdrawn enough capacity from the Asia-Europe trade to
support some net rate increases over a fair period of time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
