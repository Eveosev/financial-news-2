Titan Cement Co SA (TITK) , Greece’s biggest
producer of the material, doesn’t plan to pay a dividend for the
first time in almost six decades after profit slumped last year.  The planned proposal by the board of directors will end a
“58-year run of continuous dividend payouts between 1953 and
2010,” the Athens-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Net income in 2011 dropped 89 percent to 11 million euros
($15 million) from 103 million euros a year earlier as
construction activity in Greece fell and unrest in North Africa
hurt exports, Titan said. Sales declined 19 percent to 1.1
billion euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization dropped to 242.7 million euros from 315.1
million euros.  The deterioration “is due to the collapse of the
construction sector in  Greece , the stagnation in building
activity in the USA at very low levels, as well as the effect of
the difficult current situation in the Egyptian market,”
according to the statement.  Demand in Greece probably will fall “considerably” in
2012, Titan said. Public and private building activity in
Greece, now in its fifth year of recession, fell almost 8
percent in September from a year earlier, according to the
Hellenic Statistical Authority. The figure is measured by the
number of permits issued.  The company said its “guardedly optimistic” about demand
in  Egypt , where it has two  cement factories .  To contact the reporter on this story:
