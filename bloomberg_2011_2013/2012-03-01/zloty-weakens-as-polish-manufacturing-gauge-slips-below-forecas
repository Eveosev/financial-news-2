The zloty retreated against the
euro, snapping a five-day winning streak, after a report showed
Polish manufacturing slipped to stagnation from expansion in
February.  The zloty lost 0.4 percent to 4.1344 per euro as of 9:12
a.m. in Warsaw, after rising to the strongest level in almost
seven months yesterday. Its decline was the second-steepest
among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The purchasing managersâ€™ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
fell to 50 from 52.2 in January as employment and export orders
fell, HSBC Holdings said in an e-mailed statement summarizing
the results of a survey by  Markit Economics . The median estimate
of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 51.1. A reading above
50 indicates expansion, while a figure below 50 shows a
contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
