Spanish banks may be able to provide
government-backed loans to towns and regions at a floating rate
interest currently equivalent to five percent,  El Pais  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The lenders may implement the financing through a
syndicated loan to the government-controlled lender Instituto de
Credito Official, or through bilateral loans, the Madrid-based
newspaper said. Banks may price the transactions at about 350
basis points above the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
El Pais said.  The country’s banking industry is negotiating with the
government the final terms of the facilities, El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
