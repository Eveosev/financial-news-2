Vivendi SA (VIV)  tumbled as much as 9.4
percent after forecasting a profit slump through 2013 as SFR,
the French wireless unit it bought out for 7.95 billion euros
($10.6 billion) last year, faces increased competition.  Vivendi, owner of the world’s largest music and video-game
companies, bought  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s 44 percent stake in SFR
last June to get full control of the business. SFR is looking to
cut costs to cope with falling prices and revenue after new
competitor  Iliad SA (ILD)  started a service in January.  “We have two growth engines: videos games and GVT, but
we’ve also got a lot of competition and price drop in  France  in
telecoms and television,” Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy  said on a conference call today. “Those are burdens which
will weigh on Vivendi for two years.”  Vivendi fell 7.7 percent to 14.88 euros at 1:19 p.m. in
Paris, where the company is based. The stock was the biggest
loser on France’s benchmark CAC 40 Index. Iliad rose as much
as 1.6 percent.  France Telecom  slipped as much as 1.5 percent.   Net income excluding one-time items will fall by as much as
15 percent to more than 2.5 billion euros in 2012, Levy said.  SFR’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will drop 12 percent to 15 percent in 2012, from
3.8 billion euros last year, Vivendi said today. SFR’s cash flow
from operations will decline 15 percent to about 1.7 billion
euros.  Lost Subscribers  SFR lost 208,000 subscribers, a little over 1 percent of
its wireless customer base, in the first two months of 2012.
Competitor  France Telecom SA (FTE)  said it had lost a similar number
of clients as of mid-February.  SFR will adapt its structure, capital expenditure and
operational costs, Levy said.  “The excessively favorable conditions granted to the new
mobile operator by the regulator, the state and the incumbent
operator lead SFR to reconsider very carefully its commercial
offers and its cost base,” Vivendi said in a statement. “These
efforts to adapt will place increased pressure on Vivendi’s
results in 2012 and 2013.”  Vivendi’s video-game publishing unit  Activision Blizzard
Inc. (ATVI)  and GVT, which sells fixed-line broadband services in
 Brazil , helped boost profit last year.  Dividends  The French company said it plans to change its dividend
policy and intends to distribute 1 euro per share in cash for
2011 as well as 1 free share for every 30 shares held. From
2012, Vivendi will pay out 45 percent to 55 percent of its
adjusted net profit, compared with a previous policy of more
than 50 percent.  Levy, who has been orienting Vivendi more toward the music
and TV businesses, said the company has no current plans for
acquisitions, and would wait until all recently announced deals
are completed.  Universal Music Group, Vivendi’s music unit, agreed to buy
 EMI Group (EMIS) ’s recorded music operations in November for 1.2
billion pounds ($1.9 billion). The European Commission has set
an initial deadline of March 23 to rule on the deal, which is
also being scrutinized by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
