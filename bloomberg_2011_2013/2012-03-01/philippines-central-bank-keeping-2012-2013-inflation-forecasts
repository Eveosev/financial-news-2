Philippine inflation is expected to
be within the lower half of the central bankâ€™s goal this year
and in 2013, as subdued global activity tempers commodity price
increases.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its inflation forecast of
3.1 percent for this year and 3.4 percent next year, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo told reporters in  Manila  today. Rising
oil prices and capital inflows pose a risk to inflation, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
