Kenyan lawmakers will today begin
debating a report by a parliamentary committee that recommends
central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u step down for his handling
of the shilling’s decline last year.  “We will table the report and expect members of parliament
to debate it and make a decision,” Adan Keynan, chairman of the
committee, said in a phone interview today from Nairobi, the
capital.  A panel of lawmakers presented a report to parliament last
month recommending that Ndung’u step aside and allow a tribunal,
to be appointed by President Mwai Kibaki, to determine whether
the governor’s actions led to the shilling’s 20 percent plunge
in the first nine months of last year.  The shilling fell to a record low of 106.75 per dollar in
October as  inflation  surged to 19.7 percent amid higher fuel
costs and the worst-regional regional drought in six decades
that pushed up food prices.  The Central Bank of  Kenya  has moved to help stem the
shilling’s fall by increasing its key lending rate by 11
percentage points since October to a record 18 percent, raising
 reserve requirements  for banks, and mopping up shilling
liquidity through  repurchase agreements .  The shilling declined for a fifth consecutive day and was
trading 0.1 percent weaker at 83.12 per dollar by 9:42 a.m. in
Nairobi.  Ndungu’u wasn’t immediately available for comment, Nancy
Sang, a spokeswoman for the central bank, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
