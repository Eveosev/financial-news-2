Kernel Holding SA (KER) , Ukraine’s biggest
sunflower-oil producer, said revenue and profit grew amid a
successful harvest and higher prices.  Net income for the six-month period ending Dec. 31 rose to
$92.2 million from $85.9 million in the year-earlier period, the
company said in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  Refined oil production rose 38 percent to 82,563 tons and
bottled oil production advanced 41 percent to 72,938 tons, the
company said. Revenue increased 8.1 percent due to higher bulk
and bottled oil prices.  Revenue from silo services rose 61 percent in the period
due to a 49.4 percent increase in the volume of grains and
oilseeds received as Ukraine boosted grain and oilseed harvest
in 2011, the company said.  Ukraine’s grain harvest grew 44 percent to 56.7 million
tons in 2011 compared with a year earlier, state statistics data
shows. The sunflower harvest rose 28 percent to 8.66 million
tons, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
