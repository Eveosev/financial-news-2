Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, raised its annual dividend 8.9 percent to
$1.59 a share, the smallest increase since the company’s fiscal
2009.  The first quarterly payout of 39.75 cents a share will come
April 4 for shareholders of record as of March 12, the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said today in a statement.
The Bloomberg Dividend Forecast was for a quarterly payment of
44 cents.  Wal-Mart’s dividend increase is less than expected and
lower than the company has given in recent years,  Colin McGranahan , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York, said
in an e-mail. The retailer increased the dividend by 8 percent
in fiscal 2009, which includes 11 months of calendar 2008, when
the economy was reeling from the financial crisis, he said.  “Seems a bit on the meager side to us,” McGranahan said.  Wal-Mart  rose  0.2 percent to $59.22 at 10:07 a.m. in  New
York . The shares had declined 1.1 percent this year before
today.  The company raised the dividend by 21 percent in fiscal
2012, 11 percent in fiscal 2011 and 15 percent in fiscal 2010.  “We have high expectations for fiscal year 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mike Duke  said in the statement. “Our core
Walmart U.S. business is back on track.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
