Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , the world’s third-
biggest maker of commercial jets, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 27 percent as deliveries of regional aircraft slid.  Net income declined to $214 million, or 12 cents a share,
from $295 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, according to a
statement today from Montreal-based Bombardier, which shifted to
calendar-year reporting beginning with today’s statement. Sales
fell 22 percent to $4.32 billion, lower than the average
analysts’ estimate of $4.74 billion. Results covered two months
of operations of the company’s aerospace unit, as Bombardier
brought forward its year end by one month to Dec. 31.  After cutting production of its smaller CRJ regional jets
last year, Bombardier is working to meet a 2013 target for the
commercial debut of the C-Series jetliner, its largest plane,
which is costing about $3.5 billion to develop. The company said
today it expects deliveries to drop to 235 this year from 245 in
the fiscal year ended Dec. 31. Business aircraft will make up
the bulk of shipments, with 180 planes delivered, with 55
commercial aircraft, Bombardier said.  “The outlook is somewhat brighter for Bombardier this year
with the business aviation recovery continuing to pick up,”
Fadi Chamoun, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto,
wrote in a note to clients last week. “There are signs of
improving demand” for regional jets and turboprops, he wrote.  Bombardier shipped 60 planes in the two-month period ended
Dec. 31, down from 100 in the three-month period a year earlier.  Excluding some items, Bombardier was expected to report
profit of 12 cents a share, according to the average estimate in
a Bloomberg  survey  of 12 analysts.  Bombardier had $53.9 billion of future orders in its
backlog as of Dec. 31, up from $52.7 billion a year earlier.  Shares of Bombardier fell 1.7 percent to C$4.75 in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading yesterday. The stock has gained 17
percent since the start of the year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
