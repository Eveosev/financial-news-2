Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  and
customers who claim the bank gouged them on overdraft fees for
checking accounts agreed to suspend their litigation while they
try to mediate the dispute, court records show.  “The parties have agreed to engage in private mediation in
an effort to resolve this case without further litigation,”
lawyers for the bank and customers said today in a filing in
federal court in Miami. They agreed to suspend court filings on
whether to certify the case as class-action lawsuit.  At least 30 banks have cases in Miami before U.S. District
Judge James Lawrence King, who has consolidated the cases. The
customers say the banks reorder debit-card transactions in their
computers to maximize overdraft fees.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, has reached a preliminary agreement
to pay $110 million to settle litigation.  Bank of America Corp. , the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without admitting
liability. The accord won court approval despite objections that
the amount was too little for customers and that lawyers were
paid too much.  Union Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with
customers in November. An  Associated Banc-Corp. (ASBC)  unit, Associated
Bank, agreed in November to pay $13 million.  The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami).  To contact the reporters on this story:
