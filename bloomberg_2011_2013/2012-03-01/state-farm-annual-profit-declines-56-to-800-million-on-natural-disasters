State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., the biggest U.S. home and car insurer, said full-
year profit fell by more than half on costs tied to natural
disasters.  Net income for 2011 slumped to about $800 million from $1.8
billion a year earlier, the Bloomington, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. Revenue rose to $64.3 billion from
$63.2 billion in 2010. State Farm is owned by its policyholders
and reports results once a year.  U.S. insurers incurred  catastrophe losses  totaling $35.9
billion in 2011 from disasters including the tornado in Joplin,
 Missouri , in May and Hurricane Irene in August, according to the
Insurance Information Institute. That exceeds the average of
$23.8 billion from 2000 to 2010.  “Results must be viewed in the context of five catastrophe
events that are among the 25 largest in our history,” Chief
Financial Officer  Paul Smith  said in the statement.  State Farm’s net worth, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, slumped $400 million to $60.8 billion. Chief
Executive Officer Ed Rust’s compensation decreased 9.3 percent
to $9.25 million in 2011, a figure tied to results spanning
three years including customer retention, employee satisfaction
and growth, said Dick Luedke a spokesman for the company.  The underwriting loss at the property-casualty division
widened to $4.5 billion from $3.1 billion, fueled by claims on
residential properties. The underwriting loss narrowed at the
auto unit to $1.9 billion from $2.8 billion in 2010. Auto claims
fell 2.6 percent to $26.1 billion on lower claims expenses.  IBM, J&J  The insurer was profitable because of investment returns.
State Farm is among the top five shareholders of  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , and  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT) , with holdings in each of more than $2 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the second-biggest home and auto insurer in
the U.S., said annual profit fell to $788 million last year from
$928 million in 2010. Property-casualty insurers including
Travelers Cos. and  Chubb Corp. (CB)  posted reduced profit in 2011 on
losses from natural disasters.  State Farm, which has no publicly traded debt, reports
results based on state accounting rules for insurers. Publicly
traded insurers must use U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, making comparisons inexact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
