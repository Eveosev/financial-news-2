The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed five basis points to 347
at 8 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 13.5
basis points to 578.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 3.5 basis points to
131.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 4.5 basis points to 211 and the
subordinated index jumped 12 to 363.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
