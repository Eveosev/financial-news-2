Robusta coffee climbed for a second
day in  London  on signs supplies will be limited before the start
of the crop in  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest producer.
Cocoa advanced.  Farmers in Indonesia will harvest 9.1 million bags in the
2012-13 season that starts in April, 38 percent more than a year
earlier, according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. Output was cut this season by rain caused by the
La Nina weather pattern, associated with cooler-than-normal
waters in the  Pacific Ocean . A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms
(132 pounds).  “It is very tight until April, and then once the new
Indonesian crop arrives, there will be a reversal of this
tightness,” Volcafe said in a report yesterday. “ Vietnam  is
almost the lone supplier of volume robusta these last couple of
months, until  India ,  Uganda , Indonesia,  Ivory Coast  or even
Brazil start to ship more volume come April and May.”  Robusta coffee for May delivery rose 1.3 percent to $2,035
a metric ton by 10:22 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The price
increased as much as 1.3 percent yesterday and fell the previous
two sessions. Arabica coffee for May delivery was up 0.7 percent

coffee at $2,050 a ton as of Feb. 28, up from 365  call options

exports from Vietnam fell 48 percent in January, government data
show. The rise in prices has prompted farmers to increase sales,
