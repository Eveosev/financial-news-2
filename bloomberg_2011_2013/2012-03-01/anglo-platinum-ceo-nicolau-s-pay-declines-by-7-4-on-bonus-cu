Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the
largest producer of the metal, paid Chief Executive Officer
Neville Nicolau 7.4 percent less in 2011 on a lower bonus.  While Nicolau’s salary rose 15 percent to 6.86 million rand
($917,000) from 5.96 million rand a year earlier, his bonus fell
23 percent to 4.53 million rand, the Johannesburg-based company
said in an  annual report  posted on its website today. The value
of share incentives he was awarded last year totaled 8.97
million rand, compared with 9.74 million rand a year earlier.  Nicolau this month cut the company’s 2012 output target and
froze employment after  annual profit  dropped 64 percent to 3.59
billion rand and metal prices weakened. Parent Anglo American
Plc is reviewing assets in the business that aren’t delivering
acceptable returns, Anglo CEO Cynthia Carroll said.  Anglo American Platinum declined 14 percent to 583.15 rand
in Johannesburg trading in the past year, while prices of the
metal dropped 6 percent to $1,695.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
