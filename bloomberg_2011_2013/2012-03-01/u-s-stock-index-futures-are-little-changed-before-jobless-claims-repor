U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since 2008,
amid a rally in financial shares and after government data
showed that jobless claims declined to a four-year low.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  climbed at
least 1.8 percent as Spanish and French borrowing costs fell.
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  added 2.2 percent, pacing gains in energy
producers, as crude oil traded near $110 a barrel.  Gap Inc. (GPS) , the
largest U.S. apparel chain, increased 7.2 percent as same-store
sales exceeded estimates.  General Motors Co. (GM)  jumped 1.7 percent
after the automaker reported a surprise U.S. sales gain.  The S&P 500 added 0.6 percent to 1,374.09 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after a  three-month  gain. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 28.23 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,980.30.  “We’re not lighting the world on fire, but we’re seeing
improvement in the economy,” said Mark Masterson, managing
director and partner at HighTower’s Masterson, Emma & Associates
in Naples,  Florida . Hightower has over $25 billion in assets.
“The risk from the European situation has been reduced. I don’t
know that it’s been eliminated. Best I can say at this point is
that it appears to have been postponed.”  Equities rose as the number of Americans filing first-time
claims for jobless benefits fell to a level matching a four-year
low, more evidence the labor market is healing. Gains in  Europe 
also helped lift the S&P 500 after Spain and  France  sold 12.5
billion euros ($16.7 billion) of bonds as the  European Central
Bank ’s long-term refinancing operation of lending to banks
helped spur demand.  Banks Rally  Financial shares had the  biggest  gain in the S&P 500 among
10 industries, adding 1.2 percent. JPMorgan increased 2.9
percent, the most in the Dow, to $40.37. Bank of America had the
second-largest advance in the 30-stock gauge, climbing 1.9
percent to $8.12.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  jumped 5.2 percent to $121.13. The
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets agreed to buy Ariel Holdings
Ltd.’s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance businesses to
expand property and casualty coverage.  Benchmark gauges briefly pared gains as oil jumped after a
report of an explosion on a pipeline in  Saudi Arabia . A
government official said late today there was no sabotage to its
oil facilities in the Qatif region. Energy shares in the S&P 500
added 0.9 percent as a group. ConocoPhillips gained 2.2 percent
to $78.22.  ‘Two Steps Forward’  “U.S. stocks and economic data appear to be moving at
least two steps forward for every step back which, we believe,
leads to a strengthening trend for both,” said Kully Samra, who
manages U.K.-based clients for Charles Schwab Corp., which has
$1.6 trillion of assets globally. “Rising oil prices are a risk
to global growth, but we’re optimistic the improved environment
will keep the recovery in motion.”  Gap surged 7.2 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $25.05.
Sales climbed 4 percent, beating the average projection for a
1.4 percent drop from analysts surveyed by Retail Metrics Inc.
Unseasonably warm weather boosted purchases of spring
merchandise.  Car companies had the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among 24
industries, rallying 2.1 percent. GM added 1.7 percent to $26.47
as deliveries rose 1.1 percent in February to 209,306 cars and
light trucks, beating analysts’ estimates for a 4.8 percent
drop.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  climbed 2.3 percent to $12.66 after sales
also topped analysts’ estimates.  Adding Technology  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  climbed 2.2 percent to $7.51.
The second-largest maker of processors for personal computers
said it will pay $334 million to  buy  SeaMicro Inc., a chip
designer with expertise in servers, adding technology that can
help it compete with  Intel Corp . in the market for data centers.  Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  surged 15 percent to $8.01. The
world’s largest online-recruiting company said it’s considering
“all other strategic alternatives” to  boost   shareholder value .  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  rose 0.4 percent to a record $544.47, gaining
for a sixth day. Now that its market value has exceeded $500
billion, the biggest challenge for the maker of iPads may be
staying there. It’s the sixth U.S. company crossing the
threshold, data compiled by S&P show. The others are  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) , General Electric Co., Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and
Exxon Mobil Corp., in chronological order.  All five companies were below $500 billion a year after
reaching that pinnacle, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
GE was the only one to surpass that value afterward.  Extending a Rally  Today’s advance extended this year’s  rally  in the S&P 500
to 9.3 percent. Yet the index trades at about 14.2 times
reported earnings, compared with the average since  1954 (SPX)  of 16.4
times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 has the potential to reach 1,700 before the end
of the year should the economy surprise investors the same way
falling bond rates did in 1995, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  An expansion that beat forecasts would help stocks rally
after economists tempered their estimate for growth in 2012 to
2.2 percent from 2.3 percent earlier in the year, according to
Laszlo Birinyi, who was among the first to suggest buying stocks
in 2009. The potential for surprise is similar to 1995, when the
yield on the 30-year  U.S. Treasuries (USGG30YR)  fell 1.93 percentage
points, even as  Wall Street  predicted they would gain.  “In 1995, the consensus trade was higher yields, today it
is tepid economic growth and the market is suggesting -- perhaps
insisting -- an alternative to that consensus,” Birinyi wrote.
“We would encourage a more aggressive posture.”  ‘Dramatic Improvement’  UBS AG raised its forecasts for the S&P 500 and its
companies earnings amid a “dramatic” improvement in the
economy. Jonathan Golub’s year-end forecast for the benchmark
gauge rose to 1,475 from 1,325. He estimates earnings-per-share
of $103 this year and $112 in 2013. The previous forecasts were
$99 and $111, respectively.  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes lost 0.9 percent.
PulteGroup Inc. slumped 2.6 percent to $8.59.  KB Home (KBH)  fell 1.3
percent to $11.27.  Sotheby’s (BID)  tumbled 9.1 percent to $35.75. The publicly
traded auctioneer of fine arts and collectibles said fourth-
quarter profit fell  26 percent  as sales slid.  Smaller companies trailed larger stocks in the U.S. in
February, a sign that the S&P 500’s longest monthly rally in a
year may be losing momentum, according to Bespoke Investment
Group LLC.  The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY) , which tracks companies with an
average market value of $738 million, added 2.3 percent last
month, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in the S&P 500, whose
members average $25.9 billion in value. The underperformance
accelerated in the second half of the month, with the  Russell
2000  rising on two of the last nine days and the  S&P 500  gaining
during seven.  “Small caps are cyclical in nature, and typically perform
better during market rallies,”  Justin Walters , Bespoke’s co-
founder, wrote in a note yesterday. “They haven’t been rallying
recently, which should be cause of concern for market bulls.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
