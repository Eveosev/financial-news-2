Indian stocks fell amid concern a
wider-than-estimated budget deficit may curb the central bank’s
scope to cut rates and after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke failed to signal more stimulus measures.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the nation’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, fell for the second day this week after investors
bid for fewer shares than on offer at a government auction.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , which has the highest weighting on the
benchmark index, slid for the first time in three days.  DLF
Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, sank 5.5 percent after Veritas
Investment Research Corp. advised investors to “sell” and cut
the stock’s price estimate by more than half.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 1 percent to
17,583.97 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge added 3.3
percent in February, posting two straight monthly gains for the
first time since September 2010, as foreigners poured a net $7.4
billion into local stocks amid optimism slowing inflation will
prompt the central bank to cut  interest rates .  “This is definitely not a time to be chasing as a lot of
stocks have had a good run,” Gaurav Doshi, a portfolio manager
at Morgan Stanley  India  Financial Services, told Bloomberg UTV
today. “The market has been caught off guard in the last 1 1/2
months on the back of liquidity. This is the time to reconsider
sectoral reallocations.”  India’s fiscal deficit exceeded the full-year target in the
10 months through January. It may surge to 6.1 percent of gross
domestic product this fiscal year, according to Nomura Holdings
Inc. and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., more than Finance Minister
Pranab Mukherjee’s aim of 4.6 percent. India’s central bank had
signaled that efforts to curb the gap would boost its scope to
lower interest rates as growth slows. It reviews rates on March
15, a day before Mukherjee presents the budget.  ‘Interest Rate Tailwinds’  Still, Credit Suisse Group AG predicts the  Reserve Bank  of
India will lower rates by 175 basis points by January 2013. The
central bank in January reduced lenders’ reserve ratios for the
first time since 2009 after raising rates seven times last year.  “The interest rate headwinds of 2011 are now going to be
interest rate tailwinds,” said  John Praveen , chief investment
strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers, a
unit of Prudential Financial Inc., which manages $900 billion
in assets, in a Bloomberg UTV interview. “It provides a more
favorable backdrop for foreign investors to go into the market.
The potential for further foreign fund flows is there.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. slid 0.8 percent to 5,339.75. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  lost
0.7 percent to 2,175.08. U.S. stocks pared gains after Bernanke
yesterday affirmed that interest rates are likely to remain low
at least through late 2014 without offering any indication that
further monetary easing is under consideration.  Lenders Rally  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s second-biggest lender, fell
2.5 percent to 883.5 rupees, paring this year’s gain to 29
percent.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, declined 1.3
percent to 2,218.75 rupees.  Oil & Natural Gas declined 1.7 percent to 288.2 rupees.  Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, lost 1.2 percent to 810.95 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro
Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company, dropped 2.3 percent to
1,277.9 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of
sport-utility vehicles, sank 4 percent to 681.75 rupees. DLF
slid 5.5 percent to 214.05 rupees, its lowest since Jan. 30.  The Sensex has advanced 14 percent this year, rebounding
from a 25 percent slump in 2011, as  offshore funds  poured $7.4
billion into stocks. The measure trades at 15.5 times future
profits, down from 19 times at the end of 2010.  “The rally has gone from extreme undervaluation to maybe
close to a fair valuation,” Prudential’s Praveen said.
“There’s still an upside from current levels but not at the
same pace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
