Norwegian manufacturing accelerated
for a second month in February as rising oil investments shield
the Nordic economy from the fallout of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  A seasonally adjusted  index  based on responses from
 purchasing managers  rose to 56.9 from a revised 54.7 in January,
Oslo-based Fokus Bank said today in a statement. The index was
forecast at 53.8, according to a Bloomberg survey of six
economists. A reading above 50 signals an expansion.  The world’s seventh-largest oil exporter is rebounding as
rising oil prices fuel petroleum investments and after the
central bank in December lowered its main rate by half a
percentage point to 1.75 percent.  Norway’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest lender.  -- Editors: Jonas Bergman, Tasneem Brogger  To contact the reporter on this story:
