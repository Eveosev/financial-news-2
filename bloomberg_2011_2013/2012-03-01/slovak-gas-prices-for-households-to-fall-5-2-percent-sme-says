Slovak natural-gas prices for
households will decline an average 5.2 percent,  Sme  reported,
citing the utility regulator.  The drop will become effective immediately after the
regulator’s ruling is delivered to Slovensky Plynarensky
Priemysel AS, the country’s dominant gas supplier, the newspaper
said.  The Office for Network Industries asked the utility to
charge less to households after OAO Gazprom lowered prices for
its customers, including Slovensky, Sme reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
