Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos ’s approval rating fell to 62 percent in February from 65
percent in December amid perceptions that security in the South
American country has deteriorated, according to a  poll  by Gallup
 Colombia  published in El Tiempo newspaper.  Among those surveyed, 62 percent responded that they felt
the situation concerning guerrilla groups has worsened,
according to the Bogota-based daily.  Gallup interviewed 1,200 citizens in Colombia’s five
biggest cities from Feb. 20 to Feb. 25. The poll has a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points, El Tiempo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
