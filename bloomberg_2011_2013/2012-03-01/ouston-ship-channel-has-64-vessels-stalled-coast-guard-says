Sixty-four ships were idled at the
 Houston Ship Channel , which serves the largest U.S. petroleum
port, as fog limited visibility for a third day, the U.S. Coast
Guard said.  As of 6 a.m. local time, 49 ships were waiting to enter the
port and 15 were waiting to depart, Lieutenant Junior Grade
 Michael Scott , Coast Guard watch supervisor, said in a telephone
interview.  Clear weather enabled Houston ship pilots to guide vessels
out of the port from 10 a.m. to 8:10 p.m. yesterday, clearing
some dock space, Scott said.  Pilots for the ports of Galveston and  Texas City  also
suspended operations, leaving five vessels waiting to enter and
three waiting to depart, he said.  A  dense fog advisory  is in effect for the area until 11
a.m. local time, according to the National Weather Service
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
