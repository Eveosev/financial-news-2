German Lower Saxony state
Environment Minister Stefan Birkner said planned additional
reductions in subsidies for solar power should be postponed to
April 1,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported.  German homeowners considering putting solar panels on their
roofs had anticipated the reductions being introduced on that
date and had timed the installations accordingly, the newspaper
cited Birkner as saying.  A draft from the environment and economy ministries
endorsed by the German Cabinet yesterday would lower premium
rates for solar power by as much as 29 percent from March 9 and
decrease them further each month beginning in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
