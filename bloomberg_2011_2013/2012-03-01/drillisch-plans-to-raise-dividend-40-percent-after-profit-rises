Drillisch AG (DRI) , a German provider of
low-cost phone services, proposed to raise its dividend for last
year by 40 percent after 2011 profit increased.  The company plans to pay 0.70 euro per share to its
stockholders, Maintal, Germany-based Drillisch said in a
statement today. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, or Ebitda, advanced to 51.4 million euros in

factors,” which rose to 52.6 million euros in 2011, to increase
