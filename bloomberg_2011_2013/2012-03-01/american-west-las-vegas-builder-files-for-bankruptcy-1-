American West Development Inc., a
 Las Vegas  homebuilder, sought  bankruptcy protection  from
creditors after reaching an agreement on a reorganization with
seven lenders led by California Bank & Trust.  American West  listed assets of more than $50 million and
debt of more than $100 million in Chapter 11 documents filed
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas. The company has
been building homes in Las Vegas since 1984 and has eight
single-family communities under construction.  “The economic downturn of the past four years has hit the
homebuilding industry hard, particularly in southern  Nevada ,”

statement. “This reorganization will allow us to move forward
with existing and new projects.”  Sales of new U.S. homes dropped 0.9 percent in January to a
321,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Feb. 24.
The median price fell 9.6 percent from the same month last year.  American West’s largest unsecured creditors include
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA and California Bank & Trust, both with
claims of $24.9 million, and Bank of America NA, with a claim of
$17 million, according to court papers.  The case is In re American West Development Inc., 12-12349,
