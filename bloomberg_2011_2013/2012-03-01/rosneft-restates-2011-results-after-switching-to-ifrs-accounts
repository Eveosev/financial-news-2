OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s largest oil
producer, restated 2011 results after switching its accounts to
International Financial Reporting Standards from U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles in line with a Russian law on
financial transparency.  Net income was 316 billion rubles ($10.8 billion) in 2011,
49 million rubles less that previously reported, Rosneft said
today. The difference was due to increased depreciation,
depletion and amortization under IFRS, Rosneft said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
