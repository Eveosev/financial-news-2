Greek 10-year bonds slumped to a
record on concern the nation will use collective action clauses,
or CACs, to enforce losses on bondholders.  The price of the 5.9 percent bond maturing in October 2022
dropped to 19.14 cents on the euro even after the International
Swaps & Derivatives Association ruled that insurance against
bondholder losses doesn’t need to be paid as yet. ISDA’s
determinations committee said today the situation is “still
evolving” and it may rule in favor of a payout for credit
default swaps on Greek bonds in the future.  “What the market is focused on now is whether the
activation of the collective action clauses will be a  credit
event ,” said Mohit Kumar, the head of European fixed-income
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “There is uncertainty
surrounding that and the ISDA can only rule on that after the
CACs are triggered. The consensus view in the market is that if
the CACs are triggered then it will be a credit event.”  Greece’s 5.9 percent October 2022 bond yields advanced 154
basis points, or 1.54 percentage points, to 36.33 percent at
2:05 p.m. London time.  The price of 4.3 percent notes maturing this month fell
0.885, or 8.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,330) face amount, to
24.285. The price has slid after reaching 42 on Feb. 16.  ‘Plenty of Risks’  Euro-region finance ministers are meeting today to approve
a 130-billion euro bailout for  Greece  that includes a plan to
slice about 100 billion euros off more than 200 billion euros of
privately-held debt using a bond exchange. The government is
seeking a 90 percent participation rate and set a 75 percent
rate as a threshold for proceeding with the transaction,
according to a Feb. 24 statement.  “The market is still pricing in plenty of risks that the
deal does not go as planned and that there will be a hard
default,” said David Zervos, head of global fixed-income
strategy at Jefferies & Co. in  New York . “It is shunning these
assets because they are worth very little. There is no event of
default yet, but the market is pricing that there will be a
default when the collective action clauses are used.”  The additional yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
bonds instead of benchmark German debt rose to 34.46 percentage
points, after reaching a record 34.71 points yesterday.  Political determination to avoid the stigma of a credit
event has been waning as Greece struggles to meet the conditions
for a second bailout.  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the nation to
“selective default” on Feb. 27 because of the government’s
decision to retroactively insert CACs into bond terms.  S&P dropped Greece’s rating from CC, following a reduction
last week by  Fitch Ratings  to C. Moody’s Investors Service has
said it will cut the nation to its lowest rating.  Greece’s debt exchange plan aims to reduce national debt to
120.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, from 160
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
