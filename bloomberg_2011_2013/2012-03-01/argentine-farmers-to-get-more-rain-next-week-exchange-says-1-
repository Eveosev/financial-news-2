Argentina ’s farmers in the Pampas
agricultural zone will get more rain next week after abundant
downpours alleviated crop damage in February, the  Buenos Aires
Cereals Exchange  said.  The rains will improve yield prospects for late season corn
and soybeans, the exchange said in its weekly crop report today.
Drought damage has reduced potential yields of early season
soybeans by between 15 percent and 25 percent, it said.  A front will bring more stormy weather to the Pampas by
March 5, the exchange said in a separate weather report today.
February rains “were surprising in their abundance and
expanse,” boosting yield prospects, the exchange wrote.  Soybeans fell from a five-month high and corn snapped a
six-session rally on speculation rains will halt yield
deterioration in  South America . Brazil and Argentina are the
world’s second and third-largest soybean exporters after the
U.S.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$13.2150 a bushel at 10:14 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Yesterday, the oilseed touched $13.2425, the highest for the
most-active contract since Sept. 21.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to $6.5450 a
bushel in Chicago, heading for the first drop in seven sessions.
Yesterday, the grain touched $6.615, the highest since Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
