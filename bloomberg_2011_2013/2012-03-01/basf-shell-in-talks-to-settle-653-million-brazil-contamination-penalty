BASF SE (BASF) , the world’s biggest
chemical maker, is in talks with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to
determine who should pay a 490 million-euro ($653 million) fine
for contamination in  Brazil .  The site in Paulinia was “significantly” contaminated by
the production of crop protection products, and BASF and Shell
were jointly ordered in August 2010 to pay damages to former
employees for medical treatment and personal suffering, BASF
said in its 2011 annual report.  BASF said its Brazilian unit filed a lawsuit against Shell
on March 30, asking a court to declare that Shell is responsible
for the full amount of the damages resulting from the
contamination at Paulinia. The two companies are in settlement
talks, Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF said.  The Paulinia unit was built by Shell, sold to Cyanamid in
1995 and then acquired by BASF in 2000, the German company said
in its annual report. The contamination stems from the period
before 2000, BASF said.  Jennifer Moore-Braun, a spokeswoman for BASF, declined to
comment beyond what is in the annual report. Spokesmen for Shell
didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  The suit against Shell was reported today in German
newspaper Financial Times Deutschland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
