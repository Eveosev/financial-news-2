Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. (2343) , Hong
Kong’s largest operator of dry-bulk vessels, posted a 69 percent
drop in annual profit because of lower rates and a write-off of
vehicle-carrying ships.  Net income  was $32 million last year, compared with $104.3
million in 2010, Pacific Basin said in a stock exchange  filing 
today. That compares with the $28.3 million average of seven
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to
$1.34 billion.  Dry-bulk shipping is in “crisis” and freight rates will
probably be lower industrywide this year than in 2011 because of
overcapacity and global economic uncertainties, Pacific Basin
said. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a benchmark for commodity freight
rates, has slumped 54 percent this year.  “I haven’t seen any sign of pick-up in BDI,” said
Lawrence Li, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB-Kay Hian Holdings
Ltd. “The coming year or two will be tough.”  The company proposed to pay a final dividend of 5 HK cents.
The  shares  closed unchanged at HK$4.04 in Hong Kong trading
before the earnings announcement. They have dropped 15 percent
in the past year compared with an 8.6 percent decline for the
city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The company will name a new chief executive officer by the
end of this month, replacing Klaus Nyborg who will leave on
March 15, it said in a separate statement.  The ship operator is awaiting opportunities for expanding
its dry-bulk fleet. As of Dec. 31, it had $618 million of cash
and deposits while net borrowings were $161 million, it said.  The carrier has contracts covering 54 percent of its 2012
Handysize revenue days at $11,480 per day, it said. That
compares with daily earnings of $13,530 last year. For 2013, 25
percent of Handysize days are covered at $12,920 a day.  RoRo Ships  The company’s vehicle-carrying vessels posted a $10.6
million loss last year and the unit will also probably be
unprofitable in 2012, according to the statement. The company
wrote off $80 million of investments in the so-called roll-on,
roll-off ships during the first half of last year.  Pacific Basin has a fleet of 218 vessels, including those
on order, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
