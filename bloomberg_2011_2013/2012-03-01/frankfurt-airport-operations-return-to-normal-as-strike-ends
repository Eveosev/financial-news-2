Frankfurt airport,  Europe ’s third-
largest, resumed normal flight operations after  strike action  by
runway controllers that began on Feb. 16 ended.  Further industrial action is not planned for today,
Matthias Maas, the spokesman of Gewerkschaft der Flugsicherung
labor union, said by phone.  Fraport AG (FRA) , the hub’s operator,
expects 22 cancellations of a total 1,300 flights, as services
resume, Mike Peter Schweitzer, a Fraport spokesman, said.  Fraport may seek compensation after disruptions caused by
the walkouts, Schweitzer said. GdF plans to consult today within
its federal executive board on how to proceed with its pursuit
of higher pay and changes to outsourcing policies, Maas said.  Fraport and German carrier  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  won an
injunction yesterday to halt the strikes after a court prevented
GdF from rallying the support of air-traffic controllers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
