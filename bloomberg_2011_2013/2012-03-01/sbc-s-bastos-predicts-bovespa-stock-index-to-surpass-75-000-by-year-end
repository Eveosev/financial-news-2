(Corrects official’s position at HSBC in first paragraph
of story originally published March 1.)  Brazilian stocks, off to the best
annual start since 1999, will extend their rally as overseas
demand for the country’s commodities and  interest-rate  cuts push
investors into equities, said Pedro Bastos, head of HSBC Global
Asset Management in  Latin America .  The Bovespa will advance another 14 percent this year after
rising 17 percent in the first two months, Bastos said. The
index will reach 75,000 by year-end, surpassing the record of
73,516 set in 2008, from 65,811.73 yesterday, he said.  “The market still hasn’t recovered to where we were in
2010, so when you look at Brazil, it still seems a very
attractive market,” Bastos said in a phone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “The government is trying to make local interest rates
converge with the Latin American average. So there is still a
lot of room to still cut rates and that will boost the migration
of local investors to the equity market.”  The Bovespa sank 18 percent in 2011 as the global economic
slowdown weakened demand for commodities. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI
 Index (CMCIPI)  of 27 raw materials has advanced 8.2 percent this year
after falling 6.1 percent in 2011.  Brazil ’s central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate
four times since August, trimming it 200 basis points to 10.5
percent. It remains the highest among major Latin American
countries that set target interest rates.  The Bovespa’s gain this year is surpassed in the region
only by  Colombia ’s IGBC and Peru’s IGBVL, which have advanced 18
percent and 17 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
