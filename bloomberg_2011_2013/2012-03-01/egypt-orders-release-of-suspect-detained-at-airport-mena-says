     March 1 (Bloomberg) --A state security prosecutor ordered
the release of Mohamed Ibrahim Mekawi, who was detained at
Cairoâ€™s airport yesterday, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
reported.  Interior Ministry spokesman Marwan Moustafa said yesterday
that Mekawi was not Saif al-Adl, the name used by an al-Qaeda
leader wanted by the U.S., as initially reported by MENA. Mekawi
is to be freed as long as he is not wanted or detained for
another reason, MENA said today.  Mekawi was arrested after he arrived from  Pakistan  via the
United Arab Emirates, MENA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
