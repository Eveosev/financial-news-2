Jeremy Lin had 19 points and 13
assists as the  New York Knicks  rallied to defeat the Cleveland
Cavaliers 120-103.  In their last game at Madison Square Garden before a four-
game road trip, the Knicks surged back from a 12-point halftime
deficit last night to improve to 10-3 in the  National Basketball
Association  since Lin took over at point guard on Feb. 4.  Carmelo Anthony scored a team-high 22 points for the Knicks
(18-18), who had lost 12 of their previous 13 meetings with the
Cavs (13-20), who are now winless in three games.  “We’re a very deep team now,” Anthony told reporters.
“Guys are starting to get their legs underneath them, guys are
starting to get healthy.”  Steve Novak  scored 17 points, Iman Shumpert had 12 and J.R.
Smith added nine off the Knicks’ bench.  “J.R., Shumpert, when they’re on the wings and they get
out in the open court, that’s a lot of fun,” Anthony said.
“Then with Novak shooting the ball the way he’s shooting the
ball, it’s a great thing to watch.”  The Knicks trailed 61-49 at halftime before outscoring the
Cavaliers 33-19 in the third quarter to take an 82-80 lead.  New
York  extended its lead to 15 points by opening the fourth
quarter with a 19-6 run.  ‘We Melted’  “We gave up 71 points in the second half,” Cavaliers
coach Byron Scott told reporters. “You have to give them all
the credit in the world. They were much more aggressive. They
came out aggressive and we melted.”  Antawn Jamison had 23 points and rookie Kyrie Irving, the
first pick in the 2011 draft, had 22 points and seven assists
for the Cavaliers.  “It was hard to watch, and it was hard to be a part of,”
Irving told reporters. “We couldn’t sustain the same energy we
had in the first half.”  Lin, 23, is the first Harvard University graduate in the
NBA since  Ed Smith  in 1954 and the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-
American to play in the league. He was cut by two other clubs
before signing with the Knicks on Dec. 27.  The Knicks are tied with the  Boston Celtics  for second
place in the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division,
three games behind the  Philadelphia 76ers . Cleveland is 14 games
behind the  Chicago Bulls  in the Central Division. The Bulls beat
the San Antonio Spurs 96-89 last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
