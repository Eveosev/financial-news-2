(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show Travelers
won reversal of an order to pay asbestos claims.)  Travelers Cos.’ appeal of a 2011
ruling in the bankruptcy case of Johns Manville Corp., seeking
reversal of an order to pay asbestos victims about $500 million,
was granted in federal court in  New York .  “It was error to require Travelers to make the settlement
payments,” U.S. District Judge  John Koeltl  wrote. “The
judgment must be reversed.”  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in Manhattan said in
his 2011 ruling that the dispute had gone on too long,
“especially for those asbestos victims who have yet to be fully
compensated.”  Johns Manville, once the nation’s largest asbestos maker,
filed for bankruptcy in 1982. In June 2009, the  Supreme Court 
overturned a ruling that allowed suits against units of
Travelers by people harmed by exposure to asbestos.  “Just as the Supreme Court has barred parties from
bringing suit against Travelers based on the plain language of
the 1986 orders, Travelers should likewise be bound by the plain
language of the settlements, and should be compelled to comply
with its payment obligations,” Lifland wrote.  Travelers said an unmet condition of the agreements was
that settlement lawyers in Hawaii show that the plaintiffs had
dismissed all claims against the insurer. The company also said
the  bankruptcy court  made a mistake in calculating interest.  The bankruptcy case is In re Johns Manville Corp., 82-11656,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
