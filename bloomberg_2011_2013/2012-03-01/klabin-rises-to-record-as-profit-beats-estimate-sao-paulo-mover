Klabin SA (KLBN4) , Latin America’s biggest
paper maker, headed to a record high after posting  higher-than-
expected  profit in the fourth quarter.  Shares rose 1.4 percent to 8.66 reais at 3:12 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . A close at that price would sinsbe the  highest  since at
least August 1994. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 1.3
percent.  Klabin’s  net income  fell 46 percent to 122 million reais
($71 million) in the fourth quarter of 2011 from 225 million
reais a year earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The result beat the average estimate of 90.63 million
reais for adjusted net income, according to a Bloomberg survey
of six analysts.  The results were “a bit better” than expected,  Pedro Galdi , head strategist at brokerage firm SLW Corretora, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “The reaction also follows the Bovespa
index  rising ,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
