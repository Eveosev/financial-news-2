National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest bank, said profit climbed 3.1 percent to
a record as it posted higher earnings from  consumer banking . The
bank was the fourth Canadian lender this quarter to top analyst
estimates.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose to C$334
million ($338.7 million), or C$2 a share, from C$322 million, or
C$1.86, a year earlier, the Montreal-based bank said today in a
statement. It was the sixth straight period of year-over-year
profit growth.  Consumer banking profit climbed 9 percent to C$170 million
for the quarter because of an increase in personal loan volume,
the bank said. Financial markets, which includes investment-
banking operations, climbed 13 percent to C$129 million.  Before one-time items, the bank earned C$2 a share, topping
the C$1.82-a-share average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  National Bank said wealth management profit dropped 21
percent to C$38 million as it recorded costs for acquisitions.  Separately, the bank said that Chief Executive Officer
Louis Vachon was awarded C$7.48 million in 2011, up from C$5.4
million a year earlier. Both figures exclude costs to service
Vachon’s pension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
