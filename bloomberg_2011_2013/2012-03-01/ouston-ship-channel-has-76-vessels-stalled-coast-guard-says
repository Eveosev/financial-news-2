Seventy-six ships were waiting to
pass through the  Houston Ship Channel , which serves the largest
U.S. petroleum port, after heavy fog halted traffic overnight,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.  As of 4 p.m. local time, 52 ships were waiting to enter the
port and 24 were waiting to depart, Chief Levi Campbell, the
Coast Guard watch supervisor, said in a telephone interview.  Houston ship pilots began guiding vessels out of the port
after the fog rolled out at about 11:30 a.m. local time,
Campbell said.  Pilots for the ports of Galveston and  Texas City  resumed
transits at 9:16 a.m. local time, he said. They have five ships
waiting to arrive and one ship waiting to leave, Campbell said.  A  dense fog advisory  is in effect across southeast  Texas 
and southwestern Louisiana from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. local time
tomorrow, according to the National Weather Service website.  “As soon as that fog comes in, the pilots will probably
shut it back down again,” Campbell said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
