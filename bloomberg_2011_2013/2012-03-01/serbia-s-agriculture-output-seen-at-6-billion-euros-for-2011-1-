Serbia’s agriculture output for 2011
is estimated at 6 billion euros ($8 billion), the  Serbian
Chamber of Commerce  said, citing its own sources and the
country’s statistics office.  Wheat production rose 27 percent from a year earlier to
2.07 million metric tons due to a higher-than-expected average
yield of more than 4.2 tons per hectare (2.5 acres), the
Belgrade-based chamber said in a report released today. Corn
fell 10 percent to 6.46 million tons, it said.  The value of the country’s top crops, wheat, corn, sugar
beet, sunflower and soybeans, fell 19 percent to $2.2 billion
because of lower global prices, the chamber said.  The 2012 harvest will probably produce less wheat and more
corn than in 2011, as areas sown for wheat will decrease 0.8
percent to 467,712 hectares, the lowest in 60 years, while corn
will rise 11 percent to 1.4 million hectares, according to the
estimates.  Serbia is also increasing acreage for  sugar beet  by a
quarter to 70,000 hectares, the data showed. Refined sugar was
the country’s second-biggest agricultural export last year with
almost $160 million of the commodity sold abroad. Corn exports
ranked first at $423.8 million.  The country’s trade surplus in farm products rose 9.1
percent last year to $1.31 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
