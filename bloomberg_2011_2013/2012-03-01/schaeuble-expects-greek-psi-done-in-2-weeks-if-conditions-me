German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he expects Greece to complete a debt-swap deal
with private creditors in two weeks if all conditions are met.  Euro-area finance ministers are set to clear a second
rescue for Greece at a meeting in Brussels today to avoid what
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  described as a potential
“brutal outcome” for the Greek economy.  ”We’re here today to check if Greece has fulfilled its
prior actions requirements,” Schaeuble told reporters as he
entered the meeting. If ministers clear the bailout, the debt
swap “should be concluded the week after next.”  Asked if ministers would discuss a third Greek rescue,
Schaeuble said it’s “premature” to consider that possibility.
“We haven’t even signed off on the second one,” he said.  Asked if ministers would discuss relaxing  Spain ’s deficit
target, Schaeuble said today’s meeting would focus on Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
