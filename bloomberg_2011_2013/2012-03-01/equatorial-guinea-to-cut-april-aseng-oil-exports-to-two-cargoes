Equatorial Guinea  plans to export
two cargoes of 950,000 barrels each of Aseng crude next month,
one less than March, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Aseng is a medium, sweet, or low-sulfur, blend similar to
Angolaâ€™s Girassol grade. Production started in November,
according to  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , the operator of the field.
Glencore International Plc is the marketer for the crude.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
