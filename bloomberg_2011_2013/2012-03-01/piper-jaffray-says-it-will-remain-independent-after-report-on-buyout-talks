Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC) , the investment
bank and asset manager founded in 1895, said it’s staying
independent after Mergermarket reported takeover talks with a
Chinese securities firm.  Piper Jaffray is looking at corporate-development ideas and
opportunities in  Asia , such as a joint venture, as it seeks to
improve performance of its Hong Kong-based  subsidiary , the
Minneapolis-based firm said today in a statement.  “As it considers these Asia alternatives, however, Piper
Jaffray intends to remain an independent public company,” the
firm said.  Piper Jaffray advanced 2.6 percent to $25.22 at 2:58 p.m.
in  New York  after rising as much as 9.8 percent earlier in the
session for its biggest gain since Oct. 27. That followed
Mergermarket’s report that the securities firm was in exclusive
discussions with the Chinese company, which it didn’t identify,
citing a person familiar with the matter.  Last year, Piper Jaffray reported a net loss of
$102 million, or $6.51 a share, as revenue dropped 14 percent to
$458 million. The firm, run by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Andrew S. Duff, 54, cited lower  investment banking  and
institutional brokerage revenue.  The stock dropped 39 percent in 12 months through
yesterday’s close, leaving the firm with a market value of about
$490 million and trading for about 83 percent of tangible book
value. Piper Jaffray employed 1,011 people at year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
