German Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  is concerned about the results of a study by his
ministry showing that every fourth non-German Muslim living in
 Germany  rejects integration, is open to the use of violence, and
denounces “western values,”  Bild-Zeitung  reported.  While Germany “respects the origins and the cultural
identity” of its immigrants, it won’t accept “the import of
authoritarian, anti-democratic and fanatic religious views,”
the newspaper quoted Friedrich as saying. Those who fight
freedom and democracy “will have no future here,” Friedrich
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
