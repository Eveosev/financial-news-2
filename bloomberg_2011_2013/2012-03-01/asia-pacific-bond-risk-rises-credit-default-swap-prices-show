The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
sovereign and corporate bonds from non-payment rose, with
 Australia ’s contracts poised for the biggest increase in almost
three weeks, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3 basis points to
142 basis points as of 11:16 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. That would be the biggest advance since Feb.
10, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. The measure is up from a six-month low of 139.8 Feb. 8.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 3 basis points to 160.5 basis
points as of 8:28 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The index has increased from a five-
month low of 157.9 on Feb. 9.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 2.5 basis points to
139.5 basis points as of 9:15 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. Japan’s contracts fell to 137 on Feb.
24, the lowest since Aug. 18.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
