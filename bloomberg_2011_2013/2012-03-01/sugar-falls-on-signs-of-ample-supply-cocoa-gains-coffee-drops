Sugar fell to a one-week low on
signs of ample supplies from  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer. Cocoa rose, while coffee dropped.  Global sugar output may top demand by as much as 7 million
tons in the 12 months starting Oct. 1 as Brazil’s crop recovers
and harvests in  Thailand  and China climb, John Stansfield, a
senior analyst at Olam International Ltd.’s U.K. unit, said on
Feb. 28. This season’s surplus is estimated at 9 million tons,
he said.
Unica, an industry association in Brazil, will release its first
estimate for the nation’s next crop by the end of March.  “We’re going to see a reasonably good Brazil crop,”
Sterling Smith, a market analyst at  Country Hedging  in  St. Paul ,
 Minnesota , said in a telephone interview. “There is no obvious
supply threat in the next four to six months.”  Raw sugar for May delivery declined 0.6 percent to settle
at 24.85 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price touched 24.45 cents, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Feb. 23.  Cargill Inc. said it took delivery of 1.94 billion pounds
(880,152 metric tons) of sugar in transactions involving the
expiration of March futures.  The Minneapolis-based company, one of the world’s biggest
commodity traders, took delivery on all of the 17,325 expiring
contracts of 112,000 pounds each. The supplies were at ports in
Central America, Thailand, the Philippines and Brazil, ICE data
show.  Cocoa futures for May delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$2,366 a ton in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent
to $2.041 a pound.  In London futures trading, refined sugar fell, while cocoa
and robusta coffee rose on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
