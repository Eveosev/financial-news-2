PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  doesn’t intend
to buy shares in  General Motors Co. (GM)  and the Detroit-based
carmaker’s investment in Peugeot will be capped at 7 percent,
FFP Chairman Robert Peugeot said in an interview with  Le Figaro .  GM won’t get a seat on Peugeot’s board either as the two
carmakers will remain competitors, Peugeot also told the
newspaper.  Peugeot’s alliance with GM is as strong as its merger with
Citroen from a policy perspective and will accelerate the French
carmaker’s development outside of  Europe , Le Figaro reported
Peugeot as saying.  The alliance will provide GM with a long term solution for
its presence in Europe, Peugeot added, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
