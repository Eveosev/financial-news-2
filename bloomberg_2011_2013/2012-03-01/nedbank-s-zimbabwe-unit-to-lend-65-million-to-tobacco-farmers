MBCA Bank Ltd., a unit of  South
Africa ’s  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , will lend $65 million to Zimbabwean
tobacco farmers this year, spokeswoman Dedrey Mutimutema said.  “These lines of credit have been structured in such a
manner that they will fund the entire value chain in the
production of green-leaf tobacco,” Mutimutema said in an e-
mailed statement from Harare, the capital. “The funds will
cover input financing, grower financing, processing, export
logistics as well as export debtors.”  The funds will come from Nedbank and Egypt-based Africa
Export Import Bank, she said.  Tobacco is planted between September and November in
Zimbabwe. The southern African nation may sell 150 million
kilograms (330 million pounds) of the crop this year, according
to the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board. While output of the
leaves is recovering, it’s still below peak levels of about 236
million kilograms achieved in 2000.  Zimbabwe  mostly produces
flue-cured Virginia tobacco.  The crop was Zimbabwe’s biggest export earner before 2000,
when President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front began an seizing white-owned commercial farms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
