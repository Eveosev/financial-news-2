Japan ’s preferential rates for
surplus solar power for the three months starting April 1 will
be unchanged from current rates, the government said.  Utilities will pay 42 yen (52 U.S. cents) a kilowatt-hour
for the power generated by homes and 40 yen for non-residential
installations, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said
in a  statement  today.  The prices will be valid until July, when Japan starts a
feed-in tariff program that will pay above-market rates for
clean energy, including solar and wind power. Rates for the
feed-in tariff program haven’t been decided.  The ministry plans to retain the preferential rate program
for residential surplus solar power after July, according to
Masato Yasuda, a trade ministry official in charge of promoting
renewable energy. Surplus solar power from non-residential
facilities will be bought under the tariff program, he said.  The ministry usually sets rates for surplus solar power in
March for the financial year starting April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
