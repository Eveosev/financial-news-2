Vivendi SA (VIV)  is in talks with
potential buyers of  Universal Music  Group assets destined to
finance the purchase of EMI Group’s recorded music unit, Chief
Financial Officer Philippe Capron said today.  Vivendi, which said in November it would look at selling
500 million euros ($666 million) worth of assets, plans to wrap
up these divestments by the second half of 2012, Capron said
after the Paris-based company’s annual earnings press
conference.  “We want to get this done by the time regulators give
their verdict on the Universal Music and EMI  transaction ,”
Capron said.  Universal Music, Vivendi’s music unit, agreed to buy EMI’s
recorded music operations in November for 1.2 billion pounds
($1.9 billion). The European Commission has set an initial
deadline of March 23 to rule on the deal, which is also being
scrutinized by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy  said today he
expects a regulatory decision in the second half of 2012.  Levy has been orienting Vivendi more toward the music and
television businesses, as French telecommunications unit SFR
comes under pressure from increased competition.  Vivendi shares tumbled as much as 9.4 percent today in
Paris trading after the company forecast a profit slump through
2013. It said SFR is looking to cut costs to cope with falling
prices and revenue after new competitor  Iliad SA (ILD)  started a
mobile service at a discounted price in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
