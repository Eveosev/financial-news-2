Lithuania will provide details on
the usage of European Union funds in 2010 to reverse the
suspension this week of regional development aid to the Baltic
nation, Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte  said.  At issue is 26 million litai ($10 million) in aid from a
total of 3 billion litai allocated for 2010, the minister said
last night on the television program Panorama. The European
Commission, the EU’s executive arm, asked for details on the use
of the funds after Lithuania’s state auditor raised questions
over projects that received funding from the bloc.  “The European Commission asked us to provide additional
information about the issue after the state auditor’s report,”
Simonyte said. “We will continue to finance European projects
as usual, which is that we finance the projects from our own
funds and get reimbursed later. European projects will continue
to be carried out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
