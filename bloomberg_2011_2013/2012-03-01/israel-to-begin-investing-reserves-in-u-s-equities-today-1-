The  Bank of Israel  will begin today
a pilot program to invest a portion of its foreign currency
reserves in U.S. equities.  The investment, which in the initial phase will amount to 2
percent of the $77 billion reserves, or about $1.5 billion, will
be made through UBS AG and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , Bank of Israel
spokesman Yossi Saadon said in a telephone interview today. At a
later stage, the investment is expected to increase to 10
percent of the reserves.  A small number of central banks have started investing part
of their reserves in equities. About 9 percent of the foreign-
exchange reserves of Switzerlandâ€™s central bank were invested in
shares at the end of the third quarter, the Swiss bank said on
its website.  The investment will be made in equity index trackers and
will include between 1,500 to 2,000 shares, among them stocks
like  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Saadon said.  The central bank decided to add equities to its investment
portfolio in order to diversify, reduce risk and give better
performance, Barry Topf, senior adviser to Governor  Stanley Fischer , said in a Dec. 1 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
