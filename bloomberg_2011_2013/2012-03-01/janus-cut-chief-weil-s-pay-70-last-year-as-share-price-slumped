Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS)  cut the pay
of Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil 70 percent last year
as the Denver-based money manager lost more than half of its
market value.  Weil earned $6.15 million in 2011, down from $20.3 million
the year before, Janus said in a regulatory filing today. In
2010, Weil received $10 million in stock as a signing bonus
after he joined the company from Pacific Investment Management
Co. in  Newport Beach , California. The pay cut was 40 percent,
excluding the one-time bonus, Janus said.  Janus’s 2011 results were hurt by “challenges” in the
performance of its large cap growth strategies and shifts away
from equity on the part of institutional clients, the company
said in the filing. Janus managed $148 billion as of Dec. 31.  Janus, the owner of Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, has
gained 44 percent this year. The company said in January that
Chairman Steven L. Scheid will retire in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
