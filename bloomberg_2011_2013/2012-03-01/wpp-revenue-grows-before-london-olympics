WPP Plc (WPP) , the largest  advertising
agency , said revenue from continuing businesses will grow 4
percent this year as the London Olympics and U.S. presidential
elections buoy the industry.  Sales last year rose 7.4 percent to 10 billion pounds
($16 billion), the Dublin-based company said in a statement
today. The average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for revenue of 9.96 billion pounds.  WPP plans to spend 300 million pounds to 400 million pounds
on acquisitions this year, Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  said in an interview today. The company is betting that
expansion in faster-growing markets, such as Brazil and  China ,
and new technology to facilitate digital ads will help the
company weather a potential slowdown in 2013.  “One cloud on the horizon is what happens in 2013, post
the election in the  United States ,” Sorrell said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. “We are seeing more muted
growth in terms of GDP.”  WPP agreed to buy almost three dozen companies or units
last year, and has announced another 10 deals so far in 2012
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. WPP spent 469.8 million
pounds last year on acquisitions, more than twice the investment
of 2010. The company has added 5,000 employees and will continue
to add workers if the business grows, Sorrell said.  WPP  shares climbed  3.4 percent to 830.5 pence at 8:48 a.m.
in London trading.  Debt Crisis  Adjusted earnings per share, excluding a one-time effect
from a tax provision, were 67.7 pence. Analysts in the Bloomberg
survey had predicted 65.6 pence before extraordinary items.  The London Olympics and European soccer championships this
summer, as well as the U.S. presidential elections should buoy
the industry this year. Still, customers in  Europe  are
struggling with a debt crisis that could hurt growth in 2013,
Sorrell has said. Because of this, less expensive digital ads
are becoming more popular, he said.  WPP will spend $2 billion on Google Inc. ads this year, up
from $1.6 billion in 2011, Sorrell said. The Facebook Inc. and
Twitter Inc. social networking services will also get a larger
amount from the agency, he said.  In December, ZenithOptimedia, a Publicis Groupe SA-owned
company that publishes research on advertising, lowered its
forecast for the industry’s performance this year to 3.5 percent
growth from an initial prediction of 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
