Munich prosecutors conducted 86
raids in  Germany  and other countries yesterday in a probe of
stock fraud, market manipulation, breach of trust and  insider
trading .  Fifty-three raids took place in Germany, 29 in other
European countries and four outside  Europe , Thomas Steinkraus-
Koch, a spokesman for Munich prosecutors, said in an e-mail.
Several people are being investigated, he said, declining to
identify them or the stock involved. The operation was handled
by 11 prosecutors, 10 employees at financial regulator Bafin and
200 police officers.  Munich prosecutors have previously investigated fraud where
suspects used publications to inflate the price of penny stocks.
Earlier this year, prosecutors won convictions of several people
involved in a scheme using a newsletter for small investors.  “We are looking into allegations that share prices may
have been manipulated by using publications,” he said.
“Because that case is pending, we can’t say more now. We are
just at the beginning.”  Steinkraus-Koch said while the new probe is bigger as more
suspects are concerned, similar methods were used in the earlier
cases his office handled. The shares are mostly those of smaller
and lesser-known companies, he said.  “It’s easier to influence the shares prices of small
companies this way,” he said. “It would be much more difficult
to do it with the stock of huge corporations.”  Munich prosecutors asked investigators in other nations to
help in the probe, he said, without adding more details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
