Dutch manufacturing rose to the
highest level in six months in February, its first increase in
the same period, according to the Dutch institute for purchasing
and supply management NEVI.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region rose to 50.3 in February from 49 in January,
Zoetermeer, the Netherlands-based NEVI said on its website
today. It passed the 50 mark, indicating expansion, for the
first time since September, NEVI said.  The index is based on a survey of about 350  purchasing
managers  by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
