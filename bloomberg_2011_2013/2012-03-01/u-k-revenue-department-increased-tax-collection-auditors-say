Britain’s Revenue and Customs office
raised 4.3 billion pounds ($6.9 billion) from programs aimed at
preventing  tax evasion  in the five years through 2011, the
public spending watchdog said.  The National Audit Office said in a report today that the
revenue department will collect an additional 8.9 billion pounds
of extra tax between the current year and the fiscal year
through March 2015. The office could raise even more revenue
were it not for “slippage in delivering projects.”  “The department could achieve better value for money from
its investment in compliance work by improved understanding of
the impact of individual projects and ensuring that its staff
have the capacity to exploit new systems to the full,” Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said in an e-mailed
statement in  London  today.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is under
pressure to close tax loopholes used by the wealthy at a time
when he is cutting spending and raising taxes to narrow the
 budget deficit .  The Treasury this week announced it had acted to stop the
use of two “aggressive” tax-avoidance schemes disclosed by a
bank, ensuring the payment of more than 500 million pounds in
tax. Barclays Bank Plc subsequently said that it was the
institution involved, adding that it would comply with the
decision to close the loopholes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
