Global sugar supply will be “under
pressure” amid significant demand growth by 2020, which may
push prices up further, according to Mannheim, Germany-based
refiner  Suedzucker AG. (SZU)   World sugar demand is expected to grow 24 percent to 198
million metric tons by 2019-20 from 2008-09 because of
population and wealth growth, Thomas Kirchberg, a Suedzucker
management board member, said, citing the United Nation’s Food
and Agriculture Organization’s data.  The big question is who will be able to deal with these
additional demands, Kirchberg asked at a  conference  in Moscow
today. Brazil, the world’s largest producer, shipped about 26
million tons in 2010-11 and is close to its output potential, he
said.  Thailand , the number two exporter, may face weather risks
and Africa needs infrastructure, agriculture and logistical
investment, he said.  Growing sugar demand and the supply-side uncertainty could
push prices higher by 2020, Kirchberg said after the conference
without elaborating on figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
