Now that  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s market value
has exceeded $500 billion, the biggest challenge for the maker
of iPhones and iPad tablet computers may be staying there.  Apple is the sixth U.S. company that has ever crossed the
threshold, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor’s. The
others are  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO) , Intel Corp. and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , in chronological order.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, all five companies were
below $500 billion a year after reaching that pinnacle,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. GE was the only one to
surpass that value afterward.  “Getting there is hard,” Howard Silverblatt, a New York-
based senior index analyst at S&P, wrote yesterday in an e-mail.
“Staying there is harder.”  GE’s market value exceeded half a trillion dollars for the
first time on Dec. 20, 1999, based on closing stock prices. The
capitalization of the industrial-products and financial-services
company fell below that level on Dec. 19, 2000. It was above the
threshold in May and June 2001, peaking at $530.4 billion before
dropping again.  Exxon Mobil had the second-longest time gap, nine months,
between its first and last close at more than $500 billion. The
comparable gap for Microsoft was 8 1/2 months, while Cisco’s was
two weeks. Intel only surpassed that amount twice, on Aug. 23
and Aug. 31, 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
