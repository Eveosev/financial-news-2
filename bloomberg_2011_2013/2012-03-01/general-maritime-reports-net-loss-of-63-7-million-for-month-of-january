General Maritime Corp. (GMR) , the second-
largest U.S. owner of  oil tankers  reorganizing in bankruptcy,
reported a net loss of $63.7 million for the month ended Jan.
31.  The net loss since its Nov. 17 bankruptcy filing is $103.5
million, and total assets are $1.67 billion, according to the
operating report filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court yesterday.
Assets include cash of $15 million and vessels valued at $1.5
billion.  On Feb. 28, the New York-based company won provisional
court approval to reorganize even as a bankruptcy judge told
creditors to prepare their evidence for an expected fight over
final approval of a Chapter 11 plan. The proposed terms will
cancel all of General Maritime’s old stock and give all the
stock in a new company to  Oaktree Capital Management LP (OAKTRZ) .  Reorganization costs made up the bulk of the company’s
expenses, at $54 million, including a $44.9 million write-off of
a discount on its Oaktree credit facility and another $7.6
million related to deferred financing costs on the debt.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn overruled most
objections from a committee of unsecured creditors at the Feb.
28 hearing, and said they can pursue their arguments at a final
hearing on the plan in April. Unsecured creditors had objected
to the plan, saying Oaktree had a deal with the company “locked
up” and that the reorganization proposal wasn’t made in “good
faith,” citing a long relationship between Oaktree and General
Maritime Chairman Peter Georgiopoulos.  General Maritime operates in more than 230 ports of call in
more than 70 countries. The company listed assets of $1.71
billion and debt of $1.41 billion in its Chapter 11 petition in
November.  The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
