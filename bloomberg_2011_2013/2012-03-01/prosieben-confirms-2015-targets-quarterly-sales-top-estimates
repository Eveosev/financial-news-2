ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) ,  Germany ’s
biggest private broadcaster, said it is confident about reaching
its 2015 targets after investments in online games and video-on-
demand services boosted sales and earnings last year.  Recurring earnings from continuing operations before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 1.7 percent
to 317.7 million euros ($423 million) in the fourth quarter, the
Unterfoehring-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg had  estimated  an average
Ebitda of 310.4 million euros.  ProSieben is expanding its video-on-demand and digital
businesses to reduce its dependence on advertising. It has
struck deals with makers of online games such as Sony Online
Entertainment and is also ramping up production and sale of
shows such as the culinary game show “Mama’s Big Cook-Off” and
hidden camera show “Benidorm Bastards” to other broadcasters.
The company wants to add 750 million euros in additional revenue
over five years ending 2015.  “We have already achieved approximately 25 percent of the
750 million euros aimed for, and are therefore confident that we
will realize our entire growth potential by 2015,” Chief
Executive Officer Thomas Ebeling said in the statement. “We
will push forward the integration of TV with our online, paid-
content and mobile services.”  Recurring revenue, excluding the broadcasting and print-
media operations in  Belgium  and the Netherlands that were sold
to a group led by Finland’s  Sanoma Oyj (SAA1V)  last spring, were up 5.4
percent to 873.7 million euros. Eight analysts had estimated
sales of 852.5 million euros.  The shares have gained 38 percent this year, valuing the
broadcaster at 4.3 billion euros. The stock climbed 2.3 percent
to 19.51 euros in Frankfurt trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
