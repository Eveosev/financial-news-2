-- CGG Veritas, the world’s largest
seismic surveyor of oilfields, said demand for its services is
strengthening after recording a loss in 2011.  Net income slipped to $21 million in the fourth quarter
from $53 million in the last three months of 2010, the company
said today in a statement in Paris. The full-year loss was $13
million, which included one-time charges related to
restructuring the business of $42 million.  The company fell 0.4 percent to 23.10 euros by the close of
Paris trade, extending the loss in the past year to 14 percent.  CGG Veritas was hurt by uprisings in Libya and parts of the
 Middle East  as well as the slowdown in  Gulf of Mexico  following
the worst U.S. oil spill in 2010. Oil companies may spend more
to collect seismic data as  oil prices  hold above $100 a barrel,
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Georges Malcor said.  “Looking forward into 2012, in the context of a strong oil
price environment, exploration and production spending is
expected to continue to grow,” said Malcor in a statement.
“The ongoing strengthening of our high-end positioning and
technological differentiation positions us to fully benefit from
the expected robust seismic market conditions.”  The company’s order backlog rose 18 percent in the fourth
quarter from the third quarter to $1.46 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
