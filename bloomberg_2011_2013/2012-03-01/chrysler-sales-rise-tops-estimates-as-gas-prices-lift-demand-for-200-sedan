U.S. auto sales accelerated to the
fastest pace in four years, led by Chrysler Group LLC and a
surprise gain from  General Motors Co. (GM) , as demand strengthened
throughout automakers’ lineups.  GM deliveries rose 1.1 percent to 209,306 cars and light
trucks, beating analysts’ estimates for a 4.8 percent decrease.
Chrysler sales increased 40 percent to 133,521 and  Ford Motor
Co. (F) ’s climbed 14 percent to 178,644. Toyota Motor Corp. and
Honda Motor Co. deliveries each gained 12 percent, while Nissan
Motor Co. sales rose 16 percent.  Light-vehicle sales in February accelerated to a 15.1
million seasonally adjusted annual  rate , exceeding the 14.2
million pace that was the average of 17 analysts’ estimates. The
results were the best since February 2008 when U.S. sales ran at
a 15.5 million rate, according to Autodata Corp.  “Everyone’s kind of blowing us out of the water,” Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said yesterday in a
phone interview. “For fuel-efficient vehicles, we expected to
see demand as gasoline prices really surged through the month,
but the big surprise is on the truck front. It speaks to the
broad-based nature of this recovery.”  The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a 26 percent gain for Chrysler and 9.4 increase for
Ford. The average of seven estimates was for an 8.2 percent
increase for Toyota, 4.5 percent gain for Honda and 6.1 percent
rise for Nissan. U.S. auto sales ran at a 13.3 million pace in
February 2011, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based
researcher Autodata.  Consumer Confidence  Consumers gained confidence in February as the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  exceeded 13,000 for the first time since May
2008 and the  unemployment  rate fell to the lowest in  three
years . The improving economy may have blunted the impact of
rising gasoline prices. The average price for a gallon of
regular unleaded increased 14 percent through the first two
months of the year to  $3.74 (3AGSREG) , according to AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring group.  “It seems we’ve all underestimated the strength in the
retail numbers,”  Jesse Toprak , an analyst for the auto-pricing
website TrueCar.com, said yesterday in a phone interview.
“There’s pent-up demand being met even for larger vehicles
because consumers are feeling more comfortable.”  Ford plans to increase second-quarter production in  North
America  by 2.8 percent to 730,000 cars and trucks, the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company said in a statement. The company’s
forecast exceeds IHS Automotive’s estimate that Ford would cut
output to 686,000 vehicles.  Chrysler Cars  Chrysler’s car sales more than doubled to 40,024 from
17,745 a year earlier. Deliveries of the 200 more than
quadrupled to 9,717, and 300 sedan sales climbed to 7,670,
almost six times more than a year earlier,  Auburn Hills ,
Michigan-based Chrysler said in a statement.  Total industry sales rose 16 percent to 1.15 million cars
and light trucks, according to Autodata. The results included a
24 percent increase for car deliveries and a 7.6 percent gain
for light trucks.  “It’s been a long time since we’ve sold more than 1
million cars in the month of February,”  Maryann Keller ,
principal of a self-named consulting firm in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg
Radio. “It’s been a function of a very warm winter. It’s also
helped that lenders are now competing for the business.”  GM increased sales of the Chevrolet Equinox small sport-
utility vehicle by 16 percent to 17,851, according to a
 statement . The Detroit-based automaker’s deliveries of Cruze
compacts gained 10 percent to 20,427.  ‘Quite Healthy’  GM lowered incentive spending by 4.2 percent from a year
earlier to $2,895 per vehicle, according to an e-mailed
statement that cited data from Westlake Village, California-
based J.D. Power & Associates.  “Given that incentive spend is responsible and we still
had a pretty solid year-over-year increase, the industry looks
quite healthy,” David Whiston, an analyst at  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) 
in  Chicago , said yesterday in a phone interview.  GM shares rose 1.7 percent to $26.47 at the close in  New
York . They have gained 31 percent so far this year. Ford gained
2.3 percent to $12.66.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , the affiliates that
operate separately, combined to increase sales 26 percent from a
year earlier. The Seoul-based companies beat the average of five
analysts’ estimates for a 19 percent gain.  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) , which is targeting U.S. sales growth of more
than 10 percent this year, said combined deliveries of its
namesake and Audi-branded vehicles rose 34 percent to 39,108.
The average estimate of three analysts was for a 33 percent
gain.  Supply Rebounds  Japan ’s tsunami limited  Toyota (7203)  and Honda’s production and
depleted their inventories for almost half of 2011. With
supplies rebounding, the industry sales rate has exceeded 14
million in consecutive months for the first time since May 2008.  Toyota delivered 20,593 Prius hybrids in February, a 52
percent increase from a year earlier. The Toyota City, Japan-
based automaker also boosted sales of Camry, its top-selling
model, by 27 percent to 34,543.  Honda’s Civic deliveries climbed 42 percent to 27,087. The
Tokyo-based automaker followed a monthly sales increase for
January that was its first since the Tokyo-based automaker’s
inventory plunged following Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in
March.  “February felt great,”  Al Castignetti , vice president of
U.S. sales for Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan, said yesterday in a
phone interview. “Consumer demand is coming back, and I think
it’s coming back fairly aggressively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
