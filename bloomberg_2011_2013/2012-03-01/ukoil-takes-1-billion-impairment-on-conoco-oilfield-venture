OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, recorded a $955 million impairment charge after a
venture with  ConocoPhillips (COP)  found less oil than expected.  Lukoil recorded the charge in the fourth quarter at its OOO
Narianmarneftegaz venture with ConocoPhillips, it said in a
statement. Lower production at the northern Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu
deposit due to “unanticipated geological reasons” resulted in
estimated field reserves falling to 142 million barrels at the
end of 2011 from 505 million barrels in 2008.  “It’s a paper loss reflecting the problems with the asset,
which were already in the market,” Artem Konchin, an oil and
gas analyst at  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said by phone from Moscow.  Net income of $1.35 billion compared with profit of $2.19
billion in the same period a year earlier, the Moscow-based
company said in a filing today. That missed the average estimate
of $2.69 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Full-year net income at Lukoil reached a record $10.4
billion. Russian oil producers have posted record earnings for
2011 after unrest in the  Middle East  pushed average prices for
the country’s Urals export blend to more than $100 a barrel.  Lukoil has moved to expand internationally in West Africa,
Iraq, Venezuela and Vietnam, after taxes and laws limited its
access to Russian resources. This may mean additional expenses
as international prospects lack the benefit of geological data
inherited from the Soviet era.  The company’s expenses for wells that failed to find
commercial oil almost doubled to $417 million last year, Lukoil
said in the statement. Dry wells, as they are called, cost $181
million in Ghana, $149 million in the  Ivory Coast  and $27
million in Vietnam, Lukoil said.  Revenue rose to $133.7 billion in 2011 from $105 billion in
2010, Lukoil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
