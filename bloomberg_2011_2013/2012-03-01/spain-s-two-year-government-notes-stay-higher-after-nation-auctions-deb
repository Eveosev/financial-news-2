Spanish two-year notes stayed higher
after the nation sold 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2014, 2015 and 2016, meeting its maximum target for
the auction.  Two-year note yields were 10 basis points lower at 2.23
percent at 9:58 a.m. London time. Ten-year yields were nine
basis points lower at 4.90 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio on the 4 percent bonds maturing in
July 2015 was 2.37, compared with 2.19 when they were sold on
Feb. 16. The amount of 2016 bonds was covered 2.59 times over,
compared with 3.24 times on Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
