U.S. stocks  pared gains  as oil
rallied above $110 a barrel for the first time since May amid
reports of a pipeline explosion in  Saudi Arabia .  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,370.43 at 3:38 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.8
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little
changed, wiping out a 81 point rally. Crude surged 2.5 percent
to $109.73 in electronic trading and jumped as high as $110.55.
Treasuries remained lower, with the yield on the 10-year note
climbing five basis points to 2.03 percent.  Analysts including  Hamza Khan  of Schork Group and John
Kilduff of Again Capital LLC attributed the surge in oil prices
to speculation that a pipeline in Saudi Arabia had exploded.
Earlier gains came amid a rally in financial shares as borrowing
costs declined for Spain and  France , while government data
showed that jobless claims matched a four-year low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
