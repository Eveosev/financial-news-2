The U.K. finance regulator arrested
three people in an  insider trading  investigation and searched
premises in the northwest of  England .  A 43-year-old man, 42-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman
were arrested by the Financial Services Authority and local
police in Lancashire and Cheshire and are in custody for
questioning, the regulator said in a statement today. The
searches of three locations took place this morning in Northwich
and Rossendale.  The FSA, which hadnâ€™t prosecuted insider trading before
2008, secured the longest-ever U.K. sentence for the crime a
year ago when former Dresdner Kleinwort banker Christian Littlewood was imprisoned for 40 months after admitting illegal
trading over a 10-year period, along with his wife and an
accomplice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
