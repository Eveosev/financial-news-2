Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA  and
Soc. Matriz  SAAM SA (SMSAAM)  moved in opposite directions in their first
trading day as separate entities as part of a plan by  Latin
America ’s biggest container shipper to return to profitability.  CSAV rose 21 percent to 41.74 pesos at the close in
Santiago after factoring in the spinoff of its port logistics
unit known as SAAM. In its first day of trading today, SAAM
opened at 70 pesos before sliding to 62.71 pesos.  “The market was enthusiastic about SAAM and that made its
shares begin trading at a high price, but the euphoria has been
wearing off during the day,” said Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst
at Santiago-based brokerage Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA.
“This was pretty much expected in the post-split scenario.”  SAAM, which had net income of $52 million in 2010 according
to a presentation on the company’s website, was spun off as part
of a restructuring that saw  Chile ’s Luksic family secure control
of CSAV through a capital increases. Holders received 1.117 new
shares in SAAM for each Vapores share.  The Luksic’s holding company  Quinenco SA (QUINENC)  now owns a
controlling 37 percent stake in CSAV and an equal percentage of
SAAM.  CSAV posted a record $1.25 billion loss last year as a drop
in shipping rates because of overcapacity in the industry and
rising fuel prices eroded margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
