Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  is
preparing to start operating regular flights between  Brazil  and
the U.S., O Estado de S. Paulo reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Gol received approval this month from Brazil’s civil
aviation agency, known as Anac, to operate 14 flights a week to
the U.S. and has a period of 180 days from Feb. 17 to request
the routes it wants to operate, according to the newspaper. So
far, no formal request has been made, O Estado said.  Gol confirmed its interest in returning to the U.S. market
but didn’t provide details of its plan, according to O Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
