U.S. homes in or nearing  foreclosure 
accounted for almost a fourth of residential purchases in the
last three months of 2011 as lenders approved more short sales,
where the price is less than the amount owed.  Deals for bank-owned and distressed properties rose to 24
percent of total home sales from 20 percent in the third
quarter, according to RealtyTrac Inc. The transactions fell from
26 percent a year earlier, the Irvine, California-based  data
seller  said today in a statement.  “We expect to see foreclosure-related sales increase in
2012, particularly pre-foreclosure sales,” Chief Executive
Officer Bandon Moore said in the statement.  Banks may “aggressively” resume unloading distressed
property after an 18-month delay brought on by federal and state
legal probes into flawed foreclosure paperwork and
documentation, Moore said. The fourth quarter showed lenders
turning to short sales as a “better option” than holding a
house whose borrower doesn’t make any payments, he said.  The number of short sales jumped 15 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2010 while purchases of bank-owned houses fell 12
percent, according to RealtyTrac. Pre-foreclosure deals
outnumbered bank-owned sales in the “bellwether” cities of  Los
Angeles , Miami and Phoenix, Moore said.  “That trend will likely show up in more local markets in
2012,” he said.  A total of 88,303 pre-foreclosure properties sold in the
fourth quarter, making up 10 percent of all transactions.  Bank Settlement  Five of the top U.S. mortgage lenders last month reached
settlements worth more than $25 billion with the federal
government and all 50 states following investigations into
abusive foreclosure practices. The lenders agreed to provide $17
billion in mortgage forgiveness programs, $3 billion in
refinancing and cash payments to about 750,000 borrowers who
lost their homes.  For the full year, purchases of foreclosures and distressed
houses totaled 907,138, down 2 percent from 2010 and accounting
for 23 percent of all home sales, RealtyTrac said. There were
204,080 such deals in the fourth quarter, down 8 percent from
the previous three months and 2 percent from a year earlier.  Bank-owned (HOMFREO)  home sales totaled 115,777 in the fourth quarter
and sold for an average $164,944, little changed from the third
quarter and down 5 percent from a year earlier, RealtyTrac said.
The price represents an average discount of 29 percent compared
with non-foreclosure properties, down from 34 percent in the
third quarter and 35 percent a year earlier.  Pre-foreclosure homes sold for an average $184,221 in the
fourth quarter, down 3 percent from the previous three months
and 11 percent from a year earlier. The 88,303 properties sold
at an average 21 percent discount relative to non-distressed
houses.  RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
