The rand led major-currency gains
against the dollar and bond yields rose to the highest in more
than a month after a gauge of manufacturing rose to a two-year
high, adding to signs of a revival in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  South Africa ’s currency climbed 0.5 percent to 7.4665 per
dollar as of 12:30 p.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest gain out of
16 most-traded currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The yield on
nation’s 77 billion rand ($7.5 billion) of 6.75 percent bonds
due 2021 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
7.89 percent, the highest since Jan. 23.  South Africa’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 57.9 in
February, from 53.2 the month before, beating the 52.3 media
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Manufacturing,
which accounts for 15 percent of the nation’s gross domestic
product, expanded in the last three months of 2011 after
contracting in the second and third quarters, lifting economic
growth from close to a two-year low.  “It was a lot better than expected, and that is quite
positive” for the rand, Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury
strategic research at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Group Ltd.,
said by phone. “Risk appetite is still there, and that is going
to continue to buoy emerging-market currencies.”  China’s manufacturing improved for a third month in
February and data later today may show U.S. factory activity
climbed to an eight-month high, brightening the outlook for
global growth. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
drop in unemployment has been more rapid than expected. China
and the U.S. buy 19 percent of South Africa’s exports, according
to government data for 2011.  ‘Rand Resilience’  “The outlook for the  U.S. economy  continues to improve,”
 George Glynos , an economist at Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics,
wrote in e-mailed comments today. “Rand resilience may be a
feature for a while to come.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
probably rose to 54.5 in February from 54.1 in January,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the data today. Readings above 50 signal
growth. A separate report today may show consumer purchases in
the world’s largest economy increased 0.4 percent in January.  China ’s purchasing managers’ index increased to 51.0 last
month from 50.5 in January, the nation’s statistics bureau and
logistics federation said in a statement today. China is South
Africa’s biggest export destination.  South Africa’s $1.5 billion of 4.665 percent bonds due 2024
gained, driving the yield down 1.3 basis points to 4.18 percent,
the lowest since the bonds were first sold on Jan. 17. The
premium investors demand to hold the debt rather than  U.S.
Treasuries  narrowed three basis points to 219 basis points, the
lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
