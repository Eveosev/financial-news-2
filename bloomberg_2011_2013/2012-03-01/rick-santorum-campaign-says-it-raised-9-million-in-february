Former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  raised $9 million last month in his quest for the
Republican presidential nomination, his campaign spokesman

raised through Jan. 31 for his campaign. The spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said on Twitter that Santorum had received more than
130,000 donations last month.  Santorum won primaries in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri
in February and narrowly lost to former Massachusetts governor
Mitt Romney in  Michigan .  Campaign finance reports are due at the Federal Election
Commission March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
