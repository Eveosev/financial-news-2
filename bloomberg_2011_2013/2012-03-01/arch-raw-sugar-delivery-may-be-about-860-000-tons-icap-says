Raw sugar delivered against the
expired March futures contract in  New York  may be about 860,000
metric tons, according to ICAP do Brasil CTVM.  The sugar is likely to come from Brazil, Thailand, Central
America and the  Philippines , Juliano Ferreira, a broker at the
Sao Paulo-based company, said by phone today, citing market
estimates.  The March contract expired yesterday on ICE Futures U.S.
and the first notice for delivery is later today. Cargill Inc.
took delivery of almost 1 million tons of raw sugar after the
March 2011 contract expired on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
