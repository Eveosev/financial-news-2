The Serbian Parliament backed
sovereign guarantees of as much as $1.8 billion in 2012,
boosting public-debt levels further beyond limits before general
elections in May.  The loans for new energy and road infrastructure, a state-
sponsored residential project, repayment of some old debts and
fresh liquidity for debt-laden, state-owned flag carrier JAT
Airways and drugmaker Galenika AD are equivalent to almost 10
percent of the country’s existing public debt.  The government will be issuing guarantees to Serbian units
of Italy’s  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , France’s  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,
Austria’s  Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank AD (0005637D)  and the Dutch unit of  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Serbia ’s  Komercijalna Banka AD (KMBN)  and  AIK Banka AD (AIKB) ,
the  Export-Import Bank of China , Japan’s International
Cooperation Agency, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Investment Bank, the Council of
Europe’s Development Bank and the government of Azerbaijan, for
13 different loans.  The approved guarantees exclude the Srbijagas gas monopoly
and state railways operator Zeleznice Srbije, whose planned
borrowing would have doubled the total.  Sovereign guarantees worth 2.7 billion euros ($3.5 billion)
under the 2012 budget, along with 4.4 billion euros worth of
government’s own borrowing, led to a freeze of Serbia’s $1.3
billion precautionary loan deal with the  International Monetary
Fund .  The IMF includes sovereign guarantees in public debt
calculations and Serbia doesn’t. Late last year, the state took
over 700 million euros in sovereign-backed debt from Zeleznice
Srbije, road operator Putevi Srbije and several non-profit
public institutions.  Public debt stood at 14.47 billion euros ($19.47 billion)
at the end of last year, or 45.1 percent of GDP, according to
the Finance Ministry. The central bank says the nominal debt
figure is equal to 47 percent of GDP and above the 45 percent
legal cap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
