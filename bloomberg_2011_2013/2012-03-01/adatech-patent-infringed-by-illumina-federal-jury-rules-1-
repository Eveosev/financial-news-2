LadaTech LLC, a biotech company
partly owned by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , won a jury verdict that
rival Illumina Inc. infringed a patent for gene-manipulation
techniques used in diagnosing disease.  The jury in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, also
decided that the patent owned by LadaTech, of Larchmont,  New
York , is valid and enforceable, according to court papers.  LadaTech sued San Diego-based Illumina in 2009. The trial
was supervised by U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson. The jury
didn’t rule on damages. That phase of the case hasn’t been
scheduled.  “This verdict is an important reaffirmation of the
importance of the LadaTech patent” Chief Executive Officer
Nicholas Didier said in a statement today.  Illumina intends to appeal the jury’s finding of
infringement, the company said in a statement.  “We believe that we acted properly with respect to the
LadaTech patent and that, ultimately, our position will be
vindicated,” Jay Flatley, Illumina’s chief executive, said in a
statement.  The case is LadaTech LLC v.  Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , 09CV627, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,107,023.  To contact the reporters on this story:
