Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest
provider of temporary workers, gained as much as 7 percent in
Zurich trading after raising its dividend to 1.80 Swiss francs
($1.99) a share.  Adecco traded at 48.17 francs at 9:42 a.m. in
Zurich, 6.2 percent higher, after reporting fourth-quarter net
income of 133 million euros, beating analysts’ estimates of
119.3 million euros.  The larger dividend, a 64 percent increase on the previous
year’s payout and more than the 1 franc forecast by Bloomberg,
“should be seen in the long term because it’s really a change
in strategy,” Chief Financial Officer Dominik de Daniel said in
a telephone interview.  Additional share buybacks aren’t an option for the
Glattbrugg, Switzerland-based company as it already holds a
maximum 10 percent treasury shares allowed under Swiss law,
according to the CFO. Adecco plans to pay dividend ratios of  40
to 50 percent of net income, compared with 25 to 30 percent
previously, he said.  Adecco’s results are a “positive surprise with
particularly strong  cash flow ,” said  Michael Foeth , an analyst
at Vontobel, who confirmed his “buy” rating on the stock.  The company is the second-best performing stock in
Switzerland’s benchmark SMI Index this year, gaining 22 percent.
 Manpower Inc. (MAN)  added 20 percent in the same period and  Randstad
Holding NV (RAND)  increased 27 percent.  While revenues in Adecco’s biggest market, France, remained
unchanged in 2011, “increased investment will boost margins”
in the country in 2012, Chief Executive Officer Patrick De Maeseneire said on a conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
