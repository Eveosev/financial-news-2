An industry-led effort to reduce the
environmental impact of oil-sands production may generate new
business areas for  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , designated Chief
Executive Officer Steve Williams said.  Suncor,  Total SA (FP) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are
among the 12 companies that agreed today to pool resources to
reduce water, air and land pollution from bitumen extraction in
Alberta.  “This is unprecedented in the world in any industry, this
degree of collaboration,” Williams said in an interview in
Calgary. “That model is very interesting for lots of our
initiatives.”  Oil-sands producers have come under pressure from some
groups about the effect the process has on the environment.
Extracting the bitumen creates toxic waste ponds, causes the
destruction of forests and animal habitats and increases
greenhouse-gas emissions, the nonprofit energy-sustainability
group Pembina Institute said in a 2011 report.  The industry group, known as  Canada ’s Oil Sands Innovation
Alliance, will share technology and processes in the areas of
greenhouse-gas emissions, water use, land reclamation and ponds
used to store toxic waste from mining bitumen.  There may be opportunities for new business areas or
applying the collaborative process to other industries, said
Williams, who will take over as CEO from Rick George after the
company’s annual shareholders’ meeting in May. Williams now
serves as chief operating officer and president of the Calgary-
based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
