Mexico ’s peso rose after first-time
claims for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S. dropped,
boosting the outlook for the economy of the Latin American
country’s biggest trading partner.  The peso gained 0.6 percent to 12.7816 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:23 a.m. in Mexico City, from 12.8624 yesterday. The currency
has advanced 9 percent this year.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 2,000 in the
week ended Feb. 25 to 351,000 in the U.S., less than the 355,000
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, Labor Department figures
showed today. The number matches that in the Feb. 11 week, which
was the lowest since March 2008. The U.S. is the destination of
about 80 percent of Mexican exports.  “The market took it well,” Pepe Curiel, a currency trader
at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico City.
“The Mexican economy is very connected to the American economy
because we’re neighbors and because it’s our biggest trading
partner. Good data from the U.S. also influences us because of
this closeness.”  The yield on the peso-denominated debt due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.51 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.16
centavo to 130.20 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
