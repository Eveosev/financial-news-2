Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY)  said Europe’s
aluminum industry, struggling with surplus capacity, still
enjoys a “firm” physical market that’s reflected in the
premiums paid for the lightweight metal.  “Even with the high inventory level, the physical market
is still tight,” Norsk Hydro Chief Executive Officer Svein
Richard Brandtzaeg said in an interview in Oslo. “That is also
reflected in the premiums that we see in standard ingots in
Europe.”  Aluminum producers have cut output as metal prices fell and
costs increased. Hydro curtailed annual production by 60,000
metric tons, or one-third, at its Kurri Kurri smelter in
Australia last month and has reduced output at its Neuss plant
in Germany to 50,000 tons a year from 230,000 tons.  Premiums in  Europe  rose to $180 to $190 a ton last month in
Rotterdam from $160 to $170 in January and are set to rise
further should demand remain stable, Marco Georgiou, an analyst
at CRU in  London , said Feb. 23. Buyers in  Japan  agreed to pay
higher premiums for shipments starting in April, the first
increase in three quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
