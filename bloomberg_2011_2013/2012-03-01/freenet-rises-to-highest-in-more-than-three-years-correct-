(Corrects time period in first paragraph.)  Freenet AG (FNTN)  advanced to the highest
level in three-and-a-half years in Frankfurt trading after
proposing to pay a dividend for 2011 of 1 euro per share as
profit rose.  The stock gained as much as 10 percent to 11.19 euros, its
highest price since August, 2008, and traded up 9.7 percent at
11.16 euros at 3.44 p.m.  Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose to 337.4 million euros ($450 million) in 2011
from 334.9 million euros a year earlier,  Germany ’s biggest non-
network telecommunications company, led by Chief Executive
Christoph Vilanek since 2009, said in a statement.  “We rate the 2011 results strong and almost dare to say
that CEO Vilanek has completed his mission to stabilize the
business,” Joeri Sels, an analyst at  DZ Bank , wrote in a
report. “Visibility also seems to have improved as the
executives for the first time provided investors with an outlook
for 2013.”  Freenet, which buys access to wireless networks from
operators like Deutsche Telekom AG and Vodafone Group Plc, aims
to “stabilize” revenue in the coming two years at the level
seen in 2011 while Ebitda is likely to be about 340 million
euros for 2012 and 2013, the company said.  It plans to continue paying out 40 percent to 60 percent of
its free  cash flow  as dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
