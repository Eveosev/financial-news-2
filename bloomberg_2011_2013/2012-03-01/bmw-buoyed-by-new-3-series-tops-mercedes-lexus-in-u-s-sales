Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
brand roared back ahead of  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz to lead
U.S. luxury auto sales last month when its new 3 Series sedan
reached showrooms.  U.S. sales of the BMW brand rose 29 percent to 21,204 in
February compared with a year earlier, the Munich-based
automaker said yesterday on its website. Deliveries of the 3
Series gained 66 percent. Mercedes sales rose 17 percent in
February to 18,080, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus brand rose
21 percent to 16,682.  “That 3 Series is going to continue to be the difference
maker in this luxury race this year,” said  Jesse Toprak , an
industry analyst with TrueCar.com, a Santa Monica, California-
based website that tracks auto sales. “BMW has the advantage
going into this year.”  Mercedes’s updated version of the C-Class compact sedan and
new two-door version have helped the Stuttgart, Germany-based
automaker put pressure on BMW’s effort to keep its spot as the
top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. Lexus was the leader for 11
years until Munich-based BMW took the crown last year.  After two months, Mercedes holds a 770 unit sales lead over
BMW. Mercedes sold a total of 38,379 in January and February
while BMW delivered 37,609 during those months, the companies
said. Dealers sold 28,956 Lexus vehicles in the U.S.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Confidence Surging  “The surge in  consumer confidence  and the launch of the
new BMW 3 Series combined to produce the strongest February
results since the record set in 2007,” Ludwig Willisch, head of
BMW of North America, said in a statement.  The more fuel-efficient, redesigned 3 Series, which starts
at $35,795 excluding destination charges, arrived in U.S.
showrooms Feb. 11. The new version accounted for 35 percent of
the model’s sales last month.  Max Warburton , a London-based analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, called the 3 Series “one of the most profitable
vehicles ever” in a November report that estimated the model
has generated $290 billion in revenue and $17 billion in
earnings before interest and taxes since 1995.  Mercedes started selling an updated C-Class sedan in
September that ended the year up 11 percent, edging out the 3
Series sedan by about 500 sales. C-Class sales in February rose
17 percent to 5,240.  Global Contest  The U.S. sales race is just one of the battlefields for BMW
and Mercedes as they wrestle for global supremacy in the luxury
market. Daimler, which has fallen to third in luxury sales
behind  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi globally, wants to regain the top
spot from BMW by 2015.  U.S. deliveries of Audi, the premium brand of Wolfsburg,
Germany-based VW, rose 10 percent to 8,531 vehicles last month,
the company said in a statement.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand sales fell 27
percent last month to 11,505, according to the Detroit-based
automaker.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,149
vehicles in the U.S., a 6.4 percent increase, the company said
in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 9,239 vehicles, 1 percent
more than a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based company,
said in a statement.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in Tokyo, said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand rose 4.3 percent to 11,258 last month.  Lincoln Conquesting  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 6,912 Lincolns in February, a 16
percent gain from a year earlier, according to a statement from
the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Lincoln sales jumped “big time” after Feb. 14 when it
began advertising $1,000 cash offers to buyers trading in a
competitor’s vehicle, C.J. O’Donnell, the brand’s marketing
manager, said yesterday. The program, which he described as an
early “spring sales promotion,” runs through March.  “Our sales picked up right away,” said O’Donnell. “It’s
specifically targets people who are moving up from mainstream
brands and from other brands.”  Lincoln’s success in February doesn’t change Ford’s plans to
overhaul the brand with new models and improved dealerships,
O’Donnell said.  Land Rover deliveries rose 27 percent to 3,255, while
Jaguar sales were up 48 percent to 1,022, the brands, owned by
Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd (TTMT) , said in an e-mail.  -- With assistance from Keith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan.
