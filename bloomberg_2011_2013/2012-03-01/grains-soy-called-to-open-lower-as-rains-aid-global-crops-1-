What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that rains next
week will aid winter crops in the southern U.S. Great Plains
after snow boosted soil moisture this week across the northern
spring-wheat belt, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago as rains from  South Dakota  to  Ohio  will begin
to replenish depleted soil moisture ahead of spring planting
next month, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT as rain in the past week and more forecast during the
next seven days will improve yield potential of crops in  South
America , slowing demand for U.S. supplies, Grow said. Soybean-
oil futures are expected to open 0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound
lower, and soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1.50 lower
per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
