The Jeremy Lin-led  New York  Knicks
drew their smallest television audience on MSG Network in four
games during their 120-103 home win against the  Cleveland
Cavaliers  two nights ago.  The rating for the game still was more than twice as high
as when Lin took over as the team’s starting point guard in
early February.  The Knicks-Cavaliers game was seen in an average of 6.08
percent of homes in the New York metropolitan area, Brian Fisher,
a spokesman for the Madison Square Garden Co. network, said
yesterday in an e-mail.  The team drew a 6.46 rating on Feb. 22, when it played the
 Atlanta Hawks ; a 7.34 rating on Feb. 20 for a game versus the
 New Jersey Nets , and a 7.32 rating on Feb. 17, when the Knicks
played the New Orleans Hornets.  The Cleveland game marked the first time on MSG, which
dates back to the 1988-89 season, that Knicks telecasts drew
ratings of 6 or higher for four straight contests. Ratings are
based on the average number of homes in the New York
metropolitan area watching the game.  In the 10 games on MSG since Lin, a former bench-warmer who
twice was cut by other NBA teams, moved into the starting lineup
on Feb. 6, Knicks telecasts are averaging a 5 rating, almost
three times higher than the first 20 games of the season. Lin’s
first start drew a 2.68 rating.  Lin, a 23-year-old Harvard University graduate, scored 19
points and handed out 13 assists, turning the ball over once, as
the Knicks rallied from a 12-point halftime deficit to beat the
Cavaliers. Carmelo Anthony scored a team-high 22 points for the
Knicks (18-18), who were 8-15 before Lin took over the lead
point-guard role.  The Knicks are tied with the  Boston Celtics  for second
place in the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division,
three games behind the  Philadelphia 76ers . New York’s next four
games are on the road, starting with a contest March 4 at  Boston .  To contact the reporter on this story:
