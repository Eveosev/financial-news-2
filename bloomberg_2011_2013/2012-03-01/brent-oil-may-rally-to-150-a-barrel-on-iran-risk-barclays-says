Brent oil may rise to $150 a barrel
this year if diplomatic relations between  Iran  and the west
worsen, Barclays Plc forecasts.  Brent may surpass its record high of $147 a barrel if
political tensions surrounding  Iran’s nuclear program  heighten,
even if there is no military conflict or closure of the Strait
of Hormuz, the bank said in a report today. This would cause the
average price of the North Sea crude in 2012 to exceed Barclays’
base-case forecast of $115 by about $20, the bank said. Brent
traded at about $122 in  London  today.  “Quarterly averages of $140 per barrel or $150 per barrel
are distinctly possible” in the third and fourth quarters of
2012, London-based analyst Amrita Sen wrote. “This is not our
current base case, though it does seem to be moving closer to
becoming reality.”  Oil demand growth in  Asia  is rising faster than current
prices indicate, while global supplies have been reduced by
1.2 million barrels a day amid disruptions in Sudan, Syria and
Yemen, according to Barclays. That’s left worldwide spare
production capacity at the “extremely thin” level of 1.7
million barrels, the bank estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
