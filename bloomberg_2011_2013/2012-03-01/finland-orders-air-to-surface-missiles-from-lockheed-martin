Finnish defense forces agreed to buy
long-range cruise missiles from  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  as it
extends the life of its aircraft fleet.  The order is valued at 178.5 million euros ($238 million)
with payments spread over six years, the Ministry of Defense
said in a statement.   “These updates aim to extend the lifespan of the fleet as
far as possible,” Lieutenant General Mika Peltonen, the
operative chief of the Defense Command, said by phone.  The deal consists of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff
Missiles, along with the necessary software, technical
documentation and training for the country’s F-18 Hornet fleet.  Finland has 62 F/A-18 Hornet planes. The planes were
ordered in 1992 and were initially not planned for air-to-ground
armament.  The government will face a confidence vote tomorrow in
parliament over defense force cutbacks, including a decrease of
2,200 in army personnel by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
