Apranga AB, the biggest clothing
retailer in the Baltic region, said February sales rose 16
percent from a year earlier, driven by a demand recovery in
 Latvia .  Sales increased to 28.6 million litai ($11 million), the
Vilnius-based company said today in a statement to the stock
exchange. Two-month sales through January and February grew 21
percent to 69.3 million litai from last year, it said.  The retailer also said it will propose paying dividend for
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
