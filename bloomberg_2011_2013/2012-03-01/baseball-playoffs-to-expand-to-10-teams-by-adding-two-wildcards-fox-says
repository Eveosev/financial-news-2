Major League Baseball ’s playoffs
will expand to 10 teams from eight starting this season,  Fox
Sports reported  citing unidentified baseball officials.  An announcement on the expanded playoffs may come today,
though there are a few details to resolve, Fox Sports said.
Under the new format, five teams from each league would make the
postseason instead of four.  An extra tier of playoffs had been agreed on as part of
baseball’s labor contract approved in December.  This season’s schedule was already set when the new
collective bargaining agreement was completed and adjustments
probably would be needed to incorporate the extra playoff games,
Fox Sports said. It also hasn’t been determined which networks
would televise the games, Fox Sports said.  The three division winners in each league would get a
first-round bye, while the two non-division winners with the
best records would meet in a one-game playoff to decide the wild
card. That team would advance to play the division winner with
the best record, unless the teams are in the same division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
