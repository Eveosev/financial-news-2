CFC Insurance Holdings Ltd. (CFCI) , a unit
of CFC Stanbic Holding Ltd., gained for a second day after
indicating higher full-year profit.  Shares of the company, which is also a unit of  Liberty
Holdings Ltd. (LBH)  of  South Africa , climbed 6.3 percent to 7.55
shillings as of 1:07 p.m. in Nairobi. The stock climbed 12
percent yesterday, the biggest gain since the company listed on
the Nairobi Securities Exchange in April 2011.  Full-year pretax profit may be 800 million shillings ($9.6
million) to 1.2 billion shillings for the year ended Dec. 31,
the company said yesterday in a statement published in the  Daily
Nation , without giving a comparable figure for the preceding
year. The figures indicate a doubling in profit, said Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd.
“Overall the underlying business has done well,” Musau said by
phone today. “But the statement did not give potential losses
from investments in financial securities.”  The company has faced “the market-related impact of the
decline in value of certain financial instruments” during the
12 months through December, Managing Director Mike du Toit said.  Calls to du Toit and the head of finance seeking profit
figures for 2010 went unanswered.  First-half net income climbed 73 percent to 334.5 million
shillings, CF reported on Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
