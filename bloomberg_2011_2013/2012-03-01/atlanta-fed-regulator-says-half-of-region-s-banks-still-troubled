A majority of banks in the Southeast
U.S. supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta remain
troubled more than two and a half years after the recession
ended, said  Michael Johnson , senior vice president for
supervision and regulation.  “We have over 600 bank holding companies in our district,
and still to this day over 50 percent of them are in troubled or
problem condition,” Johnson said at an Atlanta Fed banking
conference. The Atlanta Fed district includes  Alabama ,  Florida ,
Georgia, and portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and  Tennessee .  While that is “bad news,” profit trends have improved,
and banks in the Atlanta Fed district were profitable overall in
2011 for the first time in several years, he said. That is
“great news from my perspective,” Johnson said.  Credit quality trends such as the level of delinquent loans
improved every quarter last year, the Atlanta Fed official said.
“A little concerning is the pace of that improvement started to
slow toward the end of the year,” he said.  The Atlanta Fed region has been “ground zero of the
banking crisis,” and its community banks were highly
concentrated in commercial real estate loans, Johnson said.  Georgia  led the U.S. in bank failures between late 2007 and
2011’s third quarter with 75, followed by Florida’s 57,
according to Trepp LLC, a provider of mortgage information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
