Euro-area finance ministers
authorized the European Financial Stability Facility to issue
bonds for the Greek debt swap.  “Ministers authorize the issuance by EFSF of bonds to
finance the euro area’s contribution to the PSI exercise and the
repayment of accrued interest on Greek  government bonds ,”
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said today in a statement. The move
followed an assessment that  Greece  has taken “decisive and
swift” action on structural reforms.  Greece’s consolidation measures “will allow the Greek
adjustment effort to regain momentum,” Juncker said.  The ministers also authorized the EFSF to implement the
Eurosystem collateral enhancement facility, which “entails the
provision by EFSF of a buyback scheme for the eligibility of
marketable instruments issued or guaranteed by the Greek
government for use as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy
operations,” according to the statement.   At the Brussels meeting, the euro-area finance chiefs also
agreed on a backstop facility for the recapitalization of Greek
banks in case of financial stability concerns.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
