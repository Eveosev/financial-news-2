Indonesia ’s rupiah declined and
bonds rallied for a third straight day as a government report
showed consumer prices rose the least in two years last month.  Inflation slowed to 3.56 percent from a year earlier, down
from 3.65 percent in January and less than the 3.8 percent
median estimate of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
rupiah’s movements may be limited on speculation the central
bank will intervene to support the currency, according to PT
Bank ICBC Indonesia. Bank Indonesia has been intervening in the
foreign-exchange and bond markets to curb volatility, Governor
Darmin Nasution said on Feb. 10.  The rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 9,111 per dollar as of
3:46 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  “I see it ranging between 9,050 and 9,150 today,” said
Artanavaro Gasali, a Jakarta-based trader at PT Bank ICBC
Indonesia. “Even as the rupiah weakens,  Bank Indonesia  tends to
hold it in a range, so I see intervention keeping it around
those levels.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage points, to 5.48
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  The yield has climbed 15 basis points after Nasution said
on Feb. 23 that a proposed reduction in fuel subsidies may cause
inflation to exceed the central bank’s target of a maximum 5.5
percent this year.  The government will decide whether to raise subsidized fuel
prices when it revises the 2012 state budget this month,
Coordinating Minister for the Economy Hatta Rajasa said last
week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
