Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  said the European Union needs to shift toward a
longer-term plan to boost growth and cut public spending.  “We’ve been in kind of a short-sighted crisis,” Reinfeldt
said in an interview late yesterday after a meeting of EU
leaders in Brussels. “There are still huge deficits and
excessive debt levels when it comes to a lot of member
countries. How do you have growth without spending taxpayers’
money?”  With the region’s economy facing stagnation this year and
the 17-member euro area expected to contract, European leaders
are seeking measures to boost employment. At the same time,
countries are under pressure to cut public spending, trim
pension costs and improve their tax systems to plug budget gaps.  Reinfeldt said free-trade agreements and better patent
procedures may lay the groundwork for a faster-growing economy
in the absence of publicly funded stimulus programs. He said
Sweden and 11 other nations are pushing to incorporate more of
their recommendations into the final conclusions of this week’s
summit.  Yesterday, U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  expressed
frustration with movement to expand the EU’s single market.
Cameron, who also signed the letter from the dozen countries,
said at the summit that he wanted measurable timetables and
targets for further market integration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
