Global coffee output will be 128.5
million bags in the season started in October, down from the
previous forecast of 130.9 million bags, according to the
London-based International Coffee Organization.  Production in  Vietnam , the biggest grower of the robusta
variety, will be 17.5 million bags, one million fewer than
estimated in January’s report, ICO data show. Output in Uganda,
Africa’s second-largest producer, will fall to 2.85 million bags
from a previous forecast of 3.3 million bags. Farmers in  India 
will harvest 4.9 million bags, down from 5.4 million bags.  “A slight decrease of 3.7 percent is forecast in  Asia  and
Oceania, down to 34.7 million bags,” the  ICO  said in the
February report e-mailed today. “This reduction in production
is due to Vietnam and India where heavy rains are likely to
affect their output.”  Global production will drop from 134.3 million bags in the
2010-11 season as arabica trees entered the lower-yielding half
of a two-year cycle in  Brazil , the biggest grower. Output in
Central America will also fall because of rains.  Beginning stocks in exporting countries for the 2011-12
season stood at 17.4 million bags, the lowest on record, the ICO
said. High prices encouraged exports, it said. Inventories in
importing countries were at 22.3 million bags, a “healthy
level.”  Coffee consumption was 135 million bags in 2010 and is set
to increase in 2011, the ICO said, without providing figures for
last year. Prices climbed to a 14-year high of $3.089 a pound in
May last year.  Arabicas  “Strong and dynamic demand, coupled with the short supply
of washed arabicas, should support firm prices going forward,”
according to the report.  Robusta coffee is grown mainly in Asia and parts of Africa
and used to make instant drinks and espresso. Arabica beans are
grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored by companies like
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  for specialty drinks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
