Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the French
waste and water utility trying to reduce debt, reported a
larger-than-estimated 2011 loss on restructuring costs and a
business slowdown in southern  Europe  and north  Africa .  The net loss was 490 million euros ($653 million) compared
with a restated profit of 559 million euros a year earlier, the
Paris-based company said today in a statement. That was greater
than the average estimate of a 281 million-euro loss of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  This year “will be the first for the transformation of
Veolia after a year of transition,” Chief Executive Officer
Antoine Frerot said on a conference call. He declined to provide
an outlook for earnings for 2012 or comment on his future as
chief executive at the water provider.  Frerot is seeking to revive the utility amid reports that
his predecessor  Henri Proglio , who remains a director, was
trying to garner board support for a replacement. Frerot’s
revamp would undo a legacy of expansion under Proglio that took
the utility to 77 countries from  Argentina  to  South Korea .
Veolia has lost about half its market value since mid-July.  Veolia  rose as much  as 6.2 percent, its biggest intraday
gain in five months. It traded 5 percent higher at 9.65 euros as
of 9:41 a.m. in Paris and was the biggest gainer on the
benchmark CAC 40 index, followed by Safran SA, up 1.1 percent.  Operating income fell to 1.02 billion euros from 1.98
billion euros a year earlier. Sales advanced 3.1 percent to 29.6
billion euros. The company said it will target annual revenue
growth of more than 3 percent from 2014 and average annual
adjusted operating cash flow growth of more than 5 percent.  A total for  restructuring costs  wasn´t immediately
available.  Divestments Target  Yesterday, Veolia said in a statement the board of
directors “reaffirms the relevance of the strategic plan
adopted in December 2011 and renews its confidence in the CEO.”  The utility achieved 1.54 billion euros of divestments last
year, taking the total to 4.08 billion euros during the past
three years, according to the statement. This was
“significantly” more than a target of 3 billion euros between
2009 and 2011, it said.  Veolia is in exclusive talks with an unidentified investor
for the sale of Transdev, the mass-transit unit it owns with the
Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Frerot said today. The sale
could be complete by the summer, according to Chief Financial
Officer Pierre-Francois Riolacci.  Veolia has also initiated the process of selling solid
waste activities in the U.S. and U.K. regulated water
businesses, according to the statement.  Veolia will narrow its geographic reach to about 40
countries in a bid to lower debt to less than 12 billion euros
by the end of 2013, the company said. Net financial debt was
14.73 billion euros at Dec. 31, down from 15.22 billion euros a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
