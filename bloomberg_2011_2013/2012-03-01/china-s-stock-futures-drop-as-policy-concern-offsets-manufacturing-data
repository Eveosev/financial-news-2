Chinese stocks  swung between gains
and losses as investors weighed growth in the manufacturing
industry against concerns the nation’s tight monetary policies
will restrict economic growth.  Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group Co. (600720)  and Zhengzhou Coal Mining
Machinery Group Co. climbed among industrial companies after a
purchasing managers index rose for a third straight month in
February. Zijin Mining Group Co. and Zhongjin Gold Co. slumped
more than 2 percent as bullion prices tumbled to a six-week low
in Shanghai.  About as many stocks climbed as declined in the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which fell 0.1 percent to 2,425.37 as of 11:04
a.m. local time. The gauge swung between gains and losses at
least four times today after the Securities Times said new
lending in February may miss estimates. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost
0.1 percent to 2,632.69.  The  Shanghai index  advanced 5.9 percent in February,
capping its biggest monthly gain since October 2010, on the
prospect the central bank will add to a Feb. 18 cut in  reserve
requirements  to halt a decline in economic growth. For the year,
the measure has rebounded 11 percent and trades at 10.1 times
estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on
Jan. 6,  weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
