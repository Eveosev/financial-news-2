Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles SA , the
Spanish stock-exchange operator, is still suffering from a
“hangover” caused by the former ban on short-selling financial
stocks, Chief Financial Officer Javier Hernani said.  “These things normally need a certain amount of time” for
a recovery in volumes, Hernani said on a webcast for analysts
today. “We are living through the hangover from a situation
that lasted a long time, because there were six months of
prohibition.”  Spain ’s market regulator  lifted  the ban on short-selling on
Feb. 16, saying the “extreme volatility” in banking shares
that justified the prohibition had eased. The ban hurt BME by
affecting liquidity and stock pricing, Chairman Antonio Zoido
said on today’s webcast.  BME today said that equity trading volumes fell 31 percent
in February from the same month a year ago. Trading volumes also
fell 35 percent from January, the Madrid-based company said.  Shares in BME rose as much as 3.8 percent in Madrid trading
today. The company said last night that it earned 155.1 million
euros last year, higher than the average estimate of 151.9
million euros in a survey of seven analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
