Iraq ’s average crude-oil exports
exceeded 2 million barrels a day in February, said Falah al- Amri, director of the State Oil Marketing Organization.  The precise figure for the average crude exports in
February will be published later this month, he said in a
telephone interview in  Baghdad  today.  Iraq, the third-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumped 2.75 million barrels a day
in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The
country plans to increase its daily crude output to 3.4 million
barrels this year while exports will exceed 2.6 million barrels
a day,  Asim Jihad , an Oil Ministry spokesman, said on Feb. 23.  The Arab nation, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil
reserves, depends on sales of crude for most of the revenue it
needs to rebuild the economy after years of war, sabotage and
economic sanctions. Iraq has awarded 15 licenses for drilling
rights to foreign companies since the U.S.-led invasion that
ousted President  Saddam Hussein  in 2003.  To contact the reporters on this story:
