The  Green Bay  Packers’ fifth stock
sale added more than 250,000 shareholders and raised
approximately $67 million for the expansion of Lambeau Field.  The only publicly owned franchise in the major U.S. sports
sold more than 268,000 shares during the offering, which started
Dec. 6 and ended yesterday. The team now has more than 360,000
shareholders. The stock doesn’t pay dividends or appreciate in
value and can’t be sold.  Proceeds from the National Football League team’s sale will
be put toward a $143 million expansion of Lambeau Field in Green
Bay, Wisconsin. The project, which will be completed by the
start of the 2013 season, includes the addition of 6,700 seats,
new video boards and two new gates.  “The response to the offering by our fans was
overwhelming,” Packers President  Mark Murphy  said in a
statement.  The Packers, who have won four Super Bowl titles, said a
traditional loan will also help finance the project, and the
team may obtain funding from the NFL and the stadium district’s
user-fee program.  Wisconsin residents purchased about 50 percent of the
shares in the latest sale. Fans from California and  Illinois 
purchased 8.5 percent each, followed by Minnesota and  Texas ,
both at 5 percent, the Packers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
