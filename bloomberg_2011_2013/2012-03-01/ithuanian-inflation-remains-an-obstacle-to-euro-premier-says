Lithuanian  inflation  will probably
be the biggest obstacle to euro adoption in 2014 after it
derailed a 2007 attempt by the country to qualify for the
currency switch, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said.  Consumer-price growth may slow to 2.5 percent this year
from 4.1 percent in 2011, Kubilius said in an interview in
Brussels today, reiterating estimates by the  Finance Ministry .  The Baltic nation’s government plans to cut the  budget
deficit  to 3 percent of  gross domestic product  this year to
qualify to join the currency union. Lithuania’s attempt to adopt
the euro at the start of 2007 failed after inflation exceeded
the threshold by 0.1 percentage point.  “We would hope that the euro club will be in a better
shape” by 2014, Kubilius said. “A more consolidated European
economy that is coming out from this crisis is what is needed
for  Lithuania .”  The goal of euro adoption is unlikely to be challenged in
the general election scheduled for October, Kubilius said.  The election campaign will be “a tough fight” with the
opposition parties, the prime minister said. Kubilius said he is
“optimistic” about the prospects for his Homeland Union-
Christian Democrat Party, which plans to campaign on the
positive results of the austerity program his government
implemented in the past three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
