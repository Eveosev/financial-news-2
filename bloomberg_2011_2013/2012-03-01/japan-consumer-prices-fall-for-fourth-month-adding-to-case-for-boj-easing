Japan’s consumer prices fell for a
fourth month, indicating the  Bank of Japan (8301)  may need to do more
to counter deflation after expanding monetary easing.  Consumer prices  excluding fresh food dropped 0.1 percent in
January from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today in
Tokyo. The median estimate was for a 0.2 percent decline, in a
Bloomberg News survey of 28 economists.  “The data reconfirm Japan’s deflation is deeply rooted,”
said  Masamichi Adachi , senior economist at JP Morgan Securities
in Tokyo and a former central bank official. “The Bank of Japan
will probably have to act more aggressively going forward.”  The central bank last month set an inflation goal of 1
percent and increased bond purchases by 10 trillion yen ($123
billion) to aid a recovery in the world’s third-biggest economy.  -- Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Lily Nonomiya  To contact the reporter on this story:
