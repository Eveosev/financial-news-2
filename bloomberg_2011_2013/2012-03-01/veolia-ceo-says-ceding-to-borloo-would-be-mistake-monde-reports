Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  Chief
Executive Officer Antoine Frerot said putting a politician at
the helm of the waste and water utility would have been a
“major error,” Le Monde reported, citing an interview.  Frerot made the comments when asked about reports that his
predecessor,  Henri Proglio , tried to install former environment
minister Jean-Louis Borloo at the helm.  A “big majority” of the board of directors yesterday
backed a strategy to restructure the company and retain Frerot
as chief, the CEO said today at a press conference in Paris on
2011 results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
