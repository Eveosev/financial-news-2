Alaskan crude production dropped 5.5
percent in February from a year earlier after a fire forced  BP
Plc (BP/)  to shut an oil-gathering center and as yield from wells in
the North Slope shrank.  Output in February averaged 609,216 barrels a day, a
decrease from 644,767 a year earlier and from 624,058 in the
previous month, according to a posting on the  Alaska Tax
Division ’s website. Supply peaked for the month at 626,002
barrels Feb. 2 and touched a low of 564,699 barrels yesterday.  Alaska production  has declined annually since 2002, and
February output has dropped for four straight years, according
to the state tax division. London-based BP shut an oil-gathering
plant in Prudhoe Bay yesterday after a fire that “extinguished
itself,”  Steve Rinehart , a BP spokesman in Anchorage, said in
an e-mail.  “As a precaution, facility managers decided to shut the
plant down,” Rinehart said. “Today the plant is being brought
back online.”  The fire’s impact on production is “undetermined,” he
said. The plant is one of about a dozen stations in the North
Slope that processes oil for delivery across the 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) Trans Alaska crude line running from  Prudhoe
Bay  on the North Slope to Valdez, Rinehart said.  Each of BP’s gathering centers, which separates raw crude,
water and gas produced from wells, is designed to process about
350,000 barrels of raw crude oil per day, according to BP’s
 website .  Production Decline  February’s decline was “strictly because of the ongoing
decline in production,”  Michelle Egan , spokeswoman for Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., operator of the Trans Alaska line, said in
a telephone interview. ‘There’s no operations reason for it,”
she said.  Alaskan North Slope (USCRANSW)  crude prices have risen 13 percent over
the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The oil
traded $18.50 a barrel above U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate, unchanged from yesterday.  The Trans-Alaska pipeline was shut for nine days in January
2011 after a leak was discovered at a pump station. That led to
a 26 percent drop in Alaskan oil production from the previous
month.  Inventories at the Valdez marine terminal, where tankers
load oil for delivery to refineries on the West Coast, averaged
4.73 million barrels in February, ranging from 3.54 million on
Feb. 14 to 5.96 million on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
