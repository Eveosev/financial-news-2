OPEC will keep shipments little
changed until the middle of this month as refiners replenishing
depleted stockpiles offsets a seasonal decline in demand,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
 export  23.32 million barrels a day in the four weeks to March
17, compared with 23.31 million in the period to Feb. 18, the
Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. The figures exclude  Angola  and Ecuador.  “Stock-building is still going on even as refinery runs
dip,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder, said by phone.
“There’s quite a lot moving west over the last two or three
weeks while shipments east are dipping. It means stocks aren’t
high.”  Exports from the  Middle East , including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will decrease 0.3 percent to 17.4 million
barrels a day in the four-week period, according to the report.  Crude on board tankers will average 475.84 million barrels
in the four weeks, up 0.5 percent from 473.38 million in the
month to Feb. 11, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya ,
Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
