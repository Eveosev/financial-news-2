Russia , Belarus and  Kazakhstan  are
approaching self-sufficiency in sugar as their combined output
will meet almost 90 percent of domestic needs in the next
marketing year, Russia’s Sugar Producers’ Union said.  The three states, which share customs arrangements, are
expected to produce more than 5.6 million metric tons of sugar
from beets in the season that starts Aug. 1, while consumption
is estimated at about 6.3 million tons, Andrei Bodin, the
union’s chairman, said today at the CIS Sugar Market 2012
 conference  in Moscow.  Production will include 5 million tons in Russia, 585,000
tons in Belarus and 50,000 tons in Kazakhstan, Bodin said.
Russians will consume 5.4 million tons, Belarusians 400,000 tons
and Kazakhs 450,000 tons, according to his presentation.  The three states will import raw-sugar and produce about
540,000 tons of the sweetener from it next season. Of that,
140,000 tons will be produced in Russia, while  Belarus  and
Kazakhstan each will produce 200,000 tons, Bodin said. The three
countries’ combined sugar exports are seen at 610,000 tons next
season, he said.  Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan export sugar to 20
countries, mostly to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Moldova,  Georgia , Syria and Montenegro,
according to Bodin’s presentation.  Sugar stocks will rise 11 percent to almost 3.9 million
tons in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan by the end of the 2012-13
marketing year, from about 3.5 million tons by the end of
2011-12, according to Bodin’s presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
