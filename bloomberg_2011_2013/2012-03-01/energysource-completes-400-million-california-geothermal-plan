EnergySource LLC, a closely held
geothermal energy developer, said its first project will begin
delivering electricity to an  Arizona  utility this month.  The 49.9-megawatt Hudson Ranch I project is the first new
geothermal power plant completed in California’s Salton Sea
resource area in Imperial County in more than 20 years,
EnergySource said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company, based in El Centro, California, will sell the
plant’s output for 30 years to Salt River Project, the municipal
utility of Tempe, Arizona. Construction began in May 2010 and
cost $400 million, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
