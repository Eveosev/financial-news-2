The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  has
the potential to reach a record high of 1,700 this year should
economic growth surprise investors the same way falling bond
rates did in 1995, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  Reaching that level would mean a 24 percent rally from
today’s close of 1,374.09, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities gained 103 percent since it
reached a 12-year low on March 9, 2009. In 2012, it’s off to the
best start to a year since 1991. The measure’s all-time high of
1,565.15 was set in 2007.  An expansion that exceeded forecasts in the world’s largest
economy would help stocks rally after economists tempered their
estimate for growth in 2012 to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent
earlier in the year, according to Laszlo Birinyi, who was among
the first to suggest buying stocks in March 2009. The potential
for surprise is similar to 1995, when the yield on the 30-year
 U.S. Treasuries (USGG30YR)  fell 1.93 percentage points, even as  Wall Street 
predicted they would gain, according to a report from the
Westport, Connecticut-based firm.  “In 1995, the consensus trade was higher yields, today it
is tepid economic growth and the market is suggesting -- perhaps
insisting -- an alternative to that consensus,” Birinyi wrote
in the note today. “We continue to be bullish and would
encourage a more aggressive posture.”  1982, 1990  Should economic data show signs of improvement, the  S&P 500 
may post a rally similar to the bull market that started in
1982, when the index advanced 229 percent, or the one that began
in 1990, when it surged 302 percent, according to Birinyi.
Reports on home sales and jobs have been better than estimated
so far in 2012. The  Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD)  for the
U.S. is at 45.1, up from negative 117.2 in June.  “If the market is right and the economy surprises us on
the upside, gains similar to 1982 and 1990 are a distinct
possibility and one which no one has entertained,” he wrote.  He stood by his bullish calls last year even as the S&P 500
fell five straight months starting in May. He said on Sept. 12
that U.S. companies were earning too much for the bull market to
be derailed by  Europe ’s debt crisis. The S&P 500 is up 19
percent since then. Birinyi advised investors to “be in the
market” during a Dec. 6 interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg
Radio’s “ Bloomberg Surveillance .”  In January 2011, Birinyi said the average length and size
of bull markets suggested the S&P 500 would rally to 2,854 on
Sept. 4, 2013.  “That number hasn’t gone away,” Jeffrey Yale Rubin,
director of research at Birinyi Associates, said during a phone
interview today. “It’s not like Birinyi is lowering the target,
because that’s way out there, almost to 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
