OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest
oil producer, shelved a plan to make a $1.8 billion shale
acquisition in the U.S. because of slumping natural-gas prices.  The producer backed away from the plan because it didn’t
offer an acceptable return, Deputy Chief Executive Officer
 Leonid Fedun  said. U.S. natural-gas prices slumped 55 percent
between June and January. Lukoil had set aside $1.8 billion for
the deal, according to the company.  “We examined this project in detail and had to suspend its
development on valuation,” Fedun said in an interview in London
today. “We’re not ready to complete it.”  Drillers including  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the second-
largest U.S. gas producer, have cut back production at shale
fields after increased supply and milder-than-usual winter
weather sent prices crashing. The number of gas-drilling rigs
working in the U.S. is at a three-year low.  Fedun said Lukoil is looking at a plan to sell shares in
Hong Kong and  Shanghai  next year, without saying how much it
hopes to raise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
