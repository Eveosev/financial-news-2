Hundreds of protesters in  Azerbaijan 
attacked government buildings in the northeastern city of Quba
after a local governor criticized residents of the area, Radio
Free  Europe /Radio Liberty reported.  The riots started today after Rauf Habibov, a district
governor, gave a speech in which he blamed locals for their
readiness “to sell their land, families and motherland” for
about $40, according to the report by RFE/RL’s Azeri service.
The demonstrators, who broke windows and set fire to the
governor’s house nearby, demanded Habibov’s resignation. Quba is
164 kilometers north of Baku, near the Azeri border with Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
