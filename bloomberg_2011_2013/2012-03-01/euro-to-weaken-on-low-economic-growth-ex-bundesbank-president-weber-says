The euro is set to weaken as the 17-
nation currency region has the weakest growth prospects
globally, former Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  said.  “ Europe  has the weakest fundamentals,” Weber, who will
become chairman of UBS AG in May, said at a conference in  Abu
Dhabi  today. “If everybody has a loose monetary policy, then
relative monetary policy will not drive your exchange rate. What
will drive your exchange rate is fundamentals.”  The euro bloc economy may stagnate or expand by 1 percent
this year, while the U.S. and the  Middle East  grow at about 3
percent or more, he said. Emerging markets will expand by
between 6 percent and 8 percent, Weber said.  The debt crisis that began in Greece more than two years
ago and spread to Ireland, Portugal,  Italy  and Spain has weighed
on the region as government austerity programs drove up
unemployment, choking growth. Unemployment in the euro zone rose
to 10.7 percent in January, a 14-year high, the European Union’s
statistics office said today.  The region will contract 0.4 percent this year, before
returning to growth of 0.9 percent in 2013, according to the
median estimate of at least 16 economist forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.2 percent in 2012 and
2.5 percent next year, while Japan will grow 1.5 percent and
1.40 percent, separate surveys show.  Euro Rally  The euro has climbed 2.6 percent against the dollar this
year as bonds and stocks rallied after the  European Central Bank 
lent more than 1 trillion euros ($1.33 trillion) to banks in its
longer-term refinancing operations yesterday and on Dec. 21. It
weakened 0.2 percent to $1.3293 at 1:57 p.m. London time, after
reaching $1.3487 on Feb. 24, the strongest level since Dec. 5.  The euro’s rally is poised to reverse as demand fueled by
the ECB cash wanes and foreign investors shun the region’s
assets, Morgan Stanley said. The bank forecast the euro to fall
to $1.27 by March 31 and to $1.15 by the year end.  “Most countries coming out of this crisis see a weak
 exchange rate  as one part of the remedy,” Weber said. “In my
view, actually a weaker euro is something that is in the books
and part of an adjustment process in peripheral countries and
that is not looked at too critically.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
