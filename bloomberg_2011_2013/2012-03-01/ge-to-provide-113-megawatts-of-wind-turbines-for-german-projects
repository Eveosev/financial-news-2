General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
U.S. wind-turbine maker, agreed to provide equipment for four
projects with 113 megawatts of capacity that developer
 Energiekontor AG (EKT)  is planning in Germany.  GE will deliver next year 41 of its 2.75-megawatt turbines
from its factory in Salzbergen, Germany, the Fairfield,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement. The
projects will supply enough power for about 70,000 German
households. Terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
