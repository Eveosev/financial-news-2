Canadian stocks  rose as  Royal Bank
of Canada (RY)  and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the nation’s biggest
lenders, paced gains among financial companies after boosting
their dividends following higher-than-estimated earnings.  Royal Bank gained 2 percent, and TD rallied 1.5 percent.
 Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , a maker of trains and airplanes, slumped 9.5
percent after  missing  analysts’ average sales estimate for a
third straight quarter.  Ithaca Energy Inc. (IAE) , which explores for
oil and gas in the North Sea, jumped 13 percent after saying it
received more interest in a possible takeover.  The  S&P/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  advanced 79.45 points, or 0.6
percent, to 12,723.46.  “The markets were clearly surprised,”  Andrew Pyle , an
associate money manager on a Bank of Nova Scotia team that
oversees about C$200 million ($200 million), said in a phone
interview from Peterborough, Ontario. “A lot of investors
thought the financials would keep money tight to the vest.”  The S&P/TSX gained 5.8 percent in January and February, its
best start to a year since 2004, as U.S. unemployment dropped to
the lowest in almost three years,  Greece  agreed to terms for a
second bailout and oil prices advanced on tension between Iran
and Western countries.  Royal Bank’s first-quarter  earnings  beat the average
analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 9.7 percent, excluding
certain items. The company raised its quarterly dividend 5.6
percent. TD, its largest domestic rival, surpassed forecasts
excluding certain items by 5.1 percent and increased its payout
5.9 percent.  Seven-Month High  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index (STFINL)  rallied to the highest level
since July. Royal Bank climbed 2 percent to C$56.80, extending
its streak of gains, the longest in two years, to eight days. TD
rose 1.5 percent to C$82 after closing at the highest since July
yesterday.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s third-
largest insurer, gained 2.1 percent to C$12.64.  Raw-materials producers advanced as gold rebounded from
yesterday’s 4.3 percent plunge and copper climbed on the Comex
in  New York .  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, rose 2 percent to C$48.91.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) ,  Canada ’s second-biggest publicly traded copper producer,
gained 3.5 percent to C$23.43 after  China  reported manufacturing
growth accelerated last month. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Rio Tinto
Group’s majority-owned partner in Mongolia’s Oyu Tolgoi project,
rallied 5.5 percent to C$18.11.  China Gold International Resources Corp. tumbled 8.1
percent to C$3.98 as the metal fell 3.9 percent in  Shanghai .  Fewer Planes  Bombardier sank 9.5 percent, the most since March 2009, to
C$4.30 after reporting fourth-quarter sales that trailed the
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey by 9 percent. The
company forecast a fifth straight annual decline in aircraft
deliveries this year.  Timothy James, an analyst at TD, cut his rating on the
shares to hold from buy. Cameron Doerksen of National Bank of
Canada reduced his rating on Bombardier to sector perform from
outperform, meaning the shares will perform in line with the
industry over the next 12 months.  Oil and gas producers advanced as crude oil touched $110 a
barrel in electronic trading in New York.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, increased 1.9 percent to
C$37.41.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-biggest company in
the industry by revenue, climbed 1.3 percent to C$38.95.
 Precision Drilling Corp. (PD) , the country’s largest drilling
company, rallied 5.2 percent to C$12.60.  ‘Unsolicited Interest’  Ithaca Energy soared 13 percent to C$3.20, the highest
close since January 2008, after saying it has “received
unsolicited interest from a number of third parties.” The
company said Jan. 23 it had received a takeover proposal.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  fell 4.9 percent to C$13.35 after
 Peter Misek , an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc., said the
BlackBerry maker is likely to estimate quarterly earnings below
the average analyst forecast. Misek cut his 12-month price
estimate on RIM’s U.S.-traded shares to $12 from $15.  Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (CFW)  advanced 8.7 percent to C$35.15
after Moody’s Investors Service raised its  credit rating  to Ba3
from B1. Ratings in the Ba category have “substantial” credit
risk rather than “high” risk as in the B category. Terry Marshall, an analyst at Moody’s, cited higher spending by oil
and gas producers as a reason for the upgrade in a note.  Calfrac shares have jumped 26 percent since Feb. 27 for the
biggest three-day gain since March 2004.  Yoga-wear retailer  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  increased 5.4
percent to a record C$69.86 after Jim Duffy, an analyst at
Stifel Financial Corp., boosted his 12-month price forecast on
its U.S. shares to $77 from $70. Stifel’s checks have found
“positive consumer response to new styles and color palettes”
as well as changes to Lululemon’s website, Duffy wrote in a note
to clients. The company’s market value surpassed C$10 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
