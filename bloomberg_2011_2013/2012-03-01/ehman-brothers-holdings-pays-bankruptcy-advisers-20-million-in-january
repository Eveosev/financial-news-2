Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  paid
its managers and advisers $20.3 million in January, according to
a regulatory filing. The bankrupt firm and its affiliates held
$27.4 billion in cash as of Jan. 31.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, whose co-founder  Bryan Marsal  runs the defunct investment bank, has charged $512
million in fees since 2008.  Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP (1127L)  has been
paid almost $383 million in 40 1/2 months for acting as lead
bankruptcy law firm, according to the filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Lehman, which has spent almost $1.6 billion on fees since
filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008,
paid $54.1 million to lawyers and managers in December.
Creditors are due to receive their first payment this month,
which may be $12 billion to $14.7 billion, Lehman has said.  Lehman’s bankruptcy became America’s most costly in April
2010, when it surpassed the $757 million cost of  Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) ’s
three-year liquidation, according to data assembled by
bankruptcy professor  Lynn LoPucki  at the University of
California,  Los Angeles . The failed energy trader’s investors
were paid 53 cents on the dollar, while Lehman’s $65 billion
liquidation plan would give the average creditor less than 18
cents, according to court documents.  Lehman’s creditors range from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
hedge funds to the New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, as well as individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Once
the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman filed for
bankruptcy with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
