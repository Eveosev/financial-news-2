Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  is in
dispute with the Algerian government over the cost of the
construction of the Aman Conference center,  El Confidencial 
reported, citing OHL chairman Juan-Miguel Villar Mir.  OHL won the contract to build the center in 2008 and the
projected cost was 400 million euros ($533 million) but the
project, which was completed in 2010, ended up costing 600
million euros, El Confidencial said.  The Algerian government has only offered to pay 100 million
euros of the extra costs and OHL will seek independent
arbitration over the dispute, El Confidencial said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
