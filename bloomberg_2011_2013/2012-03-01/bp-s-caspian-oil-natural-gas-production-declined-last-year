BP Plc (BP/)  and partners in the Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli development in the Caspian Sea pumped 35.4
million metric tons of oil last year, down 13 percent.  They also produced about 3.3 billion cubic meters of gas,
down from 3.4 billion cubic meters, BP’s office in the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku said by e-mail late yesterday.  Gas output from the offshore Shah Deniz field, developed by
a BP-led group including State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan and  Statoil
ASA (STL) , fell to 6.67 billion cubic meters from 6.9 billion.  BP gave no reason for the declines. Azerbaijani energy
officials earlier attributed them to increased safety measures
at the fields following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
