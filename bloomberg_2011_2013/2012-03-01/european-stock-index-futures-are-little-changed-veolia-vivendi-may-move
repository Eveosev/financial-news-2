European (SXXP)  stocks rose, extending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s best start to a year since 1998, as
Spanish and French borrowing costs dropped and a report showed
initial jobless claims fell to a four-year low in the U.S.  Veolia Environnement  SA, the world’s biggest water utility,
jumped the most since Oct. 2008.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest
provider of temporary workers, surged 8.5 percent after
reporting better-than-expected earnings.  Vivendi SA (VIV)  tumbled 10
percent, its biggest plunge in nine years, after forecasting
that profit growth will only resume in 2014.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  advanced 1 percent to 267.06 at the close.
The gauge climbed 3.9 percent last month and  rose 8.1 percent 
from the beginning of the year through yesterday. That was the
biggest January-February increase since 1998 as optimism mounted
that the euro area will contain its sovereign-debt crisis and
U.S. economic data beat estimates.  “The Spanish auction went well and Italian yields moving
below 2 percent is very positive,” said Trung-Tin Nguyen, a
hedge-fund manager at TTN AG in Zurich. “This helps the overall
sentiment.”  Spain and France sold 12.5 billion euros ($16.7 billion) of
bonds as yesterday’s  European Central Bank  loans to banks helped
spur demand for debt. The rate on Italy’s two-year notes dropped
below 2 percent for the first time since October 2010.  U.S. Jobless Claims  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed  initial
jobless claims  fell last week to a level matching a four-year
low, dropping to 351,000. That’s the lowest since March 2008 and
fewer than the  average economist forecast  of 355,000.  Separate figures showed personal spending rose 0.2 percent
in January and  incomes  climbed 0.3 percent.  The Institute for Supply Management’s  factory index  fell to
52.4 in February from 54.1 in January. Fifty is the dividing
line between growth and contraction.  Economists (NAPMPMI)  surveyed by
Bloomberg News had projected the gauge would climb to 54.5.  China ’s manufacturing improved for a third straight month
in February, signaling that the world’s second-biggest economy
is maintaining momentum amid the euro area’s crisis.  The purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.0 from 50.5 in
January, China’s statistics bureau and logistics federation said
today. That’s the highest level since September. Economic data
in the first two months are distorted by the Chinese New Year
holiday.  National Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18
western- European (SXXP)  markets, except Norway.  Germany ’s DAX Index
rose 1.3 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 Index gained 1.4 percent and
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 1 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers authorized the European
Financial Stability Facility to issue bonds for the Greek debt
swap, the so-called private-sector involvement.  “Ministers authorize the issuance by EFSF of bonds to
finance the euro area’s contribution to the PSI exercise and the
repayment of accrued interest on Greek  government bonds ,”
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said today in a statement.  Greece  committed to 3.2 billion euros of extra austerity
measures and negotiated terms for the biggest sovereign-debt
restructuring in history to secure the new financing.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  rejected a call to
appoint an EU official to oversee Greece’s economy.  Veolia Environnement (VIE)  jumped 15 percent to 10.55 euros, the
largest gain on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP) , after saying it’s in exclusive
talks to sell Transdev, its mass-transit unit.  Adecco Shares Rally  Adecco surged 8.5 percent to 49.18 Swiss francs. The
world’s largest provider of temporary workers increased its
 dividend  by 64 percent to 1.80 francs a share after fourth-
quarter net income of 133 million euros beat the  average analyst
estimate  of 119.3 million euros.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  soared 15 percent to 31.98
pence after Tata Communications Ltd. said it may make a cash
offer for the company and may decide on a transaction by the end
of the month.  WPP Plc (WPP)  gained 3 percent to 827.5 pence after the world’s
largest advertising agency reported that revenue rose to 10
billion pounds ($16 billion) in 2011.  Analysts had estimated
sales  of 9.96 billion pounds. WPP predicted that revenue will
grow 4 percent in 2012, faster than the industry average,
because of its position in  emerging markets .  Vivendi slumped 10 percent to 14.50 euros after the owner
of the world’s largest music and video-game companies predicted
that  profit  will not grow until 2014 as Iliad SA’s entry into
France’s mobile-phone market puts pressure on its SFR wireless
unit. Iliad has been allowed to compete on excessively favorable
terms, Vivendi said.  Aixtron, Rexel  Aixtron SE dropped 7.3 percent to 11.55 euros after the
company reported an unexpected fourth-quarter  loss before
interest and taxes  of 16.9 million euros. Aixtron also cut its
dividend payout by 58 percent. The company said it was “unable
to offer a precise revenue and Ebit-margin guidance.”  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  slid 3.9 percent to 14.47 euros after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the carmaker’s credit rating to
junk. Peugeot announced a broad alliance with General Motors Co.
yesterday that will include joint purchasing and vehicle
development in an effort to revitalize their European
operations.  Rexel SA (RXL)  dropped 2.8 percent to 16.08 euros. Ray Investment
SARL, the largest investor in the French electrical-equipment
distributor, sold 30 million Rexel shares at 15.75 euros apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
