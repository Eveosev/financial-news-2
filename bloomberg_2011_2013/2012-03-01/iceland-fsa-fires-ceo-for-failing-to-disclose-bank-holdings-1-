Iceland’s Financial Supervisory
Authority fired its director Gunnar Andersen, following an
investigation into his failure to disclose holdings at
Landsbanki Islands hf, where he worked 11 years ago.  Andersen, who took over as the Reykjavik-based watchdog’s
head in 2009, will step down immediately, the regulator said in
a statement. The FSA has also reported to the police that
Andersen has gathered information on the island’s financial
system without authorization, according to the statement.  State broadcaster RUV reported in November that Andersen
had been involved with offshore companies owned by Landsbanki in
2001, and that he failed to disclose this to the regulator 11
years ago.  Andersen on Feb. 17 refused a request to step down. “The
continued and pointless probes are in reality a servitude to
those parties that most fear the FSA and the efficient
operations of the regulator,” he said in a letter to the board
in February, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
