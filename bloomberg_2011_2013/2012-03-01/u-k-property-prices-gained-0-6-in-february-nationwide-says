U.K.  property prices  rose in
February amid a surge in first-time buyers before a  tax
exemption  expires this month,  Nationwide Building Society  said.  Prices increased 0.6 percent from the previous month to an
average 162,712 pounds ($259,500), the Swindon, England-based
customer-owned lender said in an e-mailed report today. Prices
were up 0.9 percent from a year earlier.  The data are the latest to show momentum in the property
market after the  Bank of England  said yesterday  mortgage
approvals  rose to a two-year high in January. Still, the price
rebound may not last, as the data may also reflect the March 24
expiration of a two-year stamp-duty holiday for first-time
buyers purchasing a home for less than 250,000 pounds.  “It remains to be seen whether this trend will be
sustained,”  Robert Gardner , chief economist at Nationwide, said
in the statement. “Given the still challenging economic
backdrop, this increase in housing-market activity may be the
result of a temporary rise in first-time buyers.”  Lenders granted 58,728 loans to buy homes in January,
compared with 55,019 the previous month, the central bank said
yesterday. It was the fourth successive monthly increase and the
biggest since June 2009. Approvals are running at little more
than half the pace seen in 2007, before the financial crisis
struck.  Britain’s  economy  shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter
as government spending cuts and the European sovereign debt
crisis weighed on the recovery. Still, indexes of manufacturing
and services rose in January, while inflation slowed to a 14-
month low, easing pressure on consumers.  The ending of the stamp-duty holiday, introduced by the
previous Labour government in 2010 in an effort to spur the
 property market , will add as much as 2,500 pounds to the cost of
purchasing a home for many new buyers.  David Cameron ’s
Conservative-led government scrapped the concession on the
grounds it had not been as effective as expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
