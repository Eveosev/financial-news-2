Ethanol futures rose as gasoline
surged to a nine-month high after the U.S. escalated warnings to
 Iran  about its nuclear program.  Futures advanced to the highest level in seven weeks,
following gasoline higher after U.S. officials warned that the
nation could join  Israel  in attacking Iran if the Islamic
republic doesn’t dispel concerns that its nuclear-research
program is aimed at producing weapons.  “Crude’s up today and gasoline was on fire,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management Inc. in
Galena,  Illinois . “That carried over to ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery gained 0.4 cent to
$2.264 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price
since Jan. 11. Futures have risen 2.8 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  jumped 5.5
cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.31 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel increased 5.5 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.295,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 4.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$2.22 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive rose 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.35.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.77 to settle at
$108.84 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , then
climbed past $110 after a report of a pipeline explosion in
 Saudi Arabia .  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline for April delivery gained 9.45 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $3.3517 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol traded at a record $1.09-a-gallon discount to
gasoline, based on today’s prices, giving refiners incentive to
blend the fuel to capture the spread between the two, Babler
said.  Industry advocates are  working  to get higher blends of the
fuel beyond the current 10 percent typically found at pumps sold
at filling stations, after winning a victory from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency last year to allow gasoline to
contain as much as 15 percent ethanol for vehicles made after
2001.  Distillers are losing 11 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
