Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s changes to its privacy
policy don’t comply with European data-protection rules,
European Union Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  said.  Google implemented the changes today as scheduled, defying
two requests by European data-protection authorities to delay
its plans during an investigation, saying it would cause
“confusion” for users.  Regulators “are very concerned because they are persuaded
that these new rules are not at all compliant with the existing
European laws,” Reding said in an interview with Bloomberg TV
today in London.  Google refused a second request to postpone the changes by
France’s National Commission for Computing and Civil Liberties,
or CNIL, two days ago. The  Mountain View , California-based
company said it gave enough notice to regulators and its
customers of its plans and is “confident” the new policy
complies with European rules. CNIL, charged by European privacy
regulators with looking into the matter, made the request after
a preliminary review prompted “strong doubts” about the plans.  The changes combine privacy policies across various Google
platforms to create a “beautifully simple, intuitive user
experience,” the company’s January announcement said.  While current European rules offer the “highest” degree
of personal data protection, Reding said, enforcement isn’t
coordinated across the region. That means individual countries’
regulators would have to initiate their own actions against
Google.  To contact the reporter on this story:
