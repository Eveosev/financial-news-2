MathWorks Inc., a maker of product-
design software for engineers, is being investigated by European
Union antitrust regulators over its refusal to supply a rival
with information to help it make compatible products.  The European Commission said it will check whether closely
held MathWorks rejected a competitor’s request for end-user
licenses and interoperability information to prevent it from
“reverse engineering” or analyzing software code to make
products that worked with MathWorks’ Simulink and MATLAB
software, used in car design and other industries.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  was fined 899 million euros by the EU and
ordered to provide data to competitors to allow servers to
connect to computers using the  Windows operating system .
MathWorks in 2002 settled a U.S. antitrust case that examined
whether it colluded with Wind River Systems Inc. to eliminate a
rival for design software.  “As in the Microsoft case, the issue of software
interoperability is central to this investigation,” regulators
said in a statement. “The opening of proceedings means the
commission will examine the case as a matter of priority.”  MathWorks, based in Natick,  Massachusetts , didn’t
immediately respond to a call and e-mails before normal business
hours. The company makes software used by engineers to design
computerized control systems for anti-lock brakes on cars,
guidance systems for unmanned spacecraft and aircraft flight
controls.  EU regulators said last year that they were reviewing the
practices of producers of computer-aided design software.  To contact the reporter on this story:
