Hong Kong’s retail sales  rose less
than analysts forecast in January, limiting gains to the city
from Lunar New Year holiday spending.  Sales increased 14.9 percent from a year earlier to HK$43.2
billion ($5.6 billion), the government said on its website
today. That compared with a revised 23.5 percent gain in
December and the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven economists of 24 percent.  Sales of jewelry and watches during the holiday were
“quite disappointing,” the  Hong Kong  Retail Management
Association said before today’s release. While higher prices
during the festival may have discouraged some shoppers, the
government said that February numbers are needed to get a
picture free of seasonal distortions.  “Never-subsiding inflationary pressure may start to
bite,” Raymond Yeung, a Hong Kong-based economist at  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
