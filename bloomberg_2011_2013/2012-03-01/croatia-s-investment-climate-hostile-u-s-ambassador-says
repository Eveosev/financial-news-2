Croatia ’s investment climate can be
“hostile” to foreign investors, U.S. Ambassador James Foley
said, citing high labor costs and slow bureaucracy among the
biggest obstacles to capital inflows.  Croatia ranks low in “rigidity of employment, efficiency
of legal framework and wastefulness of  government spending ,”
Foley told a panel in Zagreb today, citing data from  Doing
Business , a joint 2012 report on measuring business regulations
by the  World Bank  and the  International Finance Corporation .  The Adriatic Sea nation, which will probably join the
European Union next year, is struggling to recover from a two-
year recession. The eight-week old government, led by the  Social
Democrats , seeks to revive foreign investment by injecting 8
billion kuna ($703 million) from reconstruction banks and EU
funds into infrastructure and energy projects.  Foreign direct investment dropped to $583 million in 2010
from $6 billion in 2008. It rose to $668 million in the first
six months of 2011, according to the central bank.  “It is almost absurd that Croatia ranks so low when we
measure the ease of doing business, as it ranks much higher in
math and science education and research,” Foley said. “It is
easy and simple to implement changes that would rapidly lead to
new  capital investment .”  The  World Bank  on Dec. 13 urged the government to relax its
labor legislation and strengthen tax collection. It also
recommended “consolidation” of public wages and social
benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
