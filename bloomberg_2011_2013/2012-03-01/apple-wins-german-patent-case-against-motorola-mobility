Apple Inc. (AAPL)  won a Munich court ruling
against Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. in a case over patents
protecting photo-management on mobile devices.  The ruling held that only the “zoomed in” mode in viewing
photos on mobile devices infringed a patent, not the “zoomed
out” mode, Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed statement. The
company doesn’t expect the ruling to effect future sales as the
company has already implemented a new way to view photos,
Motorola Mobility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
