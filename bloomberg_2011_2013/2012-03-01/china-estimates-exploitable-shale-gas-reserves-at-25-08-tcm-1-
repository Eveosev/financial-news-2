China  has 25.08 trillion cubic
meters (886 trillion cubic feet) of exploitable onshore shale-
gas reserves, according to the nation’s land ministry.  The resources are part of an estimated 134.42 trillion
cubic meters of total reserves of the gas in the country, the
Ministry of Land and Resources said in a  statement  on its
website today, citing a nationwide survey. Shale gas has already
been discovered in 880,000 square kilometers (340,000 square
miles) of exploration blocks that contain 15.95 trillion cubic
meters of the fuel that can be extracted, it said.  China, which has yet to produce shale gas commercially,
aims to triple the use of natural gas by 2020 to 10 percent of
energy consumption to curb pollution. It plans shale-gas output
of 6.5 billion cubic meters a year by 2015 rising to 80 billion
by 2020, Zhang Dawei, deputy head of the ministry’s Strategic
Research Center, said in October, citing a draft of a national
program.  “China is rich in shale-gas resources, which are suitable
for scaled development,” Yu Haifeng, deputy director of the
ministry’s geological exploration department said in the
statement. “But the geological conditions are complex and our
exploration technology, which lags behind advanced countries,
requires innovation.”  Auction Plans  The country aims to start development of shale gas
resources by 2015 and accelerate its extraction by 2020,
according to today’s statement.  China will hold one or two auctions of shale-gas blocks
this year, it said, without giving details.  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028) , the nation’s second-largest oil company, and
Henan Provincial Coal Seam Gas Development and Utilization Co.
won the rights to explore two areas in the country’s first
shale-gas auction in June.  China’s shale formations may hold 1,275 trillion cubic feet
of technically-recoverable gas, or 12 times the country’s
conventional gas deposits, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said in April 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
