Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) , India’s
second-largest state refiner, bought 2 million barrels of
Nigerian crude for loading in April from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  via a
tender, said four traders who declined to be identified because
they aren’t authorized to speak with the media.  The company secured 1 million barrels each of Qua Iboe and
Agbami crudes to be loaded in a supertanker, they said.  Bharat Petroleum also purchased 1 million barrels of
Libya’s Sharara crude, the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
