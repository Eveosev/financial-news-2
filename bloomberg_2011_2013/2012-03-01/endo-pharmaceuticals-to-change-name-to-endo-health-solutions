Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. (ENDP) ,
maker of the Opana ER painkiller, plans to change its name to
Endo Health Solutions Inc. to reflect that the company’s range
of products has expanded  The new name will “reflect the company’s significant
transformation,” the  Chadds Ford , Pennsylvania-based company
said in a statement today. A call to Kevin Wiggins, spokesman
for Endo, wasn’t immediately returned.  Endo’s products now include devices, practice management
software and both branded and generic drugs after acquisitions
including the $2.9 billion purchase of American Medical Systems
Holding Inc. announced in April 2011. Endo will ask shareholders
to approve the new name at its annual shareholder meeting in
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
