France ’s  unemployment rate  rose in
the fourth quarter as the euro-area debt crisis undermined
confidence among executives, and economic growth cooled.  About 9.8 percent of the population was unemployed,
according to International Labour Organization standards, up
from 9.7 in the previous three months, national statistics
office Insee in Paris said today. Excluding France’s overseas
territories, the rate was 9.4 percent, compared with a median
forecast of 9.6 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight
economists.  French growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the final three
months of last year, prompting companies including Alcatel-
Lucent and  PSA Peugeot Citroen SA (UG)  to prepare job cuts. The
number of people actively looking for work has climbed for eight
straight months and reached a 12-year high of 2.86 million at
the end of January, the Labor Ministry said this week.  There is “room for stabilization but little for
improvement as growth is expected to remain low,” Fabrice Montagne, an economist at  Barclays Capital  in London, said
before the data were published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
