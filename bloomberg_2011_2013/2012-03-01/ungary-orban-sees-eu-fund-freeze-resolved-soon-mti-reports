Hungary  expects a European Union
proposal to freeze the payment of development funds to be
“taken off the agenda soon” as the issue is of a “technical
nature” and will be “resolved,” state news service  MTI  said,
citing Prime Minister  Viktor Orban .  The European Commission proposed the suspension of
infrastructure-development funds after Hungary failed to reduce
its excessive budget  deficit  in a sustainable manner, MTI said.
Orban previously called the proposal “completely irrational,”
according to the news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
