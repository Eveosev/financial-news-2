Spain  and France sold 12.5 billion
euros ($16.7 billion) of bonds as European Central Bank loans to
banks helped spur demand, pushing borrowing costs lower.  The Spanish auction met its maximum target, with 4.5
billion euros of bonds sold. France issued 7.99 billion euros of
debt, at the top end of the range targeted by the treasury.
Total demand at the French auction was 2.5 times the amount of
bonds on offer.  The auctions suggest that at least some of the 1 trillion
euros in loans the ECB is providing to  Europe ’s banks is flowing
into  government bonds , easing the region’s debt crisis and
eclipsing concern about slowing growth. The Frankfurt-based
central bank yesterday allocated 529.5 billion euros in three-
year loans to 800 banks, topping the 489 billion euros handed
out to 523 lenders in the first such operation in December.  “The banks have loads of money to invest, so it’s hardly a
surprise that the auctions have gone well,” said  Bill Blain , a
strategist at Newedge Group in  London . “What’s the long-term
outlook? That’s less sure.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yield fell 7 basis points after the
auction to 4.899 percent as of 11:56 a.m. The yield difference
over German bunds of the same maturity narrowed 11 basis points
to 306 points. France’s 10-year yield slid 8.3 basis points to
2.782 percent. The spread over bunds dropped to 96 points.  Auction Details  Spain sold 1.9 billion euros of benchmark three-year bonds
maturing in July 2015 to yield 2.617 percent, down from 3.332
percent when the security was last auctioned Feb. 16.  A bond maturing in April 2014 was sold to yield 2.069
percent, while a 2016 bond was priced to yield 3.376 percent
compared with 4.021 percent on Jan. 19, the Madrid-based Bank of
Spain said today.  Demand for the benchmark three-year bond was 2.37 times the
amount sold, the Treasury said, compared with 2.19 times on Feb.
16. Demand for the April 2014 bond was 2.81 times the amount
sold, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.59 for the 2016 bond
compared with 3.24 on Jan. 19.  France  sold 3.92 billion euros of benchmark 10-year debt at
an average yield of 2.91 percent. The borrowing cost for the 3
percent bond maturing in April 2022 was less than the average
yield of 3.13 percent on Feb. 2. France also sold five, six and
15-year debt, will yields falling on all.  To contact the reporter on this story:
