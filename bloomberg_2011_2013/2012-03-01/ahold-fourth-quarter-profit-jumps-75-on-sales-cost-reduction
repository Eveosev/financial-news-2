Royal Ahold NV (AH) , the Dutch owner of
Stop & Shop grocery stores, said fourth-quarter profit jumped 75
percent as revenue increased and one-time costs fell.  Net income advanced to 270 million euros ($360 million)
from 154 million euros a year earlier, the Amsterdam-based
company said in a statement. Analysts expected net income of
253.5 million euros, according to the average of six predictions
in a Bloomberg survey. Ahold said in January that sales rose 4.5
percent to 7.3 billion euros in the period.  ``We are pleased with our performance in the fourth
quarter, delivering solid results in the  United States  and the
Netherlands,’’ Chief Executive Officer  Dick Boer  said in the
statement. At the same time, ``we expect 2012 to be another
challenging year for the food retail industry. The macro-
economic environment means that consumers still continue to look
for value and competition will remain intense.’’  Boer, who took the helm in March 2011, is planning to boost
Ahold’s online business, expand in Belgium and add  convenience
stores  to reverse slowing sales growth. Ahold said Feb. 27 it
plans to acquire online retailer Bol.com for 350 million euros
to boost  Internet sales .  Ahold, which owns Albert Heijn stores in the Netherlands,
also plans to cut costs by an additional 350 million euros over
three years and increase the proportion of earnings paid as
dividends. For 2011 the company is planning a payout of 40 cents
a share, a 38 percent increase.  The company’s Giant Food Stores agreed to buy 16 Genuardi’s
outlets from  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  for $106 million in January to expand
in the Philadelphia area.  The  stock declined  0.7 percent to 10.38 euros yesterday in
Amsterdam, paring its 12-month gain to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
