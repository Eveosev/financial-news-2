Peru ’s sol advanced to its strongest
level in 15 years as companies bought the currency to pay local
taxes and a fall in U.S. jobless claims boosted demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6740 per  U.S. dollar  at 11:49
a.m. in Lima, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The
currency earlier touched 2.6720, its strongest level since 1997,
 data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  “Companies are bringing forward their currency purchases
to pay taxes” this month and next, said Samuel Torres, chief
executive officer of NCF Bolsa SAB, a Lima-based brokerage.
“Good news from the international market has led the sol to a
more marked appreciation.”  U.S. stocks climbed as weekly American jobless claims
dropped and borrowing costs fell for Spain and  France . Copper,
Peru’s top export, rose in New York amid stronger growth in
Chinese manufacturing.  Peru’s central bank bought $3.68 billion in the first two
months of this year to stem gains in the sol, surpassing the
$3.51 billion it purchased in all of 2011.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries dropped 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to a four-month low of 185, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
