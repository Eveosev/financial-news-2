The Philippine peso halted a two-day
gain and bonds rose before the central bank cut  interest rates 
for a second time this year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered the rate on overnight
deposits by 25 basis points to 4 percent, a move predicted by 14
of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The decision was
announced after the close of local trading.  “A 25-basis point cut is widely expected by the market,”
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore, said
before the rate review. “That is negative for the currency.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 42.820 per dollar at the close
in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Inflows into the stock market will support the peso, Rao
predicted. Global funds boosted ownership of local shares by
$518 million this year, exchange data show, contributing to the
currency’s 2.4 percent gain.  The yield on the government’s 6.375 percent bonds due
January 2022 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.17 percent, according to noon fixing prices from the
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  Consumer-price increases slowed to a 13-month low of 3.9
percent in January, according to government data. Inflation
probably eased to between 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent in
February, Tetangco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
