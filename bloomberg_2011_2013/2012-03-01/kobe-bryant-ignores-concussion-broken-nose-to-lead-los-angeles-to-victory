Kobe Bryant scored 31 points to lead
the  Los Angeles  Lakers to a 104-85 win against the Minnesota
Timberwolves, a day after being held out of practice because of
a concussion and a broken nose.  Bryant, who added seven rebounds and eight assists, was
injured when he was fouled byDwyane Wade of the  Miami Heat  in
the National Basketball Association’s All-Star game four days
ago.  Bryant, 33, was cleared by a neurologist to play about an
hour before last night’s game at the Staples Center in Los
Angeles. He played wearing a mask.  “He’s been examined and re-evaluated and he’s gone through
every one of the specific tests that we’ve required him to go
through,” Dr. Vern Williams told reporters before the game,
“and he’s passed them all with flying colors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
