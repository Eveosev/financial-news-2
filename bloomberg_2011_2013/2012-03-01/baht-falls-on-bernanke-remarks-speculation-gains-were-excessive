Thailand ’s baht dropped by the most
in four months as a technical gauge that traders use to predict
price swings signaled the dollar is poised to rebound.  The Thai currency retreated from its strongest level in
more than five months after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s remarks to Congress damped expectation of more
quantitative easing to boost the world’s largest economy. The
dollar’s 14-day relative strength index against the baht
yesterday slid below the 30 threshold that suggests its decline
will reverse.  “We have seen quite a fast appreciation recently and
investors probably wanted to take profits anyway,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok.
“Bernanke’s comments encouraged some buy-back of dollars.”  The baht slumped 0.7 percent to 30.46 per dollar as of 9
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 30.21 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept.
15. Hasegawa said he expects it will trade between 30.10 and
30.60 until the end of next week.  Bernanke said yesterday there are “positive developments”
in the U.S. labor market, adding that “the job market remains
far from normal.”  Government bonds  were little changed before a government
report today that may show inflation accelerated to 3.5 percent
in February from a 10-month low of 3.38 percent the previous
month, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Data is due 11:30 a.m. local time. The yield
on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 was steady at 3.41
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
