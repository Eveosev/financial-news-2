Mumbai home sales in August dropped
to a 27-month low as higher interest rates and  home prices 
crimped demand, according to brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.  Registered sales declined 25 percent to 4,611 units last
month from a year earlier, Kejal Mehta, an analyst at the
brokerage, wrote in a report dated Sept. 19. Sales in Mumbai’s
suburbs dropped 26 percent, while transactions in the city slid
22 percent, she said.  Rising borrowing costs are prompting Mumbai residents to
defer purchases, the brokerage said.  India ’s central bank has
raised interest rates 12 times since March 2010. The  Reserve
Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to 8.25 percent from
8 percent on Sept. 16.  “The data for August reaffirms the downtrend in sales the
city has been witnessing for the last one year now,” Mehta said
in the note. “We believe that lower affordability on account of
higher  interest rates  will continue for a while.”  As property prices continue to defy gravity, sales are
likely to worsen in the absence of a favorable change in the
buyer affordability dynamic, Mehta said.  Lease volumes rose 4 percent from the same period a year
ago, Mehta said. Lease registrations in August climbed to 8,102
units from a year ago, according to the note.  Registration data is a lagging indicator of demand as
properties are registered two to three months after the actual
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
