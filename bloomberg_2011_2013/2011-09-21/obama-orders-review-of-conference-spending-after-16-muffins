The Obama administration directed
heads of federal agencies to review money spent on conferences a
day after a U.S.  Justice Department  audit faulted agencies for
overpayments for food, including one case where $16 muffins were
served.  While the review is conducted, the deputy secretary or
equivalent chief operating officer of each agency will have to
sign off on all conference-related expenses, according to a
statement released by Vice President  Joe Biden ’s office. Biden
is overseeing administration efforts to cut wasteful spending.  Biden said he will convene agency heads in December “and
ask each and every one of them what they are doing to get on top
of conference-related expenses and cut waste in this area and in
other parts of their operations.”  The Justice Department’s inspector general reviewed a
sample of 10 department conferences held between October 2007
and September 2009 that cost $4.4 million. The period spanned
the administrations of Republican  George W. Bush  and Democrat
Barack Obama.  The muffins were served at an August 2009 conference of the
Executive Office for Immigration Review.  At a February 2008 meeting hosted by the Executive Office
for U.S. Attorneys, beef Wellington appetizers that cost $7.32
per serving were dished out, the audit found. A March 2009
conference of the Office on Violence Against Women served
Cracker Jack, popcorn and candy bars at a single break, costing
$32 per person, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
