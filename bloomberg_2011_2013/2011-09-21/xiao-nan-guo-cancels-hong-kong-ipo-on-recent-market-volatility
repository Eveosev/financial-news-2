Xiao Nan Guo Restaurants Holdings
Ltd., an operator of restaurants in  China , said it canceled a
HK$581 million ($75 million) initial public offering in Hong
Kong because of “recent excessive market volatility.”  The company made the decision in the interests of investors
after consulting the sale’s sponsors, according to a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing yesterday. Xiao Nan Guo, based in
 Shanghai , said it will refund deposit money.  The chain planned to sell 335 million shares to fund new
restaurants and repay bank loans, according to a Sept. 15
offering document. As of Sept. 19, investors had lost money on
37 of the 48 companies that started trading this year, and
equity sales are set for the slowest third quarter since 2008.
Companies have canceled or delayed more than $14 billion of
equity offerings in  Hong Kong  this year, a record.  XCMG Construction Machinery Co. delayed a Hong Kong stock
sale of as much as $1.5 billion, people with knowledge of the
matter said last week. Sany Heavy Industry Co. delayed its first
share sale in the city for “a few days,” the South China
Morning Post newspaper said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
