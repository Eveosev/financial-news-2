Gasoline advanced on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  may signal more economic stimulus
today, boosting economic growth and fuel demand.  Futures gained as the Fed’s Open Market Committee completes
a two-day meeting today. The FOMC may replace short-term
Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio with long-term bonds
in a bid to lower rates for mortgages, auto and consumer loans,
according to a survey by Bloomberg News.  “The market is really just treading water waiting for the
Fed,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at
Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas. “Will the Fed be
aggressive? Will they be passive?”  Gasoline for October delivery increased 1.97 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.7211 a gallon at 9:48 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
U.S. oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington . Gasoline
stockpiles probably rose 1.35 million barrels, according to the
median estimate of 16 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.
Supplies of diesel and heating oil rose 1 million barrels.  Heating oil for October delivery gained 0.21 cent to
$2.9637 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
1 cent to $3.57 a gallon yesterday, a one-month low, according
to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
