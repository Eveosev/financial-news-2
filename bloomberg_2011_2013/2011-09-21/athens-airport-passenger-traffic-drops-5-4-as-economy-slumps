Athens International Airport SA 
said passenger traffic in the first eight months of this year
fell 5.4 percent as the economic crisis hurt domestic travel.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport dropped to 10.1 million, from 10.6 million a year
earlier, according to the statement on the company’s  website 
today. Domestic passenger numbers declined 12 percent, to 3.4
million, and international traffic fell to 6.6 million from 6.7
million, the statement said.  Greek travel spending has been hit by the economic crisis,
the company said. Strikes, especially in the  transportation
industry  “negatively affected” tourist arrivals and hurt the
capital’s image, according to the statement. Taxi drivers were
on strike for almost three weeks at the height of Greece’s
tourist season and have resumed industrial action this month
with a 24-hour walkout scheduled for tomorrow.  In August, the number of domestic travelers was down 4.1
percent, at 533,112. International traffic fell for the first
time in five months, down 2.4 percent to 1.1 million euros.  The government passed a 28 billion-euro ($40 billion)
package of extra austerity measures in June and European leaders
agreed on a second aid package for Greece after a 110 billion-
euro European Union-led bailout in May last year failed to
convince that the country could avoid a default.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, will account for almost
16 percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs
in 2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
