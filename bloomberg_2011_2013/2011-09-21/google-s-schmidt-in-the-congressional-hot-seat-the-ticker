Today's performance by Google Inc. chairman  Eric Schmidt  on  Capitol Hill  was a good reminder why corporate bosses don't enjoy testifying before Congress. Schmidt appeared at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on " The Power of Google: Serving Consumers or Threatening Competition?"  As much as Schmidt tried to share a pro-consumer message, senators generally pounded away at potential antitrust issues. The Federal Trade Commission earlier this year said it is looking into allegations of  anticompetitive behavior  by Google, which dominates the online search market. Google's stock traded at $548 when the hearing started at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Shares proceeded to zigzag for the rest of the afternoon, generally heading downward, in line with general market declines. Schmidt's testimony was available for public viewing via a  webcast . One bumpy moment arose when Wisconsin Democrat  Herb Kohl  pressed Schmidt about why Google's own services, such as Google Finance, achieve such high placements among search results. Schmidt's initial answer didn't satisfy Kohl, who pulled up a less diplomatic explanation from a Google lieutenant in a 2007 interview: "We do all the work for the search page â€¦ so we do put it first." Schmidt also drew fire from Utah Republican  Mike Lee  about Google's search algorithms, and from Texas Republican  John Cornyn  about Google's past willingness to run questionable ads from Canadian online pharmacies. Google stock briefly rallied toward the end of Schmidt's testimony but finished the day at about $539, its low for the session. (George Anders is a member of Bloomberg View's editorial board.)
