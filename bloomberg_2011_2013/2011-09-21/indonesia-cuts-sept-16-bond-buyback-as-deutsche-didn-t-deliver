The Indonesian government reduced
the amount of bonds it bought back on Sept. 16 to 183 billion
rupiah from an earlier announced figure of 303 billion rupiah,
the  finance ministry ’s debt management office said in a
statement on its website today.  Deutsche Bank AG didn’t complete the transaction as it
“failed to deliver” 120 billion rupiah of bonds to the finance
ministry by the Sept. 20 settlement deadline, the statement
said.  The system failure was external to Deutsche Bank and the
ministry is aware the non-delivery was out of the bank’s
control, Mark Bennewith, a Singapore-based spokesman at the bank
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
