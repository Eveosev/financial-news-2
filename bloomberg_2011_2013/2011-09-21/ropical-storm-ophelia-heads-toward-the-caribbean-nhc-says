Tropical Storm Ophelia, the 15th
named storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season , is moving west
toward the Caribbean and is expected to strengthen in the coming
days, the National Hurricane Center said.  Ophelia was about 1,370 miles (2,200 kilometers) east of
the Leeward Islands moving at 13 miles per hour, the center said
today in a website  advisory . It has maximum sustained winds of
45 mph. Tropical storm-force winds extend as much as 175 miles
from its center, the NHC said.  The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through
November. Elsewhere, a tropical depression formed about 170
miles south-southeast of Puerto Escondido off  Mexico ’s west
coast with 35 mph winds. It’s moving west-northwest at 5 mph and
may grow into a tropical storm later today, the NHC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
