The Philippines reported a budget
surplus in August, helped by higher  tax revenue , narrowing the
eight-month deficit to 15 percent of the level a year earlier.  The surplus was 9.22 billion pesos ($210 million), compared
with a 26.5 billion-peso deficit reported for July, the
government said in an e-mailed statement in  Manila . The eight-
month gap was 34.493 billion pesos from 228.104 billion pesos in
the same period in 2010. Revenue rose 15.16 percent last month,
and while spending gained 7.93 percent in August, the cumulative
amount was still 8.12 percent lower from a year earlier,
according to the statement.  “The government needs to spend more because it’s pulling
down growth,”  Luz Lorenzo , an economist at ATR-Kim Eng
Securities Inc. in Manila, said before the report. “We really
have to boost domestic demand because the global economy is
weak. So far, private consumption and private investment are
doing well and it’s the public sector that is holding us down.”  President  Benigno Aquino  met with businessmen in the U.S.
this week to seek investments as he strives to bolster economic
growth to as much as 8 percent annually. Expansion eased to 3.4
percent in the three months through June from a year earlier,
cooling for a fourth straight quarter as faltering recoveries in
 Europe  and the U.S. cloud the outlook for exports.  The government plans to narrow the  budget deficit  to 2.6
percent of gross domestic product, or about 286 billion pesos,
in 2012, from a target of 3 percent, or about 300 billion pesos,
this year.  Aquino won two credit rating upgrades in June as he chases
tax evaders and corrupt officials to narrow the budget gap from
a record 314.5 billion pesos in 2010.  Fitch Ratings  raised the
country’s debt to one step below investment grade on June 23.
Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the Philippines’ $200 billion
economy to two levels below investment grade on June 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
