A possible new global recession and
a breakup of the euro are risks that policy makers have to take
into account in the coming period, said Gianlucca Salsecci, the
head of macroeconomic research of  Italy ’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)   Emerging markets are growing “quite well and the U.S. is
expected to benefit from the fiscal package, but it is not clear
in advanced European countries how exit strategies are
eventually managed and how will they work,” he told a business
forum in Belgrade today.  A risk of the euro’s break should not be dismissed,
Salsecci said, adding that “the cost of break would be higher
than the cost of adjustment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
