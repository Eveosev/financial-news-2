The  New Zealand  and Australian
dollars fell to the lowest levels in more than a month versus
their U.S. counterpart as stocks and commodities slid after the
 Federal Reserve  said there are “significant downside risks” to
the economic outlook.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, dropped earlier
after the nation posted a current-account deficit that was wider
than economists forecast. The Aussie fell earlier as stocks
retreated after European officials said they plan to return to
Athens next week after three days of consultations failed to
produced a solution to the country’s debt crisis.  “That the Fed sees more risks to the downside is putting a
lot of pressure on risk,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-
exchange strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York . “We are
seeing commodity currencies depreciate quite sharply after the
announcement, with the Australian and  New Zealand dollar  losing
quite dramatically.”  New Zealand’s currency plunged 2.8 percent to 80.13 U.S.
cents at 3:50 p.m. in New York, from 82.42 cents yesterday. The
kiwi touched 80.05 cents, the lowest level since Aug. 9. It
tumbled 2.5 percent to 61.44 yen, from 63.  The Aussie slid 1.9 percent to $1.0084, from $1.0276, and
touched $1.0062, also the weakest since Aug. 9. The currency
dropped 1.7 percent to 77.22 yen, from 78.57.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 3 percent, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials fell 1.1
percent.  Fed Plan  The U.S. central bank will buy $400 billion of bonds with
maturities of six to 30 years through June while selling an
equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less, the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said today in  Washington  after a
two-day meeting. The action “should put downward pressure on
longer-term  interest rates  and help make broader financial
conditions more accommodative,” the FOMC said.  New Zealand’s current-account deficit was NZ$921 million
($757 million) in the second quarter, Statistics New Zealand
said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a shortfall of NZ$671 million.  The nation’s gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent in the
three months through June from the prior quarter, according to
the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before a
government report tomorrow at 10:45 a.m. in Wellington. The
economy grew 0.8 percent in the first quarter.  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard said the
central bank is in no rush to raise interest rates even as
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and a U.S. slowdown are having a
minimal impact on economic growth. He spoke at a Euromoney
conference in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
