Italian police and North African
immigrants protesting their possible repatriation clashed on the
island of Lampedusa today, leaving dozens of people injured.  The incident began in the old port area where the
immigrants, mostly from  Tunisia , were demonstrating. After they
threatened to blow up gas canisters stolen from a restaurant,
police moved in, and some inhabitants also took part in the
clashes, a Finance Police spokesman on the island said by phone.
Three police officers and dozens of immigrants were injured,
ANSA newswire reported, citing a police official.  Political turmoil in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya has triggered
an exodus of people to the island, an entry point to  Europe , 165
miles (265 kilometers) north of Tunisia. Its mayor, Bernardino
De Rubeis, said that some 55,000 migrants had passed through the
island since the unrest began in North Africa early this year.  “Now that the war scenarios are over in  Libya  and Tunisia,
we face human trafficking and can’t keep talking about it as a
humanitarian emergency,” De Rubeis said in an interview on SKY
TG24 today. “That’s why Lampedusa must close its doors.”  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , whose main coalition ally
is the anti-immigrant  Northern League , traveled to Lampedusa on
March 30 to show support for residents of the island, which has
a population of 6,300, according to statistics institute Istat.
The billionaire told a crowd in the main square that he’d bought
a villa there to show his commitment to their plight.  “I will become a Lampedusan myself,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
