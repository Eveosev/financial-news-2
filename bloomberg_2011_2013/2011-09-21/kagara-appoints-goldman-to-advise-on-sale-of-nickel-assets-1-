Kagara Ltd. (KZL) , a mining company with
operations in Queensland and  Western Australia , said it
appointed Goldman Sachs and Partners Australia Ltd. to help sell
its Forrestania nickel assets.  “A strategic review of the company’s assets has determined
the nickel assets to be non-core,” the Perth-based company said
in a stock exchange filing today. The sale may include the
Lounge Lizard mine in Western Australia, it said.  Kagara produces zinc, copper and lead from its mines in
Queensland. Selling the nickel assets will allow the company to
focus on the other mines, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
