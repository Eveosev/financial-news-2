The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading 
said it received a so-called super-complaint from an advocacy
group about the cost of obtaining foreign currency and overseas
use of credit and debit cards. The OFT will consider whether
there is significant harm to consumers and will publish a
response by Dec. 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
