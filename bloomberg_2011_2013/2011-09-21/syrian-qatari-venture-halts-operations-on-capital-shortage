Syrian-Qatari Holding, a joint
venture between the governments of  Syria  and Qatar, halted
projects with an estimated cost of $2 billion after its two
shareholders failed to provide enough capital, Chief Executive
Officer Hassan Mukayed said.  Syrian-Qatari Holding, founded in 2008, had signed
agreements on two power-generation projects, a hospital and
dairy farms in Syria, he said today in an e-mailed statement.
The company had aimed to attract $18 billion in foreign direct
investment to Syria over the next 15 years and create 325,000
jobs, he said.  Syria has been engulfed in a wave of unrest since the
eruption of pro-reform protests earlier this year. Qatar Fuel
Co., the oil products distributor and retailer known as Woqod,
decided to halt a project in Syria because of the unstable
security situation in the country, Al-Arab newspaper reported
