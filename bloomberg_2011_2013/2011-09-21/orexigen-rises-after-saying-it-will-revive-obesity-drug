Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  surged
the most in nine months after reaching an agreement with U.S.
regulators that allows the company to renew development of the
experimental obesity drug Contrave.  Orexigen increased 72 cents, or 49 percent, to $2.19 at
4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading for the
biggest single-day gain since Dec. 8. Shares of the La Jolla,
California-based company have declined 73 percent this year.  Orexigen, one of three companies with rival obesity
treatments competing for approval, will start a two-year
clinical trial to study heart risks in the first half of next
year, aiming to receive clearance for Contrave from the Food and
Drug Administration in 2014, the company said yesterday in a
statement.  Orexigen said June 3 it would halt U.S. development of
Contrave after the FDA said a large study on heart risks would
be required before the drug could be approved, a move the
company called unprecedented.  The study would require fewer than 10,000 patients and less
than two years from the beginning to the interim analysis, the
company said.  Orexigen and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. of Osaka,
Japan, have been vying with Mountain View, California-based
 Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  and  Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  of San Diego to
introduce the first new obesity medicine in the U.S. in more
than a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
