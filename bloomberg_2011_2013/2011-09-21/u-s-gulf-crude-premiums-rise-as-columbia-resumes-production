U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened after Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. said it would
resume output “gradually” at  Colombia ’s largest oil field
following a protest.  The company began cutting output yesterday amid protests by
contract employees. Police are guarding the Rubiales field in
eastern Colombia, where “calm” has returned, company President
Jose Francisco Arata said in an e-mail.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 50 cents to
