Philippine President  Benigno Aquino 
said he got “into conflict” with the Roman Catholic Church
when he pushed for the “responsible parenthood” bill, which
will provide free contraceptives to the poor and give couples a
choice on “how to best plan” their families.  “We have our own personal religious beliefs, but we have
to separate the actions of the state and those of the church,”
Aquino said in a forum in  New York City , which was aired on the
Philippine government’s website. The bill, which he certified as
a Congress priority, is not for population control and is
‘‘after educating’’ the public, Aquino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
