Polandâ€™s zloty retreated versus the
euro, extending its losing streak into a third day, after
European officials said they plan to return to  Athens  next week
to complete a review of the Greek economy.  The zloty lost 0.5 percent to 4.3961 per euro as of 10:06
a.m. in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
