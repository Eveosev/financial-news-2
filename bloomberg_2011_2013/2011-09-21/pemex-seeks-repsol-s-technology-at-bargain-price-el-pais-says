Petroleos Mexicanos, the Mexican
state-owned company, is looking for strategic opportunities at a
bargain price from  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  after forming an alliance with
 Spain ’s  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) ,  El Pais  reported, citing an
internal document.  Pemex sees its position as an “opportunity” to “capture
specific benefits” and “influence in strategic and operational
decisions” in Repsol, the newspaper said. Among those are
Repsol’s crude oil supplies to refineries and its technology for
deep water operations, El Pais added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
