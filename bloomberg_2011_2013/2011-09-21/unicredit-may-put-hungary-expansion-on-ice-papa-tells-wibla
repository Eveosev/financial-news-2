UniCredit SpA (UCG) , eastern  Europe ’s
biggest bank, may put its planned branch expansion in  Hungary  on
ice, the lender’s regional head Gianni Papa was quoted as saying
in Austrian newspaper WirtschaftsBlatt.  The Hungarian government’s plan to allow repayment of
foreign-currency mortgages at rates below market levels had come
as a “shock,” Papa told WirtschaftsBlatt. UniCredit has about
765 million euros ($1 billion) in foreign-currency loans
outstanding in Hungary and may make a loss in the “low double-
digit” million-euro range because of the law, he told the
Vienna-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
