Kenyan police have begun
investigations into a hand grenade found yesterday in the
basement of Prime Minister  Raila Odinga ’s office in Nairobi.  “There is some kind of mischief,” Mathew Iteere, head of
the force, said today in the capital Nairobi, after showing
reporters where the non-lethal grenade, of the type used for
training, was found. “The room is dusty but the item is not
dusty.”  Kenya has a recent history of political violence, sparked
by disputes over the December 2007 presidential election, won by
Mwai Kibaki. Odinga, his rival, said the vote was rigged. The
bloodshed ended with the signing of a power-sharing accord,
brokered by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
that left Kibaki as president and installed Odinga in the newly
created post of prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
