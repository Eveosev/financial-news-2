The following table details
the changes in  Norges Bank â€™s deposit rate.  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the deposit rate
in April 2003 there have been a total of 75 rate decisions
by the bank for which surveys were conducted. In 11 cases the
survey did not match the decision made, resulting in the survey
correctly predicting the decision 85.3% of the time.
