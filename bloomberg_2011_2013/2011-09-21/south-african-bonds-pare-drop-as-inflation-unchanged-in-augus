South African bonds pared an
earlier drop and the rand maintained its decline to the dollar
and after a report showed inflation in the continent’s biggest
economy was unchanged in August, coming in below analysts’
estimates.  The government’s 13.5 percent bonds due September 2015
yielded 6.87 percent at 10:05 a.m. in Johannesburg, compared
with 6.89 percent before the data were released. The rand
depreciated 1 percent to 7.820 per dollar, having traded as much
as 1.7 percent weaker from yesterday’s close.  Inflation was unchanged at 5.3 percent in August from month
earlier, Statistics South Africa said in a report today. The
median forecast by 20 analysts was for an increase of 5.5
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
