The Palestinian Authority will give
the United Nation’s  Security Council  “some time” to mull its
membership application, which will be formally presented on
Friday, said Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.  “We will give some time to the Security Council to
consider first our full membership request before heading to the
General Assembly,” he told reporters in  New York . “We do not
think about it as a tactic or a bluff. We are not seeking to
join the Mafia or al-Qaeda.”  Asked about timing on a vote, Shaath said he “did not
know,” citing South Sudan as an example where a decision was
made in two days and Jordan as another example where it took
nine years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
