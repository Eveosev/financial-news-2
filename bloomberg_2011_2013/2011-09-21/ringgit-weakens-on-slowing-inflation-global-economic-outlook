Malaysia’s ringgit fell on
speculation slowing inflation and economic growth will prompt
the central bank to leave  interest rates  on hold for the rest of
the year. Bonds gained before an auction next week.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with a 3.4 percent gain in July, official data
showed today.  Bank Negara Malaysia  kept its overnight rate at 3
percent at reviews on July 7 and Sept. 8, contributing to the
ringgit’s 3.7 percent drop this quarter. The  International
Monetary Fund  cut its growth estimate for global economies
yesterday and predicted “severe” repercussions if  Europe  fails
to contain its debt crisis.  “Slowing inflation will reinforce the view that interest
rates could be on hold or fall going into the first half of next
year,” said Choong Yin Pheng, manager of economic and fixed-
income research at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“Growth risk is in focus and Asian currencies like the ringgit
have suffered due to Europe’s crisis.”  The ringgit dropped 0.7 percent to 3.1332 per dollar as of
4:49 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.1425 yesterday, the weakest
level since Dec. 21. It has slid 6.4 percent from a 14-year high
of 2.9335 on July 27.  The global economy will expand 4 percent this year and next,
the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook  report , compared with
June forecasts of 4.3 percent for 2011 and of 4.5 percent for
2012. The  U.S. economy  will expand 1.5 percent in 2011 instead
of 2.5 percent, it said.  Malaysia’s 10-year notes gained for a second day. The
treasury will sell 3.5 billion ringgit ($1.1 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2018 on Sept. 27, according to its sale calendar.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 dropped
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.72 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
