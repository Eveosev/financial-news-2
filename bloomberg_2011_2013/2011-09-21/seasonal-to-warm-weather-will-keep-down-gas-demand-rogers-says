Warmer weather forecast for the
northern U.S. will dampen any chance that thermostats will be
turned up to create early season energy demand for heating, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Warmth is expected across the northern Great Plains, while
seasonal temperatures take hold in the Northeast and South, and
that isn’t the kind of weather that increases demand for natural
gas for either heating or cooling, Rogers said in his 6- to 10-
day and 11- to 15-day forecasts covering Sept. 26 to Oct. 5.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
