First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar modules, dropped to a four-year
low after a congressional committee questioned the U.S. Energy
Department’s loan guarantee program.  First Solar fell $5.69, or 7.2 percent, to $73.52 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The shares haven’t traded that low since
June 12, 2007.  First Solar has said it expects to close $4.38 billion in
Energy Department loan guarantees by a Sept. 30 deadline for
three solar projects it’s developing.  The House of Representatives Committee on Energy and
Commerce yesterday sent a  letter  to Energy Secretary Steven Chu
expressing concern that guarantees that have not yet closed may
be rushed to meet the deadline. The program has come under fire
since Solyndra LLC, a solar company that received about $527 in
guarantees, filed for bankruptcy Sept. 6.  “The three First Solar projects that have outstanding loan
applications are essential” to our earnings forecasts for 2012
and 2013, Dan Ries, an analyst at Collins Stewart LLC in  New
York , said today in a note to clients. He has a “buy” rating
on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
