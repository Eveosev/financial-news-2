Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  rose to a one-week
high after  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. (UOBK)  said concerns it paid too
much for a stake in Eastern and Oriental Bhd. and a possible
general offer for the rest of the property developer are
“overblown.”  The stock climbed 1.5 percent to 8.03 ringgit as of 10:25
a.m. local time in  Kuala Lumpur , extending yesterday’s 2.7
percent increase. Sime’s purchase of a 30 percent stake in
Eastern and Oriental will help bolster its property division,
UOB-Kay Hian said in a report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
