British American Investment Co.,
which started trading on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  on Sept. 8,
extended gains for a third day as its price-earnings ratio fell
to a level matching its peers, attracting investors.  Shares in the diversified financial services group climbed
3.5 percent to 5.95 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the
capital, Nairobi, the highest level since Sept. 14. British
American shares had a reference price of 9 shillings and gains
over the last three days have pared its drop since its listing
to 26 percent.  “With the reduced price, it is more attractive in the eyes
of investors,” Victor Odendo, an investment manager at Nairobi-
based CIC Asset Management Ltd. said by phone today. “It is now
in line with the insurance sector average price-earnings
ratio.”  Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC)  trades at 4.79 times reported profit
and  Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL)  at 4.15, according to
Bloomberg data.  “British American listed at a price-earnings ratio of
4.97,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex
Africa Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “At 6 shillings, the
price-earnings ratio is 3.32.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
