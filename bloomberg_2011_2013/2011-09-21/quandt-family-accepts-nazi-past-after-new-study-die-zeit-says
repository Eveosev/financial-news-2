Germany ’s Quandt family, heirs to a
fortune including a stake in  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , have
accepted the involvement of their forefathers with  Adolf
Hitler ’s National Socialists,  Die Zeit  reported in the first
interview with family members to discuss their Nazi past.  Gabriele Quandt, whose grandfather Guenther employed an
estimated 50,000 forced laborers in his arms factories and
acquired companies through the Nazis’ program of
“Aryanization,” said it was wrong for the family to ignore
this chapter of its history, according to Die Zeit.  An independent study by Bonn-based historian Joachim
Scholtyseck, commissioned by the family, concluded that Guenther
Quandt and his son Herbert were responsible for Nazi injustices,
the newspaper said.  Herbert Quandt was “part of the system,” son Stefan
Quandt is cited as saying. The family still plans to award the
Herbert Quandt Media Prize because of the “values he
conferred” in the ensuing four decades “that made him very
much a role model for me,” Stefan Quandt is quoted as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
