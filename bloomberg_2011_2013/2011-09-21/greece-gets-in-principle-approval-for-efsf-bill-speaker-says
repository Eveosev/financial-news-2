Greece â€™s Parliament approved the
expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility in line
with accords reached in Brussels on July 21 in an in-principle
vote, Parliament Speaker Grigoris Niotis said in comments
televised live on state-run Vouli TV today.   Of the 221 lawmakers who voted, 183 cast ballots in favor
and 38 against the bill, which also increased regulation and
reform of financial institutions. A final vote will be held
within the next week.   To contact the reporter on this story:
