U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
denied a BBC television report that ministers are discussing a 5
billion-pound boost for the economy by increasing spending on
capital projects such as roads, rail and broadband.  “I don’t know where that figure of 5 billion came from.
We’re not discussing changes of that kind,” he told Sky News
television today in Birmingham, where his Liberal Democrat party
is holding its annual conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
