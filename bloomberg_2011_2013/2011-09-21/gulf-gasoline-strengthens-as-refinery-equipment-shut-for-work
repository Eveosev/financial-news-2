Gulf Coast gasoline rose after
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut units for repairs at its Three Rivers,
Texas, refinery and  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  restarted a wet gas
compressor in Big Spring, Texas.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange narrowed 0.5 cent to 7.5 cents a gallon at 1:59 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Valero closed the main production units at the 100,000-
barrel-a-day Three Rivers plant for planned work, Bill Day, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  A compressor associated with a fluid catalytic cracker at
Alonâ€™s Big Spring refinery was restarted after tripping offline,
according to a filing with regulators. The plant can process
70,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
