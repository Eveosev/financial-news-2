Airbus SAS plans to take a 51
percent stake in PFW Aerospace AG of Speyer,  Germany , to ensure
the planemaker has a sufficient supply of precision tubes,
Financial Times Deutschland reported in an article to be
published tomorrow.  PFW faces an “acute liquidity crisis” and Airbus is
talking with  regulatory authorities  about taking over the
company on short notice, the newspaper said, citing a spokesman
at Airbus Operations in Hamburg. PFW will also supply the tubes
for air, fuel and water for Boeing 787s, the newspaper said.  No one was available for comment at PFW when contacted by
Bloomberg after hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
