Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey said he’ll consider
reinvesting capital on more  wealth-management  acquisitions.  “We are looking at acquisitions in wealth management,”
McCaughey said today during an investor conference in Montreal
hosted by CIBC. “While we are always looking at things, we do
not have anything at the late stage of the radar right now.”  Canadian Imperial, the country’s fifth-biggest bank, is
looking to expand its wealth-management business to diversify
earnings as  consumer lending  slows. The Toronto-based bank last
month completed its $848 million purchase of 41 percent of
American Century Investments from JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
