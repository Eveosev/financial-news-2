Peru ’s sol fell to a three-month
low as slowing global growth and concern policy makers aren’t
containing Europe’s debt turmoil sapped demand for emerging-
market assets.  The sol weakened 0.8 percent to 2.7578 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, from 2.7372 yesterday. That’s the currency’s
weakest close since June 24.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its global
growth forecast and predicted “severe” repercussions if policy
makers fail to stem the euro area’s sovereign debt problems.
Officials from the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and
the IMF will return to Athens next week after three days of
consultations failed to produce a solution to Greece’s debt
crisis.  “Non-resident investors see a global recession looming,”
said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.
“They’re betting that local currencies are going to depreciate
as central banks lower rates and aren’t distinguishing between
countries. In Peru’s case the central bank is more likely to
lower  reserve requirements  before it cuts rates, which has less
of an impact on the currency.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose seven basis points to 5.78
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s
price fell 0.49 centimo to 114.11 centimos per sol.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries surged 42 basis points to 278,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the highest since July
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
