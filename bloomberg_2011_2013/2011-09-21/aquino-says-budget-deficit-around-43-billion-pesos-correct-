Philippine President  Benigno Aquino 
said the actual level of the budget deficit was 43 billion
pesos, without saying what period it covered.  The shortfall was 43.713 billion pesos in the first seven
months of 2011 and the data for August hasnâ€™t been released.
Aquino spoke in  New York City . Budget Secretary Butch Abad, who
accompanied Aquino in the trip, said the 48 billion pesos
deficit number Aquino earlier provided was wrong as he referred
to the seven-month shortfall announced on Aug. 25. The August
data will likely be released on Sept. 23, according to the
office of Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
