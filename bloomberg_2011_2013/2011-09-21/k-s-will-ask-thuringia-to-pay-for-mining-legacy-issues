K+S AG,  Europe ’s biggest potash
producer, said it will ask the state of Thuringia to continue
assuming expenses to fortify a retired potash mine in the east
German town of Merkers in order to prevent potential damage to
villages in the region.  K+S currently has about 180 employees filling the former
mine with rock in order to stabilize it after mining practices
in the formerly communist east of Germany left the site in
danger of collapsing, spokesman Michael Wudonig said. His
comments came after Thuringia’s environmental minister Juergen Reinholz yesterday said the state would discontinue paying for
the service by year-end.  Thuringia has paid about 250 million euros ($342 million)
since 1999 to K+S to fill the former potash mine, and it will
take “several more years” of work until the mine is safe,
Wudonig said. While K+S’s contracts bind the company to secure
the mine, it also has a valid contract with the state of
Thuringia to assume the costs associated with it, Wudonig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
