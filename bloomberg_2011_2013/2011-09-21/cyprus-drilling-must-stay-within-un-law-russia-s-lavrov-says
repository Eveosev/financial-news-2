Countries in dispute over oil and
gas exploration offshore Cyprus should comply with a United
Nations convention on the  Law of the Sea , said Russian foreign
minister Sergey Lavrov.  “We hope and encourage all parties involved to refrain
from any steps that could worsen the situation and encourage
everyone to remain within the legal framework of the Law of the
Sea,” Lavrov said after a meeting with Cypriot President
Demetris Christofias in  New York  today according to a  statement 
on the Nicosia based  Press and Information Office .  U.S.-based  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , that has an explortion and
exploitation license for  Block 12  in Cyprus’s offshore
territory, started to drill for hydrocarbons Sept. 18, according
to the director of the Cypriot energy service, Solon Kassinis.
 Turkey , which unlike Cyprus has  neither signed nor ratified  the
UN law, disputes Cyprus’s right to explore for hydrocarbons and
sent warships to the area.  The east Mediterranean island’s  ministry of defense  is
monitoring naval and air force maneuvers, which Turkey started
yesterday about 25 nautical miles south of Cyprus, spokeswoman
Aliki Stylianou said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
