U.S. prosecutors are close to
bringing criminal charges against former  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  executive Rajat Gupta for allegedly leaking information,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with
the situation.  Gupta’s lawyer,  Gary Naftalis , said allegations against him
were “totally baseless,” the newspaper reported.  The Securities and Exchange Commission dropped a civil
administrative proceeding against Gupta but was “fully
committed” to refiling charges in a federal court; the SEC
would now wait for any criminal charges from the  Justice
Department , the WSJ added.  Prosecutors referred to him as a “co-conspirator” during
the case against Galleon Group co-founder  Raj Rajaratnam , who
was found guilty of conspiracy and  insider trading  in May and is
due to be sentenced next week, the Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
