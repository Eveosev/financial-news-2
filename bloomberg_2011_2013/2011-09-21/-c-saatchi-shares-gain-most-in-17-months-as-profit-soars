M&C Saatchi Plc (SAA) , a U.K. marketing
agency formed by brothers Maurice and  Charles Saatchi , gained
the most more than two years in London trading after first-half
profit surged 48 percent on U.K. and European growth.  The shares rose 8 pence, or 6.8 percent, to 125 pence, the
biggest gain since August 2009. That pared this yearâ€™s decline
to 3.1 percent.  Net income increased to 3.85 million pounds ($6 million),
or 6.1 pence a share, from 2.6 million pounds, or 4.1 pence, a
year earlier as revenue rose 23 percent to 71.9 million pounds,
the London-based company said in a statement today. The U.K. and
European businesses performed best.  To contact the reporter on this story:
