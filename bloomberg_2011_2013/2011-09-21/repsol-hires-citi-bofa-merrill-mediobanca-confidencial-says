Repsol YPF SA (REP)  hired  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Mediobanca SpA to advise
Chairman Antonio Brufau in a power struggle with the company’s
biggest shareholder, El Confidencial reported, citing senior
Repsol executives without naming them.  Citigroup in May said it won’t continue in the syndicate
that lent  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  5.2 billion euros to take a 20
percent stake in Spain’s biggest oil company once that loan
comes due in December, the web site said.  Sacyr last month formed a pact with  Petroleos Mexicanos ,
the third biggest shareholder, aimed at focussing Repsol’s
acitivies on the oil industry and installing a chief executive
officer alongside Brufau.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
