Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK) , the
bankrupt holding company for a failed insurer, may file a new
reorganization plan as soon as tonight or move to liquidate,
depending on a Wisconsin regulator’s decision, a lawyer for the
company said.  Wisconsin’s Office of the Commissioner of Insurance will
decide at a meeting today whether to accept the holding
company’s proposed treatment of its operating unit, Ambac
Assurance Corp., under a reorganization plan filed in July,
lawyer Peter Ivanick said in Manhattan court today. Ambac
submitted the plan without an agreement from OCI, which
regulates the operating unit.  “Our discussions with OCI have been very frustrating --
they’ve been emotional and quite often angry,” Ivanick told
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman. If OCI rejects the
proposed plan, Ambac will discuss with creditors whether to sue
the agency or convert its Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter
7 liquidation, Ivanick said.  Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before
the 2008 financial crisis, when mounting defaults on mortgages
swamped the company with claims. It guaranteed about $256
billion of $1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to
Bloomberg data.  Ambac Financial, based in  New York , listed liabilities of
$1.68 billion in its petition.  The holding company case is In re  Ambac Financial Group
Inc. (ABKFQ) , 10-15973,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
