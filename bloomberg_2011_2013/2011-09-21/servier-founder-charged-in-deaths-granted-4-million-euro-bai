Jacques Servier, chairman of
 France ’s second-largest drugmaker, must post bail of 4 million
euros ($5.51 million) and his freedom may be restricted as he
faces charges that he helped hide the risks of a drug suspected
of causing the deaths of as many as 2,000 people.  Servier and five affiliated companies of  Laboratoires
Servier , which he founded, were charged today by French
magistrates, the company said in a statement. Servier must
provide a financial guarantee of 6 million euros by Dec. 15,
according to the release.  Servier, 89, was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
aggravated deception and fraud, the newspaper Le Monde reported,
citing his lawyer. The company remains innocent until proven
guilty and will “finally be able to defend itself in a judicial
setting,” it said in the statement.  Mediator, the diabetes drug at the root of the case, was
sold in France for 33 years until it was withdrawn in November
2009 on safety concerns. It was widely used as an appetite
suppressant.  The largest French drugmaker is Sanofi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
