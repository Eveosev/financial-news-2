European Union wheat production
will fall 2.9 percent from a year ago on declining yields in
 France , the bloc’s biggest producer of the grain, according to a
report from the Monitoring Agricultural Resources Unit.  Wheat output in the 27-nation bloc will total 135.4 million
metric tons, MARS said. French soft-wheat yields are expected to
fall 6.6 percent from last year to 6.57 tons a hectare (2.5
acres), according to the report released today. EU barley output
will fall 2.8 percent to 51.9 million tons in 2011 as French
winter yields will drop 10 percent and spring yields decline 8.7
percent, the bloc said.  “Toward the end of July until the beginning of August
rainfall occurred predominantly in central  Europe ,” MARS said,
adding rain was plentiful around the  North Sea  and  Baltic Sea 
for August. “Access to fields for harvesting was hampered and
held up by spells of abundant precipitation.”  Milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris has risen 6.2
percent since July 1, even after Russia started shipping the
grain following a nearly yearlong export ban.  German wheat yields are expected to total 7.26 tons a
hectare, little changed from the prior year, while barley yields
may fall 4.9 percent for winter crops and 4.5 percent for the
spring grains, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
