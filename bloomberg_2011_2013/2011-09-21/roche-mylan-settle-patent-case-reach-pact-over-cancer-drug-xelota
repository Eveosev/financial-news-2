(Corrects spelling of drug in first paragraph in story
published Sept. 21.)  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the Swiss
drugmaker, settled patent litigation with generic drugmaker
Mylan Inc. and reached a license agreement over the cancer
medicine Xeloda, Mylan said today in a statement.  The confidential settlement, filed in federal court in
Newark, New Jersey, resolves a 2009 lawsuit in which Roche
claimed Mylan sought to market a generic version of Xeloda
before its patent expired. The drug, which had U.S. sales of
$570 million in the 12 months ending June 30, is used to treat
metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.  The agreement is subject to review by the U.S. Justice
Department and the Federal Trade Commission, according to Mylan,
based in Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania .  The case is Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. v. Mylan Inc., 09-cv-1692,
U.S. District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
