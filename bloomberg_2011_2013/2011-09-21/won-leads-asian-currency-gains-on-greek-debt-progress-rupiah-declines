South Korea ’s won led gains in
Asian currencies as optimism grows that Greece will meet
requirements for further aid, reducing demand for the relative
safety of the dollar.  Greece made “good progress” in a second round of talks
with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to
stave off default, the EU said in a statement. Indonesia’s
rupiah and Taiwan’s dollar fell on speculation foreign funds are
reducing their holdings of emerging-market assets after the IMF
cut its global growth forecast.  The won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,146.71 per dollar as
of 11:59 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
China’s yuan climbed 0.09 percent to 6.3786. The rupiah dropped
0.3 percent to 8,933 and  Taiwan ’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to
NT$29.907.  “European debt woes eased a little, calming down
markets,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Still, investors will remain cautious.”  The won snapped a two-day decline of more than 3 percent
after a government report showed Korea’s unemployment rate fell
to 3.1 percent in August, the lowest level since July 2008 and
less than the 3.3 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of economists. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at a
government meeting today that the data reflects “strong”
economic fundamentals and is a “big surprise.”  The yuan advanced to the strongest level in three weeks on
signs policy makers will tolerate currency gains to fight
inflation in the world’s second-largest economy.  Chinese Inflation  The People’s Bank of  China  set the  reference rate  0.17
percent stronger at 6.3772 per dollar, the highest since a
dollar peg ended in 2005. Consumer prices in the nation climbed
6.2 percent in August from a year earlier after having increased
6.5 percent in July.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength, fell
on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will increase holdings of
longer-maturity bonds.  “Investors expect the dollar will keep weakening on
further stimulus measures,” said Kenix Lai, a senior market
analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “The yuan will
continue with its appreciation trend on China’s inflation fight,
despite the slowdown in the global economy.”  The rupiah declined to near a seven-month low as the
prospect of Europe’s debt crisis slowing world economic growth
reduced demand for emerging-market assets.  IMF Forecast  The global economy will expand 4 percent this year and next,
the  International Monetary Fund  said in its World Economic
Outlook report, compared with June forecasts of 4.3 percent for
2011 and 4.5 percent for 2012. The  U.S. economy  will expand 1.5
percent in 2011 instead of 2.5 percent, it said.  The rupiah has weakened 4.5 percent in September as
overseas holdings of the country’s government bonds fell 5.3
percent to 234.18 trillion rupiah ($26.2 billion) as of Sept. 19,
debt management office data show. Foreign funds sold $440
million more Indonesian shares than they bought this month
through yesterday, according to exchange data.  “On the domestic front investors have been selling
equities and bonds,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at
PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “ Europe ’s debt crisis
continues to drive  market sentiment  and it has hit all major
currencies in the region.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht, the Philippine peso and
Malaysia’s ringgit were little changed at 30.43, 43.463 and
3.1124, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
