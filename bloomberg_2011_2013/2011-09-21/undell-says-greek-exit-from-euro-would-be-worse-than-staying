Greece’s exit from the euro area
would be worse than staying in it, said  Robert Mundell , a Nobel-
prize winning economist and professor of economics at  Columbia
University  in New York. He spoke today at a conference in
Belgrade organized by the Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)   On Greek situation:  “Greece is never going to repay its debts.”  “Greece can go” from the currency union “but the euro
will not collapse.”  The euro-area crisis of “over-indebtedness” requires a
“division between countries that are insolvent and those that
are illiquid.” The European Union should take steps “toward
deeper fiscal integration.”  On pegging the dollar and the euro:  “The solution” to the global crisis “is to fix the
dollar-euro exchange rate and add the Chinese yuan to the fix.
This would fix the exchange rate of 50 percent of GDP. This kind
of an idea of stabilizing the dollar and the euro can stabilize
the world economy.  ‘‘If you want to stabilize the  exchange rate , you also have
to coordinate monetary policy and you have to bring in China to
it. I think China will be willing to do it. The problem is
getting Americans and Europeans together.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
