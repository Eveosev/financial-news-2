Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (GILT) 
advanced to the highest level in more than two weeks after the
developer of satellite-networking technology said its Spacenet
Inc. unit had a network-services contract extended until 2018.  The shares rose 1.7 percent to 12.95 shekels, the highest
level since Sept. 6, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Spacenet will continue to provide VSAT network services to
a major retailer with thousands of locations in the U.S., Gilat
said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange today. The
five-year extension brings the value of the contract to $27
million with a potential to increase to $35 million, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
