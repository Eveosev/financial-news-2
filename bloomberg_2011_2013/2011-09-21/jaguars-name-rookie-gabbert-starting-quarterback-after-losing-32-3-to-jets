The  Jacksonville Jaguars  named
rookie Blaine Gabbert their starting quarterback for this
weekend’s game against the Carolina Panthers, team spokesman
Ryan Robinson said in an e-mail.  Gabbert, the 10th overall draft pick from the University of
Missouri, replaces Luke McCown, who threw four interceptions in
Jacksonville’s 32-3 loss to the  New York Jets  on Sept. 18. The
Jaguars cut David Garrard, who started 68 games for them in the
past five seasons, the week before their first game of the year.  Gabbert will face rookie Cam Newton, the former Auburn
University quarterback who was taken first in the draft, in this
weekend’s game against the Panthers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
