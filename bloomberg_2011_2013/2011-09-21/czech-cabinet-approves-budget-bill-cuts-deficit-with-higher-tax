The Czech government approved a
2012 draft budget that narrows the deficit aided by higher
revenue from a value-added-tax increase.  The draft, which now goes to parliament, is part of Premier
Petr Necas’s plan to trim the fiscal gap and curb debt growth
after assembling the largest parliamentary majority since
independence in 1993. The pledge to cut the shortfall to less
than the European Union limit of 3 percent of economic output
has helped Czech bonds outperform German debt in the past year.  The bill sets the deficit limit at 105 billion koruna ($5.8
billion), compared with a gap of 135 billion koruna planned for
this year, Necas told reporters in  Prague  today.  ‘The government is fulfilling its goal of gradually
reducing the deficit in public finances,” Necas said.  The government plans to narrow the broader public-finance
shortfall, the fiscal yardstick for assessing an EU member’s
readiness to adopt the euro, to 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012 from 4.2 percent in 2011. The Cabinet expects to
narrow the gap to 2.9 percent in 2013.  The yield on the Czech state bond maturing in 2016 fell 57
basis points, or 0.57 percentage point, in the past year,
compared with a 52 basis-point decline in the yield on the
German security of similar maturity, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Spending Cuts  The lower house of parliament on Sept. 2 approved a plan to
lift the lower VAT rate on goods and services including food,
drugs and public transportation to 14 percent next year from 10
percent, while keeping the upper bracket at 20 percent. Both
rates will be unified at 17.5 percent in 2013, according to the
legislation.  The  Finance Ministry , which prepared the draft budget, said
the VAT change alone will boost  tax revenue  by 21.3 billion
koruna next year.  Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said on Aug. 21
that the ministry will probably cut its 2.5 percent forecast for
2012 economic growth because of the slowdown in the euro area
and prepare spending cuts to meet the government’s deficit goal.  The  International Monetary Fund  yesterday lowered its 2011
Czech economic growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
