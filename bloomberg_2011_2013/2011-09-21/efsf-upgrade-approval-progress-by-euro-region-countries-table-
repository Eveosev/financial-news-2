Following is a table detailing each
euro nation’s progress in approving expanded powers for the
region’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.  Austria  today became the 14th country to authorize the
expanded powers for the fund, joining  Belgium , Cyprus,  Estonia ,
 Finland ,  France ,  Germany ,  Greece , Ireland,  Italy , Luxembourg,
 Portugal , Slovenia and  Spain . The countries yet to ratify the
changes are Malta and the Netherlands, which are due to vote
next week, and Slovakia, which is expected to vote by Oct. 17.  The enhanced powers of the 440 billion-euro ($595 billion)
EFSF, which were approved at a July 21 meeting of European
leaders in Brussels, take effect when all euro-area countries
have ratified them. The measures would allow the rescue fund to
buy the debt of stressed euro-area nations, aid troubled banks
in the region and offer credit lines to governments. The EFSF’s
current role is to sell bonds to finance rescue loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
