Aker BioMarine ASA (AKBM)  entered into an
agreement with Innovasjon Norge regarding the purchase of the
loans Innovasjon Norge provided to Krillsea Group AS with
related securities.   Aker BioMarine previously made an offer to buy Thorshoevdi,
which was rejected by bondholders. By buying the loan, the
company “will more actively contribute to an expedited sales
process of Thorshoevdi and has secured a favourable financing
from Innovasjon Norge in the event the company ends up with the
vessel,” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
