Banks should be allowed to fail in
a systemic manner, Bank of Nova Scotia Chief Executive Officer
Richard Waugh said.  Current problems at UBS AG, where unauthorized trading
caused a $2.3 billion loss, “couldn’t have come at a worse
time” for financial reform, Waug said today at the SWIFT
International Banking Operations Seminar in Toronto. Scotiabank
is  Canada ’s third-largest bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
