U.S. stocks extended losses, and
Treasuries rallied, after the  Federal Reserve  announced plans to
buy $400 billion of long-term debt and said there are
“significant downside risks” to the economic outlook.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.7 percent to
1,193.34 at 2:25 p.m. in  New York . The 10-year Treasury note
yield dropped as much as seven basis points to a record low of
1.867 percent, while two-year yields climbed four basis points
to 0.21 percent. The Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent.  Fed policy makers will replace some bonds in their
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to further
reduce borrowing costs and keep the economy from relapsing into
a recession, confirming market speculation that the central bank
was planning an "Operation Twist" similar to one of the central
bank’s program in the 1960s.  The central bank will buy $400 billion of bonds with
maturities of six to 30 years through June while selling an
equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less, the
Federal Open Market Committee said today in  Washington  after a
two-day meeting. The action is intended to “put downward
pressure on longer-term  interest rates  and help make broader
financial conditions more accommodative,” the FOMC said in a
statement.  The  S&P 500  rebounded 7.4 percent through yesterday after
sinking to an 11-month low on Aug. 8. The index had tumbled as
much as 18 percent from a three-year high at the end of April
amid concern the economic recovery was weakening and speculation
 Europe ’s worsening debt crisis would further threaten growth.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an Aug. 26 speech that
the central bank still has tools to stimulate the economy
without signaling he will use them. He echoed comments of
dissenting members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  who said
then that U.S. economic data aren’t pointing to a recession.  Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which
measures whether data exceed or trail economist forecasts,
reached -117.2 on June 3, the lowest level since January 2009.
The index has climbed back to -41 since.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
