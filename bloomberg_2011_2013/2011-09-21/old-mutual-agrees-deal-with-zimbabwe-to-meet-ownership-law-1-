Old Mutual Plc (OML)  said it reached an
agreement with  Zimbabwe ’s government about how the insurer will
comply with a law to sell a majority stake in its local
operations to black Zimbabweans.  “We have reached a deal and we feel this is a sensible
one,” Ralph Mupita, Old Mutual’s Chief Executive of Life and
Savings, said in an interview in Harare, the capital, today.
“It’s a broad-based proposal we have put forward and this is
something we are happy with.”  The southern African nation’s government have asked foreign
companies to submit plans on how they will meet a law to sell 51
percent of local assets to black citizens. The law is focused on
mining and financial services companies in a country with the
world’s second-biggest reserves of platinum and chrome.  Old Mutual’s Zimbabwe unit will cede 25 percent of its
assets through grants and shares to pensioners, staff, partner
companies and a youth fund, Empowerment and Indigenization
Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  told reporters in Harare.  The company will also support a state agriculture fund and
help fund housing projects, while agreeing to invest $20 million
in its local operations, Kasukuwere said. The agreement will be
reviewed in November, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
