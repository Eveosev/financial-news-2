Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will maintain exports of Urals crude from its Baltic
Sea port of Primorsk from Oct. 1 to Oct. 11 at 23 cargoes,
according to a preliminary loading schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Shipments from Primorsk will total 2.3 million metric tons,
or 16.9 million barrels, in the first 11 days of the month, the
plan showed.  Crude exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  from Oct.
1 to Oct. 8 will be little changed at eight cargoes, including
three 140,000-ton shipments and five 80,000-ton lots, according
to the plan.  The shipping plan for all of October will be released later
this month. Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
