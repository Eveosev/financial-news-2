India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in more than two years on speculation foreign funds will
slow purchases of emerging-market assets after the  International
Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global economic growth.  The currency declined for the third day and Indian shares
fell as the IMF lowered the expansion estimate for this year to
4 percent from 4.3 percent, predicting a “severe” fallout if
 Europe  fails to contain its debt crisis. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the currency’s performance against six major trading
partners, gained before the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes a
two-day meeting.  “The rupee is a flow-based currency and will move as
such,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based currency trader
at Development Credit Bank Ltd. “Investors are awaiting the
outcome of the Fed meeting to gauge the extent of stimulus that
could be provided.”  The rupee weakened 0.6 percent to 48.3375 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
the lowest level since Sept. 16, 2009.  The Fed may say today it will replace short-term Treasuries
in its $1.65 trillion portfolio with long-term bonds, a move
that 61 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg said will
probably fail to lower the U.S.’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.04
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 48.70
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
