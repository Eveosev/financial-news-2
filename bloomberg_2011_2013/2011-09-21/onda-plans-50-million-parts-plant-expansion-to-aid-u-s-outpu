Honda Motor Co. is spending $50
million to expand a transmission factory in Ohio as  Japan ’s
third-largest carmaker upgrades U.S. assembly operations and
works to restore full production slowed by an earthquake.  The investment in the Russells Point, Ohio, factory
includes construction of a 75,000-square-foot addition to the
plant for a new die-casting operation, the company said in a
statement. The investment comes after Honda this year said it
planned $355 million of upgrades at plants in Ohio.  Honda is refurbishing factories as it resumes full North
American production this month after parts shortages triggered
by Japan’s March earthquake left Honda and Acura dealers short
of models. The Tokyo-based company’s U.S. sales fell 5.5 percent
this year through August, and market share shrank to 9.1 percent
from 10.6 percent as industrywide deliveries rose 10.5 percent.  Honda’s U.S. operations are based in Torrance,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
