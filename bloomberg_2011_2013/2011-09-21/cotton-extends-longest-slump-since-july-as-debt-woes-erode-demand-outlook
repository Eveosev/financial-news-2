Cotton futures fell for the fifth
straight session, heading for the longest slump since July, on
signs that slowing economic growth will curb demand for supplies
from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  The debt crisis in  Europe  and political squabbling over how
to prevent contagion are raising concern that the risk of
defaults by governments is increasing, the  International
Monetary Fund  said today. The MSCI World Index of equities fell
as much as 1 percent. Before today, cotton futures plunged 52
percent from a record in March.  “A lot of people are worried about demand destruction” as
the economic crisis worsens in Europe, Fain Shaffer, the
president of Infinity Trading Corp., in Medford,  Oregon , said in
a telephone interview. “There won’t be as much need for as much
cotton.”  Cotton for December delivery slumped 1.71 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $1.037 a pound at 11:16 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . A close at that level would cap the longest losing
streak since July 6. Before today, the price was down 27 percent
this year. Prices reached a record $2.197 on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
