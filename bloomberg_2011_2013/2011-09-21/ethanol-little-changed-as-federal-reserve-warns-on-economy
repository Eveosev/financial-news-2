Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  after the  Federal Reserve  warned of a slowing
economy.  Futures were steady as gasoline and stock markets declined
after the Fed said it would buy $400 billion of long-term debt
to keep the U.S. from falling back into recession, and said
there are “significant downside risks” to the economy.  “Ethanol held up relatively well despite the big sell-off,
mostly propped by corn’s relative resilience,” Justin Dirico,
senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates in Chicago wrote in a
report to clients today.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.649 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 26 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.825 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel
rose 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.865, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago lost 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.69
a gallon and in  New York  the additive lost 0.5 cent to $2.80.  Corn for December delivery slipped 4.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.8575 a gallon in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 3.49 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $2.6665 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
12 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
Illinois is banking 15 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
