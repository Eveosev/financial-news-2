Italy  lowered its forecasts for
economic growth, saying the weaker pace of expansion won’t
threaten the government’s goal of balancing the budget in 2013.  The  Finance Ministry  sees the euro-region’s third-biggest
economy growing 0.7 percent this year instead of the 1.1 percent
forecast in April and 0.6 percent in 2012 rather than 1.3
percent, according to a  document  posted on its website. The
International Monetary Fund on Sept. 20 forecast growth of 0.6
percent for Italy in 2011, slowing to 0.3 percent next year.  Parliament gave final approval to a 54 billion-euro ($72
billion) austerity package this month that aimed to erase the
deficit in 2013, based on Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti ’s
original forecasts. The plan helped convince the  European
Central Bank  to buy Italian bonds after concerns the nation
would fall victim to the region’s debt crisis sent its borrowing
costs to euro-era highs.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond fell one basis point
today to 5.747 percent as of 2:30 p.m. in  Rome . The premium over
German bunds widened nine basis points to 407 basis points as
yields on German debt fell to record lows.  While the austerity plan was “necessary” to offset rising
borrowing costs, it can also “produce negative effects on the
economic activity in the short term,” the ministry said in the
report. Still, the package does include measures to boost growth
that may be beneficial to the economy, the ministry said.  Deficit Targets  The government predicted a budget deficit of 3.9 percent of
gross domestic product this year, 1.6 percent next year and 0.1
percent in 2013. Debt is forecast to peak at 120.6 percent of
GDP this year, before falling to 119.5 percent in 2012 and 116.4
percent in 2013.  The  International Monetary Fund  said this week that the
government will miss its balanced budget goal. The IMF projected
the deficit to fall to 4 percent of GDP this year and 2.4
percent next, before reaching 1.1 percent in 2013, the
Washington-based lender said in a report.  The government also forecast household spending to slow,
saying that “in the medium term, the dynamic of the labor
market could represent a risk factor” for consumer demand.  The government will have to find additional savings between
9 billion and 10 billion euros “to increase the chances of
reaching a budget that is close to balanced by 2013,” Fabio Fois, European economist at  Barclays Capital  in  London , wrote in
a note before the new forecasts were unveiled. “We think that
further fiscal measures are likely to be announced over the next
couple of weeks.”  The government will save 20 billion euros by 2014 by ending
tax breaks. It will also push ahead with plans to liberalize the
economy, sell state assets and take steps to boost growth in
southern Italy, the ministry said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
