China ’s yuan advanced for a second
day on signs policy makers will tolerate currency gains to fight
inflation in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.17
percent stronger at 6.3772 per dollar, the highest since 2005.
Consumer prices in the nation climbed 6.2 percent in August from
a year earlier after having increased 6.5 percent in July,
contributing to the yuan’s 1.3 percent appreciation this
quarter. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength,
fell on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will increase holdings
of longer-maturity bonds.  “Investors expect the dollar will keep weakening on
further stimulus measures,” said Kenix Lai, a senior market
analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “The yuan will
continue with its appreciation trend on China’s inflation fight,
despite the slowdown in the global economy.”  The yuan strengthened 0.03 percent to close at 6.3823 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency touched 6.3771 earlier, the strongest level since
Aug. 31. The yuan is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on
either side of the daily reference rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan traded at 6.3855
per dollar, from yesterday’s 6.3870. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards gained 0.02 percent to 6.3410, a 0.7
percent premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut this year’s global
growth forecast to 4 percent yesterday from a 4.3 percent
prediction made in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
