Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) ,  Finland ’s only oil
refiner, said its renewable fuels unit’s fourth-quarter sales
volumes will increase from the third-quarter level and the
unit’s comparable operating profit will improve even as the unit
remains loss-making.  The production costs of its NExBTL renewable diesel will be
$220 per tonne due to higher utility costs, compared with a
previous estimate of $175 per tonne, Neste Oil said.  Neste Oil shares rose as much as 2 percent to 7.29 euros in
Helsinki and were up 1.1 percent at 11:07 a.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
