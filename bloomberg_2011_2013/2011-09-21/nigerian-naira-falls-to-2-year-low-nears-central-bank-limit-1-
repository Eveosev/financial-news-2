Nigeria ’s naira weakened to its
lowest level in about two years on mounting demand for dollars.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest oil producer
weakened 0.4 percent to 157.81 naira in interbank trading at
5:05 p.m. in Lagos, its lowest since an Aug. 18, 2009, sale,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria’s central bank
sold $350 million at a foreign currency auction today, compared
with $506.5 million demanded by lenders, with the currency
declining 0.3 percent to 154.42 naira per dollar.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions to help
check inflation. The  exchange rate  at today’s auction, the 21st
at which demand wasn’t met, was 2.9 percent above 150 naira per
dollar.  Nigeria’s “persistent dollar demand” is fueled by a
combination of  government spending  and the country’s dependence
on imports,  Bismarck Rewane , analyst and chief executive of
Lagos-based Financial Derivatives Co., said by phone today.  Nigeria’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate 
on Sept. 19 for the fifth time this year by 50 basis points to
9.25 percent to rein in inflation and support the naira.
Foreign-currency demand may drop in the coming weeks because of
“high borrowing costs” as the interest rate increase takes
effect, Rewane said.  Inflation rate in the West African nation fell for a second
month to 9.3 percent in August, the lowest level in more than
three years, from 9.4 percent a month earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
