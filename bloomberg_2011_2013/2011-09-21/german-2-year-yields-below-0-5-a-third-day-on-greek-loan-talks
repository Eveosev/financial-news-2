Greek  government bonds  fell for a
third day as the European Union said officials will return to
 Athens  next week after three days of telephone consultations
failed to produce a solution to the country’s debt crisis.  Yields on German two-year notes, perceived to be among
 Europe ’s safest securities, dropped toward a record low as
 Greece ’s biggest private and public sector union groups called
strikes against austerity measures. Ten-year bunds were little
changed after Germany sold the securities at an average yield
below 2 percent for the first time. Portuguese notes fell as
borrowing costs increased at a bill sale.  “There’s no incentive at the moment to jump back into
riskier assets” and sell German securities, said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
 London . “The threat over the next couple of months is going to
be for continued risk off, and core paper will have its buyers
into any weakness.”  The Greek two-year yield climbed 233 basis points to 66.51
percent at 4:30 p.m. in London. The 4 percent security due
August 2013 fell 0.960, or 9.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,370)
face amount, to 41.620. The 10-year yield rose 31 basis points
to 23.55 percent.  German two-year rates dropped two basis points to 0.44
percent, approaching the record low 0.359 percent set Sept. 12.
The 10-year yield fell two basis points to 1.77 percent.  Cabinet Meeting  Prime Minister  George Papandreou  convened a cabinet meeting
today to discuss the content of the talks with the EU,  European
Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund . The EU said in a
statement that the consultations with Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos had made “good progress.”  The 24-hour strikes by Greece’s biggest private- and
public-sector union groups are scheduled for Oct. 5 and Oct. 19,
Athens-based ADEDY’s Chairman Costas Tsikrikas said. ADEDY is
also holding a three-hour walkout tomorrow to support state-
school teachers.  Europe’s debt crisis has generated as much as 300 billion
euros in credit risk for European banks, the International
Monetary Fund said. Political squabbling and delays in
implementing agreed measures are raising concerns about the risk
of defaults by governments, the IMF said in its Global Financial
Stability Report released today.  “Investors are trying to understand what’s going to happen
next, which is also likely keeping trading volumes subdued,”
said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at
UniCredit Global Research in Milan. “There’s still a lot of
uncertainty around and nobody really knows how this situation
will develop. There’s a lot of nervousness around.”  Debt Auctions  Germany  sold 4.2 billion euros of 2.25 percent bonds due in
2021, attracting bids for 1.51 times the amount on offer, up
from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.4 times on Aug. 24. The
securities were priced to yield an average 1.8 percent, down
from 2.15 percent last month.  Portugal ’s two-year yield advanced 15 basis points to 17.48
percent after the nation sold 250 million euros of six-month
bills.  The government issued the debt at an average yield of 5.249
percent, up from 4.989 percent at a previous auction on Aug. 17.
The sale attracted bids for 4.5 times the amount offered, the
debt management agency said, compared with a ratio of 7.2 times
last month.  Italian notes dropped for a third day after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the country’s credit rating yesterday for the first
time in five years. Two-year yields increased three basis points
to 4.32 percent.  Italian Sale  Italy’s debt agency today sold 4.5 percent notes due March
2019 in an exchange for securities maturing in 2012 and 2017.  Norwegian 10-year bonds declined, pushing the yield up by
seven basis points to 2.39 percent, after the  central bank  kept
benchmark  interest rates  unchanged for a third consecutive
meeting. Volatility on the securities was 1.5 times more than
the 90-day average, the most among 22 developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg.  Bunds have returned 2.8 percent this month, extending this
year’s gain to 8.1 percent, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. Greek bonds have fallen 40 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
