Stanford University ’s Graduate
School of Business topped a list of socially responsible
business schools ranked by their course material and research on
on ethics and environmental topics.  Stanford, near Palo Alto, California, was followed by the
business schools of York University in Toronto, and IE Business
School in Madrid, in the biennial  Beyond Grey Pinstripes  ranking
released today by the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit group with
offices in  New York , Washington and Aspen, Colorado.  Aspen’s Business and Society Program promotes management
education that focuses on the broader impact of corporations on
the world at large rather than just on profits. The institute
helped organize the MBA Oath, taken by graduates who pledge to
follow honest and responsible business practices. The institute
reviewed 149 MBA programs, many of which have retooled their
curricula following the 2008 global financial meltdown.  “In the wake of the financial crisis we’re seeing an
increased willingness to address these issues,”  Judith
Samuelson , director of Aspen’s program, said in a statement.
“There are more courses than ever before with content on social,
ethical, and environmental issues.”  The Mendoza College of Business at the  University of Notre
Dame , in South Bend,  Indiana , was ranked fourth, followed by the
Yale School of Management, in  New Haven , Connecticut.  Rounding out the top 10 were  Kellogg School of Management 
at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois; University of
Michigan’s Ross School of Business, in Ann Arbor; Cornell
University’s  Johnson Graduate School of Management , in Ithaca,
New York; University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business
School, in Chapel Hill; and the  Haas School of Business  at the
University of California at Berkeley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
