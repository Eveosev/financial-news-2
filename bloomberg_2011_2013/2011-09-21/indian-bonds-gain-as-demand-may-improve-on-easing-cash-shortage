India ’s 10-year bonds rose on
speculation demand for the notes will improve as a cash shortage
in the financial system eases.  Average daily borrowings by lenders from the central bank
for meeting fund shortfalls decreased to 401 billion rupees
($8.3 billion) this quarter, the least in a year,  Reserve Bank 
of India data show. Three-month interest-rate swaps, derivatives
used to guard against fluctuations in money-market rates,
declined eight basis points this week to 8.43 percent.  “The cash situation is improving and making investments in
bonds attractive,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as of the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate has dropped three basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
