Russia will have no budget deficit
this year and will see a shortfall equivalent to 0.7 percent of
gross domestic product in 2014, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
said at a government meeting in Moscow today.  Revenue from outside the oil and gas industry will rise to
57 percent of the total in 2014 from 53 percent now, he said.  The government will keep expenditures capped at 20 percent
to 21 percent of GDP from 2012 to 2014, he said. Next yearâ€™s
budget is based on an average oil price of $100 a barrel, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
