Elevance Renewable Sciences Inc., a
biotechnology company part owned by Cargill Inc., is seeking to
raise as much as $100 million in an initial public offering.  Elevance, a producer of chemicals used in lubricants, waxes
and detergents from oils including palm, soy and rapeseed, will
trade on Nasdaq, the Bolingbrook, Illinois-based company said in
a filing, without giving the number of shares offered or price.  The company, which bought a Mississippi factory in June and
is building an Indonesian refinery, posted a first-half net loss
of $113.5 million, from a loss of $13.4 million a year before.
While revenue rose to $8.6 million from $8.2 million, the loss
widened after the company booked a $101.8 million charge because
of changes in the value of warrants to buy preferred stock.  Morgan Stanley is helping to manage the offering, while
Elevance will trade on Nasdaq with the stock symbol ERSI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
