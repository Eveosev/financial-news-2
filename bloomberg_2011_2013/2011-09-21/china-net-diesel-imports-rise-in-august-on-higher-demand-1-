China ’s net imports of diesel rose
last month as the country responded to higher demand from
fishermen and farmers amid refinery closures.  Net imports of the fuel were 40,000 metric tons after
overseas purchase rose 56 percent to 250,000 tons from a month
earlier, while exports gained 17 percent to 210,000 tons, the
General Administration of Customs reported today.  “Demand for the fuel has been boosted in autumn, when
fishermen and farmers harvest, and we see a bit tightness in
supply right now on the market,” Li Yujing, an analyst with
China International Chemical Consulting Corp., said by telephone
today from Beijing.  China was a net exporter of diesel in the first eight
months after overseas purchases jumped 44 percent to 1.44
million tons and exports fell 57 percent to 1.51 million tons.  China’s diesel inventory fell 1.7 percent from July, the
third monthly decline, to 9.4 million tons as of August,
according to Bloomberg calculation based on data released by the
official Xinhua News Agency. That’s the lowest since January.  China’s daily oil processing volume declined 2 percent to
8.7 million barrels last month from 8.9 million barrels in July.
Oil refining has dropped from a record 9.2 million barrels a day
in February and has stayed at less than 9 million barrels a day
since June as refineries shut units for maintenance.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors:  Mike Anderson ,  John Buckley .  To contact the reporter on this story:
