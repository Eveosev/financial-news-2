Bangchak Petroleum Pcl (BCP) , a Thai
state-controlled refiner, plans to spend 25 billion baht ($822
million) between now and 2015 to expand solar power plants and
improve the efficiency of its refineries, President Anusorn
Sangnimnaun said.  The company also plans to build gas stations in Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar, Anusorn said. Bangchakâ€™s profit in the second
half of this year will be lower than the 4.4 billion baht in the
first half because of volatile  oil prices , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
