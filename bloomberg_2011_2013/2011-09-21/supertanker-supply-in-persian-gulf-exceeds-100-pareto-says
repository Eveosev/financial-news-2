The number of supertankers seeking
to load crude oil from ports and terminals in the  Persian Gulf 
over the next 30 days expanded by 5.1 percent, Pareto Securities
ASA said.  Total supertankers in the region rose to 103 from 98 on
Sept. 16 amid “limited spot activity,” Pareto analysts
including Martin Korsvold said in an e-mail sent today.  Daily losses for VLCCs, each able to haul 2 million barrels
of crude, on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage narrowed
to $2,855 yesterday from the 2011 low of minus $4,175 on Sept.
19, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. The bourse’s
earnings estimates don’t reflect speed alterations that can cut
fuel consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
