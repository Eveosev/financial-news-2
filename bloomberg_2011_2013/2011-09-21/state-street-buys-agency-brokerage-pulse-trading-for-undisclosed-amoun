State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
largest custody bank, agreed to acquire Boston-based Pulse
Trading Inc., a full-service agency brokerage. No terms were
disclosed.  The deal includes Pulse Trading’s institutional equities
business and about 40 employees, the company said today in a
Business Wire statement. The deal is expected to close in the
fourth quarter, Boston-based State Street said.  Agency brokers execute customer orders and often provide
related services. They don’t earn money from proprietary trading
or committing capital to facilitate client trading requests.  State Street had $22.8 trillion under custody and
administration, and managed $2.1 trillion in client investments
as of June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
