Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell after the Federal Open Market Committee pledged to
buy $400 billion of long-term debt and cited risks to the
economic outlook, damping the earnings prospects for Asian
exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker that gets 28 percent of its sale in the
U.S. and Canada, slid 2.1 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
largest lender by market value, fell 3.9 percent after Moody’s
Investors Service cut its ratings on three major U.S. banks.
ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas
producer, dropped 1.3 percent after crude prices fell.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 8,530 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,680
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,580 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index declined 2.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
lost 0.6 percent in Wellington.  “There was no surprise about the FOMC’s monetary policy,
and it highlighted how severe the  U.S. economy  is,” said
Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “The FOMC didn’t go beyond
buying longer-term debt. Stocks may come under sell pressure
again.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In New York, the index slid 2.9 percent yesterday, the
biggest drop since Aug. 18.  ‘Operation Twist’  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday it will purchase longer-
term debt and sell shorter maturities to sustain the economic
recovery, confirming market speculation that the central bank
was planning an “Operation Twist” similar to one of the
central bank’s programs in the 1960s.  Banks fell after Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.
had their long-term credit ratings downgraded by Moody’s, which
cited a decreasing probability that the U.S. would support the
lenders in an emergency. Citigroup Inc.’s short-term credit
rating was cut.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 14 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.2 percent drop by the S&P
500 and an 18 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.7 times for the S&P 500
and 9.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 1.2 percent to settle
at $85.92 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.  The yen reached 103.67 per euro today, the strongest level
since June 2001, before trading at 104.07. A stronger yen hurts
Japanese exporters because it cuts the value of their overseas
income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
