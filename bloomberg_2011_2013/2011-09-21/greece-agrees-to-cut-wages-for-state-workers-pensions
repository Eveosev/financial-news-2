Greece â€™s government will cut wages
of state workers and pensioners as it accelerates deficit
cutting attempts to qualify for a sixth loan from international
creditors.  Pensions of more than 1,200 euros a month will be subject
to a 20 percent cut, while pensions paid to those aged less than
55 will be cut by 40 percent for the amount exceeding 1,000
euros, according to a government statement handed to reporters
in  Athens  today. The government will also put 30,000 state
employees in a labor reserve system at reduced wages to cut
spending this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
