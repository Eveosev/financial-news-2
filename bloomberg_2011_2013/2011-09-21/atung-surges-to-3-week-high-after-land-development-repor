Tatung Co. surged to the highest in
three weeks in Taipei trading after the China Times cited
analysts as saying the companyâ€™s land development project in
Taipei may be worth more than NT$10 billion.  The stock gained 4.2 percent to NT$12.50 as of 9:49 a.m.
local time, set for the highest close since Sept. 2. The
estimate for the value of the project is speculation by the
media, the company said in a statement to the Taiwan stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
