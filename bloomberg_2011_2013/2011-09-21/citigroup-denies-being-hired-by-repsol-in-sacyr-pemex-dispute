Citigroup Inc., the third-largest
U.S. lender, denied being hired by  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  to advise the
company’s chairman, Antonio Brufau, in a dispute with  Sacyr
Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  and Petroleos Mexicanos.  “Recent news reports that Citigroup was hired by Repsol in
regards to their disagreement with Pemex and Sacyr are false,”
Paulo Carreno, a spokesman for Citigroup’s Banamex unit in
Mexico City, said in an e-mailed statement.  Earlier today Spanish news website El Confidencial  reported 
Repsol hired Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
Mediobanca SpA, citing senior Repsol executives without naming
them.  Citigroup in May said it won’t continue in the syndicate
that lent Sacyr Vallehermoso SA 5.2 billion euros to take a 20
percent stake in Spain’s biggest oil company once that loan
comes due in December, the website reported.  Sacyr last month formed an alliance with  Petroleos
Mexicanos , the third biggest shareholder, aimed at focusing
Repsol’s acitivies on the oil industry and installing a chief
executive officer alongside Brufau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
