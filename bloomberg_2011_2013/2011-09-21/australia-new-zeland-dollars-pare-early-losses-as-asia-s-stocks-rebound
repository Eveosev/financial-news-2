The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars pared earlier losses as Asian stocks snapped a two-day
decline, supporting demand for higher yielding currencies.  The Aussie was little changed at $1.0275 as of 10:16 a.m.
in Sydney from $1.0276 in  New York  yesterday, after earlier
declining as much as 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s dollar was at
82.28 U.S. cents from 82.42 cents.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
