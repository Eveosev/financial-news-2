Croatia  will borrow 260 million
euros ($355 million) to refinance a maturing bond issued in
1991, officials said at a Cabinet meeting in Zagreb today.
Croatia will repay the loan by 2016 with a fixed interest rate
of 5.5 percent.  The original bond, issued in Yugoslav dinars before the
introduction of the kuna in Croatia, is now worth 2.4 billion
kuna ($437 million) in today’s Croatian currency.  The loan is facilitated in equal parts by Hypo Alpe-Adria-
Bank d.d, a local unit of  Austria ’s Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG., and by Erste & Steiermarkische Bank d.d., a
unit of  Erste Group Bank AG. (EBS)   The Croatian government will also supply 482 million kuna
from the 2011 state budget to pay off the maturing bond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
