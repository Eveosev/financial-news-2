Vietnam ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation an improved cash supply at lenders will boost
demand for the securities. The dong fell.  The central bank on Sept. 19 extended the term at which it
lends to commercial banks via open-market operations to 14 days
from seven days for the first time since January. The State
Treasury will offer 1 trillion dong ($48 million) each of five-
year and three-year notes tomorrow, according to the Hanoi Stock
Exchange.  “The extended term in the open-market operations allows
money to be circulated for a longer period, so  interest rates 
may decline, which in turn will help bring down bond yields,”
said Pham Minh Hoang, a fixed-income dealer at Ocean Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “Banks are interested in buying
government debt this year because they expect yields to drop
further in 2012.”  The yield on the five-year government bond dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.46 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.1 percent to 20,827 per dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,628, unchanged since
Aug. 24, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  The treasury sold 360 billion dong of three-year securities
at 12.14 percent on Sept. 15. That is more than the 50 billion
dong of similar-maturity notes it sold at 12.15 percent the week
before. The overnight interbank deposit rate fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.25 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
