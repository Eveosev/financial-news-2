Mauritius’s trade deficit narrowed
6.5 percent in July compared with a year earlier as the value of
exports increased, the  Central Statistics Office  said.  The gap declined to 4.96 billion rupees ($173.1 million)
from 5.31 billion rupees in 2010, the Port Louis-based data
agency said in a  statement  on its website today. The deficit
widened from 4.776 billion rupees in June.  Imports bills rose 1.4 percent to 11.18 billion rupees, it
said. Export revenue jumped 8.7 percent to 6.22 billion rupees.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million, is a net importer of food and fuels. India and
 China  are the country’s main suppliers, the data agency said,
whilst the U.K, France and the U.S. are its major exports
destinations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
