Hungary ’s financial regulator,
 Pszaf , found no evidence of  insider trading  in the shares of OTP
Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, during a review  conducted
at the request of an opposition politician, a spokesman at the
authority said.  “We found no trading pattern or any other evidence
indicating that illegal market influencing may have taken
place,” Istvan Binder said in a phone interview today. “The
authority, therefore, sees no reason to start an official
investigation,” he said.  Attila Mesterhazy, the chairman of the opposition Socialist
Party, asked the authority last week to start an investigation,
claiming that short positions were taken in OTP shares before an
announcement that Hungary may allow foreign-currency mortgage
holders to repay their debts at below-market rates, Binder said.  The announcement sent OTP shares tumbling as much as 15
percent on Sept. 9 before trading was suspended on Sept. 12. OTP
declined 15.2 percent since the loan repayment plan became
public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
