Scotland  will spend 9 billion
pounds ($14 billion) by March 2015 on infrastructure projects
designed to boost economic growth.  The semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh will prioritize
jobs as well as improving public services over the next three
years, Finance Secretary John Swinney said today. He was
presenting his  spending review  following cuts by the U.K.
government at Westminster in  London .  “Against this stark backdrop, we will steer a distinct
course and make the very best use of the constrained resources
available to us,” Swinney said in a statement today after
briefing lawmakers. “Our decisions have been focused on
supporting recovery in the face of Westminster cuts, and this
budget continues that vital process.”  Scotland is facing cuts of more than 12 percent over a
four-year period after taking account of inflation as Prime
Minister  David Cameron  tries to curb a record budget deficit,
according to Swinney. The Scottish National Party government is
trying to wrest more financial control from the U.K. as part of
its push for independence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
