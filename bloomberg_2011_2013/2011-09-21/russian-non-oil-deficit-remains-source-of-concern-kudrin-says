Russia’s non-oil deficit, or the
shortfall excluding revenue from oil and gas sales, remains a
“source of concern” and is a better measure to gauge the
country’s budget stability, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said.  The non-oil deficit reached 12.6 percent of gross domestic
product last year, 4 to 5 percentage points above an acceptable
level and compared with an overall gap of 4 percent, Kudrin told
lawmakers in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
