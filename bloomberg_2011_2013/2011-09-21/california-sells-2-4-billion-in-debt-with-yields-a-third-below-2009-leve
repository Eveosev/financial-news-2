California , its fiscal progress
easing the premium demanded by investors, saved $152 million by
refunding debt with the sale of $2.4 billion in general-
obligation bonds at yields about a third less than two years
ago.  The state’s first general obligations offered this year
were priced yesterday to yield 3.17 percent on 10-year
maturities, as much as 109 basis points above top-rated tax-
exempt debt. That compares with a 160 basis-point premium on
similar bonds sold in March 2009. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  “There is a perception that the state is getting its
budgeting and deficit situation more in order,” Kelly Wine,
executive vice president of RH Investment Corp., a broker-dealer
in Encino, California, that helped sell the bonds, said
yesterday.  The budget that Governor  Jerry Brown  and Democrats passed
in June, which helped reduce long-term structural imbalances,
allowed Treasurer Bill Lockyer to lower yields because perceived
risk has declined, said his spokesman,  Tom Dresslar . Individual
investors bought about 28 percent of the issue, or $655 million,
down from 80 percent in November, the most recent previous sale.
About half of the total was offered to such buyers, Dresslar
said.  “The treasurer will maintain his focus on maximizing
retail purchase of California bonds,” Dresslar said yesterday.
“But if the days of investors getting a sweet fiscal
mismanagement premium are over, we may not see again some of the
higher retail percentages of recent years.”  Offering Reduced  The offering was reduced by 6 percent, to $2.39 billion
from the original plan to sell $2.54 billion in securities.  Lockyer will use $1.1 billion of the debt to refinance
outstanding general-obligation bonds and another $1.26 billion
to pay down outstanding commercial paper. That will help the
state cut its debt service costs over the life of those bonds by
$152 million, Dresslar said.  California sold bonds with yields ranging from as little as
0.72 percent for securities maturing in 2013 and as much as 4.8
percent for debt maturing in 2041, 114 basis points above a 30-
year index of top-rated tax-exempt bonds.  The 10-year index of top-rated municipals fell to 2.08
percent today, up from 2.05 percent on Sept. 12, the lowest
level since January 2009, when Bloomberg began collecting data
for the securities. Yields on top-rated 30-year tax-exempts fell
to 3.63 percent after slipping to 3.56 percent on Sept. 12, also
the lowest since Bloomberg records began.  The state’s debt, including price changes and interest
income, returned 9.3 percent through Sept. 19, outperforming the
overall tax-exempt market by 122 basis points, according to S&P
Municipal Bond Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
