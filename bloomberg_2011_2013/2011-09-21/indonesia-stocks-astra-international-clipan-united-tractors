Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  fell 54.62 points, or 1.5
percent, to 3,697.49, the lowest close since April 5.  PT Astra International (ASII IJ), Indonesia’s biggest
automotive retailer, dropped 2.1 percent to 64,050 rupiah, the
biggest drag on the composite index. The nation’s domestic
vehicle sales in August declined 18 percent from a month earlier
to 73,279 units, from 89,056 units a month earlier, Astra said.  PT Clipan Finance Indonesia (CFIN IJ), a consumer financing
company, sank 8.6 percent to 425 rupiah, the lowest close since
Nov. 5. Clipan wants to raise as much as 468.6 billion rupiah
($52 million) selling 1.17 billion new shares in a rights offer
in October to boost working capital, the company said today.
Selling new shares may dilute the stakes of existing
shareholders.  PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka (KIJA IJ), which develops and
sells industrial real estate, fell 8.7 percent to 157 rupiah,
the most since Aug. 5. Jababeka had to delay a plan to sell new
shares in a rights offer because the documents it filed to the
market regulator for obtaining approval weren’t complete, PT
Onix Capital wrote in a note today. Two calls to the company’s
office in Jakarta weren’t answered.  PT United Tractors (UNTR IJ),  Indonesia ’s largest heavy-
equipment seller, fell 3.7 percent to 22,150 rupiah, the lowest
close since May 25. The company’s heavy-equipment sales in
August fell 19 percent from a month earlier to 589 units, United
Tractors said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
