Brazil’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
urged world leaders to stop manipulating their currencies and
said Latin America’s biggest economy doesn’t have limitless
resources to weather a global crisis.  “We know our ability to withstand isn’t unlimited,”
Rousseff said at the United Nations General Assembly in  New York 
today. “We need to impose controls on the currency war.”  Without mentioning specific countries, Rousseff said the
world needs to prevent countries from influencing the value of
their currencies through both expansionary monetary policies and
fixed exchange rates. She called on leaders to find joint
solutions to the international economic crisis.  Rousseff has intensified efforts to protect local
manufacturers from imports, which are being spurred by a 27
percent gain in the real since the end of 2008. Last week, her
government raised by 30 percentage points a tax on cars that are
made mostly from imported parts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
