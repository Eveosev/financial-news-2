The rand pared its decline against
the dollar after South African retail-sales growth exceeded
estimates in July.  The currency of  Africa â€™s biggest economy traded 1.7 percent
down at 7.8385 by 1:02 p.m. in Johannesburg. Earlier, it was as
much as 2 percent lower at 7.8599, the weakest intraday level
since May 2010.  Retail sales climbed 2.8 percent in July from a year
earlier compared with a revised 2.4 percent in June, Statistics
 South Africa  said in a report today. The median estimate was for
2 percent growth, according to 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
