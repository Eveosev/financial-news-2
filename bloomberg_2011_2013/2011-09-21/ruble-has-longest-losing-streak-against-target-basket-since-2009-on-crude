The ruble weakened for a ninth day
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket, its
longest stretch of declines since February 2009, as investors
pared bets on riskier assets.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent to 36.6914 versus the
basket by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the lowest level since
December 2009. The ruble sank 0.4 percent to 31.4725 per dollar
and lost 0.3 percent to 43.07 per euro.  The ruble slumped 5 percent against the basket since Sept.
8 amid concern a possible default by  Greece  will hobble the
economic recovery. The European debt crisis has generated as
much as 300 billion euros ($410 billion) in credit risk for
European banks, the  International Monetary Fund  said today,
calling for capital injections to reassure investors and support
lending.  The central bank uses the basket to smooth currency
movements that can hurt exporters. The regulator sells more
dollars and euros the closer the ruble gets to the weaker end of
a so-called floating corridor that currently stands at 32.15 to
37.15 rubles,  Ivan Tchakarov , Moscow-based chief economist at
 Renaissance Capital , said by e-mail yesterday.  The central bank drained more than $200 billion, or about a
third of the country’s international reserves, in the six months
through January 2009 to stem a 35 percent devaluation of the
ruble to the dollar.  “The central bank is now selling dollars and buying rubles
to lean against the wind,” Tchakarov said. “The closer the
ruble-basket rate moves towards the upper end of the band, the
more the bank will intervene.”  Cost of Protection  Urals crude oil,  Russia ’s main export blend, lost 4.8
percent to $111.60 a barrel yesterday, the biggest daily drop
since Aug. 8. The blend gained 0.5 percent today, paring its
loss since reaching this year’s peak of $122.88 a barrel on
April 4 to 8.7 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps climbed three basis points
to 232 yesterday, according to data provider CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That’s the highest level since
September 2009 based on closing prices, the data show.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities, or the cash equivalent, should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  The ruble could recoup some of its losses if the U.S.
Federal Reserve announces steps to boost the economy today,
 Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog, Russia’s oldest
investment bank, wrote in an e-mailed note.  “The recent sharp decline in the ruble against both the
dollar and the euro is an overreaction to oil-price fears,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
