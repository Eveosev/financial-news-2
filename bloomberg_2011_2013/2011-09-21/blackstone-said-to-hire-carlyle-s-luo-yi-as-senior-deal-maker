Blackstone Group LP (BX)  hired Luo Yi
from Carlyle Group LP as a senior managing director based in
Shanghai, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Luo, who resigned from Carlyle this month, will report to
Michael Chae, head of Blackstone’s Asian buyout business, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is
private. Luo could not be reached for a comment.  The hiring follows the departure of Ben Jenkins, who is
leaving Asia after spending more than four years in the region
and will remain with the New York-based buyout firm through
year-end as a senior managing director, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Reuters reported Luo’s move earlier today.  Blackstone, based in  New York , was the first global
private-equity firm to set up a fund with the Chinese government
in 2009, agreeing to a 5 billion yuan ($780 million) joint
venture to target investments in Shanghai and neighboring areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
