  Egypt  has appointed Mohamed Omran
as chairman of its stock exchange, the Cabinet said in a faxed
statement today.  Omran will head the Egyptian Exchange, replacing Mohamed
Abdel Salam who took over the post in March amid political
unrest that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February and
halted  stock trading  for nearly two months, the Cairo-based
Cabinet said.  Omran is a former deputy chairman of the bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
