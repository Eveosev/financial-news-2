Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , owner of the largest
rare-earth deposit outside of  China , said the U.S. should focus
on boosting production rather than trying to pressure China to
export more of the elements used in electronics.  Increasing domestic output would make the U.S. less
dependent on China while creating jobs in mining and industries
that need rare earths, Molycorp Chief Executive Officer Mark A. Smith said today in prepared testimony to a congressional
subcommittee. China is reducing rare-earth exports to encourage
companies to locate manufacturing operations there, he said.  “By remaining focused on what we can do to get our own
supply chain up and running, we will not only be in a stronger
strategic position, but we will create an important foundation
that can help catalyze manufacturing job growth in this
country,” Smith said.  Molycorp, based in  Greenwood Village , Colorado, is spending
$781 million to modernize and expand its rare-earth mine and
manufacturing facility at Mountain Pass,  California , he said.
“Mechanical completion” of the project is expected in July,
Smith said.  Congress can encourage the country’s advantage in
technological innovation by maintaining research and development
efforts in rare earths and strengthening graduate programs in
science, Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
