Curetis AG, a diagnostics company
begun by former Royal Philips Electronics NV employees, will
seek a partner as it aims to sell a speedier test for pneumonia
in the U.S. by 2013.  Curetis is likely to become an acquisition target for a
bigger company with the marketing and distribution muscle to
compete in the U.S. and  Europe , Chief Executive Officer Oliver Schacht said in an interview last week at the Sachs Associates
biotech conference in Zurich. The company aims for regulatory
approval in the U.S. by 2013, he said.  “By that time we will need a strong commercial partner in
place for the U.S. market and sales,” Schacht said.  Peak sales may reach 200 million euros ($273.3 million) to
300 million euros in seven to 10 years, Schacht said. The tests
for hospitalized pneumonia patients will cost 130 euros to 160
euros each, he said.  Curetis, based in Holzgerlingen,  Germany , expects to
introduce the test in Europe in the first half of 2012, he said.
Curetis will market the product with its own sales force in
Germany,  Austria  and  Switzerland  and through distributors
elsewhere in Europe. The company needs to sell 100 systems to be
profitable, he said.  The German company’s system of cartridges inserted in a
desktop processor means doctors can find out in less than four
hours which of 17 different pathogens and 22 antibiotic
resistance genes are present, instead of waiting several days
for traditional lab results, Schacht said. That would help
ensure patients get the correct antibiotics, he said.  Raising Funds  Curetis will compete with device makers including  Cepheid
Inc. (CPHD) , based in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Salt Lake City-based  Idaho
Technology Inc. , Schacht said.  Curetis raised 24.5 million euros from investors including
Aeris Capital AG, CD-Venture GmbH and  BioMedPartners AG  in a
first round of funding that ended in May. Schacht said he
expects to raise another 8 million euros to 9 million euros in
the next two months.  The company will begin a pair of clinical trials to prove
its test is as effective as the standard by the end of the year,
Schacht said. The trials are intended to enroll more than 2,000
patients at five European hospitals and three to five sites in
the U.S.  Curetis was founded in 2007 by employees from Philips’
former molecular diagnostics group, though it’s not developing
any products that originated at Philips. Schacht, who helped
take Epigenomics AG public as chief financial officer in 2004,
joined Curetis as CEO in April.  Some 1.2 million people in the U.S. were hospitalized with
pneumonia in 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s  website . About 3.4 percent of hospital
inpatient deaths were from pneumonia, according to the CDC. The
disease can be caused by bacterial, viral or fungal infection;
Curetis’s screener works for bacterial infections and one type
of fungal infection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
