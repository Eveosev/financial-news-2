Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
which has spent $1.4 billion on fees while in bankruptcy, paid
$34.6 million to lawyers and managers in August, according to a
regulatory filing.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
 Bryan Marsal  runs the defunct investment bank, took in about
$470 million in fees for 35 1/2 months of “interim
management,” including about $9.6 million last month, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, based in  New York , whose fees
totaled $334.8 million so far for acting as Lehman’s lead
bankruptcy law firm, collected $8.1 million in August.  Marsal has said he will start distributing some cash to the
defunct firm’s creditors by next year, or more than three years
after the September 2008 bankruptcy filing. Lehman and its
affiliates were holding cash and investments of $25.5 billion on
August 31, compared with $25.2 billion on July 31.  Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, ended a fight for control
of the firm’s $65 billion liquidation by taking some potential
payments from bondholders including hedge fund Paulson & Co. to
give to derivatives creditors such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
The chief executive officer has said holders of $100 billion in
claims now support his liquidation plan, due to be voted on in
November.  Estimated Claims  He aims to raise $65 billion by selling the defunct
company’s assets in the next few years to pay estimated claims
of more than $300 billion, he has said.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  Of the August cash total, $2.8 billion was unavailable for
use, according to the filing.  The Lehman bankruptcy in Manhattan became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by  Lynn LoPucki , a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California,  Los
Angeles .  Lehman’s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Once the world’s fourth-
biggest investment bank, Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept.
15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
