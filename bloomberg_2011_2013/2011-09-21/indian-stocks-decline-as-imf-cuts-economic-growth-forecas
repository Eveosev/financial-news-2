Indian stocks declined after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its Indian growth forecasts
because of weak investment and a faltering global economy.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  declined after the Economic Times
reported that the nation’s largest carmaker slashed production.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s biggest refining
complex, also fell.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 0.3 percent
to 17,052.14, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai after moving between gains and losses at least
eight times. The measure has declined 17 percent this year on
concern higher interest costs,  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
and a slowdown in the U.S. may combine to erode earnings.  Sensex companies trade at 14 times estimated profits,
within 10 percent of the lowest level since April 2009, data on
the Bloomberg show.  -- With assistance from Tanya Ashreena. Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
