The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 0.7 percent to 55,981.90.  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  (EMBR3 BS) jumped 5.4 percent to 11.94 reais.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft maker said it forecasts
airline demand for regional jets at $320 billion in the next 20
years, according to its market outlook published on its website.
In July, Embraer had estimated demand at $200 billion.  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3 BS) slid 4.3
percent to 10.63 reais. The company led declines for Brazilian
homebuilders as traders pared bets for further interest-rate
cuts, damping the outlook for domestic demand.  Tam SA (TAMM4)  (TAMM4 BS) increased 0.4 percent to 36.80 reais
after surging as much as 12 percent intraday. Lan Airlines SA’s
planned purchase of Tam was approved by Chile’s antitrust
tribunal with several conditions. They include Lan and Tam
opening up their frequent flyer program to other airlines,
exiting one of their global alliances and capping Santiago-Sao
Paulo fares until they exchange four daily slots in Sao Paulo’s
Guarulhos airport with other carriers. The tie-up still requires
Brazilian approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
