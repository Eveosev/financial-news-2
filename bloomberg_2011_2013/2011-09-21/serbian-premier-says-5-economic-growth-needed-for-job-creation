Serbia  wants foreign investment to
help raise economic growth to 5 percent per year and create
jobs, Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said.  Growth is estimated at 2 percent in 2011 and 3 percent in
2012, Cvetkovic said today at an economic forum organized by
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s Serbian unit.  “We know the current level of Serbia’s development is not
enough for accelerated  job creation  and an increase in the
standard of living,” Cvetkovic said. Those goals need “a
sustainable economic growth rate of 5 percent a year.”  Cvetkovic said he expects production of as many as 200,0000
cars a year from a new assembly plant run by Fiat SpA in
Kragujevac to be “an important signal for other big investors
in industry, farming, construction, telecommunications and”
technology.’’  Serbia will cut its fiscal gap to 4 percent in 2012 of
gross domestic product from 4.5 percent this year under a draft
revised budget, which still requires parliamentary approval. The
budget changes are tied to conditions outlined in the Balkan
nation’s new 1 billion-euro ($1.37 billion) precautionary loan
program with the  International Monetary Fund .  The government has stepped up efforts to meet all the
conditions for eventual European Union entry with parliament
adopting a set of laws needed to allow for membership talks to
begin. Serbia hopes to get a positive assessment from the
European Commission on Oct. 12 and formally become an EU
candidate by year’s end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
