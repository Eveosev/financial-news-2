Spain ’s  finance ministry  has
revised up the 2010  budget deficit  for the region of Catalonia,
the regional government said.  Catalonia’s budget deficit amounted to 4.22 percent of
regional gross domestic product last year, compared with the
initial estimate of 3.86 percent, the Barcelona-based government
said late yesterday in a statement. The revision is due to a
change in the accounting method, said a spokeswoman for the
economy department in Barcelona, who declined to be named in
line with policy.  A spokesman for the finance ministry in Madrid declined to
confirm the data, and said revised budget figures will be sent
to the European Commission by the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
