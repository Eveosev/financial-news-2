Orange-juice futures fell for the
first time in three days on concern that slowing economic growth
will reduce commodity demand. Sugar also dropped.  The  Federal Reserve  said today there are “significant
downside risks” to the economy. Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded the long-term debt of Bank of America Corp. and  Wells
Fargo & Co ., saying U.S. support is less likely in an emergency.
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
dropped as much as 1.1 percent.  “With the bank downgrades, there was a loss of confidence,
and commodities just got weaker and weaker,” Sterling Smith, an
analyst at Country Hedging Inc., said in a telephone interview
from  St. Paul , Minnesota. “Everybody was also very nervous
about what the Fed would say today.”  Orange juice for November delivery fell 2.15 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.663 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price rose as much as 1.2 percent
as Tropical Storm Ophelia may threaten citrus groves in Florida.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.88 cent, or 3.3
percent, to 25.91 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener touched
25.66 cents, the lowest since June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
