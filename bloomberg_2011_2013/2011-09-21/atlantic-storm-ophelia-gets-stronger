Tropical Storm Ophelia strengthened
in the Atlantic while Tropical Storm Hilary formed in the
Pacific off the western coast of  Mexico , the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.  Ophelia is 1,245 miles (2,003 kilometers) east of the
Leeward Islands with top winds of 60 miles per hour, up from 45
mph earlier today, according to a center advisory at 11 a.m. New
York time.  “The official intensity forecast calls for slow weakening
over the forecast period,” the center said in  an analysis .  Ophelia, the 15th named storm of the six-month  hurricane
season , which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, is on a track
that would take it north of  Puerto Rico  early next week. Strong
wind shear is tearing at the system’s structure, the  hurricane
center  said.  In the Pacific, Hilary formed about 155 miles south of
Puerto Escondido, Mexico, according to the hurricane center.
Hilary is the eighth named storm of the Eastern Pacific season,
which runs from May 15 to Nov. 30.  Hilary is expected to grow into a hurricane, with winds of
at least 74 mph, later this week on a path taking it away from
land and deeper into the Pacific, the center said.  “Interests along the southern coast of Mexico should
monitor the progress of Hilary,” the Miami-based center said.
“Any deviation of the track to the north of the current
forecast could require watches or warnings for a portion of the
coast of Mexico.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
