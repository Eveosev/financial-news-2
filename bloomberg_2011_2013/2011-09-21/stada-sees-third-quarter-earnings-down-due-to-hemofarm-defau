STADA Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  said that
outstanding receivables due to Hemofarm from various Serbian
pharmaceutical wholesalers are potentially, to a significant
extent, not recoverable.  In connection with this increased risk of default, the
executive board has decided to carry out corresponding
impairments and unscheduled depreciation in the amount of about
97 million euros before taxes which will be reported in the
current third quarter as burdening one-time special effects. The
resulting burden on earnings after taxes is expected to be about
85 million euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
