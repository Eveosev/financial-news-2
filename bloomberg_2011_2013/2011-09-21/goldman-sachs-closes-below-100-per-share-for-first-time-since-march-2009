     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, closed below $100 for the
first time since March 2009 as financial stocks fell amid
concerns about the European debt crisis.  The shares fell $4.75, or 4.6 percent, to $97.86 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 20, 2009. The stock dropped briefly
below $100 earlier this month before climbing back above $100 by
the end of the trading session. Goldman Sachs has declined 42
percent this year.  Goldman Sachs fell amid an overall decline in U.S.
financial stocks, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials
Index dropping 4.9 percent. Moody’s Investors Service lowered
credit ratings on  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
and reduced Citigroup Inc.’s short-term rating today.  “Most of it is still Europe and the uncertainty about what
the resolution of the sovereign debt problems will be,” said
David Hilder, an analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial
Group. “The Moody’s downgrades certainly didn’t help.” Hilder
has a “positive” rating on Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and
Wells Fargo and a “neutral” on Citigroup.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
sustained the biggest decline in the S&P 500 Financials Index as
the stock fell $1.30, or 8.6 percent, to $13.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
