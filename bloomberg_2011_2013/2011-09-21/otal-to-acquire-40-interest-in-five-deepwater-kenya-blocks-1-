Total SA (FP) , France’s largest oil
company, will acquire a 40 percent interest in five deepwater
exploration blocks off Kenya.  Total is getting the stake from  Cove Energy Plc (COV) ,  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and Dynamic Global Advisers Kenya Ltd., Cove and
Total said in statements today. After the deal, Anadarko will
have 50 percent of the blocks and Cove 10 percent.  “This transaction is part of a bold exploration strategy
that consists in acquiring large stakes in high-potential
frontier plays,” Marc Blaizot, a Total executive for
exploration, said in a statement. “Recent discoveries in
offshore Mozambique and Tanzania offer a very promising outlook
for these Kenyan permits.”  Total has pledged to carry out “bolder” exploration in a
bid to boost output and has said it may raise annual investment
to about $23 billion from about $20 billion to pay for new
ventures. Production this year will be “basically flat,” Chief
Financial Officer Patrick de la Chevardiere said after output
dropped 2 percent in the second quarter.  Paris-based Total is building a position in East Africa.
Total agreed to buy interests in Ugandan blocks from  Tullow Oil
Plc (TLW) , a transaction that the companies expect to complete this
month. Total said in March it will set up a venture with Tullow
and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to develop Lake Albert
basin fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
