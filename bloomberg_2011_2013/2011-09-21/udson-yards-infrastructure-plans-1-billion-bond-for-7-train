The Hudson Yards Infrastructure
Corp., which finances development of a district west of Midtown
Manhattan, plans to sell $1 billion of bonds next month to help
pay for extending the No. 7 subway line to the neighborhood.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is senior manager of the deal, which
is set for the week of Oct. 17, according to an e-mailed press
release from the Hudson Yards agency. The authority sells debt
for the redevelopment of the 26-acre rail yard.  The Hudson Yards West development includes expanding
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority ’s No. 7 subway line, which
runs between Manhattan’s Times Square and Queens. Bond proceeds
will also finance parks and other amenities, according to the
corporation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
