New Zealand ’s economy grew less
than economists predicted in the three months through June from
the first quarter, the government statistics agency said today
in Wellington.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.1 percent in the second
quarter from the January-March period and gained 1.5 percent
from a year earlier, the agency said. The median estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists were for a 0.5 percent
quarterly increase and a 1.7 percent year-on-year rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
