Novozymes A/S started an integrated
food-energy business with CleanStar Ventures that will replace
thousands of charcoal-burning stoves with ethanol in  Mozambique ,
the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company said in an e-mail.  The joint venture will produce an ethanol-based cooking
fuel made from cassava, which it aims to supply to 20 percent of
households in Mozambiqueâ€™s capital, Maputo, by 2014. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch is in advanced talks to join the venture,
Novozymes said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
