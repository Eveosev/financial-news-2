Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  agreed to guarantee Lubrizol Corp.’s obligations to debt
holders after completing its purchase of the lubricants maker.  Lubrizol entered into intercompany loan deals with
principal amount of $5.9 billion after the takeover this month,
and in connection with the increased indebtedness, Berkshire
“issued a guarantee of all of the company’s payment obligations
to its existing debt security holders,” Wickliffe, Ohio-based
Lubrizol said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
