Fishermen have the deadliest job
relative to their wages in the U.S.  “People who go into fishing don’t really realize what the
risks are,” Mark Juma Nahon, a  Gulf Fishermen’s Association 
board member and fisherman with 30 years of experience, said in
an interview. “There certainly are a lot of people who die
during their time at sea.”  With 116 annual deaths per 100,000 workers, the yearly
salary for fishermen and related fishing workers is $27,880,
according to a Bloomberg Rankings analysis, which compiled data
from the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  that excludes military
employees.  Fishermen are followed by logging workers with a salary of
$34,510 and about 92 annual deaths, the data showed. Quarry
workers, derrick operators and explosives workers ranked third
with a salary of $40,600 and about 64 annual deaths.  Juma Nahon said bad weather and handling equipment,
particularly for inexperienced fishermen, can be dangerous. He
said he once saw a fishing line decapitate a fellow fisherman,
leaving the man’s head on the boat while the body went
overboard.  The highest paying jobs given the risk of death include
firefighters with a salary of $47,730 and about three annual
deaths per 100,000 workers. Janitors get a salary of $24,560 and
about two annual deaths per 100,000 workers, and first-line
supervisors of production and operating workers receive a salary
of $56,170 and about five annual deaths per 100,000 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
