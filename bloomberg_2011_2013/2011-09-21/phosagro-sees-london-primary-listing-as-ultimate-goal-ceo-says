OAO Phosagro, the largest phosphate
fertilizer maker in  Europe , has an “ultimate goal” of a London
primary listing, Chief Executive Officer Maxim Volkov said.  “It is the ultimate goal probably but right now we’re just
at the beginning of this process,” Volkov said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown” with  Owen Thomas .  Russian companies aim to lure foreign investors by offering
shares in the U.K. OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s largest producer of
gold, closed a reverse takeover last month to gain a listing and
aims to join the FTSE-100 Index. OAO Polymetal picked Deutsche
Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc to bring it to the
London market, three people with knowledge of the matter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
