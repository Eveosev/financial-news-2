The  West African Development Bank 
will lend  Benin  about 4 billion CFA Francs ($8.3 million) to
help boost rice production next year, Minister of Agriculture
Sabai Kate said.  The government plans to use the money to train about 10,000
young people to produce rice on more than 15,000 hectares
(37,000 acres) in the Opkara River valley in the north, Kate
told reporters today in the commercial capital, Cotonou.  The government has a production target of 550,000 metric
tons of rice by 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
