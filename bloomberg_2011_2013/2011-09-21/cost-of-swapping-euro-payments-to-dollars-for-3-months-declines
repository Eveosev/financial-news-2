The cost for European banks to fund
in dollars fell for the first time in almost a week, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The cost of converting euro payments into dollars, measured
by the three-month cross-currency basis swap, was 96 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:17 a.m. in
 London , from 98 basis points yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost was 112.5 basis points under
Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive since
December 2008.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was little changed
at 70 basis points less than Euribor, Bloomberg data show. The
difference widened to as much as 75 basis points on Sept. 13.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between
the three-month euro interbank offered rate and overnight index
swaps, was at 82 basis points, from 79.5 yesterday, Bloomberg
data show. That’s within four basis points of the highest level
since March 2009, reached Sept. 12.  The ECB said financial institutions reduced overnight
deposits. Banks deposited 114.7 billion euros ($157 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based lender yesterday, compared with 144.8
billion euros on Sept. 19 and 197.8 billion euros on Sept. 12,
the ECB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
