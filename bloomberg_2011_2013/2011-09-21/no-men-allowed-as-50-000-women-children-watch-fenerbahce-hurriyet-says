A full stadium of almost 50,000
women and children watched Fenerbahce draw 1-1 with Manisaspor
yesterday after Turkish soccer authorities banned men from the
match as a punishment for bad behavior, Hurriyet newspaper
reported.  The federation has dropped a policy of punishing clubs by
forcing them to play in empty stadiums, and now only bans men.
Clubs being punished for crowd violence must allow women and
children under 12 into the ground for free for some matches, the
newspaper reported.  More than 41,000 supporters arrived at the Istanbul club
with tickets and authorities opened the gates to allow more into
the Sukru Saracoglu stadium, bringing attendance to close to
50,000, Hurriyet said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
