A first North Sea Forties crude
cargo for October loading was dropped and a fourth September
shipment was delayed to October amid production woes, according
to a revised export program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The October shipment with parcel number F1012 was dropped,
while September lot F0917 was delayed to Sept. 30 to Oct. 2, the
plan showed. Each consignment is 600,000 barrels.  In the past month, a total of 19 shipments for September
and October were deferred by two to 10 days and three cargoes
were dropped, according to the program. Forties is one of four
North Sea crude grades used to price Dated Brent, the benchmark
for more than half of the worldâ€™s oil.  The share of crude produced from the 200,000-barrel-a-day
Buzzard field, the biggest stream in the Forties blend, dropped
to 29 percent in the seven days to Sept. 18 from 32 percent a
week earlier, BP Plc said yesterday on its website. BP operates
the Forties Pipeline System.  To contact the reporter on this story:
