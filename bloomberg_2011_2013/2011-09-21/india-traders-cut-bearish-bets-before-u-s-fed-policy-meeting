Options traders pared bearish bets
on Indian stocks amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
do more to stimulate economic growth after a two-day policy
meeting concludes today.  The premium investors paid for three-month puts to sell the
S&P CNX Nifty Index versus call options to buy dropped to 12.3
at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai from 13.86 on Sept. 15, which was the
highest level since July 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
India VIX, which measures the cost of buying protection against
losses in the Nifty, slid 7.9 percent to 27.3 yesterday amid a
2.2 percent jump in the  stock index , the data show.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said the Fed
has more tools available to stimulate the economy as risks to
the U.S. recovery rise. The  Federal Open Market Committee  may
announce it has decided to replace short-term Treasuries in its
$1.65 trillion portfolio with long-term bonds, according to 71
percent of 42 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Some bearish positions are being squared on speculation
the Fed will announce a fiscal stimulus,” said Yogesh Radke,
analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “Easy
money may drive up stocks and that’s why there’s less panic.”  The Nifty fell 0.1 percent to 5,133.25 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge jumped 2.2 percent yesterday, the
biggest gain in  Asia  and the steepest rally in more than three
weeks. The 50-stock gauge has still lost 16 percent this year
amid concern higher borrowing costs,  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
slowing U.S. economy may combine to erode corporate earnings.  Companies on the measure trade at 14.1 times estimated
profit, within 10 percent of the lowest level since April 2009,
and down from 21 last March. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
valued at 9.9 times, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
