Uniqa Versicherungen AG,  Austria ’s
second-biggest insurer, will “significantly reduce” its
dividend as a 190 million-euro ($260 million) charge in part
relating to 600 job cuts almost wipes out annual profit.  Uniqa expects to break even in 2011 after the charge is
booked in the fourth quarter, the Vienna-based group said in a
statement today.  Andreas Brandstetter, who in July became chief executive
officer, has said he is planning a “significant” share sale at
Uniqa, probably in 2013, as he aims to double the number of
clients in until 2020 and improve earnings by up to 400 million
euros by 2015. The insurer trails Austrian market leader Vienna
Insurance Group AG.  Uniqa is cutting the jobs over the next three years to
reduce its costs, starting with 200 roles in its Vienna
headquarters in the next 12 months, it said in the statement.
About 80 million euros of the charge is for costs related to
those job cuts, it said. The charge also includes a 30 million-
euro endowment for Uniqa’s pension fund, as well as 80 million
euros for “balance sheet reserves,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
