Six banks have joined  Home Inns &
Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) ’s about $250 million acquisition loan as
senior lenders and underwriters, in addition to original
arrangers Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said
a person familiar with the matter.  The loan pays a so-called all-in rate of about 450 basis
points over the London interbank offered rate, the person said,
asking not to be identified as details are private.  Each of the banks joining as senior lenders are targeting
to hold about $30 million, said the person. The hold is the
amount of a loan banks intend to retain on their balance sheet
rather than selling to other banks in general syndication.  A decision on whether the loan will be opened to general
syndication has not yet been made.  Home Inns, which operates 934 hotels across 164 cities in
 China  according to its  website , agreed to buy budget hotel chain
operator Motel 168 in May for $470 million in cash, debt and
shares. The deal “will create the most geographically diverse
economy hotel operation in China,” Home Inns said in a May 27
 statement . Home Inns received antitrust approval on Sept. 2 for
the planned acquisition, which is expected to be completed by
the end of this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
