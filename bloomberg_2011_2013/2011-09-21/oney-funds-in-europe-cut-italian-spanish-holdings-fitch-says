European money-market funds are
cutting holdings of Spanish and Italian assets and shortening
the maturities of those that remain as the sovereign debt crisis
deepens,  Fitch Ratings  said in a  report  today.  The funds continue to hold the debt of the strongest
sovereigns and financial institutions of France,  Germany  and the
U.K., according to the report.  European money-market funds have assets under management of
1.1 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion), after a 6 percent decline in
the first six months of the year as savers made “substantial
withdrawals in June,” according to Fitch. Assets probably were
flat in the third quarter, the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
