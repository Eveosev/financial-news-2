Arena Leisure Plc (ARE) , which stages 26
percent of all U.K. horseracing fixtures, extended gains in
London trading after billionaires David and Simon Reuben, who
own more than 29 percent of the company, made an approach to buy
the rest.  Arena, which owns seven racecourses, rose 0.5 penny, or 1.4
percent, to 36.75 pence, following yesterday’s 17 percent jump,
which was the biggest gain since July 2009.  The Reuben brothers, the eighth-richest people in the U.K.
with an estimated fortune of 6.2 billion pounds ($9.7 billion)
according to this year’s  Sunday Times Rich List , made a proposal
about a possible offer for Arena, it said in a statement
yesterday after the market closed.  Reuben Brothers , which also owns  Northern Racing Ltd. , has
until Oct. 18 to make a firm offer or drop plans for a bid for a
further six months.  A successful bid would give Reuben Brothers ownership of 28
percent of the U.K.’s  60 racecourses . Northern Racing is
responsible for a further 14 percent, said  Jim Allen , head of
racing at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
