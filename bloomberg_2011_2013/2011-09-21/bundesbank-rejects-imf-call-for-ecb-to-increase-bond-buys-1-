Germany ’s Bundesbank said it
rejects the International Monetary Fund’s call for the European
Central Bank to “increase” its bond purchases to stem the
region’s fiscal crisis.  “The Bundesbank stresses the significance of a strict
division between monetary and fiscal policy,” the Frankfurt-
based institution said in a statement today. “Therefore, we
reject the IMF recommendation in the World Economic Outlook to
increase the purchase program of  government bonds  in the
Eurosystem.”  The IMF said yesterday that the ECB “must continue to
intervene strongly” in European debt markets to “maintain
orderly conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
