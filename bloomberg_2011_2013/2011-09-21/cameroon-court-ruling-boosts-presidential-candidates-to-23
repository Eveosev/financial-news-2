Cameroon’s  Supreme Court  ruled that
two presidential candidates rejected by the electoral commission
may run in the Oct. 9 election, bringing the total number of
aspirants to 23.  The ruling late yesterday allows Anicet Ekane Georges of
Manidem political party and Soh Fone Daniel of Parti Socialiste
Unifie to run in the election.  Chief Justice Alexis Dipanda Mouelle told the hearing that
the electoral commission was wrong to reject their candidacies,
due to their failure to produce tax returns, because neither
earns a taxable income.  Candidates in the race include incumbent Paul Biya, who has
led  Africa ’s fourth-largest cocoa producer since 1982, and
opposition leader John Fru Ndi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
