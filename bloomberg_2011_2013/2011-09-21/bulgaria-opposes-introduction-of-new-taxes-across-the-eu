Bulgaria won’t back a European
Commission plan to introduce a new value-added tax and a levy on
financial transactions across the 27-nation bloc because “it
will impose an extra burden” on people and businesses.  Bulgaria has outlined its position on a  European Union  plan
to achieve stronger economic-policy coordination that will help
fight the debt crisis and ensure stability in the euro area, the
 Finance Ministry  in Sofia said today.  “Bulgaria doesn’t support the introduction of new taxes
because it will impose an extra burden on EU citizens and
companies,”it said in an e-mailed statement. “The introduction
of the Financial Transactions Tax on an EU level, before
reaching an agreement to introduce it on a global level, will
endanger the competitiveness of financial centers in the EU.”  Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest country in terms of economic 
output per capita, weathered the global crisis without borrowing
from international lenders. The country has the lowest personal
and corporate income tax rate in the bloc, at 10 percent, to
curb  tax evasion , attract investment and boost growth.  Bulgaria will support a plan to increase EU subsidies by 5
percent for 2014-2020, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
