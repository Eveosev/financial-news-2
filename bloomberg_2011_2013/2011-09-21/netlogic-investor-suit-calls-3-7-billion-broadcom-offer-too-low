NetLogic Microsystems Inc. (NETL) , the
designer of data-network processors being bought by chipmaker
 Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  for about $3.7 billion, was sued by a shareholder
who contends the deal undervalues the stock.  NetLogic directors shirked their duty to get the best
possible price for the stock by agreeing to take $50 a share,
investor Vincent A. Danielo said in a complaint made public
today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that resulted from the board’s failure to maximize
shareholder value,” Danielo said.  Broadcom, based in Irvine, California, and  Santa Clara ,
California-based NetLogic announced the agreement in a Sept. 12
statement, saying the combination will help provide new product
lines and reduce delivery times.  Michael Tate, NetLogic’s chief financial officer, didn’t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  NetLogic rose 25 cents to $48.35 at 10:36 a.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is Danielo v. NetLogic, CA6881, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
