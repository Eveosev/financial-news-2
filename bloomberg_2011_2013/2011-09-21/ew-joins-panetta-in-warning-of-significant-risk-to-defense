Office of Management and Budget
Director  Jacob Lew  has told U.S. House Republican defense and
budget leaders that automatic across-the-board cuts “could pose
a significant risk to national security.”  Cuts triggered if a congressional supercommittee can’t
agree by late November on $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions
would mean “purchases of weapons would have to be cut
dramatically,” Lew wrote Sept. 15 to three lawmakers, including
House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan .  Lew’s letter was signed by Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta .
Bloomberg News obtained the letter.  Lew also wrote to House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Howard “Buck” McKeon of  California  and House defense
appropriations subcommittee chairman C.W. “Bill” Young of
Florida.  Lew said the fiscal 2013 budget would require a cut of 11
percent compared with the current $513 billion budget, or as
much as 25 percent when compared with the fiscal 2013 figure
unveiled in February. The final reduction would depend “on
whether the president elects to exempt military personnel
funding.”  The Defense Department “would almost certainly be forced
to furlough large numbers of its civilian workers, training
would have to be curtailed, the force reduced and purchases of
weapons would have to be cut dramatically,” Lew wrote.  “Spending limits beyond fiscal 2013 would also be
dramatically lower,” he wrote. Lew didn’t outline potential
cuts beyond 2013, however.  ‘Significant Risk’  Still, for 2013, “reductions of this magnitude, imposed in
this matter, could pose a significant risk to national
security,” Lew said.  The  Congressional Budget Office   estimates  that the
automatic cuts would reduce the 2013-2021 budget by $55 billion
annually or $492 billion total.  President  Barack Obama  in April directed then-Secretary
 Robert Gates  to find $400 billion in national security cuts over
12 years.  The scope of the review has since been revised to about
$420 billion in “security spending” over 10 years, with $330
billion in Pentagon reductions, as part of the Budget Control
Act of 2011 that Obama signed Aug. 2.  $450 Billion Reduction  Pentagon officials say the $330 billion, compared to budget
baselines drafted last year, equates to a cut of $450 billion
over 12 years. Pentagon officials have said they can manage
these reductions.  Still, “if the Pentagon’s base non-war budget were to be
cut $850 billion or so over 10 years, it would go down to about
$472 billion annually, the approximate level of the budget in
2007, more than $70 billion higher than DOD spending was in 2000
just before the wars,” said Winslow Wheeler, former Senate
defense appropriations staff member and now director of the
Straus Military Reform Project in  Washington .  “At $472 billion, our defense budget would remain more
than twice the defense spending of  China ,  Russia , Iran, Syria,
Somalis, Cuba and any other potential adversary,” Wheeler said.  Lew wrote that the Pentagon’s review of U.S. missions,
capabilities and “our role in a changing world” will be
completed before December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
