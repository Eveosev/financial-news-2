Former Chelsea and Manchester
United Chief Executive Officer Peter Kenyon says he’s not
interested in returning to day-to-day management in the Premier
League.  Kenyon left Chelsea in 2009, six years after quitting
United to join the Blues following Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich ’s takeover. He’s currently a director with U.S.-based
sports and entertainment management group Creative Artists
Agency.  U.K. media reports have linked the executive with a return
to soccer at  Manchester City . The team controlled by Abu Dhabi’s
Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan is looking for a new CEO.
Garry Cook resigned the position Sept. 9 after a player’s mother
complained he’d sent her an offensive e-mail.  “I’m sure my aspirations are not going back into football
club management,” Kenyon said in a telephone interview from
London today. “I’ve enjoyed working at CAA, which started its
life as an entertainment agency and developed that into sports
in North America and I’m part of the team who’s helping them to
develop that internationally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
