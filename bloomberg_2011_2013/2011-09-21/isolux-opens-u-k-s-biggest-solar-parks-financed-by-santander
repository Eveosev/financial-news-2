Grupo Isolux Corsan SA, a Spanish
engineering company, commissioned the U.K.’s three biggest
photovoltaic power plants with financing from  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
and a local partner.  The plants each have 5 megawatts of peak capacity and have
a combined 22,000 fixed solar panels costing a total of 40
million euros ($55 million), the company said today in an e-
mailed press release. The plants were completed in 10 weeks.  The project, which was hooked up to the U.K. power grid
before the U.K. lowered subsidies earlier this year, brings
Isolux’s portfolio of solar plants to 290 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
