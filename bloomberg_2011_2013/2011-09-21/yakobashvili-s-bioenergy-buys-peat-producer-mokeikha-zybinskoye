Bioenergy Corp., a peat producer
controlled by entrepreneur David Yakobashvili, bought  Russia ’s
OAO Mokeikha-Zybinskoye to tap reserves in Yaroslavl.  Mokeikha-Zybinskoye owns more than 70 million metric tons
of peat reserves in the region, Bioenergy said in an e-mailed
statement, without disclosing the terms of the transaction.  Russia has peat resources in several regions, particularly
in Western Siberia but also in Yaroslavl and Moscow. Last year,
record summer temperatures in Moscow sparked wildfires in
forests and peat bogs, a legacy of the Soviet era when swamps
were drained to harvest peat as fuel.  Bioenergy will build a processing plant at the Mokeikha-
Zybinskoye reserves by May to produce peat bricks for transport
by river, road or rail, company President Yan Yanovskiy said
today by telephone. The peat, a cheaper alternative to coal,
will also be used locally for heat and power, he said.  Yakobashvili was previously board chairman of dairy company
OAO Wimm-Bill-Dann, which was acquired by PepsiCo Inc. last
December. He said at the time he planned to use the funds from
the sale to invest in peat. Bioenergy was founded this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
