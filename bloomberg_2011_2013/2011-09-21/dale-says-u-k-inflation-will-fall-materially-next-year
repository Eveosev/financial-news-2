Bank of  England  Chief Economist
 Spencer Dale  said inflation will slow “materially” next year
as a sales-tax increase in January drops out of calculations.  The decline will ease pressure on U.K. spending, though the
recovery in  consumer spending  will be “gradual,” he said in
response to audience questions after a speech today in South
Shields, England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
