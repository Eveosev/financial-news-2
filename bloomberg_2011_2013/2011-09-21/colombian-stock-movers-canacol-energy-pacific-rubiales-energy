The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:40 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.7 percent to 13,785.29 while the
Colcap Index declined 0.4 percent to 1,669.03.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in  South America , fell to a record
low on growing concern the company’s move to farm out some work
to Sintana Energy Inc., announced last week, may signal a lack
of funds, said Santiago Melo, analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Alianza Valores SA. The stock fell 4.7 percent to 1,425 pesos,
the lowest level since the stock began trading in July 2010. The
shares earlier fell as much as 7 percent in what is its seventh
consecutive day of declines.  Canacol had about $110 million in cash in the first
quarter, said Kevin Flick, the company’s vice president of
capital markets.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , fell 1.3 percent
to 46,900 pesos. The company began reducing production at
Colombia’s largest oil field yesterday to protect employees amid
protests by contract workers, President Jose Francisco Arata
said yesterday in an e-mail.  Pacific Rubiales holds a 40 percent stake in the Rubiales
field, which it operates, and Bogota-based Ecopetrol SA owns the
remainder of the field. Rubiales plans to “gradually” increase
production at the field today after protests eased, Arata said
in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
