Mauritius’s rupee appreciated for a
second day versus the dollar as optimism grows that  Greece  will
meet requirements for further aid.  The currency strengthened by 0.2 percent to 28.65 per
dollar at 11:50 a.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the rupee gained
0.6 percent to 39.1459.  Greece made “good progress” in a second round of talks
with the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  to
stave off default, the EU said in a statement. Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  holds a cabinet meeting today in
 Athens  to press for accelerating budget cuts to ensure the
country gets its next tranche of a rescue package, staving off
default.  “Markets are having a sense of deja-vu with regards to the
Greek conundrum,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank, the
country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today. “The next payment will be made as the
systemic risks posed by the failure to do so are enormous, and
could lead to a global slowdown in the best-case scenario, and a
deep recession in the worst.”  Mauritius, an open-market economy with a population of 1.3
million, is a net buyer of food and fuels, with 67 percent of
its import bills denominated in dollars, according to Bank of
Mauritius data.  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main
trading partner for tourism and manufactured goods, with 41
percent of foreign-currency income in euros.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.7713 rupees to
29.9427 and the selling price dropped to 29.2572 compared with
29.2867 yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
