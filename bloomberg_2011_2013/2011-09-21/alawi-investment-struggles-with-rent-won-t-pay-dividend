Malawi Property Investment Co.
won’t pay an interim dividend because it is “experiencing some
challenges in getting timely rental payments,” it said in a
statement today.  The company posted net income of 208.4 million kwacha in
the six months ended June 30, or 14.1 tambala per share,
compared with 163.9 million kwacha, or 11 tambala a share, the
year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
