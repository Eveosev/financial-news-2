Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) 
retreated the most in a month after National Bank of Umm Al
Qaiwain said a Dubai court will look into its appeal in a
dispute with the Kuwait-based investment bank.  The shares dropped 6 percent, the most since Aug. 21, to
39.5 fils at the 12:30 p.m. close in  Kuwait City . Global’s
shares have soared 84 percent in the past month, trimming a drop
for the year to 24 percent.  Global Investment House of Kuwait said on April 25 a Dubai
court ruled in its favor in a $250 million dispute with National
Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain. The bank was ordered to pay the amount
in addition to interest of $54.6 million, Global said then.  National Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain (NBQ) , a United Arab Emirates-
based commercial bank, didn’t trade today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
