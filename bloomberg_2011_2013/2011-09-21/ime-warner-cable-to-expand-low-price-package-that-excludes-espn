Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  will offer
more broadly a low-priced programming package that excludes
sports channels including  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN.  The company will offer it in markets on the East Coast
during the next few weeks, said Robert Marcus, president and
chief operating officer of New York-based Time Warner Cable, the
second-largest U.S. cable system after  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  West Coast
availability will follow, he said. The offer had been previously
tested in New York.  The low-priced service may help Time Warner Cable stem
losses of subscriptions from cash-strapped customers, Marcus
said today at an investor conference sponsored by  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)   By carving out sports channels, which charge the highest
fees, the company has been able to offer a package that costs
$30 to $40 a month, he said. Time Warner Cable pay-TV bills
averaged $73.50 a month at the end of June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve been challenging ourselves to design an offering
that might be more attractive and affordable to those customers
who might not be able to handle the full packages,” Marcus
said. “The numbers are still pretty small, but the results are
sufficiently encouraging that we’re going to roll that out more
broadly.”  Time Warner Cable fell 58 cents to $66.94 as of 3:37 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Disney, whose ESPN
is the most-watched sports channel, fell 67 cents to $31.64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
