Asian oil refiners plan to increase
West African crude imports for next month to 48 cargoes, six
more than September, according to a survey of six traders
involved in the transactions.  Shipments totaling 46.1 million barrels, or 1.49 million
barrels a day, will be exported from  Angola ,  Nigeria ,  Chad ,
 Equatorial Guinea  and the Republic of Congo, according to the
poll and an analysis of loading programs obtained by Bloomberg
News. That compares with a revised volume of 40.3 million
barrels, or 1.34 million barrels a day for September.  Chinese refiners will import 29 cargoes, five more than
September, according to the survey. This includes 20 shipments
bought by China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp.,
known as Unipec, one more than this month.  Indian processors bought 11 shipments, two more than this
month, according to the survey. Indian Oil Corp., the nationâ€™s
largest refiner, purchased 10 cargoes, compared with five this
month, the survey showed.  Exports to  Asia  from West Africa in September will total 
42 cargoes, the survey shows, up from earlier forecasts for 41.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe reached a premium of $4.15 a
barrel to Dated Brent on Sept. 6, the highest since July 9,
2008, compared with an average of $3.04 a barrel in August,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The grade was
yesterday at $3.72 more than the benchmark.  Nigeria plans to export 2.04 million barrels a day of crude
next month and Angola will ship 1.64 million barrels, Bloomberg
calculations based on loading programs showed.  The following table shows details of planned Asian imports
of West African crude. Each cargo ranges from 950,000 barrels to
1 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
