The first stage of Cyprus’s oil and
gas drilling in its offshore territory is complete and the
second phase will begin today,  London Greek Radio  reported,
citing a Cypriot energy official.  U.S. based Noble Energy Inc. which has the license to
explore for hydrocarbons in the east Mediterranean island’s
exclusive economic zone, did not encounter any problem so far
and its drill may reach 900 meters tonight, LGR reported, citing
Solon Kassinis, director of the Energy Service of the Nicosia-
based  Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism .  The first results will probably be available in two to
three months, LGR said, citing Kassinis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
