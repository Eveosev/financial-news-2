     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- NuVasive Inc. (NUVA)  said the facts and the
law do not support the jury’s findings of infringement and
validity in the patent lawsuit with Medtronic, and the company
will seek to overturn the verdict in post-trial motions with the
District Court. If the District Court does not grant NuVasive’s
motions, the company intends to challenge the verdict through an
appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a
statement on MarketWire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
