The cost of insuring European
sovereign debt was little changed and credit-default swaps on
corporate debt fell.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15
governments was unchanged at 350 basis points at 3 p.m. in
London, according to Markit Group Ltd. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality ; an increase, the
opposite.  Swaps on  Germany  rose one basis point to a record 95.5,
 France  increased two to 187 and Belgium was unchanged at 272,
according to CMA. Italy increased 4.5 basis points to an all-
time high of 518 on a closing basis,  Portugal  was three higher
at 1,131 and  Spain  rose seven to 426. Ireland fell 12 to 803.  It now costs $6 million in advance and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, signaling a 96
percent probability of default within that time, CMA prices
show.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds fell, with the Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings was seven basis points lower at 788, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis points to 183. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior debt of 25
banks and insurers declined six basis points to 284, while the
subordinated index was down two basis points to 496.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
