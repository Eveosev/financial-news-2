Taiwan’s dollar fell toward an
eight-month low after the  International Monetary Fund  predicted
“severe” repercussions should  Europe  fail to contain its debt
crisis and if the U.S. doesn’t rein in its fiscal deficit.  The currency dropped for a third day as the IMF cut its
projection for world economic growth this year and said
“downside risks are growing.” Export orders grew in August at
the slowest pace in 22 months, government data showed yesterday,  “ Export orders released yesterday printed a poor trade
outlook for this Christmas,” said Raymond Yeung, an economist
at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Hong Kong .
“The central bank is very likely to adopt a dovish stance
temporarily, pausing interest rate normalization and promoting
export competitiveness.”  Taiwan ’s dollar dropped 0.2 percent to NT$29.950 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. local time close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.980 yesterday,
the weakest level since Jan. 7.  “Europe’s debt crisis continues to drive market sentiment
and it has hit all major currencies in the region,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta.  The global economy will expand 4 percent this year and
next, the IMF said yesterday in its World Economic Outlook
report, compared with a June forecast of 4.3 percent for 2011
and 4.5 percent for 2012. Taiwan’s economy will grow 5.2 percent
this year and 5 percent in 2012, the Washington-based fund said.  Taiwan’s government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the 2
percent debt due July 2016 up three basis points to a two-week
high of 0.997 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  Central Bank  of  China  (Taiwan) will meet on Sept. 29 to
review the discount rate after raising it twice this year, by
12.5 basis points each time, to 1.875 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
