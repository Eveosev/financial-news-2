What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that adverse
weather in the past three months damaged U.S. crops,  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa,
said in a telephone interview today.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that export demand will increase after cash prices
at terminals near New Orleans dropped to a six-month low this
week, Roose said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open up
0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open 30 cents to 80 cents higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open down 1 cent to up 1 cent a bushel on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as traders weigh rising inventories against
concern that dry weather will damage harvests in the U.S.,
Ukraine, Argentina and Australia, Roose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
