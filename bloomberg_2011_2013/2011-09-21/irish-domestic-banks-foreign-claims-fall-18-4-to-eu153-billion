Claims by Irish domestic banks on
non-residents fell 18.4 percent to 153 billion euros at the end
of June, the Irish central bank said in a statement today.  The decline in the claims “represents domestic banks’
retrenchment from foreign markets,” the central bank said. The
largest proportion of existing claims are on U.K. private sector
residents, the Dublin-based bank said.  These consolidated banking statistics detail the claims of
the domestic banks on non residents by country and sector on an
ultimate risk basis, according to the bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
