Norway should look at buying up
Renewable Energy Corp. ASA and Borregaard as  Orkla ASA (ORK)  seeks to
sell its stakes in the companies, newspaper Klassekampen
reported, citing ruling coalition parliamentarians.  Industry and Trade Minister Trond Giske should look at the
companies to ensure a long-term investor that takes
responsibility for Norway, Alf Holmelid, the Socialist Left
lawmaker on the Business and Industry Committee, told the Oslo-
based newspaper.  Terje Aasland, the Labor Party chairman of the committee,
said the companies were “interesting,” while Center Party
representative Irene Lange Nordahl said state ownership
shouldn’t be ruled out if it ensures continued development of
the renewable  energy industry  in Norway, the newspaper said.  Web Link   To contact the reporter on this story:
