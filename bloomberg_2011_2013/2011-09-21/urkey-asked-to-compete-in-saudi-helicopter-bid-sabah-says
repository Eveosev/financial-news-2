Saudi Arabia ’s military asked
 Turkey  to enter a tender to produce attack helicopters for the
Saudi air force,  Sabah  newspaper reported.  Turkish officials are in negotiations with Saudi
counterparts regarding the Turkish-made Atak T-129 helicopters,
which made their first test flights last month and are expected
to go into mass production in the middle of next year, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said. Sabah didn’t say how it got the
information.  The helicopters are produced with parts and input from
Turkish companies including Aselsan Elektronik Sanayi & Ticaret
AS and are generating interest from Malaysia, Jordan and
Pakistan, Sabah said.  South Korea officially invited Turkey to join a tender in
April next year for 36 military helicopters, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
