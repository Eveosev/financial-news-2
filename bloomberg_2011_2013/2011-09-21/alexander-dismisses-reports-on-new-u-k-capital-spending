U.K. Chief Secretary to the
Treasury Danny Alexander said he does not recognize reports that
the government is planning 5 billion pounds of additional
 capital spending  to spur growth.  “I don’t recognize the numbers involved or the process as
described,” Alexander said in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s
“Today” show. “We’re not changing our spending plans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
