Weather conditions for winter crops
will be “good and satisfactory” in  Russia ’s European part and
“predominantly good” in West Siberia and Ural federal
district, the Federal Hydrometeorological Center said.  The conditions will be good for the rest of the month, the
center said on its website today. Soil moisture will be reduced
in certain areas of the Central and the Southern federal
districts, and satisfactory in the rest of Russia’s European
territory.  Harvesting conditions will be good in the Asian part of the
country. They are expected to be close to the norm in the so-
called Black-Earth zone, and worse than average in the
surrounding area until the end of the month, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
