The owners of  Florida â€™s  Sawgrass
Marriott Resort  won bankruptcy court approval to seek votes on a
reorganization plan that will give ownership of the resort to
secured lender Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Glenn in Jacksonville, Florida,
ruled yesterday that the second amended disclosure statement
explaining the proposal by RQB Resort LP provides enough
information for creditors to make an informed decision.  The plan would give the  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  unit
ownership of the resort, an unsecured deficiency claim for about
$63.8 million, and a secured claim of $132 million. Trade
suppliers with $190,000 in claims would recover about half of
that amount, court papers show.  Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in  Ponte Vedra
Beach , Florida, by RQB Resort and RQB Development.  A hearing on confirmation of the plan is scheduled for Oct.
18. RQB Resort sought Chapter 11 protection in March 2010
listing assets and debt of as much as $500 million each. RQB
Development also filed for court protection.  The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).  To contact the reporter on this story:
