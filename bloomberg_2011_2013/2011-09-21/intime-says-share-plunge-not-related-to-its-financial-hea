Intime Department Store Group Co.
said its financial health was good and it did not have a reason
to explain the stock’s biggest drop in almost three years in
 Hong Kong  trading today.  The Chinese retailer plunged 8 percent, the most since
December 2008, to HK$10.06 at the 4 p.m. close of trading in
Hong Kong. The shares earlier plummeted as much as 27 percent.  Intime, part owned by U.S. private-equity investor Warburg
Pincus LLC, expects same-store sales to increase 20 percent this
year, Chief Executive Officer Chen Xiaodong said today on a
conference call. He said he wasn’t aware of any reason for
today’s share price decline.  Sales growth at the operator of 23 department stores across
China would be “stable” in the next few years, Chen said.
Same-store sales rose more than 20 percent in July and August
and “we are confident to achieve growth of more than 20 percent
in September,” Chief Financial Officer Yuan Fei said on the
same call.  The company’s “fundamentals are very strong,” Yuan said.  Profit climbed 60 percent from a year earlier to 481
million yuan ($75 million) in the six months ended June,
according to an Aug. 30 filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Revenue increased 42 percent to 1.6 billion yuan.  Intime opened its first store in Hangzhou,  China , in 1998.  --Marco Lui,  Michael Wei . Editors:  Dave McCombs , Suresh Seshadri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
