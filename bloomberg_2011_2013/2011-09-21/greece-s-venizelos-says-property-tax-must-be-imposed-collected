Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said a property tax announced earlier this month to
raise revenue for the budget must be implemented.  “If we don’t impose and implement this measure and collect
the budgeted amount, we won’t meet the 2011 budget target and we
won’t be able to draft a budget for 2012,” Venizelos told
lawmakers in Parliament in  Athens  today.  “We must supplement measures that haven’t had the expected
returns to raise revenue of 54 billion euros,” he said. “We
must collect this levy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
