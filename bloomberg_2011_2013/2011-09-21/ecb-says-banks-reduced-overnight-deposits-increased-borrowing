The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions reduced the amount of cash they deposited
with it overnight.  Banks parked 114.7 billion euros ($157 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB on Sept. 20, down from 144.8 billion euros
the previous day. Euro-area banks borrowed 1.06 billion euros
from the ECB at the marginal rate of 2.25 percent, up from 1.04
billion euros the previous day. The ECB currently lends banks
unlimited liquidity in its refinancing operations at the
benchmark rate of 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
