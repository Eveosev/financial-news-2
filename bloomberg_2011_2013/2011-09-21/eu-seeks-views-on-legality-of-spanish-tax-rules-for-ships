The European Commission has invited
public comments on whether Spanish tax rules for ships are in
breach of the region’s state-aid rules.  The commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator in
Brussels, has “received complaints from both the European
shipbuilding and shipping industries about the so-called Spanish
tax lease system (STL), which has allegedly enabled shipping
companies to buy ships from Spanish shipyards at prices 20
percent to 30 percent cheaper than otherwise since 2002,” the
commission said in a statement published on its  website .  Interested parties have one month from today to submit
comments, the commission said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
