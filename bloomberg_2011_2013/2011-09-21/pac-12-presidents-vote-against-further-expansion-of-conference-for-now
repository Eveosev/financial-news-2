The  Pacific-12  conference won’t
expand further at this time, blocking the  Big 12 ’s  University of
Texas  and  University of Oklahoma  from heading west.  “After careful review, we have determined that it is in
the best interests of our member institutions, student-athletes
and fans to remain a 12-team conference,” Pac-12 Commissioner
Larry Scott said in a statement last night.  The vote by the conference’s school presidents and
chancellors came a day after the board of regents in Texas and
Oklahoma gave their school presidents permission to seek new
conference affiliations. The Pac-12 previously discussed adding
the Longhorns and Sooners, along with Oklahoma State and Texas
Tech, ESPN reported Sept. 4.  Utah and Colorado last year became the 11th and 12th
schools of the Pac-12, which in May announced a 12-year, $3
billion television contract with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN and  News
Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox network, the largest rights package for a college
sports league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
