Billings at U.S. architecture firms 
rose in Aug. according to the  American Institute of Architects .  Billings at architecture firms, tracked by the Work-on-the-Boards 
survey, rose to 51.4 in Aug. from 45.1 a month earlier. The inquiry index,
which tracks a firms capacity to take on additional work, rose to 56.9.
A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings while a reading below 
50 indicates a negative outlook.  Commercial building construction typically follows the billings
index by about six months. Following is a table compiled from the
