Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s biggest energy
company, had its long and short-term credit rating confirmed at
‘A-/A-2’ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s Rating
Services.  “We now asses the link between the Italian sovereign and
the Italian power incumbent as limited instead of strong,” the
rating agency said in a note published today.  The Italian government, which is Enel’s biggest shareholder
with 31 percent, had its rating cut by one level on Sept. 20 on
concern about its ability to cut debt. S&P had lowered Enel’s
credit outlook in May, citing the government stake.  “Expected improvement of Enel’s financial risk profile,
coupled with management actions to support its cash flow
generation potential, may be challenged by the potential
increase of the cost of funding,” S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
