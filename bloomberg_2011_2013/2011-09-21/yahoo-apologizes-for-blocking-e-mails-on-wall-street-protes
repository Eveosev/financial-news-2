Yahoo! Inc., operator of the most-
visited U.S. Web portal, apologized for blocking e-mails about
an anti-Wall Street protest that aims to occupy parts of lower
 Manhattan  for months.  “Unfortunately, the domain ‘ occupywallst.org ’ was being
caught by one of our spam filters when some users tried to send
messages containing it,” the Sunnyvale, California-based
 Internet company  said today in an e-mailed statement. “This was
a false positive which we corrected on Monday. However, there
was a residual delay (up to 24 hours) for users trying to send
e-mails with that phrase.”  Yahoo separately apologized for the incident in a  Twitter 
message yesterday.  The protest, dubbed “#OccupyWallStreet,” aims to get
President Barack Obama to establish a commission to end “the
influence money has over our representatives in  Washington ,”
according to the website of Adbusters, a group promoting the
demonstration. Participants have complained in online videos
that Internet messages are being hindered.  The  New York City Police Department  has arrested 20 people
since the protest began on Sept. 17, four of whom were arrested
today for disorderly conduct, impeding pedestrian traffic and
ignoring a lawful order to disperse, according to  Paul Browne , a
police spokesman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
