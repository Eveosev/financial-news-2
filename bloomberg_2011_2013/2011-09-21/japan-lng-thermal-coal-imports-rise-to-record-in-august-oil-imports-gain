Japan’s imports of liquefied
natural gas and thermal coal rose to a record in August because
of low utilization rates at nuclear  power plants .  The nation’s LNG imports climbed 18.2 percent from a year
earlier to 7.55 million metric tons, while thermal-coal imports
increased 7.1 percent to 10 million tons, according to data
released today by the Ministry of Finance.  The operating rate for nuclear power plants fell to 26.4
percent in August, the Federation of Electric Power Companies
announced last week. It was the lowest since the federation
started compiling data in April 1977. Power generation at
thermal plants rose 8.2 percent, while total electricity output
by utilities dropped 12.1 percent on lower temperatures and
efforts to conserve energy, according to the federation.  The country’s crude-oil imports rose 1.2 percent to 18.38
million kiloliters, the finance ministry data showed.  The following table shows  Japan ’s imports for August:  To contact the reporter on this story:
