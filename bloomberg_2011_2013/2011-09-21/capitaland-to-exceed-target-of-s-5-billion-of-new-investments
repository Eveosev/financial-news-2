CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) ,  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest developer, said it expects to exceed its target of S$5
billion to S$6 billion of new investments in 2011.  The company said in a slide presentation to the  Singapore 
exchange it will seek acquisitions when price expectations are
“moderated,” and it expects markets in Singapore and  China  to
stabilize as cooling measures by the two governments present
opportunities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
