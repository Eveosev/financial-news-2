Swiss banks including  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) ,  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  and Wegelin & Co. must hand
over new account data of U.S. clients to the American  Justice
Department  after the market closes in  New York  tomorrow,
Handelszeitung  reported , citing documents at banks.  The U.S. is demanding more information about the number of
clients who probably committed tax fraud or evaded taxes, how
many havenâ€™t signed a so-called W-9 form, the number of
customers who had U.S. equity in their portfolios and to which
extent clients used off-shore financing vehicles on the Virgin
Islands, the Zurich-based newspaper reported in a preview of an
article to be published tomorrow.  The banks will have to deliver a copy of the documents to
the Swiss State Secretariat for International Financial Matters
in Bern by 2 p.m. local time tomorrow, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
