Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011 against the dollar, climbed
the most in a week as overseas investors bought the African
nation’s Treasury bills at an auction today.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.2 percent to 2,785 per dollar at 3:23 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, after closing at 2,790 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank today auctioned 90 billion shillings of
three-, six- and 12-month bills today. Three-month borrowing
surged to 17.055 percent at the previous auction on Sept. 7, the
highest since at least March 2005. Results of today’s auction
will be released later today.  “The shilling has appreciated today because offshore
inflows of the dollar for the Treasury-bill auction,” Lucas
Ochieng, the head of  currency trading  at Orient Bank Ltd. said
by phone from Kampala. “There was anticipation today that
offshore players were participating in the market.”  The shilling remains under pressure and should depreciate
in the week ahead as companies will seek the dollar for their
greenback-based end-of-month spending, he said.  The Ugandan shilling reached 2,830 a dollar on Aug. 26, the
weakest since 1993, and has declined 17 percent this year
against the dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing
currency during the period.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
