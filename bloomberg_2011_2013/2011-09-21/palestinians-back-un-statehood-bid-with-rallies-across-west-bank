Palestinians took to the streets in
cities across the West Bank with rallies to support their
campaign for statehood at the  United Nations .  Thousands poured into Ramallahâ€™s Manara Square today for
music, folk dances and speeches celebrating the effort to become
a member of the UN. Parades and demonstrations also took place
in Nablus, Bethlehem, Hebron and other points throughout the
territory.  The UN General Assembly opens its annual meeting later
today in  New York . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas
will speak on Sept. 23, followed by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.  U.S. and European diplomats have been trying to persuade
Abbas to postpone the membership bid and resume peace
negotiations with Israel. The Palestinian leader has refused and
said he will submit a formal application to UN Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon after his speech.  Jewish settlers held demonstrations in several points
across the  West Bank  yesterday opposing Palestinian statehood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
