Cement consumption in  Cameroon  may
climb to as much as 8 million metric tons a year by 2013, from
about 2.5 million tons now, Cameroon Radio and Television said.  Demand for the building material will increase as the West
African nation invests in energy and transport infrastructure,
the state-owned broadcaster said, citing Badel Ndanga Ndinga,
minister of industry, mines and technological development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
