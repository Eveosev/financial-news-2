Travelport LLC, the travel-
reservation systems provider owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , will
pay lenders as much as 13.5 percentage points more than
benchmark rates to refinance debt.  Travelport is seeking to exchange $287.5 million into a
term loan B, due in 2016, that would pay 13.5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, the  Atlanta-based
company said in a Sept. 19 lender presentation filed with the
 Securities & Exchange Commission .  The company is seeking to refinance $715 million of
payment-in-kind, or PIK notes, with new debt and will pay down
$85 million.  The company also wants to convert $207.5 million of PIK
debt due 2012 into a second-lien facility that matures in 2016,
it said. Travelport is also seeking a $135 million  term loan  A
portion maturing in September 2012, which if not repaid in one
year would convert into a second-lien slice due in 2016.  This debt would pay six percentage points more than Libor,
according to the filing.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the restructuring,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Lenders must
let the bank know by Sept. 23 if they will participate in the
deal, said the person, who declined to be identified because the
transaction is private.  Bonds Fall  The company’s 11.875 percent bonds due 2016 fell 2.5 cents
on the dollar to 52 cents at 2:24 p.m. yesterday in  New York ,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  A revolving line of credit will be extended from 2012 to
2014, and pricing on the facility will increase to 4.5
percentage points more than Libor, according to the company.  Consenting lenders to the term loan and revolver will each
receive a fee of 400 basis points, the company said.  The amendment allows for total leverage, or debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
to increase to eight times and first-lien leverage to cap at
four times.  Ryan Toohey, a spokesman for Travelport, declined to
comment. Blackstone purchased Travelport from travel-services
company Cendant Corp. in June 2006 for $4.3 billion.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . A term loan A is sold mainly to banks. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
