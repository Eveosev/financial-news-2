New Yorkers are almost evenly split
over natural-gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale formation that
lies under the state, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  About 45 percent favor drilling because of economic
benefits and 41 percent oppose it because of environmental
risks, according to the survey of 1,016 registered voters
released today. The survey was conducted from Sept. 13 to 18 and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent, the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute said in a statement.
About 13 percent said they didn’t know or didn’t answer.  The strongest opposition to drilling, 47 percent, was in
upstate  New York , where drilling would take place, according to
the Hamden, Connecticut-based institute. An estimated 84
trillion cubic feet of gas lie in the Marcellus Shale under New
York and seven other states, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said on
Aug. 23. Extraction requires injecting a mixture of water, sand
and chemicals underground, known as hydraulic fracturing.  “Upstate voters, who have the most to gain in terms of
jobs and the most to lose in terms of the environment, opposed
natural-gas drilling, while suburban voters support it,”
 Maurice Carroll , director of the institute, said in the
statement.  The New York Department of Environmental Conservation said
on  Sept. 7  it will issue draft rules for high-volume hydraulic
fracturing in early October, potentially ending a state
moratorium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
