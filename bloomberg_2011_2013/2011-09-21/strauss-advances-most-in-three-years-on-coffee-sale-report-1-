Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS)  rose the most in
almost three years after TheMarker said Israel’s second-largest
food producer is in talks to sell its overseas coffee activities
to  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  Strauss denied the report.  The shares jumped 7.5 percent, the biggest gain since
December 2008, to 45.90 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv.  “There is currently no contact between Strauss and Sara
Lee regarding either a sale or acquisition of businesses,”
Strauss said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
