Kenya ’s central bank sold dollars
for the third time this month in the domestic foreign-exchange
market as the shilling weakened to the lowest in 17 years
against the U.S. currency, traders at African Banking Corp. and
Commercial Bank of  Africa  Ltd. said.  “The central bank was in the forex market selling dollars
which temporarily supported the shilling,” John Muli, a dealer
at Nairobi-based African Banking, said in a phone interview
today. Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial
Bank of Africa, said the central bank sold dollars.  Central bank officials declined to comment when called by
Bloomberg.  The Kenyan shilling fell 0.5 percent to 96.75 per dollar as
of 6:35 p.m. in Nairobi. Earlier it gained as much as 0.5
percent to 95.85 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
