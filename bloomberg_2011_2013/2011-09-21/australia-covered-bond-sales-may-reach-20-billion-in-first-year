Australian banks may sell as much
as A$20 billion ($20.1 billion) of covered bonds next year,
according to  Paul White , global head of debt syndicate at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   Offerings denominated in U.S. dollars may account for up to
half of the issuance, White told Bloomberg News at the Australia
and New Zealand Debt Capital Markets Investor Forum organized by
Euromoney Conferences in New York.  Treasurer Wayne Swan introduced legislation in parliament
on Sept. 15 to allow Australian banks and authorized deposit-
taking institutions to sell the debt for the first time. The
measure will likely be approved before the end of this year,
White said. Covered bonds, which typically have the highest
 credit rating , are backed by assets that stay on the bank’s
balance sheet and can be sold in a default.  “We would expect covered bond issuance from the major
banks and ADIs, and the U.S. dollar market will be an attractive
offshore currency for issuance with about 50 percent of the
total achievable,” White said.  The legislation authorizing Australian lenders to issue
covered bonds may lead to A$130 billion of sales “in coming
years,” Swan said in a speech to parliament upon introducing
the measure, according to a transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
