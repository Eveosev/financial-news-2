Mauritius’s central bank will
probably keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its next
meeting on Dec. 5, l’Express said, citing a survey by
PluriConseil Ltd.  Out of 30 analysts surveyed, 24 said they expect no change
in the rate, the Port Louis-based newspaper reported.  The Bank of Mauritius’s monetary policy committee left the
interest rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
