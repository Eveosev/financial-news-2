Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) , the
maker of West and Davidoff cigarettes, forecast higher full-year
sales, led by growth in eastern Europe and  Asia .  Net revenue from tobacco will probably increase 2 percent
excluding currency shifts in the 12 months through September,
the Bristol, England-based company said today in a statement.
That matched the median of three estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Results will be “in line” with the company’s
expectations, the Davidoff maker said.  Imperial Tobacco is looking to emerging markets such as
eastern Europe to offset declining consumption in Spain and
 North America . The company said in July that lower cigarette
prices in Spain would cut operating profit this year by as much
as 70 million pounds ($110 million), below a previous forecast
of 100 million pounds.  The total volume of tobacco sold by the producer will
probably decrease 2 percent in the 12 month period,  Europe ’s
second-biggest tobacco company said. Imperial Tobacco is
scheduled to report full-year results on Nov 1.  Imperial Tobacco said recent price increases in Spain will
help business in that market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
