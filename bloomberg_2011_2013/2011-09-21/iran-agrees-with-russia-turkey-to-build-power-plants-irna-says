Iran  reached agreements with  Russia 
and Turkey on sharing know-how and investment in power plants
inside the Persian Gulf country, the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency  reported, citing Energy Minister Majid Namjou.  Power stations to be built with Turkish companies will
allow the transfer of electricity to neighboring Turkey or to a
third country, Namjou said, according to the IRNA report.  Iran and Russia agreed in separate talks earlier this month
to jointly build power plants in Iran for export, Namjou said,
without giving details of the projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
