Hong Kong’s rising  home prices 
continued to “erode” housing affordability, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority said in its half-yearly report today.  A ratio measuring mortgage payment for a 50 square-meter
apartment to household median income compiled by the HKMA rose
to 53 percent in June from 51 percent at the end of 2010, the
report said.  Home prices in the city have risen more than 70 percent
since early 2009 on low  mortgage rates , the lack of new housing
supply and an influx of buyers from other parts of  China . The
government has imposed measures including raising the minimum
down-payment requirement for some mortgages and accelerating
public land sales to quell public outcry over inflating real
estate value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
