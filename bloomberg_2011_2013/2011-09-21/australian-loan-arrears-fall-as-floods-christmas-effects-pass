Australian home-loan delinquencies
fell in the second quarter as borrowers adjusted to the effects
of higher  interest rates , natural disasters and increased
spending at Christmas, Fitch Ratings said.  Mortgages more than 30 days overdue fell to 1.69 percent in
June from a record 1.79 percent in March, according to the
London-based ratings firm’s Australian residential mortgage
performance index. Loans more than 60 days late fell to 0.31
percent from 0.34 percent in March.  “The decision by the  Reserve Bank  of Australia to leave
the current level of cash rates at 4.75 percent over the last
nine months has contributed to the stabilization of arrears,”
James Zanesi, associate director for structured finance at
Fitch, wrote in the statement. “Mortgage performance is
expected to stabilize in the third quarter as the effect of
Christmas spending continues to pass through and borrowers
affected by natural disasters in the first quarter receive
financial support.”  Australian  consumer confidence  rebounded in September from
a two-year low as the central bank indicated it will keep rates
on hold to gauge fallout from  Europe ’s debt crisis. The nation’s
gross domestic product expanded 1.2 percent last quarter, the
fastest pace in four years, driven by a recovery from natural
disasters in the nation’s northeast at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
