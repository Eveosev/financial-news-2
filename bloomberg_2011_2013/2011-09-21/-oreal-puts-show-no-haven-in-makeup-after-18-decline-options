L’Oreal SA (OR)  options traders are the
most bearish in at least three years, convinced valuations for
the world’s largest maker of cosmetics are too high even after
9.57 billion euros ($13 billion) was erased from its value.  Three-month puts that pay should the stock fall 10 percent
cost 38 percent more than calls to buy, the widest gap since at
least 2008 and the third-biggest among Euro Stoxx 50 Index
companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While the stock has
dropped 18 percent since this year’s peak on July 7 after profit
missed analyst forecasts, it’s trading at 16.1 times estimated
2012 income, exceeding all but three companies in the gauge.  Traders are betting L’Oreal’s earnings will suffer as its
makeup business proves less insulated from slowing global growth
than investors anticipate, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a note
to clients. The Paris-based company said Aug. 30 that operating
earnings as a percentage of revenue narrowed to 16.8 percent
during the first half of 2011 from 17.3 percent a year earlier
as it spent more on research and advertising.  “Their product is somewhat discretionary and very
expensive,”  Uri Landesman , who helps oversee $1 billion as
managing general partner of New York-based hedge fund Platinum
Partners LLP, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “To the
extent that there’s real trouble or a chance of a second
recession, it wouldn’t be very good for L’Oreal.”  Worst Since 2009  L’Oreal dropped 9.8 percent in August, its biggest monthly
decline since January 2009, as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
tumbled the most since October 2008 amid concern the region’s
debt crisis would spread and lead to a recession. The company
said on Aug. 30 that operating profit was 1.7 billion euros in
the first half of the year, missing the median analyst estimate
of 1.78 billion euros. Profitability narrowed at every division
except luxury products.  Aurelie Gasnier, a L’Oreal spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the options trading.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , a gauge of Euro Stoxx 50 options prices,
rose 8.3 percent to 47.78 today. It jumped 29 percent last month
and surged to 53.55, its highest level since January 2009, on
Sept. 12. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index,
which tracks equity derivatives in the U.S., gained 11 percent
to 41.35. It advanced 14 percent yesterday after the  Federal
Reserve  announced plans to buy $400 billion of long-term debt in
an effort to combat “significant downside risks” to the
economy.  European confidence in the region’s economic outlook
plunged the most since December 2008 last month, with an index
of executive and consumer sentiment in the  euro zone  falling to
98.3 from 103 in July, the European Commission said Aug. 30.  Economic Forecasts  Gross domestic product in the euro area will expand 1.7
percent this year, less than last year’s 1.8 percent growth,
according to the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast this
week for global growth and predicted “severe” repercussions if
Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers
deadlock over a fiscal plan.  “We’re seeing fears of Europe heading back into a
recession,” Julian Chillingworth, who helps manage 16 billion
pounds ($25 billion) at Rathbone Brothers Plc in  London , said in
a Sept. 19 telephone interview. “People may well rein back on
general spending as  consumer confidence  suffers.”  The maker of Maybelline, Kiehl’s lip balm and Garnier
deodorant has expanded outside its home continent, cutting
Western Europe to 37 percent of total sales in 2010 from 47
percent in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Not Very Good’  “The consumer spending figures in Western  Europe  in July
were not very good,” L’Oreal Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul
Agon said during an Aug. 31 conference call with analysts. “The
world cosmetics market should record second-half growth close to
that observed in the first half, and we also confirm our goal of
outperforming the market and continuing to strengthen our
positions.”  The company’s December 2012 60 euro puts and December 2011
60 euro puts had the biggest increase in ownership in the past
two weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The December
72 euro puts had the biggest open interest among all L’Oreal
options, accounting for 8.8 percent of the 52,167 outstanding
contracts.  “Unluckily for L’Oreal, it’s a French company,” Herbert Perus, head of global equities at Raiffeisen Capital Management,
said in a phone interview from Vienna yesterday. He helps
oversee about $36 billion including L’Oreal shares. “There’s a
fear about the meltdown of the European stock market because of
this debt crisis. When people are selling Europe, they’re
selling L’Oreal as well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
