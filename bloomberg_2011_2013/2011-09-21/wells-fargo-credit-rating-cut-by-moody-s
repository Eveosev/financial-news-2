Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, had its credit ratings cut by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited “a decrease in the probability that the
U.S. government would support the bank, if needed.”  Moody’s downgraded the long-term ratings of the holding
company’s senior debt to A2 from A1, according to a statement
today. The outlook remains negative on the senior long-term
ratings, indicating another cut may be ahead for the San
Francisco-based lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
