South Africa ’s new tax law won’t
protect the confidentiality of communications between tax
advisers and their clients, South African Revenue Service
Commissioner Oupa Magashula said.  Separate legislation aimed at regulating tax practitioners
must address the confidentiality of tax advice given by non-
lawyers, Magashula told lawmakers in Cape Town during hearings
on a Tax Administration Bill that the revenue service proposed
to simplify and clarify administrative tax procedures.  South African common law protects the confidentiality of
communications between qualified lawyers and their clients,
including tax advice. Accountants’ bodies asked the South
African Revenue Service to extend this privilege to other tax
practitioners, including chartered accountants.  “You cannot give tax practitioners who are not lawyers,
who are not regulated by law, this legal privilege,” Magashula
said. “To give them professional privilege would really be to
promote rogue business dealings in our country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
