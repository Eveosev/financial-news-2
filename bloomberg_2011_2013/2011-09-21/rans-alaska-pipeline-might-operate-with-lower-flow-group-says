The Trans Alaska Pipeline System,
which carries oil from  Prudhoe Bay  to the port of Valdez, can
operate for at least another 30 years without opening new
petroleum fields, an environmental group said.  Spending $539 million to $721 million for heaters,
insulation and anti-corrosion chemicals may let the 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) pipeline run with a daily flow as low as
150,000 barrels of crude oil, according to a report released
today by the  Natural Resources Defense Council .  Alaska Governor Sean Parnell set a target of increasing the
stream in the pipeline, run by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., to
1 million barrels a day over 10 years from about 570,000 barrels
in recent months. State and U.S. officials are seeking to add
land for exploration and boost drilling.  Concern that waning production might prompt an early
shutdown of the line is “clearly incorrect,” the New York-
based environmental organization said in its analysis. “With a
minimum level of additional investment,” the pipeline “can
continue to serve the currently producing fields.”  The  House Natural Resources Committee  is holding a hearing
today to examine opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil exploration. Parnell, a Republican, is scheduled to testify.  BP Plc (BP/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  combined own
96 percent of Anchorage, Alaska-based Alyeska.  To contact the reporter on this story:
