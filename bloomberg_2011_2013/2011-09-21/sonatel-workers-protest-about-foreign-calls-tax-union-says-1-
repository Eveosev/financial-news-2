Workers at  Sonatel (SNTS)  SA, the
Senegalese telecommunications company part owned by  France
Telecom SA (FTE) , began weekly demonstrations today to protest a tax
on international calls that will cut the company’s revenue.  Some workers at the Dakar-based company will leave their
posts to join the demonstration, which will be repeated every
Wednesday, Mamadou Aidara Diop, secretary general of the Sonatel
Workers’ Union, said in an interview today.  The tax, which took effect on Sept. 1, adds a 49.2 CFA
franc ($0.10) surcharge to all incoming international calls to
mobile phones in the West African nation. The tax is likely to
cause a 10 percent fall in revenue at Sonatel, the largest
company by market value listed on the regional bourse in
Abidjan,  Ivory Coast , Diop said on Sept. 2.  Sonatel is 42 percent owned by France Telecom and 27
percent by Senegal’s government. The stock fell 2.4 percent to
120,000 CFA francs in Abidjan today, bringing its decline since
the tax came into effect to 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
