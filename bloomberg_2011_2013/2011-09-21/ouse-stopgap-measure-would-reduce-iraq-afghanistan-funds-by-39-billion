     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) --The U.S. House is considering a
stopgap measure to fund the beginning of fiscal year 2012 that
would reduce the budget for the wars in Afghanistan and  Iraq  by
$39 billion.  Congress is running out of time to approve annual spending
bills for the government, including the Pentagon, for fiscal
2012, which begins Oct. 1.  To avoid a federal shutdown, the House has prepared a
stopgap measure to carry the government through Nov. 18. The
measure would fund the Pentagon at 1.5 percent below this year’s
budget, about $7.5 billion less, including military construction
funds.  The House failed in its first attempt to pass the stopgap
measure today because of a dispute over disaster relief aid to
victims of  Hurricane Irene  and other calamities.  The Defense Department received $532 billion in 2011, which
reflects the base budget, military construction and nuclear
stockpile maintenance. The Pentagon base budget, without
military construction and the nuclear programs, is $513 billion
for fiscal 2011.  The Pentagon wouldn’t continue to receive $158 billion it
got last year for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where U.S.
forces are being reduced. Instead, the measure allows for $119
billion, the amount approved by the House in its version of the
2012 defense appropriations bill.  “The biggest surprise is the immediate contraction” from
overseas contingency funds, said Jim McAleese of McAleese and
Associates, a consulting firm in  Virginia .  This will have an unanticipated impact on the defense
industry, he said.  “Much of the industry had anticipated that the Defense
Department would continue to spend $13 billion per month to
support the two wars,” McAleese said. “The bill contracts that
down to $10 billion a month, which is a cut of 25 percent. This
will directly translate into their revenues and earnings per
share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
