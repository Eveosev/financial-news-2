Colombia ’s peso dropped to its
lowest level in almost six months as concern global growth is
slowing hurt appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The peso plunged 0.8 percent to 1,874 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:44 p.m. New York time, from 1,860 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,889.90, its weakest intraday level since March 29.  “There’s a lot of distrust on what policy makers can do to
improve things,” said Po Jeng, a currency analyst at Interbolsa
SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage. “Until now measures taken by
the  Federal Reserve  don’t seem to have worked.”  The Fed today announced plans to buy $400 billion of long-
term debt and said there are “significant downside risks” to
the economic outlook.  RBC Capital Markets  said in a report today it got out of
bets placed in June that the Colombian peso would strengthen
towards 1,680, after the currency weakened beyond 1,850.  Emerging-market currencies including the Colombian peso,
the Chilean peso and the Czech koruna had been “resilient to
building external stresses” as they were perceived as “safer
haven currencies,” RBC wrote in the report.  Debt Swap  “This has changed most recently, likely reflecting
accelerated profit-taking of these positions to cover for losses
elsewhere,” RBC wrote. “We still like the Colombian peso from
a medium/long-term perspective, but would wait until global
sentiment stabilizes” before betting on gains in the peso
against the U.S. dollar.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.48 percent.
The bond’s price fell 1.209 centavos to 120.296 centavos per
peso.  The Finance Ministry yesterday repurchased 6.4 trillion
pesos ($3.4 billion) of peso bonds, known as TES, and in return
offered securities due October 2015, October 2018 and a new 7.5
percent bond due August 2026.  Colombia will auction 18.6 trillion pesos of TES next year,
1.4 trillion pesos less than initially planned, after the debt
swap reduced financing needs, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told reporters yesterday in Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
