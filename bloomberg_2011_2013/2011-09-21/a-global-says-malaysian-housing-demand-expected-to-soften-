TA Global Bhd. (TAGB) , a Malaysian
property and hotel group, said domestic housing demand is
expected to “soften” this financial year and global volatility
may hurt revenue growth at its hotel operations.  The company is confident of sales at its ongoing domestic
projects as the current low interest rate environment is
expected to spur sales, it said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
