Serbia should work to cut the
government’s spending gap, boost output and fix the dinar to the
euro to stabilize it before discussing whether it joins the euro
region once it becomes a European Union member, said  Robert
Mundell , a Nobel-prize winning economist.  The Balkan country should keep current monetary policies of
targeting inflation and allowing the national currency to trade
freely for now, he said today at Belgrade conference.  In the longer term, it should “increase productivity,
balance the budget and then try some kind of a currency board
system,” Mundell said. “Right now, the  exchange rate  is
depreciating and you can’t fix it,” he said.  Serbia is working to become an official EU candidate by the
end of 2011 and win a date for the start of entry talks. Having
a currency peg before taking the step to enter the euro region
would give  Serbia  time to decide what is best for the economy.  “If you don’t like it, don’t join it,” he said.  Mundell said Serbia should not rely on Eurobond issues for
deficit financing. “You might want to do that and it will be a
measure of your  credit rating ,” he said, commenting on today’s
reports that Serbia plans to sell 10-year bonds in dollars.  Instead, a small, open economy should rely on investments
for growth, with the government making sure that public debt-to-
gross domestic product ratio stays below 40 percent at all
times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
