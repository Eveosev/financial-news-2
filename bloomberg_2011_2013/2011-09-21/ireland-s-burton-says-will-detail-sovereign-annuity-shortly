Ireland’s Social Protection
Minister  Joan Burton  said her ministry  will “very shortly”
detail findings on  sovereign annuity. At a conference in Dublin
today, she said that her ministry had done a “lot of work” on
the issue.  So-called defined benefit pension plans guarantee their
payments by buying annuities that typically invest in top-rated
German bunds, which trade more frequently than their Irish
counterparts. Irish pension funds  want the government to let
them switch to annuities that can buy lower-rated local
securities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
