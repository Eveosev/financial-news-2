South African retail sales growth
accelerated to 2.8 percent in July as  interest rates  at a 30-
year low helped to support  consumer spending  in  Africa ’s biggest
economy.  Sales advanced from a revised 2.4 percent in June,
Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa , which used a new sample
for the data, said on its website today. The median estimate of
16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth to slow to 2
percent. Sales increased a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent in
the month.  “We’re not expecting any major declines in the near
future,” Gina Schoeman, an economist with Absa Bank Ltd. in
Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview before the data was
released.  The central bank will probably keep its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent tomorrow,
according to 18 out of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Inflation was unchanged at 5.3 percent in August, while economic
growth slowed to a two-year low of 1.3 percent in the second
quarter, according to the statistics agency.  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) , Africa’s biggest retailer, plans to
accelerate its store expansion this year, adding 106 outlets in
the 12 months ending June 2012, the Cape Town-based company said
on Aug. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
