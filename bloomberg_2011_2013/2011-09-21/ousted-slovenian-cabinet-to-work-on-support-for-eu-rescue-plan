Slovenia’s government, which was
toppled in a confidence vote yesterday, will continue to work on
building support to approve the European Union’s rescue fund,
the  Finance Ministry  said.  A rejection of the European Financial Stability Facility
would be “counterproductive” and harm the credibility of the
Alpine nation, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
