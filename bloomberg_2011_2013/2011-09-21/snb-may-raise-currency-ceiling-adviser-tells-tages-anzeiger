Ernst Baltensperger, an adviser to
the Swiss central bank, said that he considers it possible that
policy makers will soon increase the franc ceiling versus the
euro to 1.25, Tages-Anzeiger reported, citing an interview.  “I don’t know any expert who doesn’t consider the franc
still overvalued at 1.20 based on fundamental factors,”
Baltensperger told the newspaper in the  interview  published
today. “As long as one defines the lower limit at 1.20, the
risk for the central bank is comparatively limited but all
fundamental data are pointing toward a range of between 1.30 and
1.40.”  He also said that while the currency ceiling poses “a high
risk,” it would have been “more risky not to do anything.”
The  Swiss National Bank  is able to defend its cap “for as long
as it wants,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
