CBD Energy Ltd. (CBD) , an Australian
developer of renewable energy, and its partners acquired a
planned 100-megawatt wind-power project in New South Wales state
from the U.K.’s RES Group.  The Taralga wind farm in the Southern Highlands has
government approval for 61 turbines, Sydney-listed CBD Energy
said today in an e-mailed statement. Financial details of the
agreement weren’t disclosed.  CBD is a partner with China Datang Renewable Power Co. and
Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co. in AusChina Energy Group,
which bought the right to build the wind farm, including the
land needed for the project. The joint venture plans to develop
A$6 billion ($6.3 billion) of renewable-energy projects over the
next eight years.  Construction of the Taralga wind farm may start this year,
with completion due in 2013, CBD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
