Capacity constrains at  London ’s
Heathrow airport,  Europe ’s busiest hub, may be costing the U.K.
economy as much as 1.2 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) a year in
lost trade, according to a report commissioned by its owners.  The U.K. is missing out on trade opportunities with
emerging market economies as the airport does not have the
capacity to accommodate sufficient direct flights, according to
the report by Frontier Economics. Should Heathrow fail to expand
it will likely fall behind  Frankfurt  airport and Paris’ Charles
de Gaulle by 2021, the authors said.  “The center of gravity in the world economy is shifting
and Britain should be forging new links with emerging markets,”
Colin Matthews, chief executive officer of Heathrow’s owner BAA
Ltd., said in a statement. “Instead we are edging towards a
future as an island cut-off from some of the world’s most
important markets.”  Local companies trade 20 times as much with emerging market
countries that have a direct flight to the U.K. as with those
that don’t, the report found. Paris and Frankfurt have 1,000
more annual flights to  China ’s three largest cities than
Heathrow, according to the document, which seeks to show how a
hub airport contributes to economic growth.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  canceled plans for a
third runway at Heathrow following his election in May last
year. The government is seeking responses to its proposed
“sustainable framework for U.K. aviation” this month.  BAA is owned by  Spain ’s  Ferrovial SA. (FER)   To contact the reporter on this story:
