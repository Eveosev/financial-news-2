European Union and European Central Bank officials are pressing
Greece on budget cuts now because they have maximum leverage,
 Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  analysts said in a research note.  Greece doesn’t have a bond maturing until December and
euro-area governments have yet to ratify a July 21 agreement
that includes a second bailout for the country and an overhaul
of the region’s rescue fund.  “This is possibly the last opportunity to press in the
direction of structural changes and spending cuts because the
full implementation of the July 21 decisions will decisively
increase the level of co-dependence between the euro area and
Greece,” said Piraeus Bank analysts, led by Ilias Lekkos, the
chief economist.  While there is always a rise in friction between Greece and
the so-called troika before the release of each aid installment,
“this time the differences are particularly pronounced as the
troika appears determined to impose significant spending costs
and, as a result, a substantial reduction in the size of the
state,” Piraeus said.  The troika deemed additional measures announced by  Greece 
on Sept.11, including a new special property tax and a cut in
salary for all elected officials, as “inadequate” leading the
government to seek further permanent measures, according to the
note.  Without additional cuts, Greece’s budget deficit in 2011
would be as much as 9 percent of gross domestic product compared
with the 7.5 percent target.  Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who’s negotiating a
second financing package with the EU and IMF, has said the
contraction of Greece’s economy will be 5.5 percent this year.
He has pledged that the government will accelerate further
austerity measures to ensure continued support after EU
officials said payment of a sixth tranche of bailout loans will
be withheld unless Greece meets its deficit targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
