Sowing of winter wheat in Ukraine
was delayed by dryness that caused average soil humidity to drop
to the lowest level since 2000 for this month, increasing crop
risks, the national weather center said.  Soil humidity is at a record low for September in the
Zhytomyr, Rivne and Volyn regions, Tetiana Adamenko, head of the
agrometeorology department at the Kiev-based Hydrometeorology
Center, said in a phone interview today. Less than half of
planned wheat seeding took place in those areas, where the
optimal planting period to allow sufficient crop development for
winter ended yesterday, she said.  Farmers sowed 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) with
winter wheat as of Sept. 19, Liza Malyshko, a grain analyst at
researcher UkrAgroConsult, said by phone today. That compares
with 2.17 million hectares on the same date last year.  A lack of precipitation was the main reason for seeding
delays, Malyshko said. Rain is unlikely to fall anywhere in
Ukraine until Oct. 5 at the earliest, the centerâ€™s Adamenko
said.  Winter rapeseed that was planted in August also suffered
from a lack of soil moisture, according to Adamenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
