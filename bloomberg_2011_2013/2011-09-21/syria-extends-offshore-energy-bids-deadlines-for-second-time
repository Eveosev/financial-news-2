Syria  extended for the second time
the deadline for companies to qualify to bid for three offshore
oil exploration contracts to Nov. 15, according to a statement
on the  Oil Ministry  website.  The deadline for companies to bid for the licenses was also
extended until Dec. 13, according to the statement signed by Oil
Minister Sufian Alao.  The bidding round to explore and develop three offshore
blocks in Syriaâ€™s territorial waters was first announced on
March 24. The deadline for submitting bids was initially set for
Oct. 5. The Oil Ministry in July extended the deadline to submit
qualifications to Sept. 15 from Aug. 1.  Syria has witnessed violent unrest since pro-reform
protests erupted in the  Middle East  and North Africa earlier
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
