Returns for capesize ships that
haul  iron ore  and coal advanced for a second session, as steel
demand from Japan and congestion at ports in  China  and Brazil
bolstered rates.  Daily rents increased 3.3 percent to $25,087, according to
the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based provider of freight costs on
29 dry-bulk routes. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of
commodity shipping costs, gained 0.9 percent to 1,811.  “There is congestion for iron-ore ships discharging into
China and loading at ports in Brazil, and this is taking ships
out of circulation,” said Philippe van den Abeele, the managing
director of Castalia Fund Management (U.K.) Ltd., a London-based
adviser to a hedge fund trading shipping derivatives.  Demand for steel from  Japan  was a “driving force in the
dry bulk market”, Erik Stavseth, an analyst with Oslo-based
investment bank Arctic Securities ASA, wrote in an e-mailed
report today. Iron ore is a raw material used in steel
production.  Earnings are rebounding since they fell 20 percent in the
three sessions after they reached $28,826 on Sept. 14, the
highest level for 2011. Three vessels were hired to carry iron
ore from  Australia  to China at rates of $10.30 to $10.60 a
metric ton, compared with $10.25 to $10.30 a ton reported
yesterday,  Omar Nokta , an analyst with New York-based investment
bank Dahlman Rose & Co., said in an e-mailed report.  Capesizes are the largest vessels tracked by the index.
Daily hire costs for panamaxes, the biggest ships that can
navigate the Panama Canal, fell 2.4 percent to $13,345 today,
according to the exchange. Supramaxes, which carry about 25
percent less, gained 0.4 percent to $15,294 and handysizes, the
smallest ships tracked by the index, rose 0.2 percent to
$10,116.  To contact the reporter on this story:
