Japanese utilities surrendered 57
million metric tons of emission permits and offsets governed by
the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in the year to March, said the
Federation of Electric Power Companies of  Japan .  The purchased and then surrendered units enabled power
generators to effectively reduce their emissions in the year by
15 percent to 317 million tons of carbon dioxide, the industry
association said in a  report  published yesterday on its website.
The report didn’t disclose the portion of Certified Emission
Reductions, Emission Reduction Units or Assigned Amount Units
bought. FEPC includes Japan’s 10 main utilities.  Those three types of credits and allowances can be used by
Japan to comply with its target under the protocol, which is for
a 6 percent reduction from 1990 levels in the five years through
2012. There are 37 developed nations with targets.  Mitsuharu Kawabata, a spokesman for the federation,
declined to comment on the outlook for emissions cuts. “We want
to work hard toward the current goal we have,” he said today by
phone.  Japan had 6.085 billion tons of AAUs as of the end of 2010,
according to  data published  on the website of the United Nations
Framework Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn. That’s compared
with 6.026 billion tons at the end of 2009, indicating the
country added 59 million tons last year.  The nation had 102.9 million tons of CERs, compared with
82.7 million a year earlier, indicating it’s buying about three
AAUs for each CER. Japan had 2.4 million tons of ERUs at the end
of last year, compared with 673,635 tons in 2009, the data show.  Free to Swap  Emitters are free to swap CER credits for cheaper AAUs as
the earthquake-stricken country meets mounting costs for
complying with the protocol, an official of the nation’s
government said in June.  There’s nothing to stop Japanese companies selling CERs
they’ve already bought and buying AAUs, said Toshiaki Nagata, a
deputy director in the  Kyoto Protocol  office of the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry. “It could be a viable thing to do
in terms of cost efficiency,” he said.  AAUs, CERs and ERUs are all measured in metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
