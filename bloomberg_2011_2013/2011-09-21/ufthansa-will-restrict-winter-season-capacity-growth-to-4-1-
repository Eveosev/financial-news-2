Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest airline, will pare capacity growth in the winter
season by 2 percentage points to 4 percent because of lower-
than-expected reservations.  The carrier said that bookings for the winter timetable,
which starts on Oct. 29, have been hurt by the economy. It’s the
second time the Cologne, Germany-based company has lowered the
winter capacity figure this year.  “The weak August, poor economic climate and weak advance
bookings have all contributed,” Lufthansa spokeswoman Stefanie Stotz said by telephone.  Lufthansa scaled back planned seating growth for the winter
to 6 percent from 12 percent  in July , including its namesake
brand, British Midland and Austrian Airlines. The company said
yesterday that full-year operating profit will fall short of
last year’s 876 million euros ($1.2 billion).  Lufthansa shares fell 5 percent to 9.80 euros in Frankfurt
trading, the biggest drop since Aug. 18, giving the company a
market value of 4.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
