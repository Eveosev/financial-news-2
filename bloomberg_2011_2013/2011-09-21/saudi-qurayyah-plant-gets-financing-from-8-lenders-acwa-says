     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) --Saudi Arabia’s $2.85 billion
Qurayyah power plant will receive financing from four
international banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc and  Standard
Chartered , and four local banks.   Seventy-seven percent of the total cost of the project will
be funded through dollar and riyal debt, Acwa Power
International, a member of the group building the plant, said in
an e-mailed statement today. The dollar facilities 
will include tranches funded or covered by three export credit
agencies, including the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., Acwa
said.   Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) , the kingdom’s largest utility, will
sign the agreement to build the plant today with a group that
includes South Korea’s  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , the MENA Fund and Acwa
Power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
