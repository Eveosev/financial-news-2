Ireland’s economic growth may have
slowed in the second quarter as tax increases and rising
unemployment weighed on  consumer spending .  Gross domestic product may have expanded 0.3 percent from
the first quarter, when it grew 1.3 percent, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of six economists.
From a year earlier, the economy may have grown 0.4 percent. The
country’s  Central Statistics Office  will release the data at 11
a.m. tomorrow in Dublin.  Ireland’s government is betting that exports of goods from
foods to drugs will help to offset falling consumer spending.
The economy has shrunk every year since 2007 after a real-estate
bust pushed the country’s financial system close to collapse.  “With consumers still very much under pressure, the risks
remain to the downside,” said  Alan McQuaid , chief economist at
Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin. “Although there are still clear
downside risks, especially with the global economy starting to
slow down, we remain hopeful that the economy will return to
positive growth in 2011.”  Ireland’s trade surplus narrowed to 3.15 billion euros
($4.3 billion) in July from 4.18 billion euros in June on a
seasonally adjusted basis as exports dropped, the statistics
office said today.  “The worry is that growth will slow down markedly in the
second half of 2011,” said McQuaid. “These latest figures
don’t bode well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
