Michael Sata , leader of Zambia’s
Patriotic Front party, had 46.59 percent of the votes after
presidential election ballots in 33 constituencies had been
verified, said Ireen Mambilima, chairwoman of the Zambian
Electoral Commission.  Sata had 265,843 votes against 192,966 votes for incumbent
President Rupiah Banda. Banda has 33.82 percent of the vote,
Mambilima told reporters in Lusaka, the nation’s capital.  Patriotic Front Secretary General Wynter Kabimba said his
party had asked Banda to step down.  “Banda must peacefully transfer power to Mr. Sata,”
Kabimba said today in an interview. “He must pack his bags
because they know who has won.”  Nine candidates are contesting the presidency in the
southern African nation, the continent’s biggest copper
producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
