Senator  Herb Kohl , a Wisconsin
Democrat who is chairman of a U.S. Senate antitrust panel
holding a hearing on  Google Inc. (GOOG)  today, questioned whether the
company can provide unbiased Internet search results.  “Is it possible for Google to be both an unbiased search
engine and at the same time own a vast portfolio of Web-based
products and services?” Kohl said in a prepared statement to be
delivered at the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee
hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
