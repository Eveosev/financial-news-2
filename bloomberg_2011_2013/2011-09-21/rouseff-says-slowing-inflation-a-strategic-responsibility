Brazil  has assumed its “strategic
responsibilities,” above all the duty of bringing inflation
under control, President  Dilma Rousseff  said in  New York .  Brazil is adopting “an active policy of investment and
expansion of demand” to face the global economic crisis,
Rousseff said during a speech yesterday.   The Brazilian economy is currently close to full
employment, Rousseff added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
