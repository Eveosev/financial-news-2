Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures declined after the  Federal Reserve  said there
are “significant downside risks” to the economic outlook and
as Moody’s Investors Service lowered the debt ratings of Bank of
America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 41.5 percent at 3 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 40.3 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery dropped $1, or 1.2 percent, to
settle at $85.92 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have fallen 6 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
November $75 puts, with 3,814 lots changing hands. The options
gained 7 cents to $1.03 a barrel. November $80 puts, the next-
most-active options, advanced 27 cents to $2.02 a barrel on
volume of 2,125 lots. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls by almost two to one
in electronic trading.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  December $75 puts were the most active options traded in
