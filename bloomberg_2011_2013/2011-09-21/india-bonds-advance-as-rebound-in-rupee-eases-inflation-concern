India ’s government bonds rose on
speculation a rebound in the rupee will reduce fuel-import costs
and help temper inflation.  Benchmark 10-year yields fell from near the highest level
in seven weeks after the rupee advanced from a two-year low it
touched yesterday. The currency has strengthened 0.7 percent
from that low. Inflation in India, which meets more than three-
quarters of its energy needs from imports, has averaged 9.55
percent this year.  “The rupee’s movement in the past few weeks has been
significant and it’s now determining bonds because it has direct
implications for inflation,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as of
9:29 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed at 7.97 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
