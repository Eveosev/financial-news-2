Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) , the
kingdom’s largest utility, has increased revenue 10 percent
since July 2010 when the Arab world’s biggest economy raised
power tariffs in the industrial and government sectors, said
Chief Executive Officer Ali Al Barrak.  “We have to add 3.5 gigawatt every year to meet the
demand,” Al Barrak told reporters in Riyadh today.  Saudi Arabia  is seeking to expand generating capacity as
its population grows and industrial demand for energy increases.
Saudi Electricity will spend $80 billion to raise its capacity
and transmission network in the next decade, Al Barrak said.  Saudi Arabia has about 45,000 megawatts of generating
capacity, with power demand also reaching that level during
times of peak consumption, Saudi Electricity said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
