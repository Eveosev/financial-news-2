The Philippines is studying how oil
companies price their petroleum products and the tax agency will
look into their “profitability,” President  Benigno Aquino  said

deregulation law, which allows oil companies to set their own
prices, is “working,” Aquino said in a video posted on the
government’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
