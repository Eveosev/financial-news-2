Malawian President Bingu wa
Mutharika demanded an end to a three-day strike organized by
civil-society groups protesting against government policies and
continuing fuel and foreign-currency shortages.  “You can’t bully me into submission,” Mutharika said on
the state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corp. television today.
“Government can’t be taken to ransom by a few disgruntled
individuals hiding in the name of civil society. If you stop
people from going to work, I will deal with you.”  Nineteen protesters died in the southern African nation in
clashes with police during protests organized by civil-society
groups in July. United Nations-backed talks on ending a dispute
between the groups and Mutharika broke down last week.  The groups, which include the Malawi Law Society and
Council of Churches, called for workers to strike for three days
from today instead of holding planned marches, Benedicto
Kondowe, national coordinator of the Coalition of Civil Society
on Quality Basic Education, said by phone from Blantyre, the
commercial capital.  The call for a national strike is illegal, Mutharika said.  “I want you to open your shops tomorrow and nothing will
happen to you or your property,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
