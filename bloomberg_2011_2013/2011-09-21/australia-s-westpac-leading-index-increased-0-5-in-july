An Australian index of leading
economic indicators increased in July as stronger corporate
profits offset a decline in  consumer confidence .  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, gained 0.5
percent from a month earlier to 284.2,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens has kept the overnight
cash rate target at 4.75 percent all year as monthly employment
from January through August came in less than a 10th of the
average of 30,500 job gains in the first eight months of 2010.
Still, the RBA sees Australia’s medium-term economic prospects
as “positive,” according to minutes released yesterday of the
central bank’s Sept. 6 policy meeting.  “The sharp turnaround in growth momentum in the second
quarter explains all of this improvement,” said  Bill Evans ,
Westpac’s chief economist who in July predicted the RBA will
lower its benchmark  interest rate  in December.  “Inflation risks have eased, labor markets are softening,
credit growth and housing markets are weak, and confidence,
amongst both consumers and businesses, has tumbled,” Evans said
in today’s statement. “We believe that the case is there now
for a rate cut.”  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, was littled changed at 265.6 in July, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
