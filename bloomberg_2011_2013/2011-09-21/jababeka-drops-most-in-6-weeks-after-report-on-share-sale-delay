PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka fell
the most in six weeks in Jakarta trading after PT Onix Capital
wrote in a note the Indonesian company had to delay a plan to
sell new shares in a rights offer because the documents it filed
to the market regulator for obtaining approval weren’t complete.  Jababeka, which develops and sells industrial estates, sank
7.6 percent to 159 rupiah as of 3:43 p.m. local time, set for
the sharpest drop since Aug. 5. A call to the company’s office
in Jakarta wasn’t answered.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
