Spanish businessman Juan Miguel
Villar Mir is considering the sale of shares in Fertiberia SA
after proposals by banks for an initial public offering,  Cinco
Dias  reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
matter.  Fertiberia, which manufactures fertilizers and industrial
products, would try to raise funds through an IPO in the second
half of 2012 depending on market conditions, Cinco Dias said.
Proceeds of the sale would be used to expand internationally,
the newspaper said.  Villar Mir, who also owns  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  and
Ferroatlantica, may be reviewing a proposal from  Banco Santander
SA (SAN) , Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
