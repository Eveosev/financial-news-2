German Chancellor Angela Merkel
consulted with top economists of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  last week on ways to overcome
Europe’s debt crisis, Die Zeit reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Thomas Mayer presented a
proposal on how to increase the volume of the European Financial
Stability Facility without having to apply for new funds through
national parliaments, the Hamburg-based newspaper said.  Mayer’s proposal is to turn the EFSF into a bank that could
tap the European Central Bank for liquidity, Die Zeit said.
Goldman’s Jan Hatzius and Morgan Stanley’s Joachim Fels also
took part in the meeting, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
