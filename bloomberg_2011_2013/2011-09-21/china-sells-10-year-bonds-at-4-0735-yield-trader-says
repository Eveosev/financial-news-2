China ’s  finance ministry  sold 10-
year government bonds at a lower yield than estimated as concern
the economy will be hurt by Europe’s debt crisis spurred demand
for the safest assets.  The Ministry of Finance issued at least 30 billion yuan
($4.7 billion) of 10-year bonds at an average yield of 4.0735
percent, according to a trader at a  finance company  that
participates in government debt auctions. That compared with the
4.09 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 10
fixed-income analysts and traders.  “If Europe can’t deal with the debt crisis properly, it
will hurt  China’s economy ,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at
Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Cash supply hasn’t got that
tight in the  bond market  because of the bad performance of
stocks.”  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its China
growth estimate for this year to 9.5 percent from 9.6 percent.
The 2012 forecast was lowered to 9 percent from 9.5 percent,
according to the Washington-based lender.  The highest winning-bid yield at today’s sale was 4.1002
percent, said the trader. The auction drew bids for 2.05 times
the amount of debt on offer, up from 2.03 times at the last sale
of similar-maturity securities on Aug. 17.  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bond due January
2021 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.09
percent as of 11:14 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to quotes
provided by the Interbank Funding Center.  The finance ministry in January published a list of 59
underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial
Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC International
