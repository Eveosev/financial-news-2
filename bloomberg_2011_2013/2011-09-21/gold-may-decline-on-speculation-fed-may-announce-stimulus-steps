Gold may decline on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  may announce steps today to stimulate
growth and shore up the  U.S. economy , eroding demand for a haven.  Immediate-delivery gold traded little changed at $1,802.68
an ounce at 9:53 a.m. Melbourne time. December-delivery bullion
in  New York  fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1,803.30 before
trading at $1,806 an ounce.  Federal Reserve officials might propose new measures to
galvanize the economy when the  Federal Open Market Committee 
completes a two-day meeting. Ben S. Bernanke, the central bank’s
chairman, told economists Sept. 9 in Minneapolis that policy
makers have measures at hand and are “prepared to employ these
tools as appropriate.”  “If they just come out and talk the talk, which they have
been doing for the last several weeks, there will be probably
less pressure for gold to move up,” said  David Lennox , a
resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney. “It’s likely the
market may take that as a ‘they’re not going to do anything
again until the next meeting’ and gold may weaken off just a
little bit.”  The Fed may decide to replace short-term Treasuries in its
$1.65 trillion portfolio with long-term bonds, according to 71
percent of 42 surveyed economists.  Cash silver traded little changed at $39.775 an ounce.
Platinum declined 0.1 percent to $1,775.53 an ounce while
palladium was down 0.2 percent to $715 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
