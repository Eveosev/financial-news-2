New Zealand â€™s dollar pared earlier
gains against its U.S. counterpart after a government report
said the economy expanded in the second quarter less than
economists estimated.  The currency traded at 80.24 U.S. cents at 10.47 a.m. in
Wellington from 80.14 U.S. cents yesterday in New York and 80.54
cents before the data was released. It fetched 61.46 yen from
61.27 yen yesterday.  Statistics New Zealand  said the economy expanded 0.1
percent from the previous quarter, compared with the 0.5 percent
median growth estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists
conducted before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
