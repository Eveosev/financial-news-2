HealthSouth Corp. (HLS)  Chief Executive
Officer Jay Grinney said an Obama administration plan to target
rehabilitation hospitals may force him to close facilities and
would cost $26 million if it were in place now.  The Birmingham, Alabama-based in-patient rehabilitation
company fell $1.48, or 9 percent, to $15.02 at 4:03 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest since Oct. 30,
2009. It’s the third straight decline after the administration
recommended to Congress $7 billion in cuts to the industry.
HealthSouth has about $2 billion in annual revenue.  Adoption of the proposal may force the company to shut a
“limited number” of its 94 hospitals, 38 of which would comply
with the plan, Grinney said. He called investors’ reaction
“just irrational fear,” after Obama proposed Sept. 19 reviving
a rule that hospitals show at least 75 percent of patients meet
criteria for rehabilitation. The threshold is now 60 percent.  Grinney said Congressional adoption of the president’s
“wrongheaded” recommendations isn’t certain. He said his
industry isn’t driving increased spending for Medicare, the
federal health program for the elderly and disabled.  The company estimates the proposed rule would have cost it
$42 million in net operating revenue in the most recent testing
period, or a loss of $26 million in earnings before interest
taxes and amortization adjusted for reduced hospital-based
expenses.  While saying he was “disappointed and perplexed” by the
proposal, Grinney leavened his remarks by adding that demand for
rehabilitative care and an industry in turmoil represents a
“growth opportunity” to take customers from rivals.  Potential Cuts  Investor uncertainty over potential government spending
cuts is reducing the stock, said Gary Lieberman, managing
director of Wells Fargo Securities. Lawmakers must make at least
$1.2 trillion in cuts by year’s end, or automatic, 2 percent
spending cuts will be made to Medicare and other government
programs.  “It’s probably more likely that we end up with a 2 percent
across-the-board Medicare cut,” Lieberman said. “But investors
are hesitant to take the risk they could see bigger, targeted
cuts.”  In the worst case, Grinney said, “maybe the pie gets
smaller on a one-year reset basis, but once that happens, that
pie continues to grow and we’ll continue to take market share.
We are the strongest provider in our space so the impact is not
going to be equal across all providers.”  The bleakest scenario for HealthSouth, if Congress adopts
all of the administration’s recommendations, is unlikely to
happen, said A.J. Rice, a senior analyst with Susquehanna
Financial Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
