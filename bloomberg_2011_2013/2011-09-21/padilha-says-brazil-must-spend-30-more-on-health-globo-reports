Brazil  would have to spend 45
billion reais ($25 billion) more on healthcare each year to
match the quality of services available in Chile and  Argentina ,
 O Globo  reported, citing Health Minister Alexandre Padilha.  This would require a 30 percent increase in health
spending, which is currently close to 150 billion reais, the Rio
de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
