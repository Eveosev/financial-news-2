Irish Life & Permanent Plc retail
pension head Gerry Hassett said today that a pension levy
introduced by the government reduced profit by 13 million euros
in the first six months of the year.  “The industry is happy to play its part to tackle our
economic problems but as of now it’s being asked to do too
much,” Hassett said in an e-mailed copy of a speech given in
Dublin today. “The additional imposition of the pension levy
has had a devastating impact.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
