Air Europa pilots will start a
strike tomorrow at the Spanish airline and will continue
every Monday and Thursday indefinitely, pilots union Sepla
said.  Pilots are protesting against Air Europa offering
joint services with airline Orbest, according to a
spokeswoman for the union, who declined to be named in line
with policy.  The Spanish government has imposed minimum services
during the strike that will require pilots to cover 50
percent of flights between mainland cities, as well as half
the programmed services between mainland airports and
European cities, the company said in a statement on its
website on Sept. 19. Flights to the Balearic and  Canary
Islands  and transatlantic services wonâ€™t be affected, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
