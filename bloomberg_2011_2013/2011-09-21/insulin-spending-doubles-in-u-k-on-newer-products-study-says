The U.K.’s  National Health Service 
spent 359 million pounds ($561 million) on insulins in 2009,
more than double what the state-run medical system paid a decade
earlier, as the use of newer products increased, a study found.  Researchers from Cardiff University in  Wales  found that
synthetic insulins such as Sanofi’s Lantus and Novo Nordisk
A/S’s Levemir accounted for 85 percent of the National Health
Service’s total insulin cost in 2009, compared with 12 percent
in 2000. Older, cheaper insulin products fell to 14 percent of
the 2009 total insulin cost from 84 percent a decade earlier,
they wrote in the journal  BMJ Open .  To contact the reporter on this story:
