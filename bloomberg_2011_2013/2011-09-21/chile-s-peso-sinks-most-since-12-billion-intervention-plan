Chile ’s peso weakened beyond 500
per dollar, posting the biggest one-day decline since the
central bank announced a $12 billion intervention plan in
January, as the slowing global economy eroded demand for the
country’s copper exports.  The currency dropped 2.2 percent to 500.83 per U.S. dollar
as of 8:32 a.m. New York time from 489.86 per dollar yesterday.
It touched 501.49, its weakest since September 2010.  The peso’s 7.6 percent decline since Sept. 1 is the
steepest over such a period since February 2010, outpacing the
plunge in January. The peso has weakened as copper, Chile’s
biggest export, fell 11 percent this month and foreign investors
dumped the currency.  “There’s a lot of dollar buying from abroad,” said Andres
de la Cerda, a money markets trader at Bice Inversiones in
Santiago. “The scenario hasn’t changed much, but there is a lot
of flow.”  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had a
$2.6 billion position in favor of the  U.S. dollar  as of Sept.
16, the central bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
