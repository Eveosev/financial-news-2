Thailand ’s baht rose from an 11-
week low amid speculation exporters are taking advantage of the
relatively favorable  exchange rate  to repatriate income.  Data this week are expected to show overseas sales
increased 27 percent from a year earlier in August following a
38 percent gain in July, based on the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The baht fell to the lowest
level since July 4 yesterday as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen dimmed the outlook for exports and deterred
investment in emerging-market assets. The International Monetary
Fund cut its forecast for global growth yesterday.  The baht traded at 30.41 per dollar as of 8:30 a.m. in
Bangkok, from 30.42 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 30.67 yesterday, the weakest level since
July 4.  “There may be some orders near 30.50 from exporters who
missed yesterday’s high for the dollar,” said Norawit
Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl.
“The dollar dropped quite fast yesterday after reaching its
high.”  Risks to growth have increased as economic problems in
Europe and the U.S. worsened, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said on Sept. 15. Shipments to Europe and the U.S.
accounted for 19 percent of exports in the first half of 2011,
official data show.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2011 growth
forecast yesterday for  Asia ’s developing economies to 8.2
percent from a June estimate of 8.4 percent. It lowered its
projection for the U.S. to 1.5 percent from 2.5 percent, and
that for the euro area to 1.6 percent from 2 percent.  Thailand’s government bonds dropped for a seventh day,
pushing their yield to the highest level since Aug. 4. The rate
on the government’s 5.25 percent debt due May 2014 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.65 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
