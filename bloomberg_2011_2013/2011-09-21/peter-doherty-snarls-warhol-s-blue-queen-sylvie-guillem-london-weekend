Peter Doherty  is returning to music
after years of being in the headlines for his personal life. The
one-time fiance of  Kate Moss , friend of  Amy Winehouse  and drug
addict is playing a solo show on Friday.  Doherty, who has fronted the Libertines and Babyshambles,
added the gig after sell-out tour dates in May. Since his solo
CD “Grace/Wastelands” he has written dozens of
autobiographical songs, biting back at press coverage.  Peter Doherty, supported by the View. O2 Academy Brixton,
211 Stockwell Road, SW9 9SL. Information: +44-844-477-2000 or
 http://www.o2academybrixton.co.uk ,  http://www.frenchdogblues.com   Saturday  The artist who once displayed actress  Tilda Swinton  in a
vitrine has made a selection of her own favorite works from the
U.K. government’s collection.  Cornelia Parker has come up with a clever, color-
coordinated array you can see at the Whitechapel Gallery.  On the blue-themed wall is a Warhol portrait of  Queen Elizabeth II . The red wall features Jake and Dinos Chapman’s
skulls and plastic eyeballs. Peter Blake’s screenprint of the
Beatles is amid the mainly yellow artworks.  Hanging nearby is another fabulous quartet: Gillian Wearing’s “The Garden” (1997) shows the artist and other women
wearing only T-shirts with mischievous messages.  The show is at Whitechapel Gallery, 77-82 Whitechapel High
Street, E1 7QX, through Dec. 4. Information: +44-20-7522-7888 or
 http://www.whitechapelgallery.org .  If you’re visiting Whitechapel and want to try dishes from
the  Indian subcontinent , Mirch Masala is a cut above many of the
curry houses on Brick Lane. This informal venue is inexpensive,
with a wide choice of meat and vegetarian dishes. Information:

vitrines on Fifth Avenue. The company rolls out its stars for a
Saturday matinee, dressing them in sparkling green, red and
white costumes representing emeralds, rubies and diamonds.  “Jewels” ends its run on Oct. 5. Information:
 http://www.roh.org.uk  or +44-20-7304-4000.  Saturday Night  Very hot tenor Vittorio Grigolo sings the title role of the
randy old philosopher in Gounod’s “Faust” at the Royal Opera
House. The diverting staging by David McVicar includes a can-can
scene at the Enfer cabaret and soprano Angela Gheorghiu as the
doomed Marguerite.  “Faust,” at the Royal Opera House, ends on Oct. 10.
Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk  or +44-20-7304-4000.  Theater buffs may opt to step back in time at Shakespeare’s
Globe, which is reviving medieval mystery plays. The adaptations
by Tony Harrison cut the original works to a manageable three
hours. The evening runs from a comic Creation scene to a scary
Last Judgment, with parts of the audience getting consigned to
heaven or hell.  Shakespeare’s Globe, 21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, SE1 9DT.

during his stewardship of the Paris Opera Ballet in 1989 -- is
not ready to hang up her pointes.  Still defying gravity at 46, Guillem now gets her kicks
from the contemporary repertoire. Watch her on Sunday night
perform two tailor-made pieces: “Rearray” by William Forsythe,
and “Bye” from Mats Ek, which is about “a woman who takes
leave of a certain stage in her life.”  Information:  http://www.sadlerswells.com  or
+44-844-412-4300.  Exmouth Market, a 10-minute walk from Sadler’s Wells, is
filled with restaurants and bars. If the weather’s good, it’s
hard to resist a seat outside Caravan, where you may share a
table and enjoy inexpensive treats or sip coffee. Information:
