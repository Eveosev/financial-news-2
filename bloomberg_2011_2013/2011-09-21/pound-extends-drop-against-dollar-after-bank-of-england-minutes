The pound extended its decline
against the dollar after the  Bank of England  minutes showed
policy makers see an expansion of their bond-buying program as
increasingly probable.  The pound weakened 0.6 percent to $1.5638 as of 9:35 a.m.
in  London . It depreciated 0.2 percent to 87.27 pence per euro.  Bank of England officials considered ways of adding
stimulus to the economy this month and most of them said an
expansion of their 200 billion-pound bond purchase program is
“increasingly probable,” the minutes of the September meeting
released today in London showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
