Inter Milan  fired coach Gian Piero
Gasperini after a winless start to the season in Serie A.  Gasperini was dismissed a day after a 3-1 loss at newly
promoted Novara left Inter with a tie and two losses from its
first three league matches.  “The club would like to thank Gian Piero Gasperini for the
dedication he has shown in his work and regret having to end the
relationship with the coach,” Inter said in a  statement  on its
website.  Inter is 17th in 20-team  Serie A . It also lost at home 1-0
to Trabzonspor in its opening Champions League group match last
week and fell 2-1 to rival AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup
last month.  “At the end of the day it’s a results game,” Gasperini
 said  on Inter’s web site. “Am I disappointed? Yes, I am.”  Claudio Ranieri, Delio Rossi and Quique Sanchez Flores are
the top candidates to replace Gasperini, according to  La
Gazzetta dello Sport .  Gasperini, 53, was hired in June. He led Genoa to promotion
to Serie A in 2007 and qualified for the Europa League two
seasons later. He was fired by the club last November.  Gasperini replaced Leonardo, who took over when Rafael Benitez was fired in December and led the team to a second-place
finish behind AC Milan.  Benitez had been hired six months earlier after  Jose Mourinho  left for Real Madrid following a treble of  Champions
League , Serie A and Italian Cup titles.  Inter travels to Bologna in three days in Serie A before
visiting CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
