Air Liquide SA (AI) , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, is seeing strong sales in the U.S.
as its customers thrive, its top American executive said.  Low natural-gas prices are helping chemical companies,
which also buy products from Paris-based Air Liquide. Hospitals,
refiners, steelmakers, semiconductor manufacturers and  NASA  also
use the company’s gases, which include liquid nitrogen, argon,
carbon dioxide and oxygen.  “We’re hearing from our large industrial customers that
2011 is a great year,” Michael Graff, chief executive officer
of American Air Liquide Holdings Inc. in Houston, said in an
interview yesterday when asked about the possibility of another
U.S. recession. “We’re not seeing anything right now”
signaling slower sales.  Air Liquide said in August that sales for the first half of
the year climbed 9.2 percent to 7.12 billion euros ($9.67
billion). The company said in December that sales may rise 8
percent to 10 percent on average through 2015 as it boosts
investments in  China , Russia and other fast-growing regions.  While those emerging markets are growing faster, revenue in
the U.S. and  Europe  is not far behind, Graff said.  In the first half of this year, Air Liquide’s net income
increased to 750 million euros ($1.08 billion) from 676 million
euros a year earlier, the company said Aug. 1 in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
