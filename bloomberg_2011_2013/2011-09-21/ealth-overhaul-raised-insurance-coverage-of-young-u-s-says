The 2010 health-care law has given
almost 1 million people under age 26 insurance coverage, the
U.S.  said  today in promoting the effort’s ability to reduce the
rate of the country’s uninsured.  The rate of those ages 18 to 25 who have insurance
increased 3.5 percentage points, to 70 percent, or about 1
million people, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department
said in a  study  released today. The added enrollment overcame a
drop in employment that may otherwise reduce coverage, the
report found.  The data shows the law is working and shouldn’t be rolled
back as Republicans in Congress and those running for their
party’s presidential nomination have advocated, said  Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.  “It’s very disappointing to hear some people in Congress
talk about repealing the law and taking away this security,”
Sebelius said on a conference call.  The health-care law, signed by President Barack Obama in
2010, lets young adults stay on the insurance their parents get
through work until age 26. Before the law, health insurers
typically no longer covered children once they reached age 19,
or age 24 when they were in school.  More young people are uninsured proportionally than the
population at large. In 2010, 18 percent of people under age 65
were uninsured, according the  U.S. Census Bureau . Among people
aged 18 to 25, 30 percent were uninsured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
