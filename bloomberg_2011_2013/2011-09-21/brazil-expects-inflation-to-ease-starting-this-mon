Brazil ’s 12-month inflation is
expected to slow starting this month, the  Finance Ministry  said
in its Brazilian Economic Outlook report, distributed today by
e-mail.  The country’s economic growth in 2011 will be above the
average for the major advanced economies and the central bank
will be “able to act with expansionary monetary policy” if the
the global economic crisis worsens, the Ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
