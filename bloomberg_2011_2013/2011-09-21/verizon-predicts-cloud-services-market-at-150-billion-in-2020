Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, expects that the total market
for cloud computing services will grow to $150 billion by 2020
from about $10 billion now.  “We think we’ll have a pretty big share of that,” Kerry Bailey, group president of Verizon unit Terremark Worldwide,
said during a press meeting in Amsterdam today. “A lot of
companies are moving into this space.”  The market for cloud services will grow by $90 billion in
the next four years, Bailey forecast. Verizon has spent “well
over $2 billion” on cloud technology this year, after acquiring
information-technology services company Terremark and
CloudSwitch, a provider of software, according to Bailey.  Cloud computing allows users to store data and programs on
offsite computers and access them via the Internet. Verizon will
open its flagship datacenter for  Europe  in Amsterdam tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
