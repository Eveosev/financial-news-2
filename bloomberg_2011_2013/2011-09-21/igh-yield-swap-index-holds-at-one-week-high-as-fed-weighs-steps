Confidence in U.S. high-yield,
high-risk debt held at about the highest level in a week as
investors bet the  Federal Reserve  will give more stimulus to the
economy.  Markit’s CDX North America High Yield Index, a credit-
default swaps index which rises as investor confidence improves,
was unchanged at 93.75 percent of face value as of 8:37 a.m. in
 New York . The benchmark has climbed from 91 on Sept. 12, the
lowest level in two years.  The Federal Open Market Committee meeting today will decide
to replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio
with long-term bonds, according to 71 percent of 42 surveyed
economists. The move is known as “Operation Twist” for its goal
to bend the yield curve, forcing longer-term borrowing costs
lower to support the housing market and consumers.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
