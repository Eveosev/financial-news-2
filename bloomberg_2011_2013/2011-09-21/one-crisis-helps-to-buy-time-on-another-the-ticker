The R-word and the W-word have a lot in common. As the  International Monetary
Fund  raised the specter of recession (the R-word)  in yesterday's World Economic
Outlook, environmental scientists must have breathed a sigh of relief as they
struggle to convince climate skeptics that the planet is ``warming'' (the W-
word). With every percentage-point decline in gross domestic product, carbon
emissions fall in lockstep -- that's something even Texas Governor Rick Perry
might have trouble disputing. During the global recession, carbon-dioxide emissions fell as much as 10
percent in the U.K. and about 6 percent from industrial facilities in 27
European nations. Factories went idle, demand for  air travel  dropped and people
cut consumption. After the economic recovery was in full swing, the British
government's top climate economist,  Nicholas Stern , said the world was back on a
``business-as-usual path'' in relation to CO2 emissions and there was now a 50
percent chance that the disaster scenario of a 4-degree Celsius increase in
average temperatures this century would unfold. That's not to say recessions remove the need to invest in renewable-energy
sources, but economic contractions buy time for politicians to get their act
together on a global framework to replace the  Kyoto Protocol . Leaders are
scheduled to meet in Durban,  South Africa , in November to seek a follow-up
agreement that will be more binding and effective than the last one. So until
then, let's look on the bright side of a long recession. (David Henry is a Bloomberg View editor)
