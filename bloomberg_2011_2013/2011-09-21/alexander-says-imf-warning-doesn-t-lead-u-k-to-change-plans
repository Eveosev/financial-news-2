U.K. Chief Secretary to the
Treasury Danny Alexander said the International Monetary Fund
warning yesterday on the threat to British economic growth will
not change the government’s spending plans.  “The message I’ve taken from what they’ve said is we
should stick to our plans,” Alexander said in an interview with
BBC Radio 4’s “Today” show. “What we need to have across the
world is countries taking action that’s appropriate
to their own circumstances to deal with the problems that they
face.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
