Qatar surpassed Luxembourg as the
world’s richest nation in 2010 and is set to pull away with
wealth that’s almost twice that of the U.S., latest estimates
from the International Monetary Fund show.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Qatar’s gross domestic product
per capita at $88,221 in 2010, beating Luxembourg for the top
spot, according to IMF data released Sept. 20. The figure may
reach $111,963 by 2016, surpassing Luxembourg’s $94,621 and
 Singapore ’s $70,992, the IMF said. U.S. GDP per capita is
forecast at $55,622 in five years, from $46,860 in 2010.  “It’s the combination of wealth, growth and a small
population,” said  Paul Cooper , Dubai-based managing director at
Sarasin-Alpen & Partners Ltd., which oversees more than $500
million in the  Middle East .  Qatar, the host of the 2022 soccer  World Cup , forecasts
economic growth of about 16 percent in 2011 and projects a
budget surplus of $6.1 billion this fiscal year. The IMF
forecasts the Persian Gulf nation will have the world’s fastest-
growing economy for a second year in 2011 and estimates the 
country's population at 1.7 million in 2010. Qatar, which is 
smaller than  Connecticut , has a population of about 848,000, 
according to the CIA World Factbook.   The country, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied
natural gas, has reached its target of 77 million tons of annual
production.  To contact the reporters on this story:
