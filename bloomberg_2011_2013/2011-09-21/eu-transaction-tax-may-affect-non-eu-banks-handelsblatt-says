The European Union plans to
introduce a financial transaction tax that will also affect
banks in the U.S. and  Asia , German newspaper  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing unidentified officials.  The tax will be applied to non-EU banks if theyâ€™re settling
transactions for citizens in the 27-nation bloc, the newspaper
said. The EU Commission is trying to avoid disadvantaging
European  stock exchanges  through the transaction tax, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
