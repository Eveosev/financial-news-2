The anonymous cover just says
“SuperHeavy” and features a lion painted by  Shepard Fairey ,
the artist behind the Barack Obama “Hope” poster.  A sticker on the CD’s box gives the game away, listing  Mick Jagger , Joss Stone, Damian Marley, Dave Stewart and A. R. Rahman
-- names likely to excite interest in this diversely talented
“supergroup.” Good news for sales.  Bad news for buyers. Jagger’s friends are arguably not a
group and their product is definitely not super. What a mess.  Things start with “SuperHeavy,” mixing bombastic
Bollywood with Stewart’s urgent guitar and everyone else
wailing. “Never Gonna Change” sounds like a rejected Stones
ballad. The reggae number “Miracle Worker” is the best thing
here, leaving aside Jagger in a silly pink suit parodying his
1970s self in the video. It’s downhill from there. Rating: **.  For a better album by a real group, try “The Whole Love”
by Wilco. The Chicago act is outgrowing its alternative-rocker
tag and improving on its Grammy-nominated, self-titled release
from 2009. The opening “Art of Almost” has a stadium-filling
sound that can be heard on Internet  streams . The record is out
on Sept. 27. Rating: ****.  Bon Iver’s eponymous second CD is also a thing of beauty.
Wisconsin songwriter Justin Vernon chose his nom d’artiste as a
pun on the French for “good winter” and emerged from
hibernation with a full backing band of the same name. Each song
is about a place: “Perth,” “Calgary,” “Lisbon.”
Surprisingly, the concept works. Rating: ***½.  Ireland’s the Waterboys try fusing their folky rock with
the words of one of the country’s greatest poets in “An
Appointment With Mr. Yeats.” It doesn’t all work, though
“September 1913” is brilliant. Rating: ***.  “Hysterical” by U.S. quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is
an advance on its 2007  predecessor , with the sweetly chiming
guitars of “Misspent Youth” building into a bruising story of
a car-crash life. Rating: ***.  A group of four wheelchair-bound street musicians from 
Congo-Kinshasa, called Staff Benda Billy, came together with a 
teenager who plays a lute made out of a tin can. That doesn't 
sound too promising on paper, which makes the result, “Tres 
Tres Fort,” all the more breathtaking with its fusing of rumba, 
rhythm `n' blues and reggae. It's been re-released to tie in 
with a documentary on the musicians. Rating: ***.  The guys in the U.K.’s Kasabian are poised to step into the
gap for lad-rock created by the demise of Oasis. Kasabian’s
fourth CD “Velociraptor!” makes all the right moves, even down
to the titles: “Let’s Roll Just Like We Used To,” “Man of
Simple Pleasures.” It’s neither original nor interesting.
Rating: **.  Many other British groups have made so-so CDs this year:
Kaiser Chiefs, Kooks, the View,  Wild Beasts . Slightly better are
Friendly Fires, Hard-Fi and Yuck (the music’s better than the
name). Best of the bunch: “Skying” by the Horrors, which drags
the ghosts of 1960s garage rock into 2011 and gives them a good
guitar-led thrashing. Rating: ***.  Enjoy this new music now: We’re about to be swamped by a
glut of pre-Christmas reissues: Hendrix, Presley,  Pink Floyd ,
Nirvana, Queen, Beach Boys, U2. Watch this space.  SuperHeavy was released this week on A&M; Wilco is on dBpm
and released on Sept. 27; Bon Iver on Jagjaguwar, Waterboys
released this week in  Europe  on Proper Records, on import into
U.S. with release in 2012. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is on V2,
Staff Benda Billy on Crammed Discs, Kasabian on RCA/Columbia 
and the Horrors on XL.  Prices from $14 or 8 pounds. Download fees vary.
