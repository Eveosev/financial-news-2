(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd., the world’s No. 1 bourse operator by market value, has no
need for high-frequency trading even as it has the “slowest
trading machine,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Li said.  The Chinese city’s bourse operator has its own market
structure and doesn’t need high-speed trade right now, Li said
at a conference in Hong Kong. The exchange company doesn’t
believe a merger with another bourse operator would add any
value and is concentrating on luring more Chinese investors to
the former British colony.  Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) , the southeast Asian city-state’s
securities market operator, is also not looking for other merger
opportunities, chief executive officer Magnus Bocker said at the
same conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
