Hong Kong ’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the city’s Central roadside-monitoring
station, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website today.  The index was 105 in Central, 92 in  Causeway Bay  and 57  in
Mong Kok as of 7 a.m. local time, the department said. Roadside
pollution of more than 100 triggers a government       
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid  prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
