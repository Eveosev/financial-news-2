The  European Central Bank  will cut
interest rates next month in an attempt to ease tensions on
money markets, Barclays Capital said.  With the risk of a “hard restructuring” in Greece
increasing, the ECB will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter
percentage point to 1.25 percent at its policy meeting on Oct.
6,  Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays in
London, said in an e-mailed note late yesterday. “Tensions
within the euro area have escalated, particularly for some
banking systems, suggesting a greater need for stimulus.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB has raised borrowing costs twice
this year to curb inflation pressures, even as the sovereign
debt crisis spread to Italy and Spain, damping the region’s
growth outlook. The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut
its forecasts for euro-area growth and said the ECB should
reduce  interest rates  if “downside risks” persist.  Callow said he also expects the ECB to reduce its overnight
deposit rate to 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent, providing scope
for overnight market rates to trade “significantly lower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
