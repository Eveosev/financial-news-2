Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
cut short a trip to the U.S. today because of unrest in  Senegal ,
according to an e-mailed statement from Widener University School
of Law, where he was scheduled to speak on Sept. 24.  The statement from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based school
didn’t say what unrest forced Wade’s early return. Wade’s
spokesman Serigne Mbacke Ndiaye couldn’t immediately be reached.  The Senegal Embassy asked to postpone a planned reception
for the president “due to developments in the country,” the
World Affairs Council of Harrisburg, which was organizing the
event, said on its website. “President Wade will return
immediately to Senegal following the United Nations meetings.” He
was set to attend a Sept. 24 ceremony for a recent contract
between Senegal and Green Energy USA, council president Joyce
Davis said. She wasn’t told any details about the unrest.  Workers at Senegal’s largest telecommunications company,
Sonatel, staged a protest in the capital, Dakar, today. “I’m not
aware of any unrest,” Police Commissioner Harona Sy said in a
telephone interview about the demonstration by about 400 people.  A group called Movement 23 has planned demonstrations for
the 23rd day of each month to protest the president’s bid for a
third term. “We don’t expect any problems,” Sy said.  Demonstrators shut down commercial areas of Dakar on June
23, to protest a constitutional change that would have lowered
the vote threshold needed for re-election in Senegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
