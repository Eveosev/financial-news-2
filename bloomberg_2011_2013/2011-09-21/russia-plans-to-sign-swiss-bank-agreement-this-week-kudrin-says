Russia plans to sign an accord with
 Switzerland  by the end of this week that will allow the
government to obtain some information about money deposited by
Russian nationals in the Alpine countryâ€™s banks.  The agreement will be approved at a government  meeting 
today, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin told lawmakers in Moscow.
The treaty will allow law-enforcement agencies to request Swiss
assistance in tracking down account information about Russian
deposit holders suspected of tax evasion or  money laundering ,
Kudrin said.  A double-taxation agreement will likely be signed in
Washington this weekend, Roland Meier, a spokesman for the Swiss
Finance Ministry, said by telephone today from the Swiss
capital, Bern. The pact will comply with standards set out the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said.  Switzerland has signed more than 30 such agreements since
March 2009, when the government decided to work with countries
investigating  tax evasion  to avoid being blacklisted as a tax
haven by the OECD.  To contact the reporters on this story:
