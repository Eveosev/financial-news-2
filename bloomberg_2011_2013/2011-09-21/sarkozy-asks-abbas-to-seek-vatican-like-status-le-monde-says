French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
proposed to Palestinian leaders that they seek a United Nations
status similar to the Vatican’s, rather than push for full
membership,  Le Monde  reported, citing diplomatic sources.  Under Sarkozy’s plan, members of the so-called “quartet”
would offer various incentives, such as announcing more
favorable starting points for direct negotiations with Israel,
the Paris-based daily said.  The French want to avoid a vote in the  Security Council ,
which is the only avenue to full membership. Sarkozy believes it
would be hypocritical to deny Palestinian aspirations while
claiming to support democracy movements across the Arab world,
and also wants to avoid a clash with the U.S., which has said it
will veto Palestinians’ application, Le Monde said.  Sarkozy met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas
yesterday in  New York . Abbas has said he wants to seek full
membership through the Security Council, rather than settle for
lesser status from the General Assembly, where the Americans
don’t hold veto power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
