Russian mortgage loans doubled in
the first half from last year as lending conditions eased and
low interest rates spurred demand, rating agency Expert RA said.  OAO Sberbank, VTB-24, the retail-lending arm of VTB Group,
and OAO Gazprombank led home loan issuance in the period, Expert
RA said in an e-mailed report today. The top ten banks accounted
for 74 percent of mortage lending from January to June, compared
with a 68 percent share during the same period last year, the
agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
