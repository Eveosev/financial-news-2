Norway’s Financial Supervisory
Authority requested that over a dozen pension funds conduct
stress tests due to the decline in equity markets, Dagens
Naeringsliv said, citing head of Insurance Supervision Runa
Saether.  The FSA sent out a letter on Sept. 8 to Norway’s biggest
pension funds, MP Pensjon PK,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) ’s
pension funds, and to 14 municipal and private funds, the Oslo-
based newspaper said. The agency gave the recipients six days to
conduct tests on how unusual market conditions affected the
funds’s capital buffers, Dagens Naeringsliv said.  The OSE Benchmark Index has dropped 19 percent since an
April 6 high.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
