A  World Economic Forum  poll showed
that confidence in the global economy is on the wane.  Less than 10 percent of respondents expressed confidence in
governance and growth in the next year, according to the Geneva-
based forum’s quarterly  Global Confidence Index , based on a
survey of 1,500 business executives, academics and officials of
national governments and international organizations.  “Lack of confidence in the state of the global economy is
not surprising, but the corresponding lack of confidence in
global governance and global cooperation is far more
troubling,” Lee Howell, a managing director at the forum, said
in the statement. The forum holds an annual meeting in Davos,
 Switzerland .  A quarter of respondents said there’s a lack of global
leadership on the economy, according to the index, which was
released today. A majority are concerned about geopolitical as
well as social upheaval.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its forecast
for 2011 global economic growth to 4 percent from 4.3 percent,
and to 4 percent in 2012 from 4.5 percent. Jorg Decressin, a
senior adviser at the IMF’s research department, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today that a credit crunch is
possible given the outlook for the U.S. and European economies
as well as  Greece  and  Italy ’s debt problems.  Half of the World Economic Forum’s respondents were
pessimistic about the global economic outlook and a quarter
anticipates an economic disruption in the next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
