Savanna , a New York-based real
estate private-equity firm, acquired 80 Broad St. in  Manhattan ’s
financial district after taking control of the senior mortgage
earlier this year.  Mesa West Capital LLC  provided a $65.3 million loan to
finance the purchase and upgrades, Savanna said in a statement
today. The property, located between Stone and Beaver Streets,
is a 36-story office building with about 417,000 square feet
(38,700 square meters) of space.  Savanna plans to spend $23 million toward improvements,
including updates to the elevator system, a lobby restoration
and the installation of new common corridors. It will pull the
building off the leasing market during renovations and make it
available again in the first quarter of 2012.  “We want to make a strong statement that we’re dedicated
to this asset and to providing reliable and comprehensive
services, and as such have decided to remove the building from
the market,” Shep Wainwright, a managing director at Savanna,
said in the statement.  The first mortgage on the property was in default when
Savanna purchased it earlier this year, according to the
company’s website. It had been held by developer Kent Swig’s
Swig Equities LLC, which will continue to manage the building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
