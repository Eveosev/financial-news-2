     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Metro AG (MEO)  may not sell its Real
supermarket chain as planned, Handelsblatt reported in a preview
of an article to be published tomorrow.  Chief Executive Eckhard Cordes told Metro-employee
representatives on the supervisory board at a meeting Tuesday
that the chain may remain part of the company, Handelsblatt
said, citing people on the board.  The company declined to comment on the report because the
discussions between Cordes and the employee representatives were
confidential, spokesman Ruediger Stahlschmidt said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
