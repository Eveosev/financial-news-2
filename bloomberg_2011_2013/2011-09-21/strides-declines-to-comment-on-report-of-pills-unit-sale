Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR) , an Indian
drugmaker, declined to comment on a report that the company may
sell its unit that makes generic tablets and capsules.  “We cannot offer any comment,” Chief Financial Officer
T.S. Rangan said in an interview today, adding that the company
will scale up its speciality injections business. “Obviously
when you have to build an injectible business, you have to defocus” 
on other businesses, Rangan said.  The shares rose as much as 12.4 percent and changed hands
at 335.45 rupees, up 10.7 percent, at 1:11 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
