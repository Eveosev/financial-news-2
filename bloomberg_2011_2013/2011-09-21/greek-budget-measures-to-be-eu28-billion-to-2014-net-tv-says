Greece â€™s government is examining
budget measures totalling 28 billion euros up to the end of 2014
rather than an originally planned 2015, state-run NET TV
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The measures include closure of 350 state agencies, pension
cuts of as much as 50 percent in some supplementary pensions, a
cap on all pensions and reducing the tax-free threshold to as
low as 4,000 euros, NET said.  A property tax announced this month may be extended for
another two years, NET said. Detailed announcements may not be
made until after Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos returns
from  Washington  next week, the broadcaster said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
