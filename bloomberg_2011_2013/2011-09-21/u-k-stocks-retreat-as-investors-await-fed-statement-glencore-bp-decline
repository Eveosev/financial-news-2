U.K. stocks tumbled the most in 2
1/2 years, led by basic-resource producers and banks, as the
 Federal Reserve  warned of “significant downside risks” to the
U.S. economy.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company,
retreated 11 percent and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  plunged 13 percent as a
report showed manufacturing in China may shrink for a third
month.  BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-biggest oil company, declined 5
percent as crude retreated.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  fell the most in
almost three years as analysts said the brewer may be paying a
high price for Foster’s Group Ltd.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid 246.8, or 4.7 percent, to
5,041.61 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest drop
since March 2009. The gauge has fallen 17 percent from a this
year’s high on Feb. 8 amid speculation the global economy is
stalling. The FTSE All-Share Index sank 4.5 percent today and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 3.2 percent.  “Recession fear is in the market,” said Morten Kongshaug,
chief equity analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “The Fed
actually did something good but the market wanted more.
Following a big crisis, it takes a while before markets can
think straight again.”  The Fed will extend the average maturities of the
Treasuries in its portfolio by purchasing $400 billion of long-
term debt while selling an equal amount of shorter-term
securities, the  Federal Open Market Committee  said after a two-
day meeting yesterday. The central bank said “there are
significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including
strains in global financial markets.”  Miners Drop  Rio Tinto  plummeted 11 percent to 3,023 pence, its biggest
drop since April 2009. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest
mining company, slid 8.3 percent to 1,731.5 pence. Antofagasta,
a Chilean copper miner, declined 13 percent to 972.5 pence and
Xstrata Plc slid 9.6 percent to 849.5 pence as copper fell as
much as 8 percent and tin plunged as much as 9 percent in London
trading.  Manufacturing in China, the biggest consumer of base
metals, may shrink for a third month in September, the longest
contraction since 2009, after a preliminary index of purchasing
managers showed measures of export orders and output declined.
The preliminary reading of 49.4 compares with the final reading
of 49.9 for August and 49.3 for July. A reading below 50
indicates a contraction.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker,
retreated 9.8 percent to 1,361 pence, the biggest drop since
November 2008. The company gets 33 percent of revenue from the
Asia Pacific region.  BP, Shell  BP slid 5 percent to 384 pence and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
fell 3.4 percent to 1,998.5 pence. Petrofac Ltd. declined 7.9
percent to 1,257 pence as oil futures dropped as much as 6.6
percent to $80.25 a barrel in New York.  SABMiller, the maker of Peroni and Grolsch beer, declined
6.3 percent to 2,047 pence, its biggest drop since October 2008.  Foster’s is a “pricey” acquisition,  Trevor Stirling , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, said in a note.
SABMiller’s A$9.9 billion ($9.7 billion) offer values the
Australian brewer at 13 times its earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, more than the 12.4 times that
InBev NV paid for Anheuser-Busch Cos. in 2008, though with
“less upside and more downside risk,” he wrote.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  fell 10 percent to 32.51 pence and
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  dropped 5.7 percent to 22.05
pence as Moody’s Investors Service yesterday downgraded three
U.S. banks saying U.S. support has become less likely if lenders
get into financial trouble.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second-biggest discount airline,
rallied 9 percent to 340 pence, the largest gain in two months,
as the company said it will pay a dividend of 9 pence a share
for the fiscal year ending in September after raising its annual
profit forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
