South Korea’s won fell for a third
day after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth
forecast, damping the outlook for the nation’s exports. Bonds
declined.  The IMF yesterday cut its estimate for world economic
growth to 4 percent this year from 4.3 percent, and to 4 percent
in 2012 from 4.5 percent. It predicted “severe” repercussions
if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis. South Korea is
expected to grow 4 percent this year and 4.4 percent next year,
compared with previous projections of 4.5 percent and 4.2
percent, respectively.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,149.83 per dollar as of 3 p.m.
in  Seoul , extending its 3.2 percent slide over the previous two
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had been up by
as much as 0.7 percent earlier. The currency touched 1,156.50
yesterday, the weakest level since Dec. 22.  “Uncertainty about  Europe ’s debt crisis is making
investors demand dollars,” said Ha Jun Woo, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Daegu Bank. “Players speculate the Federal
Reserve announcement will be within expectations.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will probably announce
plans to replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion
portfolio with long-term bonds, according to 71 percent of 42
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  A government report today showed the Korean  unemployment
rate  fell to 3.1 percent in August, the lowest level since July
2008 and less than the 3.3 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan
said at a government meeting today that the data reflects
“strong” economic fundamentals and is a “big surprise.”  The yield on  South Korea ’s benchmark three-year bonds rose.
The rate on the 3.5 percent debt due June 2014 climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.51 percent, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. The yield reached a one-month high of
3.55 percent on Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
