California-blend gasoline’s premium
widened after  New York  futures dropped faster than regional
prices.  Gasoline futures fell to a seven-month low after the U.S.
Federal Reserve cited “significant downside risks” to the
country’s economic outlook. Refinery maintenance in Wyoming and
Louisiana may also boost demand for gasoline produced in
California from neighboring states.  “Prices on the West Coast have receded but not as severely
as the futures,” said Bob Van Der Valk, an independent fuel
pricing analyst in Terry, Montana.  The premium for Carbob in  Los Angeles  widened 8.75 cents to
17.50 cents versus gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:09 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped 3.53 cents
to $2.7187 a gallon.  Gasoline for October delivery tumbled 10.65 cents, or 4
percent, to $2.56 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
price since Feb. 18.  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  increased 8.88
cents to 17.63 cents a gallon. The premium for conventional, 87-
octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, fell by 1.5 cents to 22
cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
