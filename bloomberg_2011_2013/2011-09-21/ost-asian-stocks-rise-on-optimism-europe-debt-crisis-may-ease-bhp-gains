Most Asian stocks rose after a
gauge of economic indicators signaled growth in  China  is
withstanding  Europe ’s debt crisis and a faltering U.S. economy.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index trimmed advances in late trading as
European markets opened lower.  China Life Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest insurer by
market value, rose 1.6 percent in Hong Kong after the Conference
Board said its leading indicator index for the world’s second-
largest economy rose 0.6 percent in July, citing a preliminary
reading.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,

most at risk from Europe’s debt crisis.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which swung between gains and
losses at least seven times today, rose 0.2 percent to 118.12 as
of 7:34 p.m. in Tokyo. About three stocks rose for every two
that fell, as speculation grew that the  Federal Reserve  will
today announce steps to bolster the world’s biggest economy. The
gauge fell for the past two weeks on concern Europe’s debt
crisis is spreading and signs of slowing U.S. growth.  “Any news suggesting China’s growth rate is firm provides
comfort to investors who have been concerned about a hard
landing alongside worries about a downturn in demand from the
developed world,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more than
$300 million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “At the same
time, markets are hanging on for what the Fed is going to do,
and how U.S. markets might react.”  Nikkei, Hang Seng  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 0.2 percent and

rose 0.6 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1 percent, deepening
losses after European markets opened, with Esprit tumbling 11
percent to HK$8.96. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped
as much as 1.1 percent today as European Union officials said
they planned to return to Athens next week to complete a review
of the Greek economy  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos made “good
progress” in a second round of talks with the European Union
and  International Monetary Fund  aimed at staving off default,
according to an EU statement. The statement said a “full
mission” will return to  Athens  next week after Venizelos’s
talks in coming days at the International Monetary Fund’s annual
meeting in  Washington .  Growth Projection  Stock gains were also limited today after the IMF said the
world economy will expand 4 percent this year and next, revising
down its June forecasts of 4.3 percent in 2011 and of 4.5
percent in 2012. The U.S. growth projection for 2011 was lowered
to 1.5 percent from a 2.5 percent prediction in June.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today amid optimism among some investors that Greece may satisfy
requirements for aid that may help ease Europe’s debt crisis.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 14 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.4 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 17 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks

equivalent of $24 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co. in  Tokyo . “There’s a lot expectation that Fed
will introduce some measures even if they aren’t that
aggressive.”  Nuclear Power  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier of clothing and toys
to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., gained 4.1 percent
to HK$13.82 ahead of the scheduled U.S. Federal Reserve
