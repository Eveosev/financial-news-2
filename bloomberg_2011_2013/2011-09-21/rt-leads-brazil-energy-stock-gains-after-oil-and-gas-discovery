HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) , a
Brazilian oil company, slid in  Sao Paulo  as declining crude
prices overshadowed a discovery in an onshore well.  HRT fell 4.2 percent to 920 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New York
time close, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 3.1 percent.
The stock followed oil futures lower after the  Federal Reserve 
said there are “significant downside risks” to the U.S.
economic outlook.  The company, which held an initial public offering in
October, found traces of oil and gas at a well in  Brazil ’s
 Solimoes Basin . The discovery hasn’t yet been declared
commercially viable, according to a posting on the website of
Brazil’s  National Petroleum Agency . HRT controls 55 percent of
the well, while Petra Energia SA owns the remainder.  The finding was “already expected by the market,” Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes, analysts at Itau Unibanco Holding SA,
wrote in a note to clients today.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, was little changed at 20.60 reais after earlier rising
as much as 2.2 percent. Petrobras found oil and natural gas at
an offshore field near an area where Brazil plans to auction
exploration licenses next year. The company confirmed high-
quality oil at two separate layers in a well test at the BM-
SEAL-11 block, it said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
