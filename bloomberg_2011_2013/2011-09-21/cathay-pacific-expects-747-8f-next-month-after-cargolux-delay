Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  plans
to accept its first  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-8 freighter next month after
the initial customer for the model rejected two planes.  The airline is “satisfied” with its commercial
arrangements with Boeing, it said by e-mail today. “We expect
to take delivery of our first 747-8F in October.”  Boeing last week canceled three days’ worth of ceremonies
and events after Cargolux Airlines International SA, based in
 Luxembourg , refused to accept the first two 747-8Fs because of
contractual issues. The clash marred the arrival of the newest
and biggest version of the humpback 747, which has been Boeing’s
marquee model since its inception in the 1960s.  Hong Kong-based Cathay, the world’s largest international
cargo carrier, is due to receive five 747-8 freighters this year
and five next year, according to its interim results statement
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
