Heart of Midlothian FC has been
issued with a winding-up order by the Court of Session in
Edinburgh after failing to pay a tax bill on time, the British
Broadcasting Corp. said, without saying where it got the
information.  The Edinburgh-based  soccer club  has eight days to pay the
bill, which is a “substantial six-figure amount” and relates
to unpaid income and sales taxes, or the winding-up order will
be enforced, the  BBC  said.  The unpaid tax is unrelated to another 1.75 million-pound
($2.8 million) tax bill from HM Revenue & Customs that Hearts is
contesting, the BBC said.  Hearts is already unable to register new players because of
its failure to pay players on time, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
