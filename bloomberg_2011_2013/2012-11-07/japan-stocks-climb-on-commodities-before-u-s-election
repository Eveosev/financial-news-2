Most Japanese  stocks  fell amid mixed
earnings reports from companies including  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and
Taiyo Yuden Co., and the yen strengthened after U.S. President
 Barack Obama  won a second term in office.  Taiyo Yuden sank 2.8 percent after the maker of electronics
components cut its profit forecast. Nissan jumped 4.1 percent
after analysts said its forecast was conservative and that
Chinese customers were returning to the carmaker’s showrooms
after a territorial dispute between the two nations.  Inpex Corp. (1605) 
rose after the oil explorer boosted its full-year forecast and
crude rose the most in a month.  “The current economy isn’t sustainable enough for the
drastic fiscal restructuring the Republican Party wanted,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $22 billion.
“Obama succeeded in keeping the nation from entering a
depression. Without his actions, we can’t tell how much the
economy would have plunged. Obama kept a critical situation from
getting worse.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  was little changed at 8,972.89
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after swinging between gains and
losses of 0.6 percent earlier. Volume on the gauge was 5.7
percent above the 30-day intraday average. The broader  Topix (TPX) 
Index added 0.1 percent to 745.71, with eight shares falling for
every seven that gained.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today as Obama defeated Republican  Mitt Romney , who conceded the
presidential race after projections showed the incumbent
winning the electoral votes needed for re-election.  Obama faces a so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts that take effect in
2013 unless Congress can reach a budget compromise.  Yen Strengthens  The yen appreciated to as high as 79.81 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 80.29 when the stock markets open.
A stronger yen cuts overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Toyo Tire & Rubber Co., a tiremaker that gets a third of
its sales in North America, declined 1.5 percent to 198 yen.  In China, the nation’s Communist Party tomorrow starts its
18th Congress in Beijing, when delegates will meet over several
days to pick a new leader. Xi Jinping will probably replace Hu
Jintao as general secretary of the party that’s ruled  China 
since 1949.  The Topix has risen 3.7 percent since Sept. 6 after the
European Central Bank started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of  Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Commodities Rise  Commodity-related companies gained after crude oil for
December delivery jumped 3.6 percent to settle at $88.71 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest gain since Oct. 4 and
the highest settlement since Oct. 22. The London Metal Exchange
Index of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum advanced 0.9 percent.  Inpex, the nation’s largest oil explorer by market value,
climbed 2.8 percent to 457,000 yen after raising its full-year
net-income forecast 8.3 percent to 182 billion yen ($2.3
million), saying crude prices rose more than expected the
company assumed in August. Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. jumped
6.2 percent to 172 yen even after cutting its earnings forecast.  Some 551 of the 1,675 Topix companies post  earnings results 
this week. Of the 295 companies on the gauge which have reported
quarterly revenue since Oct. 1 and for which Bloomberg News has
estimates, 66 percent have missed projections.  Taiyo Yuden (6976)  slid 2.8 percent to 623 yen after slashing its
operating profit forecast by half to 5 billion yen, citing weak
demand for electronic parts.  Nissan Rises  Nissan gained 4.1 percent to 705 yen after saying orders
and showroom visits in China have rebounded following violent
protests in several cities. Nissan Chief Operating Officer
Toshiyuki Shiga said yesterday that orders there had recovered
to 70 percent of normal levels and dealership traffic to 80
percent as of mid-October.  At least four analysts, including Masataka Kunugimoto of
Nomura Holding Inc. who raised the target price to 880 yen from
830 yen, made positive comments even after Nissan cut its
operating profit forecast 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
