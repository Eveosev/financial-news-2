Ethanol futures slipped in  Chicago 
after a government report showed ample inventories and an
increase in imports.  Prices dropped after an Energy Department report showed
that  stockpiles  of 18.1 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 2
were 10 percent higher than a year earlier, while  imports 
averaged 60,000 barrels a day, compared to none a year earlier.  “There seems to be plenty of ethanol,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based
alternative-energy broker. “We have a lot of ethanol for
sale.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.344 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, down 12 percent
from a year ago.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago dropped 3 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $2.34 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive decreased 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.42, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.495 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slid 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.455.  Corn for December delivery rose 3.25 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $7.4425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 36 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for December delivery tumbled 11 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $2.5889 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel narrowed to 24.49
cents from 35.39 cents yesterday. Gasoline traded at a premium
of 99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
