Georgia Gulf Corp. (GGC) , the biggest North
American maker of vinyl construction products, said it will
consider buying a stake in a jointly-owned ethylene plant to
meet its raw-material needs.  The Atlanta-based company has had “quite a few
discussions” about its goal of securing 50 percent of its
ethylene requirements at cost, Chief Executive Officer Paul Carrico said today on a conference call to discuss third-quarter
earnings.  He was asked whether Georgia Gulf would invest in a “condo
cracker,” an ethylene plant owned by more than one company.  “Yes, we’re willing to make the investment in order to get
to the position we’re trying to target,” Carrico said.  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the world’s largest maker of
polypropylene, said in December it may invest in a condo
cracker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
