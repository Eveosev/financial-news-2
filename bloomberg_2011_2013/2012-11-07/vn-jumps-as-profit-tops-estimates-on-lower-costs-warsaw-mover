TVN SA (TVN) ,  Poland ’s second-largest
television network, jumped the most in three weeks after it
posted a higher-than-expected net income in the third quarter.  The  stock  climbed as much as 3.8 percent, and traded 2.4
percent higher at 6.83 zloty, the biggest gain since Oct. 17, as
of 11:05 a.m. in Warsaw. Turnover amounted to 173 percent of the
three-month daily average. TVN has fallen 34 percent this  year ,
while the WIG20 Index advanced 9.7 percent.  Its third-quarter profit stood at 62 million zloty ($19
million), compared to a 357.2 million-zloty loss a year earlier
and 57.5 million-zloty profit median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Results surprised on the upside due to excellent cost
containment leading to better-than-expected profitability,”
 Leszek Iwaszko , an analyst at Societe Generale SA in Warsaw,
said in a research note. “Importantly, TVN maintained its full-
year guidance for the advertising market, expecting the fourth
quarter to be similar to the third.”  TVN reiterated its forecast that the TV advertising market
will fall 6 percent to 9 percent this year as Poland’s economic
growth slows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
