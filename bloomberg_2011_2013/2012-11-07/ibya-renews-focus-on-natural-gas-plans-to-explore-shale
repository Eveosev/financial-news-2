Libya plans boost production of
natural gas and is studying options to explore unconventional
reserves, National Oil Co. Chairman Nuri Berruien said.  The country is now producing 2.5 billion cubic meters a day
of gas and aims to reach its full capacity of 3 billion cubic
meters per a day by the start of next year, Berruien said today
in an interview while attending a conference in Vienna.  Libya’s oil and gas production screeched to a halt last
year during the uprising that overthrew the government of
 Muammar Qaddafi . The north African country is working to restore
its output, bring in international oil companies such as  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Total SA (FP)  and explore new
gas deposists using unconventional techniques such as drilling
through shale.  “Gas has never been a priority for us, but it is now,”
Berruien said. “We may have some of the most important shale
gas deposists in the world.”  Libya may hold as much as 290 trillion cubic feet of
technically recoverable shale gas, according to data from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration, the eighth largest in
the world.  Shale production, which involves the drilling of hundreds
of wells and blasting of rock with water and chemicals, has
turned the U.S. into the world’s largest producer of  natural
gas , but has been banned in some European countries because of
potential environmental hazard.  “Right now we are evaluating the reserves and talking to
our partners,” Berruien said. “The potential is definitely
there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
