The European Commission predicted the
French economy will barely expand next year as exporters
continue to lose ground to competitors in other countries.  Gross domestic product  will rise 0.4 percent in 2013, half
the pace expected by President  Francois Hollande ’s government,
the Brussels-based commission said in a twice-yearly report on
the European Union’s 27-national economies.  “The persistent deterioration in external competitiveness
observed over the past 10 years is not likely to be reversed in
the medium term,” the report said. “French companies are set
to continue to lose export market share.”  The commission expects unemployment to climb to 10.7
percent in 2013 and stabilize at that level in 2014.  France ’s
budget deficit will be about 3.5 percent of GDP next year,
compared with the government’s target of 3 percent, the
commission predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
