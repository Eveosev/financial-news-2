Hurricane Sandy  reduced U.S. retail
sales in the northeast by about $4 billion last week, according
to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse.  Retail sales, excluding automobiles, in the area affected
by the storm were about $15 billion for the week ending Nov. 3,
Michael McNamara, vice president of research, said in a
telephone interview. The sales fell short of the researcher’s
estimate of about $19 billion, he said.  Sandy struck the U.S. on Oct. 29, leaving millions to
grapple with disruptions from power failures, flooding and a
crippled transit system, including New York City’s flooded
subways.  MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse tracks purchases in all
payment forms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
