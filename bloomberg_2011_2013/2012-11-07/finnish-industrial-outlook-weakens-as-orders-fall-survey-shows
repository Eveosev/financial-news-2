Finnish manufacturing companies
became more pessimistic as  Europe ’s slump hurts exports, a
 survey  by the Confederation of Finnish Industries showed.  About half of industrial companies suffer from
overcapacity, according to the Helsinki-based organization. The
manufacturing outlook index fell to minus 32 in October from
minus 3 in July as 34 percent of respondents expect the economy
to weaken over the next six months. Only 2 percent forecast an
improvement.  Europe’s debt crisis and slowing global growth are hurting
demand for Finnish companies’ goods abroad. Order books are seen
falling further and personnel numbers are expected to decline in
the coming months, the survey showed.  Sales abroad  account for
about 40 percent of the northernmost euro member’s economy.  Outlook in construction and services also dipped and all
main industries estimated a decline in employment toward the end
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
