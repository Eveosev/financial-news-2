San Diego Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal, a 2010 first-round draft pick who hit two home runs in
his first career Major League Baseball start last season, was
banned for 50 games after testing positive for testosterone.  Grandal, 23, will begin his suspension at the start of the
2013 season for using the banned muscle builder. The Padres said
in a statement they’re disappointed in Grandal’s violation of
MLB’s drug prevention and treatment program.  Grandal said in a statement that he accepts responsibility
and won’t challenge the suspension.  Grandal, who’s from La Habana, Cuba, was selected by
Cincinnati with the 12th pick in the 2010 draft and joined the
Padres with three other players in a Dec. 17, 2011, trade that
sent pitcher Mat Latos to the Reds. Grandal made his major-
league debut last season and hit .297 with eight home runs and
36 runs batted in over 60 games.  In his first MLB start, on June 30 in  Colorado , Grandal hit
home runs both right-handed and left-handed. It was the first
time in history that a player had homers from both sides of the
plate for his first two career major league hits, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
