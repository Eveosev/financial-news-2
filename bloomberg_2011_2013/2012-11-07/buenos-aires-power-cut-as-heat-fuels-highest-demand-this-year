Electricity supply was cut in central
Buenos Aires today, disrupting subways, after soaring
temperatures sent demand to the highest level this year.  “We reached a record for the year at 3 p.m.,” said
Alejandra Martinez, a spokeswoman for distributor Empresa
Distribuidora Sur SA, known as Edesur. A return to normal
service will take a couple of hours, she said. A spokesman for
 Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte (EDN)  SA, or Edenor,
was unavailable to comment, an assistant said by phone.  Argentina ’s electricity grid has had blackouts in recent
years as economic growth spurs demand and price controls limit
investments. Temperatures have reached 35 degrees Celsius (95
degrees Fahrenheit) in Buenos Aires this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
