President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
and the victories of Democratic Senate candidates yesterday show
the importance of “people power” in U.S. politics, AFL-CIO
President Richard Trumka said.  The wins by Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin in
Wisconsin, Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts and Tim Kaine in
Virginia -- all Democrats -- along with voter rejection of a
California ballot initiative that would have restricted union
fund-raising, show that labor organizing efforts can succeed as
corporate campaign contributions increase, Trumka said today in
a news conference with labor-movement leaders in Washington.  “This election proved there is no substitute for grass-
roots people power,” Trumka said. “Voters got it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
