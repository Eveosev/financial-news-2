Bioenergy Geradora de Energia Ltda. ,
a Brazilian renewable-energy developer, will submit the first
loan application for a solar project from the country’s
development bank BNDES in January.  The 3 million-real ($1.47 million) loan will cover about 42
percent of the 1-megawatt project’s cost, Sergio Marques,
president of the Sao Paulo-based company, said yesterday in a
telephone interview.  The plant in the northeastern city of Bom Jesus da Lapa,
will begin producing power in the first half of 2013 that it
will sell to a commercial building in Sao Paulo city at a rate
of 237 reais a megawatt-hour, he said.  BNDES, officially Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social, has discussed financing solar projects with
local developers and hasn’t received any applications, according
to a press official who didn’t want to be named because of
company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
