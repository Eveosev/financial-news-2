Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened by
the most in three weeks after U.S. President  Barack Obama  was
re-elected for a second term, spurring appetite for emerging-
market assets.  The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  index of shares gained by the most in
a month after Obama defeated Republican challenger  Mitt Romney ,
who said he wouldn’t reappoint Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke . The Fed announced in September it would buy $40
billion of mortgage debt per month to spur growth.  Bank
Indonesia  will hold its  reference rate  at record-low 5.75
percent tomorrow, according to all 16 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “The markets, especially emerging ones, preferred an Obama
victory,” said Taufan Tito, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT
Bank Rakyat Indonesia in Jakarta.  The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 9,595 per dollar as of 4:26
p.m. in Jakarta, the most since Oct. 17, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency rebounded, after
earlier declining to 9,668, the weakest level since October
2009. One-month implied volatility, a measures of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 5 percent.  “There is still room for the rupiah to hit new lows as
demand for dollars adds up,” Tito said.  Indonesia sold 60 billion yen ($747 million) of samurai
bonds yesterday, the third sale of such notes since 2009, at a
yield of 1.13 percent, said Robert Pakpahan, the acting director
general of the  Finance Ministry ’s debt management office.
Samurai bonds are yen-denominated securities sold in Japan by
foreign borrowers.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes maturing in
May 2022 rose to 5.63 percent from 5.62 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since March 5, according data compiled by Bloomberg
based on closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
