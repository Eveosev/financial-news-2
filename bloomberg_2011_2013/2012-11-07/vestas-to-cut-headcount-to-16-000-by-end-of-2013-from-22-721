Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  is seeking to
sell a stake of as much as 20 percent and said it’s reducing
headcount by 3,000 to raise the staff cuts by the biggest wind
turbine maker to almost a third over two years.  The shares  fell  the most in 10 months after the Danish
manufacturer reported a third-quarter loss of 175 million euros
($225 million). That compares with the average  forecast  for a 20
million-euro profit in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Vestas
is looking for an investor to help it weather falling turbine
prices, Chief Financial Officer Dag Andresen said.  “What’s important is that we have investors who understand
the company, the segment that we are working in and also have a
longer-term view,” Andresen said in an interview from Vestas’s
headquarters in Aarhus,  Denmark . He and Chief Executive Officer
Ditlev Engel declined to discuss talks announced in August about
a potential “strategic cooperation” with  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)   Vestas is struggling to return to profit after last year
posting its first loss since 2005 as overcapacity in the
industry squeezed margins. The stock had surged after lenders
waived loan covenants in July and the Mitsubishi talks were
disclosed the next month.  Andresen said he expects Vestas to meet its loan covenants
by year-end. Asked about the possibility of a rights offer or
another move to raise equity from existing shareholders,
Andresen said, “I do not rule out anything.”  Shares Tumble  Vestas  shares  tumbled 13 percent to 26.65 kroner at the
close of Copenhagen trading, a three-month low, after falling as
much as 17 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Jan. 4. The
yield on Vestas bonds due in 2015 jumped to 20 percent as their
price dropped to the lowest since Aug. 14.  The finance director’s remarks confirmed comments made in
August by Chairman Bert Nordberg to the Berlingske Business
newspaper that he’s seeking a single major shareholder. Andresen
said executives would consider a lesser stake sale. He declined
to say when an announcement might be made about the Mitsubishi
Heavy talks.  Asked about his comments to Bloomberg in an analyst call
later in the day, and whether Vestas is actively seeking an
investor, Andresen said Nordberg’s remarks remain “valid.”  “I cannot imagine that he would say one thing and then
just sit still and not do anything with it,” Andresen said.  Cash Flow  Vestas said it no longer expects positive free cash flow
this year, guiding for zero to 500 million euros of cash losses.  “The restructuring efforts are clearly directionally
positive but the cash evolution over the coming quarters remains
the single most important issue, and it is unclear,” Martin
Prozesky, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in  London ,
wrote today in a note.  Vestas kept guidance for a full-year margin before interest
and tax of zero to 4 percent, and for 6.3 gigawatts of turbine
shipments this year and 5 gigawatts next year.  Engel said he’s bracing for a decline in orders next year
in the U.S. as a tax credit supporting wind power expires.  “We have back in November 2011 said we had to deal with a
tough 2012 and tougher 2013, and that is what we have been
adjusting to all along,” Engel said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “We are preparing for it to be a very
tough U.S. market in 2013.”  Obama Backing  The production tax credit provides an incentive of 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour for wind power. When it was allowed to
lapse at the end of 2003, U.S. wind installations declined to
397 megawatts in 2004 from 1,670 megawatts in 2003. U.S.
President  Barack Obama , elected yesterday to serve a second
term, has said he supports extending the credit.  “We hope that what the president has said will
materialize,” Engel said. “Our hope is that it will happen.”
He didn’t provide a regional breakdown of the new reductions
though the company earlier guided that 1,600 jobs in the U.S.
were at risk because of the expiring credit.  Vestas will reduce its headcount to 16,000 by the end of
2013 from 22,721 in 2011, according to today’s statement, taking
the annual fixed cost savings to 400 million euros by the end of
2013 from 2011 levels, the company said.  The total includes about 3,700 already-announced job cuts
and 3,000 reductions announced today. Engel said some staff
reductions will come through the selling of facilities, meaning
Vestas workers may retain jobs by working for another company.
Others will come from not filling vacant positions, he said.  The manufacturing workforce at Vestas’s four Colorado
factories has been slashed to about 1,200 this year from 1,700.
That includes the firing of about 18 percent of workers at two
blade factories last month in Brighton and Windsor.  Revenue Rising  Revenue rose to 1.988 billion euros in the third quarter,
49 percent higher than a year ago, Vestas reported today.  Before the inclusion of 153 million euros of special items,
Vestas posted earnings before interest and tax of 13 million
euros. That compares with a 20-million euro profit forecast,
according to analysts surveyed. Special items included the
writedown of research and development projects, scaling back
work in  India  and firing employees, Vestas said.  “Vestas is evaluating its manufacturing footprint
including identification of outsourcing and divestment
opportunities,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
