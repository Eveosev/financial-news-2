The following are comments by former
European Union Commission President and Italian Prime Minister
 Romano Prodi  on the re-election of U.S. President  Barack Obama .
Prodi spoke at a conference in Milan.  “Obama’s victory has very important significance for
foreign policy. In the years that he has been president, Obama
has clearly changed the role of the U.S. from a solitary
protagonist to a solitary protagonist. The U.S. remains the
greatest economic, military and political power in the world but
it can no longer manage on its own.  “The second term of a president usually offers a greater
degree of liberty. I expect to see a much more dynamic foreign
policy and faster decision making for example in the Middle East
and Afghanistan.  “As far as internal U.S. policy, the country has a very
precarious fiscal situation. The European balance of payments is
much more balanced than in the U.S. There are also problems of
bipartisanship, which they can’t seem to build -- the
bipartisanship needed to confront this problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
