Archstone Inc. (ASN) , the U.S. apartment
landlord that’s being taken public by the estate of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., sold or plans to sell assets worth $1.77
billion between June 30 and the end of 2013 to reduce debt as it
prepares for an initial public offering.  The Englewood, Colorado-based company has sold or agreed to
sell about 15 properties for $765.1 million since June,
according to an amended S-11 filing yesterday. Archstone also
plans to shed another 13 buildings valued at $1 billion and will
secure an option to require Lehman to buy them at the end of
next year if it doesn’t find another purchaser, the filing said.  Archstone has been moving to reduce indebtedness left from
the October 2007 buyout of the real estate investment trust by
investors including Lehman, as the defunct securities firm’s
estate sells assets to repay creditors. The eighth-largest U.S.
apartment-property manager has total consolidated debt of almost
$9.64 billion, according to yesterday’s filing. Archstone’s
total liabilities of $9.97 billion represent 60.5 percent of
total assets of $16.47 billion, the filing showed.  “These transactions would drop their leverage into the
mid-50 percent range, still higher than any other apartment
REIT,” said Andrew McCulloch, a managing director at Green
Street Advisors Inc., the Newport Beach, California-based
property research firm. The average debt ratio for U.S.
apartment REITs is about 35 percent, McCulloch said.  Apartment Stocks  Plans for an IPO come as the  Bloomberg REIT Apartment Index (BBREAPT) 
is down 8 percent from a July 17 high. Apartment occupancies
rose in the third quarter at the slowest pace in more than two
years as record low mortgage rates in the U.S. spur would-be
renters to buy homes instead, according to  Reis Inc. (REIS)   Apartment stocks had surged after REIT landlords increased
rents by 19 percent between the market’s low-point at the end of
2009 through the second quarter of 2012, according to Dallas-
based Axiometrics Inc. While rents are projected to keep
climbing through 2017, the rate of annual growth peaked in the
second quarter of 2011 at 5.1 percent. Rents are on pace to rise
about 4 percent nationally this year, Axiometrics said.  Lehman filed Aug. 11 to take Archstone public after
battling billionaire Sam Zell to get full control of the
company, setting the stage for a multibillion-dollar IPO later
this year or early next. Lehman exited bankruptcy in March.  Peter Jakel, a spokesman for Archstone, and  Kimberly Macleod , a spokeswoman for Lehman, both declined to comment on
the amended filing.  Put Option  Since June 30, Archstone sold or placed under contract for
sale properties with 4,411 units that generated $16.8 million of
revenue during the quarter ended June, according to yesterday’s
filing. The properties are located in  Arizona ,  California ,
 Washington ,  Colorado ,  Maryland  and  Georgia .  Archstone completed $504.6 million of sales since June 30
and has contracted to sell another $260.5 million of properties
since then, for a total of $765.1 million, the filing said.  The company also said it will enter into an option on 13
other properties with 4,495 units that generated $21.7 million
in revenue for the quarter ended June 30. Archstone will have
the right to sell the properties to Lehman for about $1 billion
on Dec. 31, 2013, if it doesn’t find another buyer before then,
the filing said.  The 13 properties that are subject to the put option are
located in  Virginia , Maryland, California,  Massachusetts ,
Washington and Georgia, according to the filing.  Archstone owned all or part of 174 apartment complexes in
the U.S. with 56,525 units as of June 30, as well as eight
properties under construction with 2,830 units, according to the
filing. They are located mainly in Washington, Southern
California, the San Francisco area, Boston and  Seattle .  To contact the reporter on this story:
