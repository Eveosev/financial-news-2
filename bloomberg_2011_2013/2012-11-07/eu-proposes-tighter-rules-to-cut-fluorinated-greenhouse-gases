The European Union’s regulator
proposed today tighter rules to cut fluorinated greenhouse gases
in order to put the bloc on track to reach its long-term
pollution-reduction targets.  The European Commission’s proposal to revise the existing
regulation on so-called F-gases aims to cut their emissions by
two-thirds by 2030 from the current level. It also seeks to
prohibit their use in equipment including household
refrigerators to spur the development of more climate-friendly
alternatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
