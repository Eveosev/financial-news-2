The ruble strengthened for the first
time in three days as a U.S. presidential victory for  Barack Obama  boosted appetite for riskier assets.  The ruble rose 0.1 percent to 31.46 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow. The currency strengthened 0.6 percent to
40.1175 versus the euro and gained 0.3 percent versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Bond purchases under Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 
have swelled the amount of dollars on the market, supporting
crude oil’s 129 percent rally since Obama took office in January
2009. An Obama win will stoke Russian stock gains as he has a
“more constructive” view of relations with  Russia  than
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , East Capital, which manages
about $2.4 billion of Russian assets, said yesterday.  “Obama’s victory brought certainty to the markets,”
Sergey Kucherenko, who manages about $50 million in Russian
equities at Nomos Bank in Moscow, said by phone today. At the
same time, there are still “many unresolved issues” including
the  U.S. budget deficit , he said.  Russia sold 33.4 billion rubles ($1.1 billion) of 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 7.42 percent today, its lowest rate
on record for that maturity and 37 basis points below the yield
at the last sale on Oct. 10.  “Investors expect Obama to continue with his monetary
easing policies, which will help maintain a weaker dollar and
stronger  oil prices ,” Aleksei Belkin, who manages about $350
million as the head of asset management at Kapital LLC, said by
phone from Moscow.  Bank Rossii plans to review  interest rates  on Nov. 9. The
regulator will probably leave the  refinancing rate  on hold at
8.25 percent, according to a median estimate of 23 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.9411 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose seven basis points to 189,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
