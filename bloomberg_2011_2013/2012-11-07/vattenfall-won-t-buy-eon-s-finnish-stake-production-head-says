Vattenfall AB,  Sweden ’s biggest
utility, isn’t interested in taking over EON AG’s share in
Fennovoima Oy, a joint venture that’s building a nuclear reactor
in northern Finland, a company official said.  EON,  Germany ’s biggest utility, is seeking to sell its 34
percent stake in Fennovoima by the first quarter and focus on
operations in Sweden and  Denmark , it said on Oct. 24.  “Vattenfall recently divested all of its operations in
Finland, except for retail power sales and some hydropower
production, which answers the question whether we are interested
in EON’s share in Fennovoima,” Tuomo Hatakka, head of
production at Vattenfall Europe AG, said today at an interview
in Helsinki where he was attending a conference.  The only possible candidate to fill the void left by EON is
Vattenfall, Ingo Becker, Frankfurt-based head of utilities
research at Kepler Capital Markets, said by e-mail Oct. 29. The
venture is “highly likely to fail unless Vattenfall jumps in,”
Becker said.  Fennovoima is preparing to start construction on the
reactor, with a capacity of 1,600 to 1,800 megawatts, at
Pyhaejoki,  Finland , in late 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
