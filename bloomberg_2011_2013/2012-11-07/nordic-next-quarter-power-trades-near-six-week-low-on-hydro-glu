Nordic power prices for next quarter
declined to near their six-week low as forecasts showed stable
water supplies in the hydropower-dependent region.  Electricity for delivery from January through March slipped
5 cents to 40.20 euros ($51.26) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The contract closed at
40.02 euros on Nov. 5, the lowest since Sept. 25. Power for
December fell 5 cents to 38.70 euros.  The near-quarter contract may drop further because of a
water glut and high nuclear utilization rates, according to
report today from Bixia AB,  Sweden ’s fourth-largest power
trading company.  The surplus in water supplies in the  Nordic countries ,
compared with the seasonal average, may drop by 0.7 terawatt-
hour to 7.5 terawatt-hours in the next two weeks, Markedskraft
AS data on Bloomberg show. The area meets more than half its
power needs by running  water through turbines .  Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors were producing at 95
percent of their average combined capacity at 7:38 a.m., up 2
percentage points from yesterday, data from the operators and
calculations by Bloomberg showed.  Norway’s water reservoirs were 86.7 full on Nov. 4, which
is 0.5 percentage points more than the seasonal median, the
country’s water and energy directorate said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
