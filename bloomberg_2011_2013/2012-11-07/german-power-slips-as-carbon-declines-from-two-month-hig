German power for 2013 slipped as
European Union carbon permits declined from their highest level
in two months.  German next-year baseload electricity, for supplies
delivered around the clock, declined 0.2 percent to 47.09 euros
($60.50) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg at 10 a.m. Berlin time.  Carbon for December dropped 1 percent to 8.27 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Electricity in
Europe’s largest economy can track emissions prices, which
affect production costs at plants that burn fossil fuels.  Carbon call options trading surged yesterday, according to
data from ICE, where brokered contracts are cleared. There were
2.75 million tons of options to buy December EU carbon at prices
as high as 14 euros a ton. There were 500,000 tons traded the
previous day. Yesterday’s options to sell amounted to 1 million
tons, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
