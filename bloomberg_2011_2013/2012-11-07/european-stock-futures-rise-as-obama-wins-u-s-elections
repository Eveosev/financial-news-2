European stocks  fell the most in two
weeks as the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the
region and concern over an impending fiscal crisis in the U.S.
increased after the re-election of President  Barack Obama .  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  slumped the most in six months
after predicting that its annual output will be at the bottom of
its target.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest cement maker, slid
2.4 percent as earnings missed analysts’ estimates. BNP Paribas
SA jumped 1.1 percent after third-quarter net income more than
doubled.  Hochtief AG (HOT)  advanced 3.1 percent after reiterating
full-year profit targets.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 1.4 percent to 271.04
at the close of trading, erasing an earlier gain of as much as
0.7 percent. The benchmark gauge has still  rallied 16 percent 
from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks around the world
reduced borrowing costs and expanded stimulus programs.  “Worries about the state of the European economy are
weighing on sentiment,” said  Markus Wallner , an equity
strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “With regards to the
U.S. election, investors may be relieved it’s over, but the
fiscal cliff at the end of the year still is the main unsolved
problem.”  Brussels-based European Commission today projected the 17-
nation euro economy will expand 0.1 percent in 2013, down from a
May forecast of 1 percent. It cut the estimate for  Germany ,
Europe’s largest economy, to 0.8 percent from 1.7 percent.  Fiscal Cliff  Stocks earlier advanced as Obama defeated Republican  Mitt
Romney , winning at least 303 electoral votes in yesterday’s
election with 270 needed for the victory. With one state --
 Florida  -- yet to be decided, Romney had 206 electoral votes.  Automatic tax increases and spending cuts totaling $607
billion will take effect at the start of 2013 unless the Senate,
controlled by Democrats, and the Republican-controlled House
pass an agreement on avoiding or reducing the changes. The
 Congressional Budget Office  estimates that the U.S. may slip
back into recession in the first half of next year if such a
compromise is not reached.  National benchmark indexes declined in all of the 18
western European markets today except  Denmark . France’s CAC 40
retreated 2 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1.6 percent.
Germany’s DAX dropped 2 percent.  China Leadership  In China, Vice President  Xi Jinping  was appointed the
secretary general of the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress,
a procedural move that signals he’ll replace President  Hu Jintao 
as head of the party and government in the world’s second-
largest economy. The congress will be held Nov. 8-14.  In the euro area, September  retail sales  decreased more
than economists estimated, a report showed today. Sales fell 0.2
percent from August, when they rose 0.2 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said. Economists had
forecast a decline of 0.1 percent.  In indebted Greece, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras faces a
test of his fragile coalition government today as he seeks
parliamentary approval for austerity measures.  The 238 pages of austerity measures, ranging from raising
the  retirement age  two years to 67 to eliminating Christmas and
holiday payments for pensioners, is being debated in the 300-
seat Parliament, with a vote expected after 8 p.m. Athens time.
Approval of the legislation is the first of the parliamentary
votes required by Nov. 12 to obtain a 31 billion-euro ($40
billion) portion of international aid.  Randgold, Holcim  Randgold Resources Ltd. slumped 6.4 percent to 6,950 pence,
the sharpest decrease since May 8. The producer of gold in West
Africa said full-year output will be at the bottom of its target
range of 825,000 ounces to 865,000 ounces. The company also said
its costs will increase after power disruptions at the Tongon
mine in  Ivory Coast .  Holcim slid 2.4 percent to 63.90 Swiss francs after third-
quarter net income of 394 million francs ($420 million) missed
the 409.8 million-franc analyst estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK)  fell 5 percent to 14.53 euros after the
hospital operator said profit this year will be hurt by lower
revenue at two hospitals and costs from Fresenius SE’s failed
takeover bid. The company already cut its earnings forecast in
July. Rhoen-Klinikum also announced a restructuring plan for the
two struggling hospitals in Giessen and Marburg.  William Demant Holding A/S (WDH)  declined 5.1 percent to 468.80
kroner, the lowest price in nine months. The Nordic region’s
largest maker of hearings aids cut its 2012 profit forecast. The
company now sees earnings before interest and taxes “on par
with or just short of” the 2011 level, compared with its
earlier guidance for an increase.  BNP, Hochtief  BNP Paribas (BNP)  rose 1.1 percent to 39.54 euros. France’s
biggest lender said third-quarter profit more than doubled after
its investment-banking unit posted higher revenue.  Net income climbed to 1.32 billion euros from 541 million
euros a year earlier. That exceeded the 1.06 billion-euro
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hochtief added 3.1 percent to 39.77 euros, its biggest gain
in three weeks. Germany’s largest builder reiterated its full-
year profit targets and reported a third-quarter pretax profit
of 354.7 million euros, compared with a loss of 101.6 million
euros a year earlier.  Alstom SA (ALO)  advanced 1.4 percent to 27.98 euros. The French
maker of power equipment and high-speed trains reported first-
half earnings that beat analysts’ estimates on higher sales and
orders for trains.  Income from operations in the six months ended Sept. 30
rose 12 percent to 703 million euros, the company said. That
exceeded the 689 million-euro average of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose 11 percent to 403 million
euros, also beating forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
