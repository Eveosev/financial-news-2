Chicago Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  said
President  Barack Obama  has a “new governing coalition” based
on middle-class economics that will drive policy in his second
term in office.  The president must “never allow the Washington talk of
merely austerity to literally shout down and push to the side a
middle-class, pro-growth economic agenda,” Emanuel, Obama’s
former White House chief of staff, told Pimm Fox on Bloomberg
Television’s “Taking Stock.”  Investment in energy and infrastructure are “the cores
that propel an economy to grow,” he said.  The mayor said he expects Obama’s next four years to build
on a plan that includes  tax reform , research and development,
making college education affordable and implementation of his
2010 Affordable Care Act.  “He now, because he got re-elected, has the ability and
the liberty to implement his health-care bill, which was driven
about making sure health care is affordable and accessible to
middle-class families,” said Emanuel, 52, who took office as
mayor of the third-most populous U.S. city in May 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
