Gold declined for the first time in
three days as a stronger dollar crimped demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar gained as much as 0.4 percent against a basket
of six currencies on concern that President  Barack Obama  will
struggle to convince Congress to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff after his re-election. European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the region’s crisis is affecting Germany. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities slumped as
much as 2.6 percent  “We are seeing a risk-off day today,”  Donald Selkin , the
New York-based chief market strategist at National Securities
Corp., which manages about $3 billion of assets, said in a
telephone interview. “There is a sell-off across the board.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,714 an ounce at 1:53 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, prices touched $1,733, the highest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 19.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 1.2 percent
to $31.661 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 1.2 percent to close at $1,539.50 an
