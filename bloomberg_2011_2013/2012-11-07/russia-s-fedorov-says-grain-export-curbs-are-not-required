Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat shipper  last season, doesn’t need to curb grain exports
and state stockpile sales are sufficient to regulate the local
market, Nikolai Fedorov, the agriculture minister  said .  Stockpile sales began last month to keep domestic prices
from rising too much after drought damaged the grain harvest,
causing it to fall by 24 percent this year, according to
ministry data. The country banned exports in August 2010 for 10
months following the worst drought in at least 50 years.  Russia has sold 313,449 tons of milling wheat from silos in
Siberia and the country’s Far East since Oct. 23 in order to
reduce domestic grain prices which rose due to crop damage.  Stock sales from silos in the European part of the country
are unlikely to start before 2013, according to the statement,
citing Fedorov.  Farmers harvested 72.9 million tons of grain before drying
and cleaning from 98.5 percent of the sown area to date,
according to the ministry data.  U.S. Department of Agriculture’s foreign service in Moscow
 raised  its estimate of Russia’s wheat exports to 10 million tons
on Oct. 31 from its previous estimate of 8 million tons. That
compares with 22 million tons last season, the USDA’s unit said.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to $8.7975 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 6:23 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
