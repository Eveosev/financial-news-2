Czech Premier Petr Necas won a
parliamentary vote on overhauling the pension system after
securing support for the minority government from unaffiliated
lawmakers.  The lower house of parliament overturned President Vaclav
Klausâ€™s veto of two bills needed to implement a system that will
boost private savings for retirement. The government, which lost
its parliamentary majority in April amid personnel and budget
rows, mustered backing of 102 deputies, one more than needed to
override the veto.  Necas is seeking to boost private savings as the aging
population is increasing the deficit in the state system where
workers pay for pensions of the retired. Under the plan, the
Cabinet will redirect part of compulsory payments from the
pay-as-you-go pension program into private accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
