Darrell Royal, who led the  University
of Texas  to three national football championships and 11
Southwest Conference titles, has died. He was 88.  Royal won more games than any other coach for the Longhorns
and his name is given to the team’s stadium. He died in Austin,
 Texas , the school’s home, the university  said on its website .  The school didn’t list any details about Royal’s death. The
 Associated Press  said he had  Alzheimer’s disease  and recently
fell at an assisted-living center.  After coaching at Mississippi State (1954-55) and
 Washington  (1956), Royal moved to Texas in 1957 and compiled a
167-47-5 record, winning national titles in 1963, 1969 and 1970.
He stepped down as coach after the 1976 season and was the
school’s athletic director until his retirement in 1980.  Royal was 184-60-5 for his 23-year coaching career. A
proponent of running the football, he was credited with
developing innovative offensive strategies such as the “Flip-
Flop Winged-T” and the “Wishbone,” according to the  College
Football Hall of Fame .  “Three things can happen when you pass and two of ‘em are
bad,’’ Royal once said.  Other offerings of wisdom attributed to Royal included
‘‘Dance with the one that brung ya,’’ when asked about
installing more passing plays, and ‘‘Act like you’ve been there
before,’’ on his distaste for celebrating touchdowns in the end
zone, according to the Houston Chronicle.  Oklahoma’s Son  Darrell K. Royal was born on July 6, 1924, in Hollis,
 Oklahoma .  He became an All-American quarterback at the University of
Oklahoma, also playing defensive back and punter. The Sooners
went 36-6-1 during his four years at the school, from 1946 to
1949.  Royal became an assistant coach at North Carolina State,
Tulsa and Mississippi State, and coached the Edmonton Eskimos of
the Canadian Football League before returning to Mississippi
State for his first college head coaching job.  Royal was twice named Coach of the Year by the American
Football Coaches Association. He was inducted into the College
Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Oklahoma Sports Hall of
Fame in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
