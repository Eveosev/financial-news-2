President  Barack Obama ’s victory positions him to claim a mandate for pushing a proposal through Congress that would let tax cuts expire for top earners and avert $1.2 trillion in automatic spending reductions.  Obama now must decide how to contend with opposition from congressional Republicans who demand a tax-cut extension for all income levels.  Obama defeated Republican  Mitt Romney  to win a second term that will begin with the same balance of power in Congress: Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans holding the majority in the House. Republicans were counting on a Romney victory or a Senate takeover to improve their negotiating posture.  Emboldened by the election results, Obama “will offer a brand-new plan of his own,” Steve Bell, senior director of the Economic Policy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in an interview.  Bell said one option the Obama administration is considering is pushing anew for a “balanced” plan to cut as much as $100 billion in spending as a deficit-reduction down payment while letting the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire for top earners.  “In the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together: reducing our deficit; reforming our  tax code ; fixing our immigration system; freeing ourselves from foreign oil,” Obama said in his victory speech early today.  Call to Leaders  The president spoke by telephone with the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate after his victory. He told them the “message” sent by voters yesterday was that both parties “need to put aside their partisan interests and work with common purpose,” according to a White House statement.  Congressional aides have previously said that lawmakers in both parties are discussing fallback plans for $60 billion to $100 billion in deficit reduction.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman  Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat, said this week that he expected Obama to call on Congress soon after the election to pass a deficit-reduction plan that includes revenue increases and spending cuts.  “There’s a mandate for a balanced approach, and that means it’s got to be a combination of revenue and cuts,” former Representative Tom Perriello, a Virginia Democrat, said in an interview. He said he would like to see Obama “put a very bold plan out there.”  Taxes, Entitlements  Unless Congress acts, automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, will begin in January and the Bush tax cuts will expire Dec. 31. Obama and congressional Democrats want to let the tax cuts expire for top earners, while Republicans advocate extending them for all income levels. The spending reductions and tax increases, amounting to $607 billion in 2013, are known as the “fiscal cliff.”  To help bring Republicans to the table, Obama also may propose “minor changes” to entitlement programs, such as a temporary change in the formula used to calculate annual benefit adjustments, Bell said.  “Obama will certainly be very proactive,” he said.  A big question is the degree to which Republicans will back off from their opposition to tax increases.  House Defense  “For two years, our majority in the House has been the primary line of defense for the American people against a government that spends too much, taxes too much and borrows too much when left unchecked,” House Speaker  John Boehner , who was one of the leaders Obama spoke with, said yesterday at an election event in  Washington . “With this vote, the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising tax rates.”  Boehner indicated before the election that the House may be willing to pass short-term legislation to make time for broader talks on reducing the  deficit  and averting automatic spending cuts over the next decade.  “The American people re-elected the president, and re- elected our majority in the House,” Boehner of  Ohio  said in a statement. “If there is a mandate, it is a mandate for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is critical to solving our debt.”  Boehner Statement  The speaker plans to make a statement on the fiscal cliff at 3:30 p.m. Washington time today, according to an e-mailed statement issued by his staff. He’ll make the statement after holding a conference call with  House Republicans  to discuss the fiscal cliff and the election results, according to a House Republican leadership aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private meeting.  Eric Ueland, chief of staff to former Senator  Bill Frist  when the Tennessee Republican was majority leader, said Obama “has a responsibility to step forward quickly and express his specific interest in what he wants to see happen in December and then let Congress react to that.”  Ueland said Obama’s victory increases pressure on him to reach across the aisle.  “While he’ll have the ability to argue that he received an endorsement of his positions, he also has the responsibility of working with the Republicans in the House and Senate,” Ueland said.  Some congressional Republicans, especially in the Senate, have said they may be willing to consider eliminating some tax breaks to help pay for eliminating automatic cuts to defense programs.  Political Center  To the extent that Obama “wants to move to the political center, which is where the work gets done in a divided government, we’ll be there to meet him halfway,” Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. “That begins by proposing a way for both parties to work together in avoiding the ‘fiscal cliff’ without harming a weak and fragile economy.”  McConnell also was telephoned by Obama about the agenda for the rest of the year, as was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House minority leader  Nancy Pelosi , the two top Democrats.  Obama wants to boost top income tax rates to the levels they reached when President  Bill Clinton  left office in 2001 -- at 36 percent and 39.6 percent. He also wants higher taxes on  capital gains  and dividends than now and a smaller estate tax exemption and higher rate.  Tax Legislation  In July, the Senate, which Democrats now control 53-47, passed legislation to extend through 2013 the tax cuts for individual income up to $200,000 a year and income of married couples up to $250,000. Above those thresholds, taxpayers would face higher rates for ordinary income, capital gains and dividends.  Reid a Nevada Democrat, said yesterday in a statement that voters rejected “the strategy of obstruction, gridlock and delay” he has accused Republicans of employing.  “This is no time for excuses,” Reid said. “This is no time for putting things off until later. We can achieve big things when we work together, and the middle class is counting on us to achieve big things in the months ahead.”  The Republican-led House passed legislation in May to avert  defense spending  cuts and voted in July to extend all of the expiring tax cuts. Neither measure advanced in the Democratic- controlled Senate. Obama opposed them, too.  The automatic cuts over 10 years would be split equally between defense and non-defense programs. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about the cuts and say they want to avert them.  Representative  Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat, said in an interview before lawmakers left Washington in September to campaign that he was optimistic lawmakers could at least find a short-term solution to allow time for talks on a larger deficit- cutting plan.  “The keys are in the Republican hands,”  Van Hollen  said. “The minute they decide to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction we can get there.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Kathleen Hunter in Washington at   khunter9@bloomberg.net ; Roxana Tiron in Washington at   rtiron@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jodi Schneider at   jschneider50@bloomberg.net
