Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that completed the purchase of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s U.S. online
bank earlier this year, said it rebranded the business “Capital
One 360.”  The new name will go into effect in February, according to
a notice sent to customers today. ING’s orange-ball logo will be
replaced by a design incorporating the name Capital One 360, the
McLean, Virginia-based company said in the e-mail.  Capital One Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, 62,
completed the $9 billion transaction in February. The new name
shows the intent of Capital One to surround customers with the
best digital products and access to other services, according to
an e-mail from Tatiana Stead, a spokeswoman for the bank. She
said the law required a business name change.  “As of February, we’ll have a new name and a fresh look on
the outside -- but on the inside it’s the same ING Direct you’ve
come to know and love,” the company said in the e-mail, signed
by  Jim Kelly , head of direct banking at the business, and Jon Witter, president of retail and direct banking at Capital One.  To contact the reporter on this story:
