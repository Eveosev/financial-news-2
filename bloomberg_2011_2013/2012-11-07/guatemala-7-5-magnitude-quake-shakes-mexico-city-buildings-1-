At least 52 people are dead and 22
are still missing after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake yesterday off
 Guatemala ’s Pacific coast damaged buildings and homes, President
Otto Perez Molina said.  “We are continuing to send assistance and resources to
people throughout the country who are without electricity,
water, had their homes destroyed or are still at risk,” Perez
Molina told reporters today in the capital, Guatemala City.  The quake occurred at 10:37 a.m. local time yesterday and
shook most of the country for more than 30 seconds. The most
severe damage was in the town of San Marcos in northwest
Guatemala, where the most casualties occurred as more than 30
homes collapsed and city streets fractured, Perez Molina said.  The president has declared a national red alert for San
Marcos through tomorrow and has ordered three days of national
mourning. There are at least 760 people in shelters after losing
their homes and it is thought that the death toll will continue
to rise, he said.  Military and relief organizations are assisting damaged
areas and 44 tons of humanitarian aid has been sent to San
Marcos and Quetzaltenango in northwest Guatemala. The U.S. and
several Central and South American countries have offered to
provide assistance and aid, Perez Molina said.  The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake’s epicenter was
39 miles (63 kilometers) from Suchiate, Chiapas in  Mexico  and 53
miles from Retalhuleu, Guatemala, at a depth of 26 miles. The
quake was the largest recorded in Guatemala since 1976. Seventy
aftershocks of between 4.2 and 4.9-magnitude were recorded in
Guatemala in the past 24 hours, Perez Molina said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
