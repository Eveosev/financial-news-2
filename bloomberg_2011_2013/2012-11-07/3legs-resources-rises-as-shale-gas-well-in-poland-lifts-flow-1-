3Legs Resources Plc (3LEG) , a shale-gas
explorer in Poland, rose the most in almost a month in London
trading after a Baltic Basin well increased output.  3Legs climbed 7.5 percent to 43 pence, the biggest gain
since Oct. 10.  The Lebien LE-2H well showed flow rates as high as 780,000
standard cubic feet a day, up from a previous maximum of 520,000
cubic feet a day, 3Legs said today in a statement. It’s removed
a so-called nitrogen lift, which helps initiate fuel flows.  “We are very pleased that the well is showing a
significantly improved performance as compared to 2011, in that
the well now flows without the assistance of a nitrogen lift,”
Chief Executive Officer Kamlesh Parmar said in the statement.
“The plan is to continue further testing.”  Parmar took the helm last month after 3Legs’ stock slumped
more than 40 percent since the start of the year. Concern that
Poland’s shale potential was overestimated has led  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  to return some of its licenses.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  bought a 70
percent stake in three western Baltic Basin licenses this year
from 3Legs, which is based on the Isle of Man in the  Irish Sea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
