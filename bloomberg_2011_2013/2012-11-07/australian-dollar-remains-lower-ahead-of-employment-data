Australia’s dollar touched a seven-
week high against its New Zealand peer as gains in the nation’s
employment exceeded estimates, while the jobless rate in the
smaller country surged to the most in 13 years.  The so-called Aussie rose versus most major counterparts as
investors reduced bets the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut
borrowing costs next month. The  New Zealand dollar , known as the
kiwi, fell for a second day against the greenback after its
biggest loss in three months. Demand for both currencies was
limited as U.S. President  Barack Obama  faces budget negotiations
with Congress.  Today’s data from Australia “was stronger than expected,”
said  Sue Trinh , a Hong Kong-based senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada. “It’s no surprise to see the Aussie
outperforming across the board. Expectations of a December rate
cut from the RBA have been pared back further.”  The Australian dollar added 0.2 percent to NZ$1.2740 as of
4:42 p.m. in Sydney after it earlier touched NZ$1.2748, the
strongest since Sept. 17. It was little changed at $1.0406. New
Zealand’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 81.67 U.S. cents
following a 1 percent decline as of the  New York  close, the
biggest one-day drop since July 23.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year note dropped four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.15 percent. New Zealand’s
two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, was at 2.64 percent from 2.62 percent yesterday.  More Jobs  The number of people employed in Australia increased by
10,700 last month after rising a revised 15,500 in September,
the statistics bureau said today. Economists in a  Bloomberg News 
predicted a gain of 500. The  unemployment  rate was unchanged at
5.4 percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 60 percent chance the RBA will cut the overnight cash rate
target by a quarter-percentage point to 3 percent at a meeting
on Dec. 4. The probability was 68 percent yesterday. RBA
Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board held borrowing costs at a
gathering this week.  Statistics New Zealand said today the nation’s  jobless rate 
increased to 7.3 percent in the three months ended September
from 6.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s the most since
1999.  In the U.S., President Obama’s re-election is set to be
followed by budget discussions with Congress to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff, which refers to more than $600 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts set to be implemented in 2013
that may push the U.S. back into recession.  “Everyone’s worried about the fiscal cliff,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist in Sydney at  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  “I think we’re a long way from a deal. Risk
appetite is under pressure.”  The Aussie has declined 2.7 percent in the past three
months, the worst performance after the yen among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The kiwi fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
