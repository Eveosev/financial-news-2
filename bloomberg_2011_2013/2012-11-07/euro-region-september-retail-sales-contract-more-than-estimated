Euro-area  retail sales  decreased more
than economists estimated in September as a decline in Spain
offset gains in Germany and France.  Sales in the 17-nation euro area fell 0.2 percent from
August, when they rose 0.2 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a decline of 0.1 percent, according to the median of 27
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year earlier,  sales 
dropped 0.8 percent.  In Spain, retail sales plummeted 7.3 percent from August,
when they increased 3.5 percent, today’s report showed. Sales in
Germany and France rose 1.5 percent and 0.8 percent,
respectively.  The statistics office didn’t report data for Greece, Cyprus
or Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
