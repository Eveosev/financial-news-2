U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
10-year yields to the lowest level in three weeks, as a decline
in German industrial production added to signs the region’s debt
crisis is harming Europe’s biggest economy.  Britain’s benchmark securities advanced for the third time
in four days after U.S. President  Barack Obama  was re-elected,
boosting speculation the  Federal Reserve  will stick to its
program of buying bonds to spur growth.  Bank of England  policy
makers began a two-day meeting today to decide whether to
increase so-called quantitative easing from the current level of
375 billion pounds ($599 billion). The pound advanced to the
strongest level in five weeks versus the euro.  “Gilts have rallied after confirmation of weak German
industrial production underlined a weak euro-area macro
outlook,” said  Sam Hill , an  interest-rate  strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in London. “This follows the Obama re-election,
which stabilizes expectations that existing U.S. monetary policy
will be maintained. The combination has put a bid into less
risky markets.”  The U.K. 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 4:43 p.m. London time,
after dropping to 1.75 percent, the  lowest  level since Oct. 15.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.505, or
5.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.915.  German Production  Gilts rose after Germany’s Economy Ministry said  industrial
production  dropped 1.8 percent in September after sliding 0.4
percent the previous month. Economists forecast a 0.7 percent
decline, according to the median of 41 estimates in a  Bloomberg
News  survey.  Gilts have returned 2.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 3.5 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 1.8 percent.  The pound climbed 0.3 percent to 79.89 pence per euro after
appreciating to 79.72 pence, the strongest since Oct. 1.
Sterling slipped 0.1 percent to $1.5977.  President Obama prevailed over Republican nominee Mitt Romney to win re-election, becoming only the second Democrat
since  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  to win another term. Romney said
he wouldn’t reappoint central bank Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to a
third term in 2014.  BOE Decision  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee, led by Governor  Mervyn King , will maintain its  target 
for asset purchases when it announces its decision tomorrow,
according to 35 of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Six
forecast a 50 billion-pound increase and four predict a 25
billion-pound expansion, the survey showed.  The central bank will hold its main  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent, according to all 55 economists in a
separate survey.  The pound is poised to weaken to 82 pence per euro,
according to Adrian Schmidt, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London.  “At these levels, sterling is looking a little out of step
with fundamental value,” he wrote in an e-mailed note. “This
now looks like an opportunity to oppose sterling strength.”  The pound has gained 1.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro fell 3.3 percent, and the
dollar dropped 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
