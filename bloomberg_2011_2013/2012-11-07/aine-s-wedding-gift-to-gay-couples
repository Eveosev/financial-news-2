Whatever else happened this Election
Day, marriage equality passed another important milestone.  Maine 
became the first state to legalize  same-sex marriage  at the
ballot box.  Maryland  voters approved a similar measure.  The  issue of legalization  was also on the ballot in
Washington state. Voters in  Minnesota  were asked to approve a
ban. Those results will come in later.  For now, Maine and Maryland follow six states and
Washington, D.C., in making marriage legal for gay couples,
though in all previous cases this was achieved through court
decisions and legislation.  The vote in Maine reverses a losing streak for supporters
of referendums on same-sex marriage. The issue has been on the
ballot more than 30 times across the U.S. In all those cases,
voters either blocked ballot initiatives allowing legalization,
reversed legislation that made it legal, or approved amendments
to state constitutions defining marriage as between a man and a
woman.  President  Barack Obama , who carried Maine and Maryland,
made his much-delayed endorsement of same-sex marriage this
year.  According to preliminary exit polls in Maryland, about
three-fourths of those who backed ballot measure also said they
supported Obama. More than 50 percent of opponents backed  Mitt Romney . Not surprisingly, the young were most likely to back the
measure. Gay couples will be able to wed in the state starting
