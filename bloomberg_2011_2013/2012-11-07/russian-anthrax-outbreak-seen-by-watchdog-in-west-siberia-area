 Russia’s Altai region in West
Siberia has had an anthrax outbreak, said the country’s food
safety watchdog, known as Rosselkhoznadzor.  A man was diagnosed with anthrax after slaughtering a cow
in the village of Bystry Istok in mid-October, Rosselkhoznadzor
said in an e-mailed statement today. The cow might have been
infected with anthrax spores at a local pasture, the service
said. No other animals or people in the area have infection
symptoms yet. The last anthrax case in the village area was in
1964, Rosselkhoznadzor said.  The anthrax bacteria, known as Bacillus anthracis, occurs
most commonly in cattle, sheep and goats and can be lethal for
people, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s
website. The bacteria can cause skin and lung infections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
