Open interest in December futures
contracts for European Union emissions permits and United
Nations carbon offsets is declining as traders roll, or shift,
their positions into 2013 contracts.  Open interest in the December EU permit contract was 3512
million metric tons yesterday, a drop of 7.3 percent from its
peak of 378 million on Sept. 24, ICE Futures data show. Open
positions in the 2013 contract rose 15 percent in the period to
445 million tons.  Traders sometimes choose to maintain positions in the most
liquid contract, which in carbon is the one for the nearest
December. At expiry, they may either make or take delivery of
the underlying asset or cancel the holding by buying or selling
to balance their book and opening a position in a later
contract.  Open interest on ICE Futures for UN offsets for delivery in
December have dropped almost 16 percent from a peak on Oct. 8,
with interest in the December 2013 contract gaining 2.8 percent
over the same period.  For the March 2013 CER contract, the last in which many UN
offsets will be eligible in the EUâ€™s carbon market, open
interest has jumped 36 percent since Oct. 8 as traders seek to
sell these credits before they lose compliance value in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
