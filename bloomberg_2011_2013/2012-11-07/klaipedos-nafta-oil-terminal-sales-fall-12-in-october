Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) , Lithuania’s oil
terminal on the Baltic Sea, said sales decreased 12 percent in
October from the same period last year.  Sales fell to 10.1 million litai ($3.8 million) in October
from 11.4 million litai last year, the Klaipeda-based company
said in a statement to the stock exchange today. Revenue for the
first 10 months of the year was 110.8 million litai, an 8
percent drop on year, the company said.  October sales “were significantly impacted by major
maintenance at Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus and scheduled
maintenance works at Russian oil refineries that are exporting
their product through Klaipeda,” the company said. The terminal
reloaded 544,000 tons of oil products during October, 15 percent
less than a year ago, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
