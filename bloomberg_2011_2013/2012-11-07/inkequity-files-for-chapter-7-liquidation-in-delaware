ThinkEquity LLC filed to liquidate in
bankruptcy, about three weeks after the San Francisco-based
investment bank closed its stock-trading business.  The company listed assets and debts of as much as
$10 million in Chapter 7 documents filed yesterday in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington,  Delaware .  ThinkEquity Chief Executive Officer Greg Wright said Oct.
17 that the company was closing its stock-trading business amid
a market slump and preparing to transfer its remaining
investment-banking unit to another firm. He declined to identify
the other firm at the time.  ThinkEquity, which employed about 100 people, joined other
firms closing or shrinking their stock-trading businesses as
investors trade less and pay lower commissions.  The case is In re ThinkEquity LLC, 12-13034, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
