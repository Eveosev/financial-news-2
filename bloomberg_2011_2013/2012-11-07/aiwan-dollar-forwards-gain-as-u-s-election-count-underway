Taiwan dollar forwards rose to a six-
month high after U.S. President  Barack Obama  was re-elected,
easing concern that monetary easing would end should challenger
 Mitt Romney  win office.  Romney had said he wouldn’t reappoint Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke when his term expires in 2014 and had
pledged to halt bond purchases that have increased inflows to
emerging-markets assets. Foreign funds bought $113 million more
Taiwanese stocks than they sold in the first two days of this
week, exchange data show.  “It’s clearly negative for the dollar,” said  Nizam Idris ,
head of Asian fixed-income and foreign-exchange strategy at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “Relative to Romney, Obama is
willing to support Ben Bernanke’s easing policy. Asian
currencies for now are appreciating against the dollar.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.5 percent to
NT$29.068 versus the greenback as of 4:55 p.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached
NT$29.065 earlier, the strongest level since May 9, and are at a
0.5 percent premium to the exchange rate.  In the spot market, the Taiwan dollar appreciated 0.3
percent to NT$29.200 against its U.S. counterpart, data from
Taipei Forex Inc. showed. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, increased
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.59 percent.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2017
was little changed at 0.884 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was
steady at 0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
