Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  founder
 Leon Black  said Europe’s banks are still willing to sell assets
amid a dearth of such sales by the region’s lenders.  “It’s not like banks have a for sale sign on a lot of
those assets,” Black said in a speech at the Super Investor
conference in Paris today. “But they may do a deal if you can
provide a holistic solution, give them the right sticker price
and get it back in terms, or keep them on as stakeholders.”  Apollo is among hedge and private equity firms that have
amassed an unprecedented 60 billion euros ($77 billion) to buy
assets from lenders. They’ve been limited in deploying that
money after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  cut
 interest rates  three times to a record low and flooded the
financial system with cash since taking over at the helm of the
central bank last year, taking pressure off banks to sell assets
at depressed prices.  “We see more deals happening in consumer loans and real
estate, less in corporate private equity,” he said, noting that
lenders in the region face negative growth for the next 18
months and potential zero growth for years to come.  To contact the reporter on this story:
