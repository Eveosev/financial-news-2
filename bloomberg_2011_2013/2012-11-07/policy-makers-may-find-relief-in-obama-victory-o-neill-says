U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election may provide relief to world policy makers concerned
about the “unpredictability” of the  Republican Party , Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said.  “I’d say in general, better the devil you know,” he said
in a telephone interview from London. “Policy makers have had
four years of dealing with Obama’s people so they kind of know
what they are dealing with.”  Challenger Mitt Romney’s threats to label China a currency
manipulator and his “rather noisy comments” about the role of
the  Federal Reserve  -- “whether that was election hype or not -
- would cause me concern if I were a policy maker,” he said.  If Romney had won, “my guess is that most policy makers
outside the U.S. would have been worried about the
unpredictability of the Republicans and that’s part of their
problem in my opinion,” he said. “The right fringe has such
aggressive views on things. It doesn’t take into account what
the rest of the world thinks about life.”  O’Neill said he wasn’t optimistic that the Obama victory
would convince Republicans of the need to show more flexibility
in dealing with the president.  “If the Republican big-picture thought leaders are
sensible, they will encourage their people to get off their high
horse a bit. They didn’t get any mandate here. One would think
that they need to compromise as well but I’m not overly
confident about that,'' he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
