Rex Ryan  of the New York Jets was voted the National Football League’s most overrated coach in a midseason player poll conducted by the Sporting News.  Ryan received  35 votes  from the 103 players surveyed, more than twice as many as the New England Patriots’ Bill Belichick, who was named on 16 ballots.  Andy Reid  of the Philadelphia Eagles was third with nine votes, followed by Mike Shanahan of the Washington Redskins with eight.  The Jets have a 3-5 record under Ryan this season and only three other teams in the American Football Conference have scored fewer points. Ryan has a 31-25 record over four seasons in New York and took the Jets to the AFC Championship game each of his first two years.  Mike Smith  of the undefeated Atlanta Falcons and  Gary Kubiak  of the 7-1 Houston Texans tied for the NFL’s most underrated coach, with each receiving 15 votes.  Jets backup quarterback  Tim Tebow  was tabbed the NFL’s most overrated player, receiving 34 percent of the vote in results announced last week. New York’s starting quarterback, Mark Sanchez, was tied with Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys for second to Tebow with 8 percent.  Eagles quarterback Michael Vick topped the voting as the NFL’s most disappointing player, named on 16 ballots with Philadelphia off to a 3-5 start. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton was second with 15 votes.  The Patriots were voted the league’s best organization in the Sporting News poll, receiving 34 votes to 21 for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Cleveland Browns edged Jacksonville and Oakland as the league’s worst organization, with 20 votes to 19 each for the Jaguars and Raiders.
