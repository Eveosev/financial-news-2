The recession in Cyprus will be
longer and deeper than previously forecast as the country tries
to rein in its  budget deficit  and investor confidence sours,
according to the European Commission.  Gross domestic product will fall 2.3 percent this year, 1.7
percent in 2013 and 0.7 percent in 2014, the European Union’s
executive arm said in its autumn economic forecast, released
today in Brussels. The commission previously forecast a 0.8
percent contraction in 2012 followed by a return to growth next
year.  “The weakness of economic activity seen in the second half
of 2011 is expected to intensify in 2012,” the commission said
in the report. “The fiscal consolidation effort that has been
pursued, the rapid deterioration in labor market conditions and
the high degree of economic uncertainty have together weighed
heavily on private consumption.”  Cyprus, whose banks took large losses from  Greece ’s
sovereign debt restructuring this year, became the fifth of the
euro area’s 17 member states to seek a bailout in June as its
biggest lenders, Bank of Cyprus Pcl and  Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (CPBANK) ,
sought state support. Its officials are in talks with the so-
called troika that oversees euro-area rescue programs.  The Cypriot government’s budget gap is seen at 5.3 percent
of GDP this year, widening to 5.7 percent next year and 6
percent in 2014 if no new measures are taken. Public debt will
climb to 96.7 percent of GDP in 2013 from 89.7 percent this
year, and will reach 102.7 percent in 2014, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
