Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) ’s bid for  ThyssenKrupp
AG (TKA) ’s Inoxum unit won European Union approval after it agreed to
sell an Italian steel mill.  Outokumpu’s offer to sell Inoxum’s stainless steel
production facility at Terni and several European service
centers alleviates the European Commission’s concerns that the
deal might allow the companies raise prices of cold-rolled steel
products, the Brussels-based regulator said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The divestment of the Italian Terni plant ensures that
the creation of a new European market leader will not be
detrimental for consumers and businesses in Europe,” said EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  in the statement.  The Espoo, Finland-based steelmaker agreed to buy Inoxum on
Jan. 31 in a deal valuing the German unit at about 2.7 billion
euros ($3.5 billion.) The EU conditions also include an option
for the plant’s buyer to purchase Terni’s forge and a bright-
annealing production line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
