Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-
biggest insurer, said third-quarter revenue fell 10 percent as
the euro area’s debt crisis eroded consumer demand and the
British economy struggled to emerge from a recession.  Total covered sales slumped to 278 million pounds ($446
million) from 308 million pounds a year earlier, London-based
Old Mutual said in a statement today. That beat the 275 million-
pound estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by the company.  “U.K. savings trends remain depressed by low  consumer
confidence  and pressure on household finances,” Chief Executive
Officer Julian Roberts said in a statement released in London
and Johannesburg today.  Old Mutual, which is Africa’s largest insurer, operates in
Europe, the U.K. and  South Africa . CEO Roberts and his team
created a three-year strategy to reduce debt, cut costs and
achieve a return on equity of 15 percent. While the sale of
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and the initial public offering of its U.S.
asset management unit fell through, the insurer has sold U.S.
Life and part of its Skandia operations.  “In the short term, the sector will continue to be
challenged by external factors,” Roberts said.  The company’s shares dropped 1.3 percent to 23.65 rand at
the close in Johannesburg and 3 percent to 168.8 pence in London
trading. Old Mutual is the fourth-best performing stock on the
eight-member  FTSE 350 Life Insurance Index (F3LIFE)  this year, having
gained 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
