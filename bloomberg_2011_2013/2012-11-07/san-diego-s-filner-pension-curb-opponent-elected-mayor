Democratic congressman Bob Filner,
who has represented parts of  San Diego  and the border since
1993, was elected mayor of the eighth-largest U.S. city.  Filner, 70, beat San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, a
Republican who led a successful initiative to replace city
employees’ guaranteed pensions with 401(k)-style plans, 51.5
percent to 48.5 percent,  according  to San Diego County vote
data. Filner had called the pension changes a “fraud.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
