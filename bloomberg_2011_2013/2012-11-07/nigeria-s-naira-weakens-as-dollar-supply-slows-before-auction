Nigeria ’s naira weakened against the
dollar on importer demand for the U.S. currency after the
central bank cut foreign exchange supply at auctions this week.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest crude producer retreated
0.2 percent to 157.3 a dollar as of 4 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has gained 3.2 percent this year,
the second-best performance in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $50 million at an auction
today, bringing sales this week to $79.9 million compared with
$93.5 million last week, it said in an e-mailed statement. The
regulator sells dollars at twice-weekly auctions on Mondays and
Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3 percent band around 155
per dollar.  The naira is likely to remain under pressure due to an
“imbalance between dollar supply and demand,” Kunle Ezun and
Kenneth Asenime, analysts at Ecobank Transnational Inc. in
Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The central bank, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left
the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a record 12 percent
this year, increased lenders’ reserve requirements and limited
access to money auctions to stop dealers from buying foreign
currency using naira purchased from the bank at a discount.  The yield on the nation’s 16.39 percent naira debt due
January 2022 fell 11 basis points to 12.78 percent, according to
today’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association. The yield on the country’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due January 2021 slipped seven basis points to 4.321
percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent at 1.8811 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
