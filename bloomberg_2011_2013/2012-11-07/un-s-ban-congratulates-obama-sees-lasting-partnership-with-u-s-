United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated President  Barack Obama  on his re-election
and said he looks forward to working with the administration
“in the spirit of the enduring partnership” between the U.S.
and the UN.  “Many challenges lie ahead, from ending the bloodshed in
Syria, to getting the Middle East peace process back on track,
to promoting sustainable development and tackling the challenges
posed by  climate change ,” Ban said in an e-mailed statement
today. “All will require strong multilateral cooperation” and
the UN counts on the “active engagement” of the U.S. on these
and other issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
