Novak Djokovic fought back from a set
down to defeat U.S. Open champion  Andy Murray  at the ATP World
World Tour Finals in a re-match of their U.S. Open championship
match.   The world No. 1 from Serbia defeated the third-ranked
Murray from Britain, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a group match at the
season-ending tournament at London’s O2 arena.  It was the seventh meeting this season between the two men,
who first played each other as juniors when they were 13 years
old.   Djokovic, who now leads Murray 10-7, will move to the
semifinals should France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeat former
Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych of the  Czech Republic  later in
the day in the other group match.    The ATP World Tour Finals feature a round-robin format. The
world’s best eight singles players and doubles pairs are divided
into two groups of four, with the top two in each section moving
into the knockout semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
