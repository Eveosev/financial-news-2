Kloeckner & Co. SE,  Europe ’s largest
independent steel trader, stepped up plans to cut jobs after
lowering its profit outlook for the second time this year as the
sovereign debt crisis weakened demand.  The company will eliminate in excess of 1,800 posts,
equivalent to more than 16 percent of the workforce, compared
with an earlier target of 1,300.  “We don’t see any growth impulses at all for Europe in the
next year,” Chief Executive Officer Gisbert Ruehl said today on
a conference call.  Kloeckner expects full-year earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 130 million euros to 140
million euros ($167 million to $180 million), excluding
restructuring costs of at least 40 million euros. That compared
with Ebitda of 217 million euros a year earlier, the Duisburg,
Germany-based company said in a statement.  So far, 800 jobs have already been cut. About 20 offices
out of 290 have been shuttered, and 40 more closures will
follow.  Kloeckner gained 3.2 percent and closed at a six-week high
of 7.88 euros in Frankfurt trading.  Tumbling demand from the auto and construction industries
has squeezed profit margins at European steel companies.
 Salzgitter AG (SZG) ,  Germany ’s second-largest steelmaker, cut its
profit forecast on Nov. 5.  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
producer, said last week that third-quarter Ebitda dropped 44
percent to $1.34 billion.  Third-quarter Ebitda at Kloeckner fell 49 percent to 19
million euros, missing the 21.3 million-euro average of 11
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company seeks to
increase Ebitda by an annual 150 million euros from 2014.  Kloeckner reported its fifth consecutive quarterly net
loss, of 27 million euros, compared with 11 million euros a year
earlier. The average estimate of eight analysts was for a net
loss of 21.6 million euros.  Kloeckner on Aug. 8 had forecast Ebitda of about 170
million euros, excluding restructuring costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
