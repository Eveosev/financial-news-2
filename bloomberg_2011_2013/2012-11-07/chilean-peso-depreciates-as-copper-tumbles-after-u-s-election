Chile’s peso fell as copper, the
nation’s top export, tumbled amid concern U.S. President  Barack
Obama  may clash with Congress on policies intended to address
the so-called “fiscal cliff” in the world’s largest economy.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 479.60 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:14 a.m. in Santiago after earlier appreciating to 478.3 per
dollar.  Copper dropped 1.4 percent on the Comex in  New York  on
concern Obama, who was re-elected yesterday, may fail to reach
an agreement with Republican lawmakers as they seek to address
the $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to be
implemented next year. The  dollar rose  against major trading
partners after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
risks of inflation in the euro area were very low and that the
region’s fiscal crisis was starting to affect  Germany .  “The world is weakening, copper and oil are falling, the
euro is down and the dollar is stronger,” said Cristian Donoso,
a currency trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “The deterioration in external markets is now being
reflected in the currency.”  Chilean  imports  reached a record $7.25 billion in October,
rising 26 percent from a year earlier, according to data
published today by the central bank. Copper exports as a share
of total exports reached 60.6 percent, the most since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
