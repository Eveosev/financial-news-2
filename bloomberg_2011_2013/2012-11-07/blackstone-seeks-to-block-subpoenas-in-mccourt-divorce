Blackstone Group (BX) , which advised on
the $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is seeking to
block subpoenas from Jamie McCourt, former team owner Frank McCourt’s ex-wife, in her bid to set aside a divorce settlement.  Jamie McCourt, who claims her $131 million settlement is
unfair, issued subpoenas that seek information related to
valuation of assets, according to papers filed Nov. 5 in  New
York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  The subpoenas issued to Blackstone and senior managing
director Peter Cohen, who worked on the Dodgers sale, are
“vastly overbroad and seek materials that are completely
irrelevant” to asset valuations, Blackstone said.  Jamie McCourt, in a request filed in September in
California state court in Los Angeles, said the divorce
settlement was based on fraud and should be set aside. To induce
her to accept the $131 million,  Frank McCourt  claimed the value
of their assets was less than $300 million, according to her
request. The sale of the Major League Baseball team left Frank
McCourt with $1.7 billion, she said.  Bertram Fields, an attorney for Jamie McCourt, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment about the Blackstone filing.  The case is In the matter of the application of Blackstone
Advisory Partners, 653823-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
