Democratic U.S. Senator  Bob Casey  of  Pennsylvania  won a second term.  Casey defeated Republican businessman  Tom Smith , an anti- tax Tea Party-backed challenger who spent $17 million of his own money on his campaign.  Casey touted his record in the Senate, including his efforts on behalf of veterans as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. He contended that Smith’s positions were out of step with the state.  An opponent of abortion, Casey, 52, supported President  Barack Obama ’s health-care bill that expanded insurance coverage to 30 million people. He did so after working to develop language ensuring that federal subsidies for health insurance couldn’t be used to pay for abortions.  Casey raised $12 million in campaign contributions while Smith received $3 million, in addition to the money he spent on his campaign.  Smith, 65, is a coal-mine worker who later owned coal companies. A former Democrat, he defeated four rivals to win the Republican primary in April.  He was endorsed by Tea Party-aligned FreedomWorks, whose super-political action committee spent more than $1 million on his behalf. That’s more than was spent by other outside groups in the race, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, endorsed Smith. Casey supported the chamber-backed 2009 economic stimulus plan.  Smith, who opposes abortion in all circumstances, was criticized for a comment he made in August suggesting that a woman impregnated by a rapist faced a similar decision to one contemplating whether to give birth out of wedlock. His comment came days after the Republican Senate nominee in  Missouri , Todd Akin, said victims of “legitimate rape” rarely become pregnant.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan D.
