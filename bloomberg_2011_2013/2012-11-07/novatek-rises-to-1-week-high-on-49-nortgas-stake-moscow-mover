OAO Novatek rallied to a one-week
high on investor optimism  Russia ’s biggest non-state natural gas
producer’s acquisition of a 49 percent stake in ZAO Nortgas will
increase gas production.  Novatek rose 2.3 percent to 332.91 rubles by 1:59 p.m. in
Moscow, the highest intraday level since Nov. 1. The amount of
shares traded was 1.18 million, equivalent to 78 percent of the
three-month average. The 10-day  volatility  on the Moscow-traded
shares jumped to 54.3, the highest since May 12.  Novatek said yesterday it agreed to buy a stake in Nortgas
from Farkhad Akhmedov’s REDI Holdings for $1.375 billion, and
expects to close the deal by the end of the year. OAO Gazprom
holds the remaining 51 percent in Nortgas.  “We see the news as positive for Novatek, as it confirms
the company’s growth prospects,” UralSib Capital analysts led
by Alexei Kokin said in an e-mailed note. “We note the
proximity of the acquired assets to existent infrastructure,
which should lead to some production and development benefits.”  UralSib expects the stake acquisition to boost Novatek’s
gas production by 3 percent and its total reserves by 9 percent
next year, according to the report. UralSib reiterated its buy
recommendation.  Novatek’s global depositary receipts gained 2.6 percent to
$108.70 in  London , the highest intraday since Oct. 31. The
