Africa requires $360 billion of
infrastructure investment in the next 30 years to spur
industrial growth, said  Donald Kaberuka , president of Africa
Development Bank.  Improvements in energy, transport and information
technology would reduce the continent’s reliance on agriculture,
Kaberuka said yesterday in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. The
Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa projects energy
demand to grow sixfold, maritime traffic as much as eightfold
and demand for IT 20-fold in the period, he said.  Private capital, mobilized through infrastructure bonds,
can provide financing for an economic transformation, Kaberuka
said. Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia are already using the
instruments, he said.  “Infrastructure bonds have become important for the
mobilization of infrastructure financing and the development of
domestic  capital markets ,” he said in a speech sent by e-mail
today by Uganda’s central bank.  Oil discoveries in Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda and Kenya as
well as gas in Tanzania and Mozambique and other natural
resources will enhance the transformation if well managed, he
said. Intra-African and regional trade must also be developed,
Kaberuka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
