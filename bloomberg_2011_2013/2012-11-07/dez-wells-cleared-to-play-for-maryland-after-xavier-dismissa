Guard/forward Dez Wells was cleared
to immediately join the  University of Maryland  basketball team
after being dismissed from  Xavier University  in a sexual-assault
case.  Transfers usually are required to sit out a season.
Maryland appealed to the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association , which granted the waiver, the College Park-based
school said on its  website .  Wells was expelled from the Cincinnati, Ohio, school in
August following a sexual-assault allegation. An Ohio grand jury
chose not to prosecute.  “At the end of the day, the NCAA made the right
decision,” Maryland coach Mark Turgeon said in a statement.
“This has been a long process for him and his family, and we’re
grateful he can put it behind him.”  Wells also was one of eight players suspended following a
bench-clearing brawl during a Dec. 10 game between Xavier and
the University of Cincinnati. A chest-to-chest shouting match
between Xavier’s Tu Holloway and Cincinnati’s Ge’Lawn Guyn
escalated when Wells shoved Guyn. He received a four-game ban.  Wells, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, started all 32 games he played
at Xavier last season, averaging 9.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per
contest.  The Terrapins open their season Nov. 9 against the
defending national-champion University of  Kentucky  at the
Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. It’s the first college
basketball game at the new arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
