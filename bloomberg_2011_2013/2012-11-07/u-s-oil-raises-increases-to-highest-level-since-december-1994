U.S. oil  production  rose to the
highest in almost 18 years as a shale drilling boom cut reliance
on foreign fuel and nudged the country closer to energy
independence.  Output swelled by 8,000 barrels to 6.68 million barrels a
day in the week ended Nov. 2, the Energy Department reported
today. It was the most since Dec. 23, 1994. Improvements in
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have
unlocked fuel trapped in deep underground rock formations in
states such as  North Dakota ,  Texas  and  Oklahoma .  The U.S. met 83% of its energy needs in first six months of
2012, on track to be the highest annual level since 1991,
according to department data compiled by Bloomberg. Production
advanced 31 percent this year in North Dakota, 19 percent in
Texas and 11 percent in Oklahoma, department records show. Crude
 imports  have declined 11 percent this year.  “Every added barrel we make here is another barrel we
don’t need from somewhere else,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of
commodities research at IAF Advisors, a Houston consulting firm.
“U.S. production could reach 9 million to 10 million barrels
per day in another five to 10 years.”  Oil fell $3.59 a barrel, or 4.1 percent, to $85.12 on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange at 12:19 p.m. Futures have declined
14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
