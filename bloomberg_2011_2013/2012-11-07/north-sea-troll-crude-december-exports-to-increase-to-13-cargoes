Exports of North Sea Troll crude in
December will increase to 13 cargoes, one more than November, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The plan comprises 12 consignments of 600,000 barrels each
and one shipment of 1 million barrels. This compares with 12
lots of 600,000 barrels for November.  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norwayâ€™s largest oil company, operates the
Troll field. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
