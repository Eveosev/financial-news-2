Democratic Representative Tammy Baldwin won Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race over former Governor
 Tommy Thompson , a Republican, making her the state’s first
female senator.  Baldwin will take the seat of retiring Democratic Senator
 Herb Kohl . Thompson was the state’s longest-serving governor and
former U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services under
President  George W. Bush . He won his party’s four-way primary by
3 percentage points.  “Tonight we have won a huge victory for Wisconsin’s middle
class,” Baldwin told supporters. “I didn’t run to make
history, I ran to make a difference.”  Baldwin, a Madison-born lawyer with strong approval ratings
from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and
Americans for Democratic Action, will become the first openly
gay senator. Sexual orientation was rarely discussed in the
campaign, which centered on the economy and the loss of
manufacturing jobs in the state.  President Barack Obama also won Wisconsin, capturing a
state that has voted Democratic in every presidential election
since 1988. In June, Republican Governor  Scott Walker  survived a
recall vote in the polarized state of 5.7 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
