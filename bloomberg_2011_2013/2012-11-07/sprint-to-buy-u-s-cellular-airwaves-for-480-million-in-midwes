Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, agreed to buy Midwestern airwaves
and customers from U.S. Cellular Corp. for $480 million.  The spectrum is in the so-called PCS band and spans parts
of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, Sprint said
today in a statement. The Overland Park, Kansas-based company
plans to use the airwaves to bolster its wireless coverage as it
rolls out a new network based on a technology called long-term
evolution, or LTE.  Sprint, which received $3.1 billion in cash last month as
part of a $20 billion investment from  Softbank Corp. (9984) , is putting
some of that money to work in a network expansion race against
competitors including Verizon Wireless and  AT&T Inc. (T)   “Acquiring this spectrum will significantly increase
Sprint’s network capacity and improve the customer experience in
several important Midwest markets including Chicago and St.
Louis,” Sprint Chief Executive Officer  Dan Hesse  said in the
statement.  Under the deal, which is expected to be completed in
mid-2013, Sprint will pay cash and assume liabilities.  Sprint  fell  1.9 percent to $5.62 at the close in New York.
The stock had more than doubled this year. Chicago-based U.S.
Cellular fell 12 percent to $34.18, the biggest drop since Oct.
10, 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
