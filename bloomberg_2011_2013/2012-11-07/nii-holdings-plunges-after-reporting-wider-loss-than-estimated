NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD)  , the Latin America
mobile-phone carrier that offers service under the Nextel brand,
fell the most in almost two months after posting a wider loss
than analysts had estimated.  The shares plunged 6.7 percent to $6.60 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since Sept. 10. The stock has lost 69
percent of its value this year.  NII’s average revenue per user dropped almost $12 to $37
last quarter, hurt by price competition and weaker local
currency exchange rates. The company also has been trying to cut
less-lucrative subscribers from its customer rolls in  Brazil ,
leading to higher churn in the short term.  The net loss widened to $82.4 million, or 48 cents a share,
compared with a break-even quarter a year earlier, the Reston,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
estimated a loss of 28 cents on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 15 percent to $1.42 billion,
missing the $1.49 billion projected by analysts.  “I’m disappointed,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Dussek
said on a conference call. “Our current performance is not
acceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
