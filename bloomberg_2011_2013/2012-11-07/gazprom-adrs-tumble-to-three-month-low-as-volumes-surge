OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s largest
natural gas producer, tumbled to the lowest level in three
months in  New York  as trading volumes jumped to more than six
times the daily average over the past three months.  American depositary receipts  of state-run Gazprom, Russia’s
biggest company, sank 2.6 percent to $9.04, the lowest since
Aug. 2. Volumes rose to 654 percent of the three-month average,
while 10-day volatility on the ADRs held at 34.3, the highest
reading since Sept. 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, fell the most this
year in New York trading as Greece’s debt woes and concerns over
the so-called fiscal cliff in the U.S. dent the outlook for
global energy demand. Moscow-based Gazprom links its gas
contracts to  oil prices  and refined products with a time lag, a
method that dates back to the 1970s, when the fuels were more
commonly used in power generation.  President  Barack Obama , re-elected yesterday, now faces
negotiating with Congress to avoid more than $600 billion in
mandated tax gains and spending cuts from next year. Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras is seeking parliamentary approval today
for more budget cuts to get bailout funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
