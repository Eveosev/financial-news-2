Krajinapetrol AD (KRPTRA) , Bosnia-
Herzegovina’s oil and gas retailer, is seeking takeover by  INA
Industrija Nafte d.d ., a Croatian refiner controlled by
Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported, citing people it
didn’t identify.  The Banja Luka-based company owns 14 gas stations in
addition to gas and oil storage terminals, according to
Poslovni. The company’s assets belonged to INA before the
breakup of former  Yugoslavia  in 1991 and INA in the past has
sued for their return, the Zagreb-based business newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
