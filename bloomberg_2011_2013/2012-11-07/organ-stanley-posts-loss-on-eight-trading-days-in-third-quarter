Morgan Stanley (MS) , the Wall Street bank
with the biggest trading-revenue increase last quarter, lost
money in that business on eight days in the period, down from 31
days a year earlier.  Traders generated more than $100 million on nine days in
the period, compared with two days in the third quarter of 2011,
the New York-based company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. None of the daily losses exceeded the bank’s so-called
value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading losses.  Morgan Stanley had a 40 percent quarter-over-quarter
increase in trading revenue, excluding accounting charges, led
by an 89 percent jump in fixed-income revenue. Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said last month that clients returned to
dealing with the firm after shying away in the second quarter as
Moody’s Investors Service reviewed its ratings. Moody’s cut the
bank’s credit grade two levels in June.  Colm Kelleher, who runs Morgan Stanley’s trading business,
will take over the investment-banking unit as Paul J. Taubman,
Kelleher’s co-president of institutional securities, leaves at
year-end. The company announced plans to reduce so-called risk-
weighted assets in the fixed-income trading unit by at least 35
percent from the third quarter of 2011 through the end of 2014.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-largest U.S. lender, said
in a filing last week that it had one day of trading losses,
which were less than $1 million, and one day of revenue of more
than $100 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
