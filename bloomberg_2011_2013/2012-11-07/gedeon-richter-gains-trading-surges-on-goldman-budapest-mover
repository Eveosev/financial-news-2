Gedeon  Richter Nyrt . recovered from a
three-week low as Goldman Sachs Group Plc. raised the price
projection for  Hungary ’s biggest drugmaker and KBC Groep NV said
it was “more upbeat” on the company’s prospects.  The stock rose 0.1 percent to 40,310 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest, with share turnover double the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Richter
pared gains of as much as 0.8 percent after the European
Commission cut its growth forecasts for the euro area.  Goldman increased Richter’s price estimate to 42,900 forint
from 41,900, keeping its recommendation at neutral. The company
expects a 3 percent increase in sales this year in euro terms,
compared with an earlier estimate for no change, and it sees a
more stable tax environment thanks to a deal with the government
last week, Chief Executive Officer Erik Bogsch said yesterday.  Bogsch’s comments “made us more upbeat about the prospects
of the company,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at
 KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker unit, wrote in a research report today.  Goldman raised its target because of a more positive
outlook for the drugmaker’s profitability, according to a
research report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
