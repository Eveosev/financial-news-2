Mark McGwire  was hired as hitting
coach of the  Los Angeles Dodgers , joining a team that scored the
fifth-fewest runs in Major League Baseball last season.  McGwire spent the past three seasons in the same role with
the  St. Louis Cardinals , who had a National League-best .269
batting average and .337 on-base percentage while scoring the
second-most runs in the league.  A 12-time All-Star whose 583 career home runs rank 10th in
major-league history, the 49-year-old McGwire replaces Dave Hansen as the Dodgers’ seventh hitting coach in eight seasons.
Hansen was fired last month after the Dodgers (86-76) posted a
.252 batting average and scored 637 runs, the fewest of any
major-league team with a winning record.  “He (McGwire) earned the respect of both veterans and
young players while in  St. Louis  and the offensive numbers the
Cardinals produced under his tutelage speak for themselves,”
Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti said in an e-mailed
statement.  The Cardinals won the World Series title in 2011 with
McGwire as their hitting coach and batted a NL-best .274 with
runners in scoring position over the past three seasons.  McGwire, who lives in Irvine, California, and played
college baseball at the University of Southern California in Los
Angeles, had said earlier this week that he wouldn’t return as
the Cardinals’ hitting coach. He has admitted using steroids
during his playing career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
