The earnings of Britainâ€™s bottom 1
percent of workers have risen faster than those of the top 1
percent since 1998, as a result of the adoption of the  minimum
wage .  Workers at the bottom of the income scale saw their
earnings increase by 51 percent between 1998 and 2011, the
 Office for National Statistics  said in  London  today. The top 1
percent had a gain of 30 percent over the same period.  Britain introduced a legally binding national minimum wage
in April 1999 under the Labour government of  Tony Blair .
Overall, full-time employees earned 62 percent more after
adjusting for inflation than they did in 1986, despite an
erosion in pay since the financial crisis began in 2007, the
statistics office said.  Since 1986, higher earners have done better than those
further down the scale. The top 10 percent enjoyed a real wage
increase of 81 percent, with the earnings of the top 1 percent
surging 117 percent, the ONS said. The bottom 10 percent saw
their incomes rise by 47 percent, though the very lowest-paid
gained 70 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
