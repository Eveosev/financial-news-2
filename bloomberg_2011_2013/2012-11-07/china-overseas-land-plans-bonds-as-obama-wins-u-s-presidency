China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) 
is marketing dollar-denominated debt as  Gemdale Corp. (600383) ,  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  and Global A&T Electronics Ltd. plan
offerings. U.S. voters re-elected  Barack Obama  as president.  China Overseas Land, a Hong Kong-based developer, plans to
sell a total $1 billion of bonds, split between 10-year and 30-
year maturities, according to a person familiar with the matter.
High-yield sales in Asia excluding Japan have risen by 41
percent to $1.2 billion since Oct. 29 from the prior two-week
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gemdale, the
third-largest real estate developer listed on the Shanghai stock
exchange, casino operator Melco Crown and Global A&T Electronics
have hired banks to meet investors.  “Obama’s victory will probably bring on a risk-on
sentiment,” said Glenn Hodgeman, the Sydney-based global head
of credit trading at Westpac Banking Corp. “There is a good
chance that credit spreads will tighten.”  Yields on Asian non-investment grade notes, rated Ba1 or
lower by Moody’s Investors Service, fell to a record low of 6.13
percent yesterday, according to HSBC Holdings Plc indexes. Obama
defeated Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  to win a second four-
year term. Obama had captured 303 Electoral College votes,
beyond the 270 needed to win the White House.  China Overseas Land is offering $700 million of 10-year
securities at a yield premium of between 235 basis points and
240 basis points more than Treasuries, and $300 million of 30-
year debt at a spread of 255 basis points to 260 basis points,
the person said, who asked not to be identified because the
terms aren’t final.  Gemdale Meetings  Gemdale hired HSBC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to arrange
meetings with investors in Hong Kong and Singapore from
tomorrow, another person familiar with the matter said. Melco
Crown is expected to sell $825 million of eight-year notes while
Global A&T Electronics is looking at a $625 million sale of six-
year bonds.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell one basis point from yesterday’s
close to 113 basis points as of 5:26 p.m. in Hong Kong, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose one basis point from
yesterday’s close to 138 as of 4:18 p.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That’s up from 136 as
of 11:47 a.m., ANZ prices show.  Default Swaps  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 6 basis points to
194 from yesterday’s close as of 6:22 p.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup
Inc. prices show. The gauge has ranged from 168.5 to 229.5 this
half, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
