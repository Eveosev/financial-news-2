Portuguese dock workers extended a
strike in at least four ports until Nov. 28 as they protest
against a plan to change labor rules, a union official said
today.  “We will continue to strike until the government and
unions reach an agreement,” Vitor Dias, head of the Stevedores’
Union of Central and Southern  Portugal , which represents about
300 workers, said in an interview today.  The strike, which began before the government approved a
 draft law  on Sept. 20 to make employment practices in the sector
more flexible and reduce exporting costs, was due to end next
week, according to Dias. Dock workers at ports in Lisbon,
Setubal, Aveiro and Figueira da Foz are expected to join the
protest, he said.  Portuguese holding company  Semapa-Sociedade de Investimento
e Gestao  SGPS SA said on Oct. 26 that the strikes were slowing
down its ability to export the cement and paper it produces in
Portugal. The government proposal still has to be voted in
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
