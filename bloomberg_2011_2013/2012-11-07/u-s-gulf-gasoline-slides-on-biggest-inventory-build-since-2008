Gasoline dropped for a second day in
the U.S. Gulf Coast as the area’s  stockpiles  of motor fuel grew
last week the most since 2008 after  Hurricane Sandy  shut the
largest pipeline between the Gulf and the northeast U.S.  Supplies in the region, known as Padd 3, increased by 4.62
million barrels to 75.1 million in the week ended Nov. 2, the
Energy Department reported today. That’s the biggest rise since
Oct. 3, 2008, and the highest level this year. Total U.S.
inventories grew by 2.89 million barrels to 202.4 million, data
from the department show.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf Coast dropped 0.25 cent to a  discount  of 11.25 cents a
gallon versus futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
3:40 p.m., a second consecutive decline.  Colonial Pipeline Co. shut the 825,000-barrel-a-day Line 3,
which runs between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Linden, New
Jersey, after the storm cut power to fuel distribution terminals
in the Linden area.  The same fuel weakened 3 cents in  New York  Harbor to 20
cents a gallon over futures at 3:14 p.m.  Eighteen tankers carrying petroleum and chemical products
are expected to arrive in the area over the next four days,
according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Four of the ships are
carrying gasoline, and four hold naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
