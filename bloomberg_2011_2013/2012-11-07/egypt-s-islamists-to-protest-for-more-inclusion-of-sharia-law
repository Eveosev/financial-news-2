Islamist parties and groups have
called for demonstrations on Nov. 9, demanding greater inclusion
of Islamic law in  Egypt ’s forthcoming constitution.  The statement called on people in different governorates to
participate and oppose “the dangers facing Egypt and Islam,”
and to counter attempts by liberals and seculars to change the
identity of Egypt.  Egypt’s Muslim brotherhood said in an e-mailed statement
that it won’t be participating in Friday’s protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
