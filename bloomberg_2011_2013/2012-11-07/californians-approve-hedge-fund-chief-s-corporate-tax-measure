California  voters passed a ballot
initiative financed by hedge fund executive Thomas Steyer that
strips out-of-state corporations of an option for lowering their
state income taxes.  The measure was winning 59.5 percent to 40.5 percent, with
58 percent of the precincts counted, according to the  Associated
Press .  The initiative requires corporations to base their tax
solely on in-state sales, rather than a formula that let some
pay less by factoring in their property and workforce in
California. It will raise about $1 billion annually, with half
set aside for the state’s general fund and half for energy-
efficiency programs.  Steyer, who announced last month that he was stepping down
as chairman of $20 billion hedge fund Farallon Capital
Management LLC in  San Francisco , spent $29.5 million of his
personal fortune on the measure.  Under previous law, businesses engaged in agriculture,
mining and banking had to base their corporate taxes equally on
payroll, property and sales in California, according to the
state Finance Department. Other companies were allowed to choose
between a formula in which 50 percent of taxes were based on
California sales and 25 percent were based on property and 25
percent on other sales, and one in which 100 percent was based
on sales.  The rule was put in place as part of a deal Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  struck with fellow Republicans in 2009 to get
them to agree to raise taxes to help erase a $35 billion
deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
