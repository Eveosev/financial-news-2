There was never much doubt
who was going to win Indiana tonight:  Mitt Romney  has
taken the state back from President Barack Obama fairly
easily. But we can still learn something from the
returns in this early-closing state.  The best microcosm may be Vigo County, on the
Illinois border, west of Indianapolis. Since 1888, the
residents of the county seat, Terre Haute, have sided
with the  presidential winner  in all but two races. In
2008, Obama won the county by nearly 16 percent over
 John McCain , more than  two and a half times  the cushion
 George W. Bush  had over  John Kerry  in 2004.  Tonight, with 92 percent of  precincts reporting ,
Obama is up on Romney by a slender 2 percentage points.
(Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, the darling of
Reason magazine and bugbear of my colleague  Josh Barro ,
is playing spoiler with 2 percent.) Equally interesting
is the Senate race, which has Democrat Joe Donnelly up
big on Republican  Richard Mourdock , 58 percent to 36
percent.  What to make of it? It’s a bad omen for Mourdock,
who was a sure thing until he made comments about
pregnancy caused by rape being something “God intended
to happen.” Indiana Republicans might have buyers’
remorse after choosing Mourdock over longtime incumbent
Dick Lugar in the primaries.  As for Obama and Romney, we’ve got more than 10,000
votes yet to be counted before one can know that
history is on his side.  (Tobin Harshaw writes editorials on national
