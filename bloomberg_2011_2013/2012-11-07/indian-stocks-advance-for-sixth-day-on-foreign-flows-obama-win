Indian stocks advanced for a sixth
day, led by banks and automakers, as foreign investors raised
holdings of local shares and after U.S. President  Barack Obama 
won re-election.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.4 percent
to 18,891.80, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, its highest close since Oct. 5.  State Bank of
India , the largest, climbed 1.7 percent.  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS) , which gets at least half its revenue from  North
America , led other Indian software exporters higher.  Overseas funds were buyers of local equities for a fourth
day on Nov. 5, purchasing a net $76 million of shares, data from
the regulator show. Obama defeated Republican  Mitt Romney ,
winning at least 303 electoral votes in yesterday’s election
with 270 needed for a second term. His victory increases the
odds that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain stimulus
measures designed to boost the world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
