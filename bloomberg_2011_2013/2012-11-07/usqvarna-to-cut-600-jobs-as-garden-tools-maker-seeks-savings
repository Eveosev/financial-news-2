Husqvarna AB (HUSQB) , the world’s biggest
maker of powered garden tools, plans to cut about 600 jobs in a
move that will save 220 million kronor ($33 million) a year by
2014.  “The proposed measures aim to improve efficiency, reduce
the fixed cost base and further increase flexibility,” Chief
Executive Officer Hans Linnarson said in a statement.  Almost half the job losses will come in  Sweden , mainly in
Huskvarna, where the company is based, it said. The cuts will be
carried out during the first six months of next year after
negotiations with unions. The cuts will cost about 250 million
kronor to implement, which will be charged to fourth-quarter
operating income, the company said.  The  maker  of lawnmowers, chainsaws and other tools under
the McCulloch, Gardena and Husqvarna brands has seen its shares
rise 26 percent this year in  Stockholm , compared with an 9.1
percent increase in the Stockholm  SAX index .  The company, with about 15,860 employees at the end of the
third quarter, has about 40 percent of its sales in the Americas
and said Oct. 26 that demand there and in  Europe  continued to be
challenging during the third quarter.  The company’s stock rose 0.5 percent to 39.95 kronor as of
9:15 a.m. in Stockholm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
