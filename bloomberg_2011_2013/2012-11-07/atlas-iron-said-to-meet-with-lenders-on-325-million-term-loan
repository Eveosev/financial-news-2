Atlas Iron Ltd. (AGO)  will meet with
lenders on Nov. 14 in New York to discuss a $325 million term
loan the company is seeking for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.   Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the five-year financing
for the Australian iron ore producer and will also hold a
conference call tomorrow to review the transaction, the person
said, who asked not to be identified because the information is
private.      Lenders are being offered call protection of 102 cents
during the first year, the person said. The premium to refinance
the debt will drop to 1 cent more than face value in the second
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
