The college basketball game on the
flight deck of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Midway between
 Syracuse University  and  San Diego State University  was postponed
two days and moved to the early afternoon by forecasts of rain.  The game will remain on the top deck of the decommissioned
ship, which is now a  San Diego  museum, according to the
athletics websites of the two schools. Tip-off is scheduled for
1 p.m. San Diego time on Nov. 11.  The  National Weather Service  forecasts a 70 percent chance
of rain and low temperatures of 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13
Celsius) on the night of Nov. 9, when the game was originally
scheduled. The afternoon of Nov. 11 is forecast to be mostly
sunny with a high of 68 degrees.  The game remains the season-opening contest for Syracuse,
No. 9 in the preseason  Associated Press  poll, and San Diego
State, ranked No. 20. San Diego State moved its scheduled Nov.
11 home game against San Diego Christian College to Nov. 13 to
accommodate the change.  Syracuse advanced to the quarterfinals of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament last season, while
San Diego State lost in the second round.  The University of North Carolina and  Michigan State
University  played a game on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Carl
Vinson last year, also in San Diego. The Midway deck seats about
5,200 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
