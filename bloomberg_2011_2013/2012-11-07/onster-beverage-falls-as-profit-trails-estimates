Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  tumbled to its
lowest price in more than a year after posting third-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates as sales growth slowed.  The shares  slid  11 percent to $40.11 at 9:34 a.m. in New
York and earlier traded at $39.99, the lowest price since
October 2011. The Corona, California-based company had fallen
2.4 percent this year through yesterday.  Third-quarter net income rose 4.6 percent to $86.1 million,
or 47 cents a share, from $82.4 million, or 44 cents, a year
earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement. The average
 estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 55 cents.
Sales rose 14 percent to $541.9 million. Analysts’ estimated
$578.4 million. Third-quarter revenue growth was the slowest
since the fourth quarter of 2010.  Monster said slower sales for the industry as a whole led
to “less robust” growth for the company’s namesake-branded
energy drink in the U.S. during the period. Monster, which
attracted scrutiny last month after its beverages were cited in
the deaths of five people in the past year, yesterday said the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn’t established a “causal
link” between the beverages and any fatalities.  “There is not a shred of information of which causally
links Monster to these adverse events,” Chief Executive Officer
Rodney Sacks said on a call with analysts after the results were
released.  In September, Senators Richard Durbin of  Illinois  and
Richard Blumenthal of  Connecticut , both Democrats, wrote to the
FDA urging clarity on whether energy drinks qualify as dietary
supplements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
