Rubber advanced for the first time in
four days, rebounding from a seven-week low, as U.S. President
 Barack Obama  won a second term, fueling speculation that the
world’s largest economy will maintain its stimulus program.  Rubber for April delivery gained as much as 2.4 percent to
252.5 yen a kilogram ($3,149 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange before settling at 249 yen. Futures ended at
246.6 yen yesterday, the lowest close since Sept. 13. The most-
active contract, which has lost 5.5 percent this year, almost
doubled since the end of 2008.  Obama defeated Republican  Mitt Romney , securing at least
303 electoral votes, with 270 needed for victory, according to a
projection from The Associated Press. Asian  stocks  extended
gains while the dollar weakened.  “Obama’s re-election means the U.S. will likely maintain
the easier monetary policy for economic growth, which is
positive for commodities,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Monetary easing by the U.S. will also keep the U.S. dollar
under pressure, boosting the appeal of commodities as
alternative assets, he said.  Oil traded near a two-week high in New York, lifting the
appeal of natural rubber as a substitute for synthetic products
used in tires. Crude gained the most in a month yesterday on
forecasts U.S. gasoline supplies dropped after  Hurricane Sandy 
forced the shutdown of East Coast refineries.  Rubber for May delivery gained 0.8 percent to close at
24,005  yuan  ($3,844) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board rose 1.1 percent to 92.20 baht ($3.01)
a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporters on this story:
