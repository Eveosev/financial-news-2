Pyxis Capital LP, the Dallas-based
firm spun off from Highland Capital Management LP earlier this
year, announced its first loan exchange-traded fund.  The Pyxis iBoxx Senior Loan ETF tracks the  Markit iBoxx USD
Liquid Leveraged Loan Index , which measures 100 of the most
liquid, leveraged loans, the firm said in a statement
distributed today by PR Newswire.  “In this time of extremely low  interest rates , we believe
the Pyxis iBoxx Senior Loan ETF is well-positioned to serve
investors who are looking for income, but don’t want to take on
too much risk,” Brad Ross, Pyxis’s president, said in the
statement. “Senior secured bank loans are a defensive asset
class with the potential to pay a higher yield.”  ETFs typically allow individual investors to speculate on
securities without directly owning them. Unlike mutual funds,
whose shares are priced once daily, ETFs are listed on exchanges
and are bought and sold like stocks.  Leveraged loans are rated below BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s (MHP) 
and less than Baa3 at  Moody’s Investors Service. (MCO)  The debt has
returned 9.2 percent this year, according to JPMorgan Leveraged
Institutional Loan Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
