Slovakia’s 2013  budget  target is
achievable unless the external environment worsens
“significantly,” the country’s fiscal watchdog said.  Reserves included in the spending plan may not be
sufficient should all risks to the economy materialize, the
Fiscal Council, an independent body created this year to assess
prospects for public finances and alert the public should they
deteriorate, said on its website today.  The draft budget, which has yet to be approved by
parliament, targets reducing the gap to 2.9 percent of gross
domestic product next year from a targeted 4.6 percent in 2012.  The European Commission forecast today the  economy  of the
second-poorest euro-area member is set to expand 2 percent next
year, compared with 0.1 percent for the euro region. The
European Union’s executive arm expects Slovakia to have a fiscal
deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP this year and 3.2 percent in 2013,
according to the forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
