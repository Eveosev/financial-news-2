Lincoln National Corp. (LNC)  led a decline
among life insurers as Treasury yields fell the most in five
months after President Barack Obama was elected to a second
term.  Lincoln fell 5 percent to $24.52 at 10:03 a.m. in New York,
the most intraday since June for the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based
company.  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, dropped 
3.5 percent to $33.08. All 24 companies on the  KBW Insurance 
Index (KIX)  retreated.  Treasury yields declined as Obama’s re-election bolstered
speculation the  Federal Reserve , led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , will continue buying bonds to support the economy. The
10-year Treasury yield fell 12 basis points to 1.63 percent.  “A prolonged period of low interest rates is bad for
insurers, resulting not only in lower investment earnings and
profit compression on spread-based products, but also higher
reserve increases and meaningful writedowns of goodwill,” Neil Strauss, a senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service,
wrote in a Nov. 5 research note.  The Fed has said it will keep interest rates low through at
least the middle of 2015, and announced a program in September
to buy $40 billion a month of mortgage-backed securities. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, had said he wouldn’t reappoint
Bernanke when his term ends in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
