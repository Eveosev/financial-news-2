Most  Chinese stocks  fell as earnings
concerns dragged financial shares lower, overshadowing gains by
mining companies after  Barack Obama  won re-election as U.S.
president.  Founder Securities Co. (601901)  paced losses for brokerages after
the company reported October profit that was less than half the
previous month’s level. Jiangxi Copper Co. led a gauge of
material stocks to the steepest advance among industry groups as
metal prices climbed on the prospect the U.S. will maintain
stimulus policies. SAIC Motor Corp.,  China ’s largest carmaker,
jumped the most in a week after sales rose.  Five stocks dropped for every four that advanced in the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which slipped less than 0.1 percent to
2,105.73 at the close. The gauge rose 0.3 percent after Obama’s
victory was declared and erased gains as investors focused on a
Chinese leadership congress starting tomorrow and the strength
of earnings in an economy that grew last quarter at the slowest
pace in more than three years.  “The market has returned to fundamentals,” said Wu Kan, a
 fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co. in  Shanghai , which
oversees $285 million. “There is not much hope that earnings
and growth will pick up soon this quarter or early next year.”  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.2 percent to 2,287.50, erasing a
0.4 percent gain. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  added 0.3 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.5 percent.  Global Problems  Obama, a Democrat, captured 303 Electoral College votes,
well beyond the 270 needed to win the White House, compared with
206 for Romney, the Republican challenger. Romney had pledged to
label China a currency manipulator if he had won.  “The prospect of China being called a currency manipulator
will not transpire because that will throw the whole spectrum of
protectionism into the current problems that we already have
facing the global economy,”  Arjuna Mahendran , the Singapore-
based head of Asia investment strategy at  HSBC Private Bank ,
which oversees $409 billion, said in a telephone interview
today.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 12 percent
below the 30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Thirty-day volatility in the gauge was at 15, lower than this
year’s average of 17.2. The index trades at 10 times estimated
profit for 2012 after  falling  4.3 percent this year, compared
with the 17.8 average multiple since Bloomberg began compiling
the weekly data in 2006.  Lower Profit  A gauge of financial shares in the CSI 300 that includes
brokerages and property developers slumped 0.6 percent and was
the biggest drag on the broader index. Founder Securities lost
2.3 percent to 4.25  yuan  after October net income fell to 14
million yuan ($2.2 million) from September’s 31 million yuan.
Industrial Securities Co. slid 2.8 percent to 10.61 yuan after
reporting a 48 percent drop in October profit from a year ago.  Third-quarter profit for Chinese listed companies fell 3.4
percent from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.8 percent
drop in the second quarter, Huang Xindong and Chen Jianxiang,
analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a Nov. 5
report. Net income for companies excluding financials fell 18.2
percent in the period, matching the decline in the second
quarter, according to the report.  A gauge of material companies jumped 1 percent, the most
among the CSI 300 Index’s 10 industry groups. Spot gold gained
0.7 percent to $1,727.82 an ounce. Copper rose 1.1 percent to
$7,788 a metric ton in  London .  China Congress  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, rose
1.2 percent to 21.51 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co.,
the second largest, climbed 2.2 percent to 18.08 yuan.  Zijin
Mining Group Co. (601899) , the biggest bullion producer, advanced 1.3
percent to 3.92 yuan.  SAIC climbed 2.5 percent to 13.84 yuan after the company
posted a 21 percent gain in October vehicle sales to 414,471.
Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., a maker of bus and truck parts,
advanced 2.7 percent to 5.40 yuan.  China’s Communist Party will start a meeting in Beijing
tomorrow that will formally choose the next generation of the
nation’s leadership, with Xi Jinping expected to be chosen as
general secretary. Delegates to the 18th party congress are
expected to pick Li Keqiang as one of seven or nine members of
the Politburo Standing Committee that rules the party and hence
the nation.  “There is still a huge amount of uncertainty around the
makeup of the next Standing Committee, with a number of mutually
exclusive lists having been published by different, normally
credible, sources,”  Michael Pettis , chief strategist at Guosen
Securities Co., said yesterday in e-mailed comments. “Since the
composition of the Standing Committee will tell us a great deal
about the pace and urgency of economic reform, uncertainty about
one creates uncertainty about the other.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
