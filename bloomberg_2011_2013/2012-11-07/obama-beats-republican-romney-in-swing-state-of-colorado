President  Barack Obama  won  Colorado ,
locking up an election battleground where the two rivals
campaigned with such regularity that even four-year-olds knew
their names.  With 49 percent of Colorado’s precincts reporting, the
president had 51 percent of the vote to Republican challenger
Mitt Romney’s 47 percent, according to the  Associated Press ,
which projected Obama as the winner.  Colorado’s nine electoral votes were considered crucial by
both candidates, who battled with millions in advertising
dollars to win over the state’s 3.4 million registered voters
who are evenly split among Republicans, Democrats and the
unaffiliated.  Obama took Colorado by nine percentage points in 2008,
helped by young voters energized by social issues and the
state’s increasing numbers of Hispanics.  The  economy  ranked as the state’s No. 1 issue, with
unemployment at 8 percent in September, above the national
average of 7.8 percent that month.  Voter fatigue became evident last month when a video of 4-
year-old Fort Collins resident Abigael Evans went viral on
YouTube. In the clip, shot in a grocery store parking lot
following an NPR update on the presidential campaign, Abby’s
mother asks why she’s crying.  “Just because, I’m tired of Bronco Bama and  Mitt Romney ,”
she responds, mispronouncing the president’s name as only a
preschooler can.  To contact the reporter on this story:
