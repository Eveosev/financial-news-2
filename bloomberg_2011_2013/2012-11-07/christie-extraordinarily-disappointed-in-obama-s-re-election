New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
told reporters in Long Beach Island today that he was
“extraordinarily disappointed” in President Barack Obama’s re-
election.  Mitt Romney  is “a good and decent man,” Christie said.
The governor said he was surprised at how quickly yesterday’s
election was called.  Republican governors will be “folks who lead our
country,” Christie said.  Christie said he is not thinking today about a presidential
run. “I’m honored to be governor of New Jersey, that’s where I
am,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
