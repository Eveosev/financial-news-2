Slovakia is close to selling most of
its surplus United Nations carbon-dioxide permits to  Spain ,
Environment Minister Peter Ziga said.  The government is “about to sign an agreement” with Spain
to sell allowances, known as Assigned Amount Units, representing
22 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent,  Ziga told
reporters today in Bratislava, Slovakia. The purchase price will
probably be less than 1 euro per ton, equal to the current
market price, he added.  AAUs were distributed to nations based on the  Kyoto
Protocol , which set limits on greenhouse-gas emissions for the
period 2008 to 2012. A global economic slowdown since 2008
caused industrial production to stagnate, boosting the supply of
spare permits. Slovakia has surplus allowances worth about 27
million tons.  The east European country relies on proceeds from the sale
of allowances to help it reduce the  budget deficit . The
government is also in talks with Austria on selling additional
AAUs, Ziga said without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
