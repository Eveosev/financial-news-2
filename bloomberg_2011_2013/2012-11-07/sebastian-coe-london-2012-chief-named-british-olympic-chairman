Sebastian Coe was elected chairman of
the British Olympic Association after serving as head of the
organizing committee for the 2012  London  Games.  Coe, 56, ran unopposed to succeed Colin Moynihan, who
announced in August he was stepping down after seven years. He
was selected at a meeting of all the British Olympic sports
today in London.  Coe was a four-time Olympic medalist, winning the 1,500
meters gold in 1980 and 1984, and set 11 world records. In 2005
he led London’s effort to win the right to host this summer’s
games and continued on as chairman of the local organizing
committee.  “We all know about Seb’s sporting excellence and now
thanks to the London Games we all know what a great leader he
was of a hugely successful games,” International Olympic
Committee President  Jacques Rogge  said in a  statement . “He will
no doubt bring that success and experience to the BOA and at the
same time continue to ensure that the sporting legacy from
London 2012 continues into the future.”  Under Moynihan’s leadership Britain had its best results at
the  Summer Olympics  in over a century, winning 47 total medals
in Beijing in 2008 and 29 gold among its 65 medals this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
