Grupo BTG Pactual,  Brazil ’s top
generator of investment-banking fees, said third-quarter profit
more than tripled, beating analysts’ estimates on gains in the
private-equity division.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, climbed
to 793 million reais ($390 million), or 0.90 reais a share, from
231 million reais, or 0.29 reais, a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-
based lender said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The  average 
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 0.85 reais.  BTG, led by Chief Executive Officer  Andre Esteves , 44, said
revenue from principal investments, which includes the private-
equity division, was 566 million reais in the third quarter,
compared with negative 91 million reais a year earlier, the
filing shows. The division benefited from the sale of its stake
in STR Projetos e Participacoes em Recursos Naturais, an oil and
gas holding company, for 699.7 million reais in July.  The results reflect “our continued ability to deliver
superior return on equity,” Esteves said in the filing. Return
on equity, a measure of profitability, was 24.9 percent in the
quarter, up from 12 percent a year earlier, the company said.  BTG  advanced  0.3 percent to 31.50 reais in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday, and has gained 0.8 percent since its initial public
offering in April. The firm and its shareholders raised 3.66
billion reais in the IPO, the first time a stand-alone
investment bank in Brazil listed itself on a stock exchange.  Investment-banking revenue increased 59 percent to 148
million reais in the third quarter from a year earlier, the
filing shows. BTG took the top ranking in investment-banking
fees this year through Oct. 26 from Itau BBA, the wholesale-
banking arm of  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , according to Dealogic.  Sales and trading revenue declined 7.7 percent to 407
million reais, the bank said. Operating expenses more than
doubled to 617 million reais as bonus payments almost quadrupled
to 335 million reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
