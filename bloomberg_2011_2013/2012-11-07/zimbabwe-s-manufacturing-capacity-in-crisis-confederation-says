Zimbabwe ’s manufacturing capacity
declined to less than 50 percent this year as a shortage of
electricity and affordable loans hamper recovery in the southern
African nation.  Production volumes fell to 44.2 percent from about 57.2
percent a year earlier, said Lorraine Chikanya, chief economist
at the  Confederation  of Zimbabwe Industries, which represents
most medium and large industries other than mining.  “The manufacturing sector is in crisis and to some extent
this has resulted in company closures,” she said today in the
capital, Harare.  Zimbabwe’s economy shrank by about a third between 1998 and
2008, according to the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
