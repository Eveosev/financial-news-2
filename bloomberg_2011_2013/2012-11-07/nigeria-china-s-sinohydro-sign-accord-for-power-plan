Nigeria signed a memorandum of
understanding with  China ’s Sinohydro Corp. to build a 3,050-
megawatt hydropower plant on the West African nation’s eastern
Mambila Plateau, Power Minister of State Zainab Kuchi said.  Sinohydro will build the power plant at its expense and
operate it for nine years before transferring ownership to the
Nigerian government, Kuchi told reporters today in the capital,
Abuja.  The company will work with China National Electrical
Equipment Corp. to build another 700-megawatt hydro power
station on northern Zungeru River, with China’s Export-Import
Bank providing 75 percent of required funds, according to the
minister. Nigeria will provide 25 percent, or $309 million, she
said.  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous country of more
than 160 million people is seeking increased investments in
power to meet demand which is more than double the current
output of about 5,000 megawatts. The government has ended state
monopoly of power utilities and sold generation and distribution
companies to private investors.  The two hydro power projects planned with the Chinese
companies are expected to be completed by 2014, the minister
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
