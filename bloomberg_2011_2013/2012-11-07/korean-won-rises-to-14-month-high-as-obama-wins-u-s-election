South Korea’s won strengthened to a
14-month high as the re-election of U.S. President Barack Obama
eased concern the  Federal Reserve  will rein in monetary
stimulus, supporting inflows to emerging markets.  Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  had said he wouldn’t
reappoint Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to a third term in 2014.
The Fed said in September it will expand holdings of long-term
securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month to support the economy. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of shares
rose for a second day as overseas investors bought more South
Korean equities than they sold.  “Obama winning the U.S. election is driving gains in Asian
currencies on bets that Fed easing will continue,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst for Woori Futures Co.
“We saw overseas investors sell the greenback as the won
strengthened beyond 1,090 per dollar, a level speculated to have
been recently protected by the government.”  The won rose 0.5 percent to close at 1,085.45 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,085.40 earlier, the highest level since Sept. 9, 2011. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage
point, to 5.10 percent.  South Korea’s currency market will open at 10 a.m.
tomorrow, one hour later than usual, to help reduce traffic for
the national college entrance examinations, the Seoul Foreign
Exchange Market Committee said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. It will close at the scheduled time of 3 p.m.  The  Bank of Korea  will probably hold the benchmark interest
 rate  at 2.75 percent at its Nov. 9 policy meeting, according to
all 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 was unchanged at 2.78 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The one-year interest-rate swap was little changed at 2.75
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
