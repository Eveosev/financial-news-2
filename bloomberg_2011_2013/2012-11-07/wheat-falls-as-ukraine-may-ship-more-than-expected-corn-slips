Wheat futures rose to a five-week
high on speculation that global supplies will tighten as crop
conditions deteriorate in the U.S. because of dry weather and
rain delays planting in parts of  Europe .  About 39 percent of the U.S. winter crop was in good or
excellent  condition  as of Nov. 4, the lowest for the week since
data started 27 years ago, the Department of Agriculture said on
Nov. 5. The French soft-wheat crop was 64 percent planted as of
Oct. 29, compared with 88 percent last year, FranceAgriMer said
on Nov. 2.  “In the U.S. Plains, they’re going into dormancy in very
dry conditions,” Mike O’Dea, a risk-management consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone
interview. As the French price rises, “it will give the
impression that U.S. grain is undervalued compared to the world
market,” he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 1.9 percent to
settle at $8.94 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $8.97, the highest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 1.  The grain is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  In Paris, milling-wheat futures for January delivery gained
1.5 percent to 275.50 euros ($351.70) a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. Earlier, the contract reached a record 277.50 euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
