Matrix Group Ltd., a U.K. financial
firm seeking protection from creditors, said it will liquidate
its hedge fund and investment-banking operations.  Matrix Alternative Asset Management LLP will be wound down
“shortly” and Matrix Corporate Capital LLP, which advises
energy and clean-technology firms on mergers and share sales,
will also liquidate, the London-based firm said a statement
today. Matrix Property Fund Management LLP, the real-estate unit
that manages $600 million of assets, will be spun off and be run
by its current managers, the company said.  Matrix Group  went into administration yesterday after the
European sovereign debt crisis hurt the investment performance
of the hedge-fund industry and triggered a slump in dealmaking
for the small and mid-sized companies that make up the firm’s
banking clients. As recently as a year ago, Matrix managed 4
billion pounds ($6.4 billion) of assets.  “The administration of Matrix Group was caused by
continued weakening in market conditions in the investment-
banking sector,” Rob Randall, chairman of the real-estate unit,
said in the statement. “We are optimistic that the Matrix
Property Fund Management business will continue to grow.”  Bermuda Global Ltd. will buy Matrix’s fund-of-hedge funds
unit, which picks hedge-fund investments for outside clients,
according to the statement. Matrix, co-founded 35 years ago by
Chairman David Royds, said the fund-of-funds unit won’t be
affected by the firm’s administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
