An Iranian supertanker is sailing for
 South Korea ’s Daesan port, indicating the Asian country will
probably continue to import oil from the Islamic nation after
stopping in August and September.  The Motion, a very large crude carrier that can carry 2
million barrels, left the Persian Gulf port of Kharg Island
yesterday and is signaling for Daesan on South Korea’s west
coast, according to transmissions captured by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on
Bloomberg. National Iranian Tanker Co. owns the vessel. Hyundai
Oilbank Co. operates a 395,000 barrel-a-day  refinery  in Daesan.  South Korea halted crude purchases from  Iran  for two months
after its refiners lost insurance coverage on ships because of
sanctions over the Islamic republic’s nuclear program. Iran
responded by using state-owned tankers to carry cargoes. SK
Innovation Co. took delivery of an oil shipment on Oct. 2 in
Ulsan, Yoo Jung Min, a spokesman at South Korea’s largest
refiner, said last month.  The Marigold, previously known as the Brawny, discharged a
separate cargo in South Korea around Oct. 28, ship transmissions
show. The VLCC took about 24 days to sail from Kharg Island to
Daesan.  South Korea imports almost all its crude requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
