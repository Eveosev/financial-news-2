Former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych overcame Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in three sets at the season-
ending ATP World Tour Finals in  London .  The Czech beat Tsonga of France, 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 in a group
match at London’s O2 arena.  The ATP World Tour Finals, won last year for a record sixth
time by Switzerland’s Roger Federer, feature a round-robin
format. The world’s best eight singles players and doubles pairs
are divided into two groups of four, with the top two in each
section moving into the knockout semifinals.  Top-ranked Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  beat Britain’s Andy Murray in three sets earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
