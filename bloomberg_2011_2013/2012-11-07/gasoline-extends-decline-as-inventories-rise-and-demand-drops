Gasoline tumbled as stockpiles rose
and demand slid to an eight-month low after  Hurricane Sandy , and
as concern mounted that President  Barack Obama  and the  U.S.
Congress  won’t reach a budget deal.  Futures slid 4.1 percent as the Energy Department said
 supply  climbed 2.88 million barrels to 202.4 million last week
and  demand  sank 6.1 percent. Obama, after winning re-election,
must work with a divided Congress to deal with a looming $607
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax gains known as the
fiscal cliff.  “We knew demand was going to be off,” said  David Pursell ,
a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in
Houston. “We’re really off on broad market concerns. Whether
it’s concerns about the fiscal cliff or the economy under the
Obama administration, there’s concern over what’s going to
happen over the next few months.”  Gasoline for December delivery fell 11 cents to settle at
$2.5889 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. It was the
biggest drop, not counting contract rollovers, since Dec. 14.  U.S. stockpiles jumped and demand sank after Sandy shut
retail stations, terminals, refineries and pipelines, reducing
the ability of drivers to buy fuel. The median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.5 million-barrel
decline in gasoline supplies.  Gulf Coast inventories rose 4.62 million barrels to 75.1
million, the highest since December, as Colonial Pipeline Co.,
which runs the largest system connecting Gulf refiners and East
Coast markets, shut its main line into  New Jersey  after losing
power. Inventories of gasoline in the East Coast, or Padd 1,
fell 1.25 million barrels to 47.9 million, 8.7 percent below a
year early, department data showed.  Demand Sinks  Demand for the motor fuel sank to 8.31 million barrels a
day, the lowest level since the week ended March 2.  “It will take a couple of weeks to smooth all this out,”
said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects
Ltd., a research consultant in  London . “Demand wasn’t nearly as
bad as a lot of people expected. The fiscal cliff now becomes
the issue in the U.S., where there is a divided legislature.”  Total gasoline imports slid 56 percent to 270,000 barrels a
day, the least since December 1999. Imports of gasoline into the
East Coast, where most U.S. imports land, sank 63 percent to
217,000 barrels.  Democrats retained control of the Senate in yesterday’s
election while Republicans continue to hold a majority in the
 House of Representatives .  “Now the election is over, we’re still going to have a
divided government and the market is turning its attention to
what Congress is going to do about the looming fiscal cliff, if
anything,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. “The concern is nothing will get done.”  Distillate Supplies  Distillate supplies , which include heating oil and diesel,
rose 131,000 barrels to 118.1 million in the seven days ended
Nov. 2, according to department data. Analysts estimated a 1.25
million-barrel decrease, according to the survey.  December-delivery heating oil fell 9.08 cents, or 3
percent, to settle at $2.9621 a gallon, the biggest drop since
July 23.  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  slipped
0.1 cent to $3.462 a gallon yesterday, AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices have
fallen every day since Oct. 10, sliding 35.6 cents to the lowest
since July 20. The pump price reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on
April 4.  The average price in  New York City  increased 1.9 cents to
$4.121 a gallon yesterday, and on  Long Island  rose 2.8 cents to
$4.096.  To contact the reporter on this story:
