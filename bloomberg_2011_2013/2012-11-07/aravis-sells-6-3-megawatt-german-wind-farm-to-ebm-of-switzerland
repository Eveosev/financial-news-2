Aravis SA, a renewable energy
investor, sold a 6.3-megawatt wind farm in Brandenburg,  Germany 
to EBM, a Swiss electricity producer.  EBM bought Powerwind Holding AG, the German owner of the
Frehne I facility, from Aravis Energy I LP, a fund managed by
the Zurich-based investor, according to a statement.  Powerwind has a 15-year, non-recourse project finance loan
that funded the park’s construction. It was issued by two
unnamed German banks, said Oliver Thalmann, managing partner at
Aravis. Aravis has invested more than 200 million euros ($255
million) in renewable energy assets in the last two years, he
said.  The project was commissioned in January. Further details
weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
