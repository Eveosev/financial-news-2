Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT) , the North
American grocery business reporting its first results after
separating from the snacks enterprise, posted third-quarter
revenue that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by higher prices
and stronger sales of cheese.  Net income rose 13 percent to $470 million, or 79 cents a
share, from $417 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, the
Northfield, Illinois-based company said today in a statement.
Sales rose 3 percent to $4.61 billion, topping the $4.55 billion
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Kraft also
reiterated its 2013 earnings forecast of $2.60 a share.  The original Kraft Foods Inc., founded in 1909, split into
two companies last month, allowing its international snacks
business, called  Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , to push products
into emerging markets and make acquisitions. At the same time,
Kraft Foods Group Chief Executive Officer Tony Vernon is working
to expand the slower-growing grocery business in the U.S. by
boosting marketing spending and research.  “Kraft will benefit from solid top-line growth execution,
but it will also benefit from the strong margin expansion
opportunity inherent in the business,”  Christopher Growe , an
analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. in  St. Louis , said today in a
note.  Kraft Foods Group, whose products include fresh shredded
cheese, packaged meals, beverages and coffee, fell 0.3 percent
to $44.57 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
