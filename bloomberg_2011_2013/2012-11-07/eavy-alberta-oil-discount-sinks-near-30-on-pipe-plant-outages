Heavy Canadian oil traded near a $30
a barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate as lower pipeline
flows and seasonal refinery maintenance limit access to the U.S.
Midwest market and demand.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s 591,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline
that helps transport Western Canadian oil to U.S. plants
operated at reduced rates the end of last month after a power
interruption.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery shut a
235,000-barrel-a-day crude unit at the plant for a planned
turnaround, a person familiar with the work said Nov. 5.  Western  Canada  Select for November delivery weakened $1.10
to a $32 per barrel discount to WTI at 11:53 a.m. in New York,
according to  Net Energy Inc ., which says it’s Canada’s largest
independent financial and physical oil brokerage.  The same grade for December delivery weakened 25 cents to a
$29.50 discount. WCS is a blend of heavy Canadian crudes mostly
sourced from  oil sands .  December-delivery Syncrude, a Canadian light synthetic oil
processed from oil sands, weakened 25 cents to a $7.25 a barrel
discount against WTI, according to the broker.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 5 cents to
$21.25 a barrel at 2:07 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was
unchanged at $20.70 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $14.60. Mars Blend
added 25 cents to $14.75 a barrel over WTI, and Southern Green
Canyon was steady at $14.35.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $20.25 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
