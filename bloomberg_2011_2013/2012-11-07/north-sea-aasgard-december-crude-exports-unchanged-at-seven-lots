Exports of North Sea Aasgard crude in
December will be unchanged from November at seven cargoes, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The schedule comprises six consignments of 855,000 barrels
each and one shipment of 1 million barrels, totaling 197,742
barrels a day, the plan showed. This compares with 199,500
barrels a day this month.  Loadings of Grane blend will drop to five shipments of
600,000 barrels each, one less than November, according to a
separate plan.  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norwayâ€™s largest oil company, operates the two
fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
