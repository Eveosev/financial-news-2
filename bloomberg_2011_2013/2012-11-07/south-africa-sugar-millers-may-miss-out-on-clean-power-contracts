South African sugar-cane millers may
miss out on government contracts to produce clean energy because
bagasse, a by-product from the industry, isn’t regarded as
renewable, according to  Remgro Ltd. (REM) ’s TSB Sugar Holdings unit.  TSB supplies 2 megawatts to 7 megawatts to the country’s
grid, Nico Stolz, an engineer at the Malelane, Mpumalanga-based
company, said in an interview. “If we use the leaves of sugar
cane to generate power, we have the potential to supply more.”  South Africa , where chronic electricity shortages led to
the suspension of mines and factories in 2008, has embarked on a
program to boost generation by awarding contracts to build wind,
solar and biomass plants. Sugar millers, which already generate
power to run their operations, are willing to invest to produce
more energy, the South African Sugar Association said last year.  Bagasse, the part of sugar cane left once the juice has
been extracted, isn’t regarded by the government as a renewable
source of electricity, Stolz said at TSB’s Malelane mill, which
is self-sufficient in power. TSB can generate an additional 20
megawatts at Malelane, the same amount at its Pongola mill and
30 megawatts at Komati, according to Stolz’s estimates.  The sugar industry is able to add 1,000 megawatts to the
grid, according to Stolz. The price of supply would be
“slightly higher” than the government’s long-term price of
power, he said, declining to give a figure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
