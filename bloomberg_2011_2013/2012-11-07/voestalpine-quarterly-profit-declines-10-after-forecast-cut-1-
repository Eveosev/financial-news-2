Voestalpine AG (VOE)  posted a 10% drop in
fiscal second-quarter profit after  Austria ’s biggest steelmaker
cut its forecast for full-year earnings on weakening economies.  Net income after payments to hybrid bondholders declined to
104.8 million euros ($135 million) in the three months ended in
September, from 116.6 million euros a year earlier, the Linz-
based company said today in a  statement . Sales held at 3.05
billion euros. The average of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg had estimated net income of 92.3 million euros.  “Our room to maneuver with regard to describing our
economic expectations is becoming more and more narrow,” Chief
Executive Officer Wolfgang Eder told shareholders in a letter.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult to find something new in
the outlook for the coming months because both the political and
economic mood, which is colored by the same negative issues.”  Voestalpine cut its full-year estimate for earnings before
interest and tax to 800 million euros from 900 million euros and
its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
to 1.4 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros late yesterday.  Voestalpine slid the most in two weeks in Vienna, dropping
as much as 2.4 percent to 24.50 euros and trading at 24.55 euros
by 9:50 a.m. That narrowed its gain this year to 13 percent.  “The stuff of which the current crisis is made represents
a fertile breeding ground for growing protectionism and the
increasing willingness to hand over subsidies,” Eder said in
the letter, also signed by members of the management board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
