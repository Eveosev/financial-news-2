The National Hockey League and its
players’ union will continue talks today on a collective
bargaining agreement after meeting for the first time in two
weeks, the sides said.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and players’ union
special counsel Steve Fehr met at an undisclosed location in New
York for about seven hours yesterday, the NHL said on its
website.  “The league will not characterize the substance or detail
of the discussions until their conclusion,” Daly said in a
statement.  The two sides hadn’t held formal discussions since Oct. 18.  The league locked out its players on Sept. 16, the day
after the old collective bargaining agreement expired. A total
of 327 regular-season games through Nov. 30 have been canceled,
including the annual outdoor Winter Classic. That game, between
the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs and scheduled
for Jan. 1 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, was called off last
week.  The league’s most recent contract offer contained an even
revenue split between owners and players. None of the union’s
three counteroffers was accepted by owners. The players received
57 percent of hockey related revenue under the previous pact.  The season was scheduled to begin Oct. 11. The league has
said it’s too late to play the entire 82-game schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
