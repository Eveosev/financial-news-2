Azerbaijan plans to narrow its  budget
deficit  next year as the government projects rising oil revenue
as crude prices rise and output stabilizes.  The government targets a shortfall of 656 million manat
($836 million), or 1.17 percent of gross domestic product,
Finance Minister Samir Sharifov told parliament yesterday.
That’s down 0.1 percentage point from this year’s plan,
according to the ministry.  The Caspian Sea nation is the third-biggest energy producer
in the former  Soviet Union , with Russia and  Turkey  as its
biggest export markets. Companies led by London-based  BP Plc (BP/) 
have invested about $33 billion in the country’s oil and gas
fields since 1994.  The government forecasts a 12.4 percent increase in revenue
next year, with about 60 percent coming from the state oil fund,
or Sofaz, which manages income from energy sales. The average
price of oil is forecast at $100 a barrel. Spending is predicted
to rise 12.1.  Oil production fell 7.1 percent to 22.2 million metric tons
in the first half after the country’s largest oilfield of Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli, or ACG, cut output 12 percent, the State Oil
Co. of  Azerbaijan , also known as Socar, said in July.  The BP Plc-led field is expected to keep output stable at
33 million tons next year after the decline drew criticism from
the country’s President Ilham Aliyev last month, Socar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
