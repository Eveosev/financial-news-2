Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)   Kenya ’s largest
mobile-phone company, headed for the biggest gain in almost two
weeks on speculation it will announce higher first-half earnings
tomorrow.  The shares gained 2.3 percent to 4.45 shillings by 1:03
p.m. in Nairobi, poised to achieve the biggest advance and
highest level since Oct. 26. About 5.5 million shares, or 101
percent of the three-month moving average volume, traded.  “We expect very strong numbers; it is just that we don’t
how strong they will be,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview.  “I have an estimate of 120 percent year-on-year
growth for net profit because the first half of 2011 was very
weak.”  Safaricom, which is 40 percent owned by Vodafone Plc, the
world’s biggest telecommunications company, will announce first-
half earnings through September tomorrow. Net income in the six
months through September 2011 fell to 4.01 billion shillings
($47 million) from 7.63 billion shillings. In May, the company
reported full-year profit of 12.6 billion shillings, beating
analyst estimates, and unexpectedly raised its dividend.  Safaricom increased call charges last year for the first
time in 11 years amid a weakening currency and accelerating
inflation in  East Africa ’s biggest economy. The stock of
Safaricom, Kenya’s  second-biggest company  by market value, has
rallied 51 percent this year, compared with the  Nairobi
Securities Exchange All-Share Index’s (NSEASI)  34 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
