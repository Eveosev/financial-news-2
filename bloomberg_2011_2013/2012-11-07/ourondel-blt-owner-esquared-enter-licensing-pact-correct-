(Corrects timing of settlement in second paragraph)  ESquared Hospitality said it has
entered a licensing agreement with Laurent Tourondel.  Under the pact, ESquared can use BLT Trademarks owned by
Tourondel in future restaurant projects in exchange for
royalties, ESquared said today in a statement. U.S. Magistrate
Judge Michael Dolinger, in a Nov. 5 docket entry, said that the
pair had settled a lawsuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
