 Barack Obama ’s re-election drew 66.8 million viewers last night,
down 6.5 percent from his historic 2008 win, Nielsen said on its
website.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC network led 13 broadcast and cable
networks in prime time, averaging 12.1 million viewers,
according to data released separately by the networks. News
Corp.’s Fox News cable channel was second with an audience of

years ago, according to the advertising firm Magna Global SA. In
