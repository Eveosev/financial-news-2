Serbia  has asked  China  for $1.8
billion of loans to help build new roads and  power plants .  The funds would be disbursed through  Export-Import Bank of
China  to finance more than 300 kilometers (190 miles) of new
highways in Serbia as well as expand the Kostolac coal-fired
plants east of Belgrade, where China Machinery Engineering Corp.
is already involved in an upgrade, Serbia’s  Finance Ministry 
said on its  website  today.  Chinese builders would be hired for the planned projects
and contracts may be ready for signing in the first quarter of
2013, according to the statement released after Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  met with a Chinese government delegation in
Belgrade.  The new highways would link Serbia’s biggest northern city,
Novi Sad, with the western city of Loznica, and add sections in
central Serbia, the statement said. Adding a unit at Kostolac
may begin in 2014. Serbia asked China in September for $1.1
billion for new highways.  To contact the reporter on this story:
