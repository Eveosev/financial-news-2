The American  American Civil Liberties
Union  and the  Electronic Frontier Foundation  sued to block
portions of a  California  law to combat human trafficking that
creates new requirements for sex offenders, alleging parts of
the measure violate free speech rights.  California’s Proposition 35, which includes increased
prison terms for human trafficking, requires anyone who is a
registered sex offender to turn over a list of all their
Internet identifiers and service providers to  law enforcement ,
the groups said in an e-mail today.  The measure’s online speech regulations are overly broad
and violate the First Amendment, both because they prohibit
anonymous speech and because the reporting requirements burden
all sorts of online speech, even when the speaker is using his
own real name as a screen name, they said.  The suit, which seeks a judge’s order blocking the
allegedly unconstitutional portions of the law, was filed today
in federal court in  San Francisco  by two registered sex
offenders and the non-profit group California Reform Sex
Offender Laws.  The case is Roe v. Harris, 12-5713, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
