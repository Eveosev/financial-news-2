Iraqâ€™s government has decided to
cancel food rations to 6 million families and replace them with
cash handouts, State Minister Ali Al-Dabbagh said.  Every person among those eligible for the program will be
granted 15,000 dinars ($12.88) a month, Dabbagh, also the
official government spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.
The decision is meant to end the corruption obstructing the
proper and timely distribution of the five food staples: flour;
sugar, rice, vegetable oil, and milk for babies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
