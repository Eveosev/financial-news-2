An Olympic wrestler from Uzbekistan
was stripped of the bronze medal he won in the London games
after testing positive for doping, the  International Olympic
Committee  said today.  Soslan Tigievâ€™s urine sample tested positive for the
prohibited substance methylhexaneamine on Aug. 10 and the 29-
year-old was disqualified, the IOC said today in a statement on
its website.  The bronze medal in the 74-kilo freestyle event will be
given to Gabor Hatos of  Hungary , and the International
Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles will consider further
action, the IOC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
