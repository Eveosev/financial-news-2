Spain’s  highest court  upheld a law
legalizing same-sex marriage, ending a seven-year battle to
overturn one of the biggest legislative victories of former
Socialist Party Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero .  The Constitutional Court in an 8-3 ruling decided not to
hear an appeal, the Madrid-based tribunal said yesterday in a
statement.  The challenge was brought by more than 50 members of
Congress belonging to the conservative  People’s Party  when it
was in opposition. The party was voted into power in December,
ending seven years of governance by Zapatero’s Socialists.  Gay marriage was legalized yesterday by voters in the U.S.
states of Maine and Maryland, the first time same-sex unions
have been endorsed at the ballot box in the U.S. It was leading
in the state of Washington.  The Spanish justices will publish a full written opinion at
a later date.  French President  Francois Hollande ’s government today
introduced a bill to allow same-sex marriage, challenging
religious leaders and the main opposition party. The proposal in
the Cabinet meeting, one of Hollande’s campaign promises, will
be debated in  Parliament  in January and February.  “This is a step forward toward equality, a step that had
been delayed for too long,” a government spokeswoman, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, told a press conference in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
