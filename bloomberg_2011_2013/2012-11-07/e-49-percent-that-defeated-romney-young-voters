Fellow young people , if you haven't already raised a glass -- and I imagine
many of you have -- it's time to congratulate yourselves on a well-played
election. It turns out you weren't so incompetent at navigating election
bureaucracy. It turns out you weren't so apathetic. It turns out you actually
turned out to vote. Exit polls   show  that individuals ages 18 to 29 comprised 19 percent of voters
in this year's electorate, a full percentage point higher than in 2008. The size
of the youth vote  over the years  is influenced by fluctuations in the population
of young voters. According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic
Learning and Engagement,  21 percent  of this year's eligible voters were under
30, so the 19 percent figure seems a healthy one. The more important number to study, though, is turnout. According to CIRCLE,
at least  49.3 percent  of Americans under 30 voted in this year's presidential
election. That's higher than the turnout in 1996 (37 percent), 2000 (41 percent)
or 2004 (48 percent). While the youth turnout figure has not yet reached -- and
may never reach -- the 52 percent of 2008 (the  third highest turnout  since the
voting age was lowered in 1972),  it is expected to rise as more ballots are
counted. At about this same point in the 2008 vote count, CIRCLE was estimating
a turnout of only 48.3 percent. According to CIRCLE , young voters decided this election: Assuming that  Florida  is called for President
Obama in 2012, then  Ohio ,  Virginia ,  Pennsylvania , and Florida will be states in
which young voters were essential to the President’s reelection coalition. In
those states, if  Governor Romney  had won half of the youth vote, or if young
voters had stayed home entirely, then Romney would have won instead of Obama.
Those states represent 80 electoral votes, sufficient to have made Romney the
next president. That said, young people did not vote for Obama by as large a margin as they
did in 2008. Four years ago, Obama won 66 percent of the youth vote, with
Senator  John McCain  capturing 32 percent. This year,  exit polls  show that the
split was 60-37. But Obama's 23 percent margin still exceeds that of any other
candidate  in recent history. In his Washington Post article " What the 2012 election taught us ," Chris
Cillizza suggests that one of the lessons of the race is that the youth vote
cannot be dismissed: "Once is an anomaly. Twice is a new political reality. The
only question going forward is whether the youth vote is tied to President Obama
uniquely or whether it is an advantage for Democrats more broadly." Was Obama's appeal to young voters rooted in personality or politics? He
certainly lost some youth support as his rock-star status faded. But it seems
the harsh experiences of young people unemployed or riddled with student debt
did not keep them from the polls so much as introduce them to the stakes of
politics. The exuberant youth of 2008 are the sober voters of 2012. (Zara Kessler is an assistant editor and producer for Bloomberg View.  Follow
