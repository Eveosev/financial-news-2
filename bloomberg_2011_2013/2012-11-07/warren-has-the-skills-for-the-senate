The victory of  Elizabeth Warren  in
Massachusetts marks the arrival in the Senate of a major new
figure in American politics.  To be effective, she will have to lay low for a few years,
as  Hillary Clinton  and  Al Franken  did. We’ll see if she has the
patience and good sense to do so. But if she does, she will have
a long and illustrious career.  Her strengths -- raising and championing complex but
critical issues -- are a perfect match for the institution. I
once saw her get a standing ovation for a subtle and informative
speech about banking. I can’t think of anyone else who could do
that.  Warren’s election scares a lot of business people. It
shouldn’t. I’ve known her for years and can say with certitude
that she is pro-business and has many friends in the  business
world . What she opposes are businesses -- the credit-card
industry comes to mind -- with a history of gouging their
customers. To those, she will show no mercy. But she will also
work hard to fashion pro-growth policies that work broadly, not
just for specific interests.  She will defy the expectations of a lot of people who
formed a mistaken impression of her in recent years.  ( Jonathan Alter  is a columnist for Bloomberg View. Follow him
