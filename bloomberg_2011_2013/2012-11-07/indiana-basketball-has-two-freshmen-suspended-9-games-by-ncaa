Indiana University ’s top-ranked men’s
basketball team will start its season without two freshmen after
Peter Jurkin and Hanner Mosquera-Perea were each suspended nine
games for receiving impermissible benefits before enrolling at
the school.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  said the
players’ Amateur Athletic Union coach,  Mark Adams , provided them
with a combined $14,000 in airline tickets, meals, housing,
clothing, a laptop computer and a mobile phone.  While the NCAA said players were qualified to receive the
benefits from the non-profit organization to help cover their
travel documentation and transportation to the U.S., the
violation occurred because Adams is considered an Indiana
booster as he’s been connected with the school’s basketball
program. The  Indianapolis Star  said Adams’s ex-wife donated $185
to Indiana from 1986-92, before either player was born.  Jurkin, a 7-foot center from South Sudan, must repay $250
to a charity of his choice to be reinstated while Mosquera-
Perea, a 6-foot-8 forward from Colombia, has to pay back about
$1,590, the NCAA said in its e-mailed statement.  Indiana, the No. 1 ranked team in the Associated Press
preseason Top 25 college basketball poll for the first time in
33 years, opens its  regular season schedule  on Nov. 9 at home
against Bryant University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
