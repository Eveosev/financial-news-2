Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  investor Crest
Financial Ltd. voiced support for a proposal by fellow
shareholder Mount Kellett Capital Management LP to sell
Clearwire’s excess wireless spectrum.  Crest Financial echoed Mount Kellett’s concern that  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S) , Clearwire’s biggest shareholder, wasn’t acting in
other investors’ interest. Crest Financial, in a letter to Mount
Kellett that was distributed by PR Newswire, recommended the
sale of excess spectrum and suggested Clearwire raise money
through a stock offering.  Clearwire, which is attempting to build a high-speed
national wireless network, needs additional funding to complete
the system, said Houston-based Crest Financial, which owns a 6.6
percent stake in the company. Sprint, which leases Clearwire’s
network to serve its mobile-phone customers, is the business’s
largest customer.  Susan Johnston, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, Washington-
based Clearwire, declined to comment, as did  Bill White , a
spokesman for Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint.  Clearwire shares  fell 3.6 percent to $2.12 at the close in
New York, mirroring a broader market decline. The stock has
climbed 9.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
