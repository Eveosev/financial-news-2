Reserve Primary Fund, the failed
$62.5 billion money-market fund run by Bruce R. Bent and his son
Bruce R. Bent II, was faced with an economic storm much like
 Hurricane Sandy , which swept through the northeastern U.S. last
week, a lawyer for the two men told jurors in Manhattan.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims the
Bents, their investment advisory firm Reserve Management Co. and
Resrv Partners Inc. defrauded investors by falsely claiming they
would support the fund financially when it faced a run by
investors in the wake of the 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
bankruptcy.  The fund held $785 million in Lehman debt on Sept. 15,
2008, the day Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in history,
causing the run on the fund and triggering its failure the
following day when it “broke the buck” by failing to maintain
a $1-a-share net asset value.  “In a lot of ways, my clients were caught up in a perfect
storm,” John Dellaportas, who represents the Bents, told jurors
in his closing argument in federal court today.  Sandy delayed closing arguments in the case by forcing the
 Manhattan  courthouse to close for a week.  The case is SEC v. Reserve Management Co., 09-cv-04346,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
