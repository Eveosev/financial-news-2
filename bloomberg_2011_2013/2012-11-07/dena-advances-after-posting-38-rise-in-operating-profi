DeNA Co. (2432) , Japan’s largest social-game
website operator, rose the most in a month in Tokyo trading
after reporting a 38 percent jump in second-quarter operating
profit on increased spending by users.  DeNA  rose  as much as 4.4 percent, the biggest gain since
Oct. 4, to 2,708 yen and traded at 2,672 yen, as of 9:52 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Operating profit rose to 20.4 billion
yen ($254 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, DeNA said
yesterday. That compared with the 18.6 billion yen average of
seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which provides the Mobage platform for games
including Cygames Inc.’s “Rage of Bahamut,” is adding titles
through partnerships and acquisitions to attract more users.
Tokyo-based DeNA teamed with 10 social and mobile game
developers including BigHut and Cobalt Play Games to supply
their titles to its Mobage platform, it said Nov. 1.  “We did well both in  Japan  and abroad,” President Isao
Moriyasu told reporters yesterday. “Our platform in Japan is
still expanding.”  Sales surged 45 percent to 50.3 billion yen in the quarter,
and net income jumped 70 percent to 11.7 billion yen, DeNA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
