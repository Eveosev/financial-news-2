Lithuania’s  Constitutional Court 
agreed to rule on whether electoral fraud significantly effected
the outcome of parliamentary elections and whether the ballots
themselves were valid.  A ruling will be issued within three days after requests by
President Dalia Grybauskaite and the outgoing Parliament, the
court, based in Vilnius, the capital, said today on its website.
Grybauskaite is seeking to clarify whether Oct. 14 and Oct. 28
elections for 77 of the legislature’s 141 seats were
“democratic and free.”  The president, who must approve a new prime minister and
Cabinet, wants to exclude from the next government the  Labor
Party , which is accused of bribing voters. The party signed a
coalition agreement with the Social Democrats and the Order &
Justice party yesterday.  “People shouldn’t be left with even the smallest doubt as
to whether these parliamentary elections were democratic and
free,” Grybauskaite said in an e-mailed statement. “Only the
Constitutional Court can clarify what effect the electoral
violations had on the final outcome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
