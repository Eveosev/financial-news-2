Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici 
said France “saluted with great pleasure” U.S. President
 Barack Obama ’s re-election.  Moscovici, speaking on  RTL radio  today, said Obama’s
victory maintains stability in relations with Europe. “We work
well with his administration,” he said, adding that “Mitt Romney’s election would have created many changes.”  The French finance minister said that while Obama’s
administration “does not have Europe at the heart of its
concerns, it has always been helpful toward solving the euro-
zone crisis, preserving its integrity and favors a balance
between austerity and growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
