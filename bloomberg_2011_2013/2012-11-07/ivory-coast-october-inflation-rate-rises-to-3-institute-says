Consumer prices in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s biggest cocoa producer, increased 3 percent in October
from a year earlier as food, housing and education costs rose,
the country’s National Institute of Statistics said.  Inflation accelerated 2.2 percent in September, the
Abidjan-based statistics office said in an e-mailed statement
today. Prices rose 0.4 percent in the month, it said.  Ivory Coast, the biggest economy in the eight-member West
African monetary union, is recovering from a post-election
crisis in 2011 that disrupted most business activities.  After contracting 4.7 percent last year, the nation’s
economy is expected to grow 8.6 percent in 2012, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on Oct. 2. Ivory Coast’s
government is targeting 9 percent growth in 2013.  Food and soft drinks prices rose 5.2 percent from a year
ago, while housing and utilities increased 3.4 percent.
Education costs advanced 4 percent and transport prices
increased 2.1 percent. Health-care prices fell 0.8 percent while
communication costs declined 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
