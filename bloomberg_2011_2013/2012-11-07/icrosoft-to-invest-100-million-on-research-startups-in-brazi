Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the worldâ€™s largest
software maker, said it will invest $100 million in research,
development and entrepreneurial programs in Brazil.  The company will establish its fourth Microsoft Research
Advanced Technology Laboratory in Rio de Janeiro. Microsoft will
also set up a center for work on its Bing search engine and a
business accelerator to support 15 startups over the next 24
months, according to a  post  on its website.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is chasing growth
in  emerging markets  as personal-computer sales increase at a
faster rate in those countries than in the U.S. and Western
Europe. The software maker will incorporate an investment fund,
which will be wholly owned by Microsoft  Brazil , to invest in
startups.  Microsoft declined 2.6 percent to $29.08 at the close in
New York. The stock is up 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
