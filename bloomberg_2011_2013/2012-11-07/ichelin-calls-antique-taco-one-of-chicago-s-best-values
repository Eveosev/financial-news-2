Michelin today cited 64  Chicago 
restaurants in its Bib Gourmand roster, which means they serve
good meals for $40 or less, excluding tip and tax.  There were 19 new entrants, including Antique Taco, a
Wicker Park restaurant that sells habanero popcorn, duck
enchiladas and horchata milkshakes.  Among the other newcomers were Ada St., Au Cheval, Balena,
Chilam Balam, City Tavern, Jam, Kai Zan, Lao Hunan, Maison,
Marion Street Chinese Market, Q BBQ, the Savoy, the Storefront
Company, Untitled, Urban Union and Wood.  “The Bib Gourmands are selected by Michelin’s famously
anonymous inspectors, who dine across Chicago regularly,”
Michelin said in a release.  Clermont Ferrand, France-based  Michelin & Cie. (ML) , the world’s
second-biggest tire maker, will name the winners of stars in the
“Michelin Guide Chicago 2013” on Nov. 13, with copies going on
sale the following day for $18.99.  The critically acclaimed Publican and Stephanie Izard’s
Girl & the Goat retained their Bib awards, typically an
indication that the venues won’t receive a star in next week’s
announcement.  The restaurants recognized this year are:  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and  Greg
Evans  on television.  To contact the writer on this story: Ryan Sutton in  New York  at
