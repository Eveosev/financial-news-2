Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AUXL) , the
maker of a drug to treat an abnormal curvature of the penis,
 fell the most  in three months after announcing its partnership
with  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  will end by next year.  Auxilium, based in Malvern, Pennsylvania,  dropped  7.2
percent to $18.60 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day
drop since Aug. 1. The companies said in a statement they will
stop working together on Auxilium’s Xiapex, which is sold in the
U.S. for Dupuytren’s contracture, a hand contraction disorder,
and being weighed for approval for Peyronie’s disease, the
crooked penis condition.  Pfizer, based in New York, will give up the rights to the
medicine in Europe and  Asia . Auxilium Chief Executive Officer
Adrian Adams said the company will press on with getting the
treatment approved in Europe. The  Food and Drug Administration 
has yet to rule on using the treatment for the penis disorder in
the U.S.  As many as 5 percent of adult men have some degree of
crooked penis, with about 65,000 to 120,000 in the U.S. being
diagnosed with Peyronie’s each year, according to Auxilium. The
disease can be caused by damage during sex, leading to scarring
that bends the penis. The condition mainly affects men ages 40
to 60 years and older, according to the National Institutes of
Health’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
