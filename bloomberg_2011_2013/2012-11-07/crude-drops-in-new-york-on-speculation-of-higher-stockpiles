Oil fell in  New York  for the first
time in three days before a report that may show U.S. crude
inventories increased last week.  Futures slid as much as 1 percent after surging 3.6 percent
yesterday. Crude stockpiles probably rose 2 million barrels to
375 million last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before an Energy Department report today.  Crude for December delivery fell 46 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $88.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 8:29 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
