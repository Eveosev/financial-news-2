U.K. stocks  slid after the European
Commission cut its growth forecast for Britain’s largest export
partner and as concern over an impending U.S. fiscal crisis
overshadowed the re-election of President  Barack Obama .  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  led a selloff by mining companies,
tumbling more than 6 percent.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
both lost at least 2 percent as copper dropped in  London .  Pennon (PNN) 
Group Plc slid 2.9 percent after Citigroup Inc. recommended
investors sell the shares.  The benchmark FTSE 100 declined 93.27 points, or 1.6
percent, to 5,791.63 at the close in London as all but eight
companies dropped. The gauge yesterday climbed to its highest
level since Oct. 19 as Americans went to the polls. The FTSE
All-Share Index retreated 1.5 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index both lost 1.4 percent.  Stocks initially rallied as much as 0.6 percent after Obama
defeated Republican  Mitt Romney , winning at least 303 Electoral
College votes. He needed 270 for the victory. With one state --
 Florida  -- yet to be decided, Romney had 206 electoral votes.  “We don’t think it matters a huge deal,” said Kevin Gardiner, head of investment strategy for EMEA at Barclays Plc’s
wealth management unit, on Bloomberg Television in London. “The
key thing for us and our clients is very much what happens to
that fiscal cliff as we go into 2013. We haven’t seen that risk
dispelled significantly just yet.”  The president now faces a partisan divide in Congress as
Republicans retained their House majority, while Democrats kept
control of the Senate. The government will have to impose
automatic spending cuts and tax increases at the beginning of
next year unless Obama reaches a compromise with his opponents.  Europe’s Economy  The European Commission said the combined economy of the 17
nations that use the single currency will expand 0.1 percent in
2013, slower than the 0.25 percent median forecast of 55
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  was 17 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Randgold dropped 6.4 percent to 6,950 pence, the biggest
decline on the FTSE 100, after the gold producer said that
output will be at the bottom of its forecast range of 825,000 to
865,000 ounces. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow added that
power disruptions at the Tongon mine in Ivory Coast will
increase its costs. Gold slid for the first time in three days.  “We’re still going to have a very strong quarter, but we
just can’t catch up,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said
in an interview in London today. “Tongon has another couple of
months to go before we really get on top of it.”  Mining Companies  A gauge of mining companies sank 2.4 percent, its biggest
decline since Sept. 26, as base metals retreated on the London
Metal Exchange. Xstrata slid 2 percent to 975.8 pence and Anglo
American dropped 3 percent to 1,874.5 pence.  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  slipped 2 percent to 340.35 pence.  Pennon retreated 2.9 percent to 692.5 pence after Citigroup
Inc. lowered its recommendation for the shares to sell from
hold. The brokerage said it has turned more cautious on U.K.
water utilities and cut its estimate for the shares to 650
pence, citing the company’s valuation.  Citigroup also downgraded  Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  to neutral from
buy and reiterated its neutral recommendation for  United
Utilities Group Plc. (UU/)  The shares fell 2.6 percent to 1,537 pence
and 1.4 percent to 660 pence, respectively.  CRH, Burberry  CRH Plc (CRH)  dropped 3.9 percent to 1,157 pence in London,
following an 8.4 percent rally over the past seven trading days.
The stock also fell as Swiss cement maker, Holcim Ltd., reported
third-quarter net income that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  declined 4.2 percent to 1,199 pence,
erasing an earlier gain of as much as 2.2 percent. The shares
fell even as the U.K.’s largest luxury goods maker reported
first-half profit that exceeded  analysts’ projections . The stock
surged 8.8 percent last week.  “We remain long-term fans, but the backdrop is tough,”
said Bethany Hocking, an analyst at Investec Ltd. in London, who
downgraded the stock to hold from buy. “Christmas is crucial,
and we see few near-term catalysts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
