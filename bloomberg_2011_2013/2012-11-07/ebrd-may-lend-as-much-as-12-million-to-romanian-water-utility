The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is considering lending as much as 9.2 million
euros ($12 million) to the Romanian utility Hidroprahova SA to
fund part of the company’s regional investment program.  The lender is considering providing the money as part of
its 130 million-euro loan under the regional European Union
Cohesion Fund water co-financing framework aiming to help fund
projects to upgrade  Romania ’s water and sewage networks, the
London-based EBRD said today in a website statement.  The loan may help Hidroprahova extend the water and sewage
infrastructure in eight towns in the southern county of Prahova
including Breaza, Baicoi, Campina, Mizil, Plopeni, Sinaia,
Urlati and Valenii de Munte, according to the statement.  The investments aim to reduce water losses and expand the
water supply and wastewater collection and treatment services in
the county to meet EU directives, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
