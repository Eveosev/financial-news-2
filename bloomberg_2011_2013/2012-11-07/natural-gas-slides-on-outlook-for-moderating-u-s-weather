Natural gas futures dropped in New
York as meteorologists predicted a shift to above-normal
temperatures after wintry weather in the eastern U.S. this week.  Gas fell as much as 1.7 percent after forecasters including
WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts , said the weather will be
warmer than normal in the Northeast from Nov. 12 through Nov.
16. Stockpiles of the fuel rose to a record 3.908 trillion cubic
feet in the week ended Oct. 26, Energy Department data show.  “The market is going to have trouble rallying with these
milder temperatures,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Inventories are still going to be at an all-time record.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 2.6 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.591 per million British thermal units at 11:46
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are down 2.8
percent from a year ago. Gas rose to $3.82 on Oct. 30, the
highest intraday price since Nov. 4, 2011.  The low in New York on Nov. 12 may be 50 degrees Fahrenheit
(10 Celsius), 7 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Boston  may be 56
degrees, 17 more than the usual reading.  Heating demand in the Northeast may be 21 percent below
normal from Nov. 13 through Nov. 17, data from Weather
Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , show. About 50 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating, according to the Energy
Department.  Winter Outlook  A lack of Pacific Ocean warming and of blocking patterns in
the Atlantic will probably mean warmer-than-normal weather in
the eastern U.S. for the next three months, Todd Crawford, chief
meteorologist at WSI, said in an Oct. 22 seasonal forecast.
Temperatures in the East may be about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal from November through January, while the Northwest cools,
Crawford said.  Marketed gas production will average a record 68.84 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 4 percent from 2011, the Energy
Department said yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. The department’s forecast for total gas consumption
fell to 69.75 billion cubic feet a day from 69.76 billion
predicted last month.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by eight to 424 last week, according to data released Nov.
2 by Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston. The rig count is down 48
percent this year.  Gas Drilling  “EIA expects that growth in associated gas from crude oil,
as well as continued drilling in liquids-rich areas, will help
offset the decline in drilling activity,” the department’s
Energy Information Administration said in the outlook.  Department data scheduled for release tomorrow at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington  may show that gas inventories rose 27 billion
cubic feet to a record 3.935 trillion in the week ended Nov. 2,
according to the median of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average change for the week is a gain
of 36 billion, department data show.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Barack Obama  may consider introducing a tax on carbon
emissions to help cut the U.S. budget deficit after winning a
second term as president, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  A tax starting at $20 a metric ton of carbon dioxide
equivalent and rising at about 6 percent a year could raise $154
billion by 2021, Nick Robins, an analyst at the bank in  London ,
said today in an e-mailed research note, citing Congressional
Research Service estimates. “Applied to the Congressional
Budget Office’s 2012 baseline, this would halve the fiscal
deficit by 2022,” Robins said.  Natural gas emits about  half  the carbon dioxide of coal on
an energy-equivalent basis, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
