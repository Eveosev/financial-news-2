OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s largest oil
company, said its third-quarter profit slumped 26 percent on
higher financial costs.  Net income declined to 870 million lei ($248 million) from
1.18 billion lei a year earlier, the Bucharest-based unit of
Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV)  said in a regulatory statement today. Its
financial loss was 237 million lei, compared with a gain of 57
million lei a year earlier as interest-rate charges climbed.  Earnings before interest and taxes dropped 4 percent to
1.29 billion lei as exploration costs increased at the company,
which together with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is searching for natural
gas in the Black Sea. Production costs in Romania climbed 5
percent on higher personnel expenses, it said in the statement.  “Our investments focused on the exploration and production
business to stabilize our hydrocarbon output,” Chief Executive
Officer Mariana Gheorghe said in the statement. “We are seeking
new growth opportunities in the neighboring Black Sea region, in
joint venture with  Exxon Mobil .”  Petrom’s new gas-fired power plant in Brazi, which started
operations in August, will have a positive impact on the
company’s Ebit in the fourth quarter, according to the
statement.  Nine-month net income declined 1 percent to 2.9 billion lei
from 2.92 billion lei, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
