The European Commission halved its
2013 growth forecast for  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy,
citing the sovereign debt crisis and weaker export demand.  The economy will grow 0.8 percent this year and next and
expand 2 percent in 2014, the European Union’s executive arm in
Brussels said in its autumn forecast today. In May, it predicted
growth of 0.7 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013.  There are increasing signs that the debt crisis is
beginning to take a toll on the Germany. Industrial production
declined for a second month in September, factory orders slumped
the most in a year, and business confidence is at the lowest
level since 2010. Still, the economy will continue to outperform
most of its euro-area counterparts as they struggle to rein in
deficits, the Commission said.  “The fundamentals of the German economy remain intact”
and “economic growth is expected to regain momentum in the
course of next year,” it said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s economic advisers also
predict economic growth of 0.8 percent this year and next,
according to a report released in Berlin today.  “The second half of 2012 is characterized by widespread
recessionary trends in the  euro zone  that impact on the German
economy through foreign trade and confidence” and damp the
economy’s expansion through declining investment, the advisers’
report said.  Euro-Area Recession  The Commission predicts the euro-area economy, Germany’s
biggest trading partner, will shrink 0.4 percent this year
before growing 0.1 percent in 2013. It forecasts annual economic
contractions next year in six of the 17 nations sharing the
euro.  German export growth “is expected to halve in 2012, while
picking up pace again in the subsequent years along with
reviving economic activity in trading partner countries both
within and outside the euro area,” the Commission said.
“Moreover, domestic demand should continue to be underpinned by
both consumption and housing investment, which are in turn
supported by robust labor market conditions and low  interest
rates .”  The Commission predicts Germany will balance its general
government budget in 2014 after running deficits of 0.2 percent
of gross domestic product this year and next. The structural
general government budget surplus will rise to 0.3 percent in
2013 and 2014 from 0.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
