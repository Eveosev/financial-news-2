South African sugar farmers and mills
are in talks with the government over increasing the price level
that would trigger the possibility of levying duties on imports
from  Brazil , according to  Remgro Ltd. (REM) ’s TSB Sugar Holdings unit.  The current reference level, set by the state International
Trade Administration Commission in consultation with the  South
African Sugar Association  lobby, is $340 a metric ton, said TSB
Managing Director John du Plessis at the Malelane sugar mill
today. He declined to give the current market rate, based on
London prices adjusted for transportation and other costs.  “We’ll end up importing 150,000 tons of sugar this year,
or 10 percent of South African consumption,” said Du Plessis,
who is also chairman of the national sugar association. “That
is the equivalent of a sugar mill’s production,” he said.  The government imposed anti-dumping duties of 6 percent to
63 percent in February on some chicken cuts imported from
Brazil. The Latin American country subsequently filed a
complaint with the  World Trade Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
