Spain ’s budget deficit will be more
than double the target set by the European Union in 2014 as a
deepening recession blows Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
government off course, European Commission forecasts show.  Spain’s budget gap will amount to 6.4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014, compared with a target set by the EU
of 2.8 percent, as “fiscal consolidation hardly advanced in the
first eight months of 2012,” the European Commission said today
in Brussels.  Rajoy yesterday said the country’s funding difficulties may
force him to apply for European Central Bank aid to lower
borrowing costs months after securing as much as 100 billion
euros ($128 billion) in loans for Spain’s banks. Even so, Rajoy
said he hopes to cancel tax increases in 2014 and pledged not to
extend a temporary cut in civil servants’ wages next year.  The temporary nature of some of the tax increases and
spending cuts taken by Rajoy will widen Spain’s deficit in 2014,
the Commission said. It predicted shortfalls of 8 percent this
year and 6 percent in 2013, up from May forecasts of 6.4 percent
and 6.3 percent, respectively.  ‘Substantiate Measures’  European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  called on Spain to spell out how it will meet deficit-
reduction targets, telling reporters in Brussels today that he’d
asked Spanish officials “to substantiate their measures of
fiscal consolidation soon, also for 2014.”  Spain’s performance will be judged by its “structural
fiscal effort, not only as nominal headline targets,” Rehn
said, adding that the Commission is assessing whether Spain has
taken “effective action” to bring down the 2012 and 2013
deficits.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond rose four basis
points to 5.70 percent at 4:34 p.m. in  Madrid , compared with a
euro-era high of 7.75 percent on July 25, a day after Spain
signed the conditions for bank aid. It has dropped 150 basis
points since the ECB on Aug. 2 pledged to buy sovereign debt of
countries requesting aid and committing to austerity measures.  Reordering Finances  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said today “fiscal
consolidation is progressing well in most countries,” even as
the “economic and financial situation in the euro area remains
challenging.”  European leaders decided in July to give Spain an extra
year to bring the deficit below the EU limit of 3 percent of
GDP. They set looser targets of 6.3 percent of output for this
year, 4.5 percent next year and 2.8 percent in 2014.  Overspending in Spain rose to 9.4 percent in 2011, behind
Ireland and the same as in  Greece , as the euro area’s fourth-
largest economy relapsed into a recession. The second recession
since 2009 offset measures implemented by Rajoy and by his
Socialist predecessor.  “In 2014, the expiry of some of the measures introduced in
2012, such as the income-tax hike, is roughly offsetting the
planned consolidation included in the 2013-14 budget plan,” the
European Union’s executive arm wrote in its report.  Spain’s “risks are tilted to the downside,” the
Commission said. With “high  interest rates ” and “considerable
strain” on financing conditions, Spain’s public debt is likely
to surge to 97.1 percent of GDP by 2014, from 92.7 percent next
year, it said.  Junk Risk  On the brink of a junk credit rating, Spain has forecast
gross debt issuance needs of at least 207 billion euros next
year, up from 192 billion planned for 2012. The Budget Ministry
this week confirmed the Treasury’s plan to continue raising
funds for the semi-autonomous regions that need it next year.
This year, the central government organized two bailout packages
for the regions to help them pay suppliers and meet debt
redemptions.  The Commission said GDP will contract 1.4 percent next
year, compared with a forecast of a 0.3 percent contraction for
2013 six months ago. It said the economy will grow 0.8 percent
in 2014, confirming Rajoy’s forecast of a recovery after 2013.
Unemployment will peak at 26.6 percent in 2013, the report said,
while Spain predicts it’ll fall next year. Joblessness rose to a
quarter of the workforce in the third quarter, the most since at
least 1976 and an EU record.  In power since last year, Rajoy has planned austerity
measures amounting to 150 billion euros, or 15 percent of the
nation’s annual GDP, by the end of 2014 to meet EU budget
pledges. While Rajoy has already reduced  unemployment benefits ,
Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde last month said Spain
will miss its deficit goal unless the prime minister abandons
another election pledge and changes rules linking pensions to
inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
