Former  Pennsylvania  State University
President  Graham Spanier  was arraigned on charges of conspiring
to conceal reports of ex-football coach Jerry Sandusky’s sexual
abuse of boys.  Spanier, 64, is charged with five counts including
endangering the welfare of a child, perjury and conspiring to
hide critical facts surrounding Sandusky’s abuse. He was
released today on $125,000 unsecured bond after a hearing in
Harrisburg, according to the court docket.  The charges against Spanier follow Sandusky’s sentence last
month to a minimum of 30 years in prison for sexually abusing
10 boys over a 15-year period. Sandusky, who was convicted by a
jury in June on 45 criminal counts, committed some of his crimes
in campus buildings or while he was employed by the school,
according to prosecutors and victims.  Spanier was fired by  Penn State  last year after Sandusky’s
arrest. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. His attorneys
said last week that the charges against him were politically
motivated.  Two former university officials, Timothy Curley and  Gary Schultz , face trial in January over similar charges related to
the Sandusky case.  Timothy K. Lewis  and  Elizabeth Ainslie , attorneys for
Spanier, didn’t immediately return a phone call and e-mails
seeking comment on today’s hearing.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Spanier, MJ-
12303-CR-0000419-2012, Magisterial District Judge 12-3-03,
Dauphin County (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
