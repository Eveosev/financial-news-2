Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
0.2 percent to 827,000 barrels a day last week, the highest
level in seven weeks.  Stockpiles sank 5.6 percent to 18.1 million barrels, the
steepest decline since Aug. 20, 2010, and the lowest amount
since Dec. 30, an Energy Department report today showed. Imports
increased 3.4 percent to 60,000 barrels a day, the agency said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 92 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 91 percent in the week ended
Oct. 26.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.3 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $2.342 a gallon at 10:20 a.m. local time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The futures have dropped 12 percent from
a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
