Polish day-ahead electricity
increased as the country was set to export more power during the
evening demand peak, and cut output when consumption eases.  Next-day power  in  Poland  added 2.8 percent to 167.55 zloty
($51.71) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg. Poland was set to boost exports of power to the Czech
Republic, Germany and Slovakia to 1,500 megawatts from 6 p.m. to
7 p.m. tomorrow, from 500 megawatts at the same time today, data
from the grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility said it would cut output
at its 1,900-megawatt Turow plant by 51 percent from midnight to
4 a.m. tomorrow, when demand typically subsides.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia advanced 11 percent to 39.54 euros
($50.46) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
countries’ market operators. The day-ahead contract in  Hungary 
settled 5.4 percent lower at 40.48 euros a megawatt-hour in a
