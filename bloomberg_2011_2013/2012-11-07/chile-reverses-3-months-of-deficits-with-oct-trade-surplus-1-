Chile  in October posted its first trade
surplus in four months as surging exports, including an increase
in copper sales abroad, offset record imports.  The surplus totaled $70 million as exports rose 10 percent
from last year to $7.32 billion, with copper shipments rising to
almost a two-year high of $4.44 billion, the central bank said in
a report posted on its website today. Imports leaped 26 percent to
a record $7.25 billion over the same period.  While the global economic slowdown has had a tenuous impact
on Chile, the nation’s exports still have slipped 4.5 percent this
year on weaker commodity prices. A further decline in copper
prices, coupled with the “dynamic” growth of consumer spending,
threaten to widen Chile’s current account deficit and put the
economy at risk, central bank President Rodrigo Vergara said
yesterday.  “If the current account deficit grows or persists more, odds
also increase that a deterioration of the external scenario would
impact internal conditions with more force,” Vergara told an
economic forum in Santiago. “It’s everybody’s task to moderate
spending.”  Retail sales grew 8.4 percent in the first nine months of
this year from 2011, according to calculations made by Bloomberg
based on government data.  Chile’s current account deficit will expand to 3.2 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 1.3 percent in 2011 as
imports climb 4 percent, according to central bank forecasts
published in September. The trade surplus will shrink to $4.2
billion from $10.8 billion over the same period, it said.  Copper prices will fall 11 percent this year from 2011 before
dropping another 4.2 percent in 2013, according to central bank
forecasts. Prices of the metal are down 9.5 percent in 2012 from
last year’s average.  Chile’s peso, which has gained 8.6 percent against the U.S.
dollar this year, rose 0.1 percent against the dollar to 478.64
per dollar at 8:41 a.m. Santiago time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
