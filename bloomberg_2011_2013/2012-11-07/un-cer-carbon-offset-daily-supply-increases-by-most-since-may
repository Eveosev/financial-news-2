The  United Nations  issued the most
Certified Emission Reduction carbon offsets in more than six
months, according to UN data compiled by Bloomberg.  The executive board of the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the body responsible for regulating CERs, delivered
more than 6.3 million metric tons of credits to the market
today, the UN data show. That’s an increase of 1.7 percent from
yesterday and the biggest issuance in a single day since May 2.  CERs for December fell as much as 7.3 percent to 1.01 euros
($1.30) a ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe, and were at 1.06
euros at 10:26 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
