German government bonds extended an
advance after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
inflation risks are “very low over the medium term.”  Ten-year  German yields  declined six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.38 percent at 12:27 p.m. London time.
Two-year note yields fell three basis points to minus 0.04
percent.  “The weak overall economic situation, combined with slow
money growth, means that the risks of inflation are currently
very low over the medium term,” Draghi said in a speech in
Frankfurt. “Our interventions will not change this outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
