ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  said it created a circuit-
breaker that can interrupt long-distance power cables, in a
breakthrough to transmit power that gives the Swiss company a
potential edge over rivals  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Alstom SA. (ALO)   The circuit breaker can split green-power cables connecting
offshore wind farms and cities along several points, a departure
from a previous approach that limited power transports to single
connections often spanning hundreds of miles, ABB said today.
The invention may hand Zurich-based ABB an advantage in the
growing market for grid connections, it said.  “This opens up new possibilities, we think it can open up
a significant increase, but nobody is able to quantify it
today,” Claes Rytoft, the chief technology officer of ABB’s
power systems division, said in an interview.  ABB said it solved one of the great mysteries of
electrification dating back a century to the era of rival
scientists Thomas Edison and  Nikola Tesla . Rytoft said ABB is
working with utilities on projects that may be operational
within 12 to 18 months. It may take up to five years before
circuit-breakers are installed commercially, he said.  Siemens is working on the same technology, a company
spokesman said. “We are confident of being able to offer it
when the market demands it,” spokesman Torsten Wolf said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
