Canadian Natural Resources Minister
Joe Oliver said he’s optimistic President  Barack Obama ’s
administration will approve  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL
pipeline project now that the U.S. election campaign is over.  Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Oliver said Obama’s
government will now be able to look at the project objectively.
TransCanada re-applied in May for a U.S. permit for parts of the
Keystone pipeline, which would transport crude from  Alberta ’s
oil sands to the U.S., after a prior application was rejected by
President Barack Obama on Jan. 18.  “I don’t know exactly why he postponed it but the point is
right now we’re not in the middle of an election campaign and it
will be decided by the administration on its merits,” Oliver
said.  Canada will respect the U.S. regulatory process, and will
continue to advocate for the pipeline, the minister said.  “We believe the Keystone XL pipeline will be approved by
the Americans because it is clearly in the U.S. national
interests in terms of national security, jobs, economic
growth,” Oliver said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
