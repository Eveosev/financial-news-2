Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-largest U.S.
department-store chain, posted third-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates while its forecast for the end of the year
signaled it may use heavy discounts to draw holiday shoppers.  Net income in the period ended Oct. 27 rose 4.3 percent to
$145 million, or 36 cents a share, from $139 million, or 32
cents, a year earlier, Cincinnati-based Macy’s said today in a
statement. The average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 30 cents. Profit per share in the current quarter
will be $1.94 to $1.99, trailing the $2.05 average estimate.  Chief Executive Officer  Terry Lundgren  has benefited from
exclusive Madonna, Sean John and Tommy Hilfiger products that
helped boost third-quarter revenue 3.8 percent to $6.08 billion.
The retailer also used promotions such as one-day sales to drive
customer traffic and may employ more of those in the competitive
 holiday shopping season .  “The fourth quarter is always a promotional quarter, and I
am sure they want to participate in that promotional activity,
and they want to beat analyst estimates,”  Liz Dunn , an analyst
with Macquarie Group Ltd. in  New York , said today in an
interview. She rates the shares outperform, the equivalent of a
buy, and said the third-quarter profit was “really
impressive.”  The shares fell 2.2 percent to $40.45 at the close in New
York. Macy’s has climbed 26 percent this year.  Sales Gains  Macy’s third-quarter sales topped analysts’ average
estimate of $6.05 billion when the company reported the results
last week. The retailer also last week increased its forecast
for sales at stores open at least a year to 4 percent in the
second half of 2012 from an earlier projection of 3.7 percent.
The company said today it will stop reporting monthly sales
beginning in its fiscal 2013.  The retailer’s  gross margin , or the portion of sales left
after subtracting the cost of goods sold, widened to 39.6
percent from 39.4 percent a year earlier. Selling, general and
administrative expenses fell to 34.2 percent of sales from 34.4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
