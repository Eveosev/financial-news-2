The forint gained and Hungarian bond
yields fell as U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
increased demand for riskier assets and investors awaited the
European Union’s verdict on Hungary’s budget-deficit reduction
measures.  The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, appreciated 0.3 percent to 281.33 forint by 9:55
a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year
bonds fell three basis points, 0.03 percentage point, to 6.876
percent.  Obama’s victory over Republican  Mitt Romney  increases the
odds the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue with its bond
purchases that are designed to boost the world’s largest
economy. A report by the European Commission today may indicate
whether Hungary faces an escalation in sanctions for exceeding
the EU’s budget deficit limit of 3 percent.  “The forint has gained on Obama’s victory,” Gergely Palffy, an analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in an e-
mailed report today, citing the expected continuity in Fed
policy and the end of uncertainty caused by the campaign.  “It would be very important to get a positive signal from
the Commission that acknowledges the government’s efforts are
sufficient to keep the deficit below 3 percent sustainably,”
Karoly Bamli, a Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote
in an e-mail today.  The forint may gain to 280 per euro if the global sentiment
persists and the news from the EU on  Hungary  is favorable, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
