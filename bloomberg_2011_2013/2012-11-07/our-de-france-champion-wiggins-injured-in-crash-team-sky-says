Tour de  France  champion Bradley Wiggins is expected to make a full recovery after getting
injured in a traffic accident while riding his bike, his Team
Sky cycling squad said.  Wiggins, 32, was taken to the hospital last night following
a collision with a vehicle near his home in Lancashire,
northwest  England , the team said. Wiggins broke several ribs and
suffered hand and wrist injuries, the Lancashire Evening Post
reported on its website.  “He is being kept in hospital overnight for observation,
but the injuries he has sustained are not thought to be serious
and he is expected to make a full and speedy recovery,” Team
Sky said in a  statement  on its website.  Wiggins became the first British winner of the Tour de
France, cycling’s most prestigious race, on July 22. Ten days
later, he won his fourth Olympic gold medal with a victory in
the men’s time trial at the London Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
