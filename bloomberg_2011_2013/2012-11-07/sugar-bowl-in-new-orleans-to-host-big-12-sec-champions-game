The Sugar Bowl will host the post-
season college football game between the  Southeastern Conference 
and the  Big 12 Conference  champions.  The game will be played at the Superdome in New Orleans for
12 years, with the first matchup on Jan. 1, 2015.  “The result will be, without a doubt, one of college
football’s best bowl games on an annual basis, one that brings
tremendous national prestige and millions of dollars in economic
impact to our city and state over the New Year’s holiday,” said
Paul Hoolahan, chief executive officer of the Sugar Bowl.  The champions from the two conferences will meet unless one
or both earn a spot in the four-team model to determine the
national championship. If that occurs, other teams will be
substituted in the Sugar Bowl. The new college football playoff
system begins after the 2014 season.  “New Orleans and the Sugar Bowl are synonymous with post-
season college football,” SEC Commissioner Mike Slive said in a
statement. “We look forward to competing against the Big 12 as
a new championship tradition begins on New Year’s Day.”  In the 14-year history of the BCS, the Big 12 and SEC have
had at least one team ranked in the top four of the final
standings 11 times. Each conference has had 14 teams in the top
four of the final BCS standings, tying for the best record in
the country.  SEC teams have made nine appearances in the national
championship game, while Big 12 schools have made seven trips.  Champions from the two conferences have met twice in BCS
bowl games since 1998, both in national championship games. In
2010, Alabama defeated Texas 37-21 in  Pasadena ,  California , and
 Florida  beat Oklahoma 24-14 in Miami in 2009.  “Big 12 fans can look forward to a New Year’s tradition
and coming to New Orleans to support their team,” said Big 12
Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
