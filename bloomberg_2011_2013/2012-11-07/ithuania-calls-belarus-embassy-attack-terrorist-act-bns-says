Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius
Azubalis said an attempt to set fire to his country’s embassy in
the Belarusian capital of Minsk last night was “a terrorist
act” against the Baltic nation, the Baltic News Service

bottles of flammable liquid were thrown over the embassy fence
in Minsk about 10:45 p.m., BNS reported. Azubalis urged
Belarusian authorities to investigate the incident, in which no
