Professional baseball player  Delmon
Young  pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment in the second
degree for yelling an anti-Semitic slur and tackling a person
outside a  New York  hotel in April, Manhattan District Attorney
Cyrus Vance Jr. said.  Young was ordered to complete 10 days of community service
and take part in a program at the Museum of Tolerance, Vance
said today in a statement. If he satisfies those conditions, he
can withdraw his aggravated harassment plea and instead admit to
harassment in the second degree, Vance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
