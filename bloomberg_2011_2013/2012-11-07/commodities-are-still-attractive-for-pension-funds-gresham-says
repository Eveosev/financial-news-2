Commodities are still attractive for
pension funds on inflation concern, said Douglas Hepworth,
director of research at New York-based Gresham Investment
Management LLC. The company has about $15 billion in commodities
under management, Hepworth said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  “We haven’t seen many pension funds withdrawing from
commodities. There was one large plan that decided it no longer
wanted to participate in long-only commodities program, and they
are moving toward long-short and risk-budgeting programs. But we
haven’t seen people abandoning the asset class. There is a
strong desire to get real assets.”  Gresham is focusing on a long diversified basket of
commodities as an inflation protection and a long-short
strategy, which becomes a diversifier at times of systemic
crisis, Hepworth said.  “We are poised on a nice edge between inflationary growth
and another crisis. The two are so evenly balanced, how can you
bet on one without the other one? We are generally pretty
defensive on everything right now.”  “People are thinking that inflation, although not
immediate, is a lot closer than it was. Now commodities have
become an inflation play with a diversification option. But
should the world pick up it will become what they were -- a
diversification play with an inflation option.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
