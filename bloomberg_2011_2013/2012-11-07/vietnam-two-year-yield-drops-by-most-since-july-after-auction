     Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Vietnam ’s bonds advanced, with the
two-year yield dropping the most in three months, after
borrowing costs fell at a government debt auction. The dong was
steady.  The State Treasury sold 1 trillion dong ($48 million) of
notes maturing 2014 yesterday with a coupon of 9.5 percent,
according to the  Hanoi Stock Exchange’s  website. That compared
with 9.7 percent at the last sale of like-maturity securities on
Oct. 29. Banks have increased debt purchases as lending slows,
said Nguyen Duy Phong an analyst at Viet Capital Securities.  “Lenders still have surplus cash and demand is high,” he
said from Ho Chi Minh city. “That’s why yields have gone
down.”  The yield on the two-year bonds fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 9.66 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest drop since July 30 and the lowest level since Sept. 26.
The yield on the five-year securities fell one basis point to
10.10 percent.  Outstanding loans increased 3.3 percent this year, Thoi Bao
Kinh Te Vietnam newspaper reported yesterday, citing central
bank data. In January, the government announced a 2012 credit-
growth target of 15 percent to 17 percent.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 3:36 p.m. in
Hanoi, the same level as yesterday’s close, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
