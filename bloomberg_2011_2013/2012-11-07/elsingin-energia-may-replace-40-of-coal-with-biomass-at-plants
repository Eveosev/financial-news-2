Helsingin Energia,  Finland ’s third-
biggest coal user, may replace as much as 40 percent of its coal
with wood pellets at two plants in the next eight years to limit
 carbon emissions  and boost renewable energy output.  Helsingin Energia, the country’s biggest municipal utility,
strives to find an “optimal fuel mix” for replacing 5 to 10
percent of coal use by co-firing 100,000 metric tons of wood
pellets annually starting 2014, and possibly 40 percent by 2020,
after tests which are taking place through April, it said today
in an e-mailed statement.  At stake is the fuel mix at two of the company’s main
facilities, the 226-megawatt  Hanasaari  and 160-megawatt
Salmisaari cogeneration plants in Helsinki, as the city owner
strives to cut emissions by replacing fossil fuels with
renewable energy sources at the utility which supplies power to
400,000 households.  The front-year Nordic power contract tends to track the
short-run marginal cost for coal plants, Timo Karttinen,  Fortum
Oyj (FUM1V)  executive vice president,  said  yesterday at a conference in
in  Stockholm , broadcast on the website of Finland’s biggest
utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
