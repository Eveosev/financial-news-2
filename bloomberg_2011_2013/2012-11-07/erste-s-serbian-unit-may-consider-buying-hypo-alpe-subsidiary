Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s Serbian unit
may consider buying the domestic business of Austria’s Hypo
Alpe-Adria International AG if offered for sale separately.  Hypo Alpe, the third-biggest lender in the former Yugoslav
nations, yesterday asked investors to submit initial bids for
its units in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro,  Serbia  and
Slovenia.  “We would be interested to look at Hypo in Serbia if it
was offered for sale separately,” Slavko Caric, chief executive
officer of the Novi Sad, Serbia-based Erste Banka AD, told
reporters in Belgrade today.  Hypo Alpe in Serbia was the sixth-biggest bank by assets at
the end of June with a 6 percent market share, according to
central bank data. Erste ranked 12th with a 3.4 percent market
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
