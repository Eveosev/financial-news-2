Aluminum consumers are buying metal
on a short-term basis rather than for later delivery, according
to Sucden Financial Ltd., one of the 12 companies on the floor
of the  London  Metal Exchange.  “There is little sign of forward bookings,” said Steve Hardcastle, head of client services for industrial commodities
at Sucden. “The negotiations for next year’s contracts are
being particularly difficult this year on the basis of
premiums.”  Short-term buying “is going through at good volumes,”
Hardcastle said at a briefing in London today. High premiums
that buyers have to pay for aluminum are playing “a huge part”
in the aluminum market, eroding consumer margins, he said.  The fee added to aluminum for immediate-delivery on the LME
was $170 to $185 a ton in  Singapore , excluding duty, Hardcastle
said. Premiums in Rotterdam that include duty into the European
Union were last seen at $280 and $290 a ton, he said.  Aluminum consumers are buying nearby metal on the LME and
selling forward to take advantage of the market in a so-called
contango, when contracts with later delivery dates trade at
higher prices than nearer-dated metal. They are also hedging
 interest rates  and currencies to “claw back their margins,”
Hardcastle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
