Sony Corp. (6758) , the world’s second-
largest video-game maker, said it received a safety certificate
for its PlayStation 3 home console from the  China  Quality
Certification Centre in July.  The company has no plans to sell the machine in China, Mai
Hora, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Sony’s game unit said by
phone, confirming a Reuters report today.  China’s culture ministry has banned video-game consoles
since 2000. Sales of the devices can only start if the ban is
lifted. None of the consoles, which also include Nintendo Co.’s
Wii and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox, are sold through legitimate
channels in the world’s most populous country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
