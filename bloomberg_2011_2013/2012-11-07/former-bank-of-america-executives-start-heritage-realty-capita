Heritage Capital Group Inc., a
Jacksonville, Florida-based broker-dealer, has formed a real
estate investment bank run by former  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
executives.  Heritage Realty Capital, run by William Nicholson and
Michael Case, will find debt and equity investors for commercial
properties, Case said in a telephone interview. The firm will
target projects between $25 million and $50 million, he said.  The group plans to capitalize on the difficulty some funds
have had raising cash to invest in real estate after the
property bubble burst in 2007. Heritage Realty secures financing
for individual properties, meaning investors will be able to
assess each project rather than handing over money for
unspecified deals, Case said.  “Traditional sources of equity have been burned and so
there’s a lot more hesitation by a number of groups to go into
these blind pools,” Case said. “I think the market will be
very receptive to something that has a little more transparency
to what they are investing in.”  Nicholson, 65, was previously a managing director in the
real estate advisory group at Bank of America based in
Jacksonville,  Florida . Case, 34, spent 10 years at Bank of
America in various positions in the bank’s real estate capital
markets group in  New York .  -- Editors: Mitchell Martin,   John Parry   To contact the reporter on this story:
