State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan will sell
12 percent stakes in the proposed Trans-Anatolia gas pipeline to
 BP Plc (BP/)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  and 5 percent to  Total SA (FP)  to spur plans
to ship fuel from the  Caspian Sea  to Turkey’s European border.  The Baku-based oil producer known as Socar will retain 51
percent of its current 80 percent in the project, while Turkey’s
state-controlled Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS and Turkiye
Petrolleri AO will hold 20 percent, President Rovnaq Abdullayev
told reporters today in a district south of the Azeri capital.  Azerbaijan and Turkey agreed in June to build the 1,240-
mile line, known as Tanap, costing about $7 billion. It will
connect with the proposed Nabucco West link or Trans-Adriatic
pipeline to take gas to Europe. A BP Plc-led group developing
the Shah Deniz gas field will choose between the two by May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
