Russian  stock futures  jumped in New
York on prospects a presidential victory for  Barack Obama  will
spur a rally in oil, the nation’s biggest export earner.  Futures expiring in December on Moscow’s RTS Index gained
0.9 percent to 145,340 in New York, and  expected swings  in the
contracts slid for the first time this week. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. rose 0.8 percent, led by oil producer OAO
 Surgutneftegas. (SGTPY)  CTC Media Inc. surged the most since Sept. 14 on
speculation it will report its highest third-quarter profit
since 2010 today.  Obama won re-election over Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , according to television network projections. Bond
purchases under Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  have
swelled the amount of dollars on the market, supporting crude
oil’s 129 percent rally since Obama took office in January 2009.
An Obama victory will stoke Russian stock gains as the incumbent
has a “more constructive” view of relations with Russia than
Romney, East Capital, which manages about $2.4 billion of
Russian assets, said before vote-counting ended.  The RTS futures are “reflecting an Obama win already,”
 Luis Saenz , head of equity sales and trading at BCS Financial
Group, said by e-mail yesterday from London. “An Obama win is a
clear win for Russia. Aside from the positive political ties,
Obama’s administration would continue to support a weaker dollar
which good for the price of oil.”  Based on latest projections, Obama had won 275 electoral
votes, more than the 270 needed to win. Romney had 203.  Government Revenue  Crude oil for December delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  dropped 0.3 percent to $88.41 a barrel in electronic
trading as of 12:43 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The contract climbed 3.6
percent yesterday, the biggest gain since Oct. 4. Prices are
down 11 percent this year.  Oil, which along with natural gas contributed about 50
percent of Russia’s government revenue last year, rose on
forecasts that U.S. gasoline supplies dropped after  Hurricane
Sandy  forced the shutdown of East Coast refineries and as
Americans went to the polls.  Brent oil for December settlement increased 3.1 percent to
$111.07 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange yesterday.
Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, added 2.2 percent to
$109.82, the most since Oct. 4.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.7 percent to $28.38
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in futures, slipped 0.2 percent to 27.41 points.  ‘Better for Russia’  Surgutneftegas, the nation’s fourth-biggest crude producer,
jumped 4.8 percent to $6.21, the highest level since Oct. 26.
The company’s preferred  shares  advanced 2.8 percent to 19.81
rubles, or 63 U.S. cents, in Moscow yesterday. One ADR equals 10
preferred shares. Futures on the company’s ordinary shares
increased 0.5 percent.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.5 percent to 1,446.46 in Moscow
yesterday, climbing for a fourth day in the longest streak of
gains since July 30. If Obama wins, Russian stocks will rise for
another two days, Marcus Svedberg, chief economist at East
Capital, said in a phone interview yesterday.  “An Obama win would be better for Russia,” he said. “The
Democrats tend to have a more constructive view on relations
with Russia. The rhetoric coming from Romney has been much
harsher.”  CTC’s Profit  CTC Media (CTCM) , which owns the CTC television channel, climbed
3.4 percent to $8.77, the biggest gain since Sept. 14, in New
York yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer Boris Podolsky and Chief Investment
Officer Nikolay Surikov will host a conference call with
investors and analysts at 5 p.m. in Moscow today, following the
release of the company’s earnings for the third quarter earlier
in the day.  CTC Media will probably say today that third-quarter  net
income  rose 41 percent to $24.4 million, according to the mean
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities surged 2.3 percent
yesterday, the most since Oct. 4.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest producer of coal for
steelmakers, gained 2.4 percent to $6.73 in  New York . The  stock 
rose 0.9 percent to 209.90 rubles, or $6.69, in Moscow
yesterday. Futures on the company’s stock added 3.4 percent.  Contracts on the ruble advanced 0.4 percent to 31.552 per
dollar yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 0.4 percent to HK$4.42 in recent Hong Kong trading. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
