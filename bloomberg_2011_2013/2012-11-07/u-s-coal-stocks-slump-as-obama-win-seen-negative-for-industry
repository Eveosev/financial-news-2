Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) ,  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR)  and other U.S. coal producers slumped on
speculation that the re-election of President  Barack Obama  will
mean more regulation for the industry.  Peabody, the St. Louis-based coal miner that’s the largest
in the U.S. by sales, fell 9.6 percent to $26.24 at the close in
 New York , the most in more than three months. Bristol, Virginia-
based Alpha, the second-biggest, dropped 12 percent.  Arch Coal
Inc. (ACI) ,  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) ,  James River Coal Co. (JRCC)  and  Walter Energy
Inc. (WLT)  also declined.  “The coal industry has seen increased regulatory oversight
from the EPA on a number of issues under Obama’s first term,
such as stricter permitting requirements in Appalachia and new
regulations for emission reductions at utilities,” Lucas Pipes,
an analyst at New York-based Brean Capital Carret & Co., said in
an e-mail today. “There’s a perception that another Obama term
is negative for coal.”  Pipes said rising natural  gas prices , not regulations, will
be the most important driver for coal demand. U.S. coal
producers have shut mines and fired thousands of workers this
year after cutting tens of millions of tons of output in the
face of weaker demand and prices. Coal has suffered after some
power stations switched to using gas.  James River  also fell today after reporting its third-
quarter net loss widened to 59 cents a share from 11 cents a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
