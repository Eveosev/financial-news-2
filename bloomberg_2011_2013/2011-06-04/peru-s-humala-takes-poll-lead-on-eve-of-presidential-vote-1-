Peruvian presidential candidate
Ollanta Humala took the lead in a poll by Ipsos Apoyo for the
first time since April as he prepares to face Keiko Fujimori in
a runoff vote tomorrow.  Humala, an ex-army officer and head of  Peru ’s Nationalist
Party, had a 3.8 percentage point-lead over Fujimori, the Lima-
based researcher said in an e-mailed report.  The company contacted 4,000 people today in the national
poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.6
percentage points, Ipsos Apoyo said.  Fujimori, a congresswoman and daughter of jailed former
President  Alberto Fujimori , led Humala by 2.2 percentage points
in an Ipsos Apoyo poll released June 2.  About 10 percent of voters aren’t completely decided, which
could affect the result of tomorrow’s vote, Ipsos Apoyo said.
The poll doesn’t survey Peruvians living abroad, which account
for 2 percent to 3 percent of the electorate, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
