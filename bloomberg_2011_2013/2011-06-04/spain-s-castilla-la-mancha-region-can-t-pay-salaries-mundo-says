The Spanish region of Castilla-La
Mancha has no money and can’t pay the salaries of its workers,
 El Mundo  reported, citing Vicente Tirado, regional secretary of
the  People’s Party  in the region.  Tirado, number two to Maria Dolores de Cospedal, the
recently elected president of Castilla-La Mancha, said the party
would have to look for ways to pay 76,000 salaries next month as
the region is “totally broke” and owes 2 billion euros ($2.9
billion) in unpaid bills to suppliers, the newspaper said.  Santiago Moreno, the outgoing Socialist head of the region,
denied the accusations, saying they are “totally false,” the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
