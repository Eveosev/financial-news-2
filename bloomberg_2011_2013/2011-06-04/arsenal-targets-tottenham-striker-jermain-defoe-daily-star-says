Arsenal has targeted Tottenham’s
Jermain Defoe in its search for a top-class goalscorer, the
 Daily Star  reported.  Defoe, 28, has scored 101 goals in 11 Premier League
seasons. He totaled just eight last season as he battled injury
and long spells on the bench.  Spurs are willing to listen to offers of around 10 million
pounds ($16 million) for the England striker, the Star said.
Manager  Harry Redknapp  has already started preparing for Defoe’s
departure by stepping up efforts to sign Chelsea’s Didier
Drogba, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
