As much as 500,000 pesos ($122,000)
were stolen from  Argentina ’s central bank over several months,
newspaper La Nacion reported, citing bank officials it did not
identify.  The robbed money was all in 100 peso bills which had been
withdrawn by the bank from public use to destroy, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said. The exact amount of the theft has
not been determined, the daily said.  A voice message left by Bloomberg News on central bank
spokesman Eduado De Simone’s cellular phone seeking comment was
not returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
