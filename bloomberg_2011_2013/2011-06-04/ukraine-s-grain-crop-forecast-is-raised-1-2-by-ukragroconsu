Ukraine’s grain-harvest forecast was
raised by 1.2 percent to 45 million metric tons amid increased
planting and forecasts for higher winter yields, said
UkrAgroConsult.  Yields can still suffer if the hot, dry weather that the
country has experienced since May 20 persists in June,
especially for late-sown spring crops, the Kiev, Ukraine-based
research group said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.
Ukraine gathered 39.2 million tons last year.  UkrAgroConsult boosted its corn forecast to 13.55 million
tons from 12.7 million tons, and trimmed its barley projection
to 8.55 million tons from 8.85 million tons.  Ukraine exported 766,600 metric tons of grain via ports in
May, including 729,000 metric tons of corn and 27,600 metric
tons of wheat, the researcher said. Grain was shipped to  Turkey ,
Egypt, Iran,  Greece , Albania, Lebanon, Italy, Spain,  Russia ,
Georgia and the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
