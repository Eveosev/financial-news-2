Saudi Arabian shares tumbled the most
in almost three months, led by petrochemical companies, after a
smaller-than-forecast increase in U.S. payrolls heightened
concern that a slower economic recovery will curb oil demand.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, and  National Industrialization Co. (NIC)  fell
more than 2 percent.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest
publicly traded lender by market value, declined 1.7 percent.  The 146-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 1.7 percent to
6,624.95 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, the biggest loss
since March 15. All 15 industry groups dropped.  The U.S. economy added the fewest number of workers in
eight months in May and unemployment unexpectedly rose to 9.1
percent, according to a Labor Department report yesterday.
Employers added 54,000 workers to payrolls, missing the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey for an increase of 165,000.  “Investors are worried that demand for oil will drop after
yesterday’s negative U.S. jobs data,” Turki Fadaak, an analyst
with AlBilad Investment Co., said in  Riyadh . “The possibility
of OPEC increasing oil output also heightened concern.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
respond at its June 8 conference in Vienna if the world needs
more crude, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said on June 2.  Oil in  New York  dropped 0.2 percent yesterday. Crude for
July delivery settled at $100.22 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices declined 0.4 percent this week.
 Saudi Arabia  holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Sabic, Tasnee  Sabic declined 2.6 percent to 104.25 riyals, the lowest
price since March 29. National Industrialization, the
petrochemicals maker known as Tasnee, fell 2.3 percent to 42.80
riyals.  Al Rajhi  dropped 1.7 percent to 74.25 riyals, the largest
loss since March 14.  The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 0.4 percent
yesterday, bringing its three-day retreat to 2.4 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1 percent and the Stoxx Europe
600 index declined 0.4 percent.  “As global markets continue their slump, local investors
are taking the opportunity to gain some profits in anticipation
of better buying opportunities before the end of June,” said
Fuad Aghabi, investment director at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
