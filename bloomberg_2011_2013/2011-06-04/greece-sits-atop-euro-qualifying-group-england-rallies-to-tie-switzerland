Greece  beat Malta 3-1 to take the
lead in its group in qualifying for soccer’s 2012 European
Championship, while England rallied for a 2-2 tie with
Switzerland.  Ioannis Fetfatzidis scored twice to help Greece take a
one-point lead in Group F over Croatia, which beat Georgia 2-1
last night, and Israel, which defeated Latvia 2-1 today.  England came back from a 2-0 deficit to draw with
Switzerland in Group G in London. Tranquillo Barnetta scored
twice in the first half for the Swiss, before  Frank Lampard  and
Ashley Young answered for England.  Montenegro remained tied with England atop the group with
11 points following a 1-1 tie with Bulgaria. Radmori Djalovic
scored for Montenegro and Ivelin Popov had the  Bulgaria  goal.  Russia, Slovakia and Ireland all won to stay tied for the
Group B lead with 13 points.  Roman Pavlyuchenko’s hat trick gave Russia a 3-1 win over
Armenia, Robbie Kean scored both goals in Ireland’s 2-0 win in
Macedonia and Miroslav Karhan had the goal as Slovakia beat
Andorra 1-0.  Heider Postega’s goal gave Portugal a 1-0 win over Norway
that left the two teams tied for first in Group H with Denmark,
which won 2-0 in Iceland. All have 10 points.  The winner in each of the nine groups, along with the
second-place team with the most points, qualifies for Euro 2012
with hosts Poland and Ukraine. The remaining eight second-place
teams will play off for the final four spots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
