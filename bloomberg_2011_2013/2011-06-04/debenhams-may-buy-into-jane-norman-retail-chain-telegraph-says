Debenhams Plc (DEB) , the U.K.â€™s second-
largest department-store owner, may buy into Jane Norman
Holdings Ltd., the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Debenhams may buy the fashion retailer or its brand name,
the newspaper said. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is handling the
sale of Jane Norman, which is owned by a group of about 15
banks, according to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
