Brazilian Cabinet Chief  Antonio Palocci  said he never disclosed the name of his consulting
firm’s former clients to President  Dilma Rousseff , Folha de
S.Paulo reported, citing an interview.  “I didn’t think it was appropriate to trouble the
president with this kind of information,” the newspaper quoted
Palocci as saying in the interview. “So far, nobody presented
any concrete fact that may suggest any misconduct from my
part,” Palocci told Folha.  On May 20, Folha reported Palocci earned 20 million reais
($12.7 million) in consultancy fees in 2010 while also serving
in congress and managing Rousseff’s election campaign. The
company, Projeto Consultoria Financeira e Economica Ltda, earned
160,000 reais in 2006, its first year of business, Folha said.  In an interview on TV Globo yesterday, he said “not a
single cent” of his earnings last year was related to his work
managing the campaign.  Rousseff is facing rising pressure from both political
opponents and allies to dismiss Palocci, who may face a formal
probe from the general prosecutor and be called to testify
before lawmakers.  Brazil ’s federal prosecutor  Jose Rocha Junior  will
investigate whether Palocci’s consulting fee earnings broke the
law. Brazil’s general prosecutor,  Roberto Gurgel , responsible
for investigating possible criminal conduct by Cabinet
ministers, has made two requests to Palocci to explain the jump
in his personal wealth. The prosecutor has no deadline for
presenting his findings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
