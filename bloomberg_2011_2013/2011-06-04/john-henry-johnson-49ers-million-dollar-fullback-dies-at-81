Former  San Francisco  49ers fullback
John Henry Johnson, a member of “The Million Dollar Backfield”
in the 1950s, died yesterday at the age of 81, the National
Football League team said.  Johnson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
1987 after a 14-season career.  He played for the 49ers from 1954-56, joining Joe Perry,
Hugh McElhenny and Y.A. Tittle, whose offensive prowess led to
the nickname “The Million Dollar Backfield.” The group is the
only backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the
hall of fame.  “As a member of ‘The Million Dollar Backfield,’ he holds a
cherished place in both 49ers and NFL history,” team owner John
York said in a statement.  A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson’s 6,804 career
rushing yards trailed Jim Brown, Jim Taylor and Perry at his
retirement in 1966. He also caught 186 passes for 1,478 yards
and scored 55 touchdowns.  Drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of
the 1953  NFL draft , Johnson played for the Canadian Football
League for one season before joining San Francisco. He also
played for the  Detroit Lions  (1957-59), Steelers (1960-65) and
Houston Oilers (1966).  To contact the reporter on this story:
