RTL Group SA (RTL) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Gerhard Zeiler won’t apply to become head of Austrian
state broadcaster ORF, Profil magazine reported, citing an
interview.  While Zeiler, a native Austrian, would have liked to help
ORF solve its “not inconsiderable problems,” he quickly
realized that politicians were simply aiming to have “party
political staff wishes” fulfilled, Zeiler told the magazine,
according to a prerelease of an article that will be published
on June 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
