Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ’s chief executive
officer expects a return to profit this year and next even as
unrest in North Africa and the  Middle East  burdened first-
quarter results,  Frankfurter Allgemeine  reported, citing an
interview.  The company made major investments in its route network and
will “bring in the harvest next year,” the newspaper quoted
Joachim Hunold as saying. Bookings are already on the rise,
Hunold said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
