Greek government notes advanced,
pushing two-year yields down the most in over a year, as
European officials drew closer to an agreement on a new aid
package for the debt-stricken nation.  The Greek two-year note yield dropped below 23 percent for
the first time since April as European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials moved to complete a review of  Greece ’s
plan for 78 billion euros ($113 billion) in asset sales and
austerity measures. German 10-year bunds, Europe’s benchmark
security, fell for the first week in eight.  “Developments over the week have raised fresh optimism on
the Greek situation,” which has benefited Greek bonds, said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “The euro-region data flow has been more
or less neutral so I would say the Greece story has been the
major driver of bunds as well.”  Two-year Greek note yields fell 252 basis points to 22.83
percent as of 4:32 p.m. in  London  yesterday, posting their the
biggest weekly drop since the five days ending May 14, 2010.
Ten-year yields fell 49 basis points to 15.93 percent.  The 10-year German bund yield climbed six basis points to
3.04 percent, after reaching 2.96 percent, the lowest since Jan.
12. The yield on German two-year notes rose 12 basis points to
1.68 percent, rebounding from a 10-week low of 1.56 percent on
May 30.  The yield difference, or spread, between 10-year German
bunds and Greek securities of a similar maturity narrowed to
1,292 basis points from 1,326 basis points at the end of last
week.  Interest-Rate Decision  Greece’s two-year yield surged more than 700 basis points
since the start of April.  Europe ’s financial leaders need to
hammer out a revised Greek package by the end of June, in time
to persuade the IMF to pay out its share of the next tranche of
loans and before a summit of EU leaders on June 23-24. The IMF
had indicated that it would withhold its payment unless the EU
comes up with a plan to close Greece’s 30 billion-euro funding
gap for 2012.  Bunds may fall next week if European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  indicates a July interest-rate increase
after policy makers meet on June 9. All 46 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast the bank will leave rates
unchanged after Trichet last month signaled rates will stay on
hold until after June.  German  government bonds  have handed investors 0.1 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
U.S. Treasuries have returned 2.8 percent. Greek bonds have lost
12.5 percent in the same period, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
