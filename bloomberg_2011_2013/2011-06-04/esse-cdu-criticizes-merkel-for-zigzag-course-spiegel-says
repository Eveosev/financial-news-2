The leader of the Christian
Democratic Union party’s parliamentary group in the German state
of Hesse criticized German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for adopting
a “zigzag course” on party policy,  Spiegel  reported, citing an
internal CDU paper.  The party’s recent electoral defeat in the state of Baden-
Wuerttemberg had a “historic dimension” caused by a lack of
vision and the efforts to rescue the euro triggered
“significant disturbance” in Merkel’s party, Christean Wagner
wrote in the paper, according to the magazine.  Still, “at the moment, there is no alternative to Merkel”
as party chief, Wagner was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
