Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  aims to increase the
number of partners it has in  Russia ,  China ,  India  and  Brazil 
over the next three to five years by about 360,000,  Euro am
Sonntag  said, citing an interview with Jon Roskill, corporate
vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft.  While doing business in European peripheral countries is
complicated at the moment, Roskill expects “record” operations
in  Germany  this year, according to the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
