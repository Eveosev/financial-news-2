Some  London  hotels will be charging
as much as four times their normal rates during the 2012  Olympic
Games , the  Times  reported.  A four-star Best Western Shaftsbury in Piccadilly will
charge 450 pounds ($698) a night for a single room in August
2012, compared with 199 pounds this year, while another
unidentified hotel is asking for 1,100 pounds, the London-based
newspaper said, citing unidentified tour operators.  The hotels are seeking to maximize their profit after the
London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games
booked as much as 90 percent of hotel stock in central London
for sponsors, federation members and the media at discounted
rates, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
