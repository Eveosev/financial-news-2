U.S. stocks fell this week, sending
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to its longest streak of losses
since 2004, after worse-than-estimated reports on jobs and
manufacturing fueled concern earnings growth will slow.  All 10 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index groups dropped, with
declines exceeding 1.3 percent.  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL)  sank 15
percent, leading declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
after cutting its profit forecast. J.C. Penney Co. and  Stanley
Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  slumped more than 6 percent as investors
sold companies tied to economic growth.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  decreased at least 4 percent after sales growth
missed projections.  The S&P 500 lost 2.3 percent to 1,300.16, the biggest
weekly decline since August. Its five-week losing streak is the
longest since 2008 and puts the index at its lowest level since
March. The Dow fell 290.32 points, or 2.3 percent, to 12,151.26,
also posting a fifth-straight weekly slump.  “It was a C-minus week for the economy,” said  David Sowerby , a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based money manager at
Loomis Sayles & Co., which oversees more than $150 billion.
“These are the kind of weeks that remind investors stocks don’t
just go straight up. There was enough data this week to begin to
connect the dots that uncertainty remains.”  The S&P 500 has retreated 4.7 percent since closing at an
almost-three-year high of 1,363.61 on April 29. The Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. has sunk to minus 117.20,
meaning reports are missing projections by the most since
January 2009, two months before the S&P 500 tumbled to the
lowest level in 12 years.  Payrolls Report  Labor Department figures showed payrolls increased by
54,000 last month, falling short of the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey that called for a rise of 165,000. The
jobless rate climbed to 9.1 percent.  Michael Shaoul , whose Marketfield Fund Ltd. beat 81 percent
of competitors last year, said that while the payrolls report
was disappointing, it may also be a signal the slowdown in the
economic data is near its peak. Private-sector hiring has risen
by an average 145,000 a month over the last year, faster than
economists had predicted, according to Shaoul. He noted that
weaker nonfarm payrolls reports in February and July 2004 failed
to derail the last  bull market , which peaked in October 2007.  ‘Significantly Lower’  “What the data will do, however, is accelerate the process
of economic revision, with estimates of U.S. growth being forced
significantly lower across the board,” Shaoul wrote in a note
to clients. “As damaging as the process may be for asset
values, it has surprisingly little to do with the actual ability
of corporations to generate revenue.”  The biggest decline in the  S&P 500  since August is creating
a buying opportunity for investors, according to Blackstone
Group LP’s  Byron Wien . The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P
500 has fallen close to its lowest level in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data. The index currently trades at 14.8 times
earnings, near this year’s low of 14.7 when it fell in March
after  Japan ’s earthquake.  “Investors should be looking for buying opportunities,”
said Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners,
whose parent, New York-based Blackstone Group LP, is the world’s
largest private-equity firm. “The economy is not as bad as it
looks right now. Corporate profits will be good, very good.
People are asking me, ‘Do you still think the market can get to
1,500 by the end of the year?’ I do.”  Jobs Data  The S&P 500 tumbled the most since August on June 1,
following an ADP Employer Services’ jobs report that trailed
estimates and data from the  Institute for Supply Management  that
showed manufacturing expanding at the lowest pace in more than a
year. A separate report this week showed that more Americans
than forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits .  Newell Rubbermaid declined 15 percent to $14.97, the
biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The maker of Sharpie pens and
Rubbermaid containers cut its full-year profit forecast, saying
economic woes are hampering  consumer spending .  J.C. Penney declined 10 percent to $32.26 and Stanley Black
& Decker retreated 6.1 percent to $68.93. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index sank 3.9 percent this week, while the S&P 500
Consumer Discretionary and Materials Indexes led losses in the
S&P 500, declining 3.2 percent each.  Limited, Gap  Limited Brands Inc. and  Gap Inc. (GPS)  reported May sales this
week that trailed analysts’ projections as increasing prices and
surging gasoline costs deterred budget-conscious shoppers.
Limited fell 4.9 percent to $37.44. Gap lost 6.7 percent to
$17.92.  Auto companies also fell after sales last month missed
analysts’ estimates on higher gasoline prices. GM dropped 6.9
percent to $29.12 this week, while Ford slumped 4 percent to
$14.01. GM deliveries declined 1.2 percent to 221,192 vehicles,
the Detroit-based automaker said on June 1. The average estimate
was for a 1.5 percent increase. Ford light-vehicle deliveries
decreased 2.6 percent to 191,529, compared with analysts’
average estimate for a 0.5 percent decline.  “This is a confidence issue for the consumer discretionary
sector,” said  Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at LPL
Financial Corp. in  Boston , which manages $300 billion. “We’ve
seen retail sales hold up reasonably well and consumers have
continued to spend. This jobs report combined with the weakening
trend in housing could undermine some of the support for the
retailers.”  Sealed Air Falls  Sealed Air Corp. (SEE)  sank 14 percent to $21.89. The maker of
Cryovac food packaging, Jiffy protective mailers and medical
supplies agreed to buy Diversey Holdings Inc. for $2.9 billion
to add sales to emerging-market food-processors concerned about
product safety. The company is handing Clayton Dubilier & Rice
LLC an almost $1 billion windfall at the expense of its own
shareholders by paying a 52 percent premium for Diversey,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Juniper Networks Inc. slid 13 percent to $32.33. The
network equipment maker’s Chief Executive Officer  Kevin Johnson 
indicated at a Bank of America Corp. conference this week that
“the quarter is back-end loaded,” fanning concern that results
will be worse than investors anticipated.  “We’re about to go into the pre-announcement season which,
as we have seen in the economic data, is likely to be somewhat
disappointing to investors,” Kleintop said. “We will hear a
number of companies taking down guidance and back away from what
they’ve issued previously and that could create more down draft
in a June swoon for stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
