Santi Cazorla scored two goals to
lead World Cup champion  Spain  to a 4-0 win over the U.S. in a
soccer exhibition match.  Alvaro Negredo and  Fernando Torres  also scored for Spain
at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.  It was the first meeting between the teams since the
Americans beat Spain 2-0 in the semifinals of the 2009
Confederations Cup in South Africa.  Cazorla scored off a pass from David Villa in the 29th
minute and Negredo doubled the Spain lead four minutes later.
Cazorla added his second goal, off another assist from Villa,
four minutes before halftime.  Torres, assisted by Borja Valero, made it 4-0 in the 73rd,
knocking it off one goalpost, then the other before it crossed
the line.  The game was the U.S.’s final tune-up for the Concacaf
Gold Cup, the championship of North and Central American and
Caribbean regions. The U.S. opens the Gold Cup in three days
against  Canada  in Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
