(Corrects currency in last paragraph.)  The Saudi Arabian economy will
probably expand 6.9 percent this year on higher oil output, the
 National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  said, raising its earlier forecast of
4.2 percent.  “Around half of this revision comes from the hydrocarbon
sector, which is now forecast to grow 10 percent, compared with
the 5 percent expected before,” NBK said in an e-mailed report
today. “Oil revenue could reach a record of more than 1
trillion riyals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
