Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said he expects Belarus to be granted emergency financing
from a regional fund today.  “I can’t say in advance what decision will be made,
although I think everything will turn out positively,” Kudrin
told reporters in Kiev, where representatives of nations that
participate in the fund are meeting.  Belarus, which devalued its currency 36 percent against the
dollar last month, is seeking up to $3.5 billion over three
years from the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Community’s anti-
crisis fund. Belarus said June 1 that it has begun talks with
the  International Monetary Fund  on separate financing of up to
$8 billion over the next five years.  The Russian-led loan is dependent on Belarus taking steps
to improve its current account deficit, which reached 16 percent
of gross domestic product last year. Belarus should sell at
least $2.5 billion in state assets annually for the next three
years to receive the loan, Kudrin said last month. The first
tranche of the loan will be $800 million and would be available
to Belarus within a week of the final decision, he said then.  The Eurasian Economic Community includes Russia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The group
formed a $10 billion  anti-crisis fund , with three-quarters of it
coming from  Russia , in 2009 to help member states deal with the
global financial crisis.  The fund still has $8.1 billion available to lend, Kudrin
said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
