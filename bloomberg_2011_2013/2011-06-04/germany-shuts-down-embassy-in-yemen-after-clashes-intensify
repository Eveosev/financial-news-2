Germany  closed its embassy in Yemen
after battles in the country’s capital Sana’a intensified.  “Due to the current development of the situation, the
Foreign Ministry decided to close the embassy immediately,” the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement from Berlin today. The
staff will leave Yemen “as soon as it is safe and possible.”  Fighting in Sana’a between Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s security forces and supporters of Sadiq al-Ahmar, leader
of the Hashid, Yemen’s most influential tribe, toughened
yesterday after the breakdown of a truce mediated by tribal
leaders. Government supporters attacked protesters in the
southern city of Taiz and Saleh escaped serious injury in the
shelling of his palace compound in Sana’a.  “I urgently request all fellow countrymen to immediately
leave the country as long as it is safe and possible,” German
Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said in Hanoi, according to
the statement. Current human-rights violations are “not
acceptable,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
