Managers at Southern Cross Healthcare
Plc, which said this week it is in financial difficulties, made
about 35 million pounds ($57 million) on shares in the care-home
provider in 2007, the Financial Times said.  The executives, including former Chairman William Colvin,
sold their entire stakes in December that year at 550 pence a
share, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information. The shares, which traded at as much as 634.50 pence
in December 2007, closed yesterday at 6.3 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
