Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP3) ,
the Brazilian telephone company known as Oi, plans to start
operating in the country’s cable TV market by the beginning of
next year, newspaper O Globo reported, citing regulation
director Paulo Mattos.  The decision comes after Brazil’s telecommunications
regulator, Anatel, agreed to consider updating cable TV rules.
Anatel President Ronaldo Sardenberg told reporters in Brasilia
on June 2 that the agency seeks to promote competition in the
market.  According to the regulator’s proposal, any company that
agrees to a 9,000 reais ($5,700) fee will be allowed to operate
a cable TV unit. Current rules block access to the cable TV
market for phone companies.  The new rules may be in place by September,  O Globo 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
