The  United States  should discard
“prejudice” related to the political turbulence in Beijing in
1989 to avoid damaging bilateral relations, China’s state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing foreign ministry
spokesman Hong Lei.  A clear conclusion has already been made on the events in
the late 1980s, Xinhua cited Hong as saying.  On June 4, 1989, Chinese troops fired on pro-democracy
student demonstrators who had been massing in Beijing’s
Tiananmen Square for weeks. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing
estimated a death toll exceeding 1,000, and in  Hong Kong , which
was due to return to China in 1997, nearly 1 million people, or
one-sixth of the population, marched in protest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
