Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, said it is planning to invest up to 1 billion
euros ($1.5 billion) in French hydropower projects as the
country prepares to renew licenses.  France ,  Europe ’s second-largest market for installed
hydropower capacity, is renewing concessions until 2015 to
operate hydroelectric dams with a combined output of 5,300
megawatts, about a fifth of the nation’s total. Stockholm-based
Vattenfall aims to obtain concessions for 1,000 megawatts, it
said in a statement today. The company opened an office in Paris
earlier this week, it said.  “Vattenfall’s ambition is to grow in renewable energy and
the upcoming hydropower opportunities in France fall well within
this scope,” Chief Executive Officer Oeystein Loeseth said in
the statement. “France is a growth market for Vattenfall.”  French authorities will select operators for plants in the
Alps, the Massif Central region and the Pyrenees following
tenders, the government said last year. The European Union is
seeking to open up electricity markets and aims to get a fifth
of its power from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter for this story:
