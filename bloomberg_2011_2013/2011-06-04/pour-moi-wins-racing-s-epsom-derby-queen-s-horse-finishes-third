Pour Moi won the Epsom Derby to give
19-year-old jockey Mickael Barzalona a victory in his race
debut.  Pour Moi, at 4-1 odds, charged from the rear to beat 25-1
shot Treasure Beach by a head in the 1 1/2-mile race at Epsom
Downs. The victory was the first in 10 Derby attempts for
trainer Andre Fabre.  Carlton House, the 5-2 race favorite owned by Queen
Elizabeth, finished third in the 13-horse field.  The Derby was first run in 1779 when Edward Smith Stanley,
the 12th Earl of Derby, organized a competition for himself and
his friends. It was extended to its current length five years
later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
