NH Hoteles SA (NHH) ,  Spain ’s largest
business-hotel operator, will meet covenants related to its
syndicated loan by the end of the year,  Expansion  reported,
citing Chief Financial Officer Roberto Chollet.  “As business picks up and we reduce debt, we foresee that
by year-end we will meet our covenants or be just about to,”
Chollet was cited as saying. NH Hoteles broke the covenants
after the financial crisis hurt its business in 2009, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
