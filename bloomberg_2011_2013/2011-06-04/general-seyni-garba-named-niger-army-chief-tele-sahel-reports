Niger President  Mahamadou Issoufou 
appointed General Seyni Garba, the nationâ€™s ambassador to
 Morocco , as chief of the national army, according to a decree
read on state-run television service Tele Sahel.  Garba, secretary general of the Ministry of National
Defense under ousted former President Mamadou Tandja, was made
ambassador by the military junta that came to power in a
February 2010 coup. He replaces General Souleymane Salou, the
uncle of General Salou Djibo, the former head of the military
junta, Sahel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
