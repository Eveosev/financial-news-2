A 48-year-old woman died today when
an explosion occurred in an underground water pipe in Auckland,
 New Zealand , police said.  “The cause of the explosion is still unclear and gas
levels remain high, restricting access to the area,” Auckland
Police said in a  statement  today. “ Emergency services  remain at
the scene and air is being pumped into the space in an effort to
make it safe so that a thorough scene examination can be carried
out and to enable the maintenance work to continue as
scheduled.”  A worker was killed and six others were injured by the gas
explosion, the Herald Sun newspaper reported, citing emergency
services. The explosion happened 4 meters (13 feet) into a
tunnel where a new water main was being connected earlier today,
