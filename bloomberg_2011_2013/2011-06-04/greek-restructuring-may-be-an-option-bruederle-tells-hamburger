Rainer Bruederle, leader of the
German Free Democrats group in the lower house of parliament,
said a restructuring of Greek debt could be envisaged,  Hamburger
Abendblatt  reported, citing an interview.  “From my viewpoint, a restructuring could be reasonable at
some point,” the newspaper quoted him as  saying . “But  Greece 
is no protectorate. The decision about a restructuring has to be
made in  Athens .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
