Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, will move coal by road and not rail from its $1.7
billion Moatize mine in northwestern Tete province, state-
controlled Radio Mozambique reported today, citing Transport and
Communications Minister Paulo Zucula.  The Rio De Janeiro-based company had planned to use rail
transport but opted for trucks after the completion date for
repair works to the Sena railway that serves the mine was pushed
back to September from March, the Maputo-based broadcaster said.  Vale said on May 8 that it had started operations at the
mine and will export coal through the central port of Beira.  The Indian group Rites and Ircon in 2004 won the contract
to repair the Sena railway after the lines were extensively
damaged during the southern African country’s 16 years of civil
war that ended in 1994, said Radio Mozambique.  To contact the reporter on this story:
