Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  plans to
present an offer to some private customers who suffered losses
from the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,  Tages-
Anzeiger  reported without saying where it obtained the
information.  Some customers that are holding structured investment
products that were issued by Lehman have already been notified,
while others will be informed over the coming days, the Zurich-
based newspaper reported. They have until Aug. 10 to accept the
offer, it said.  Credit Suisse plans to pool the assets and offer them for
sale to investors such as hedge funds, the newspaper said.  Credit Suisse spokesman Marc Dosch confirmed the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
