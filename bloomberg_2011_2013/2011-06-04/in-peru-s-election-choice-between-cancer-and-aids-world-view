Peru's presidential election is getting more dramatic than a  telenovela , leaving the country  deeply divided  and its  stock market volatile . The  neck-and-neck race  leading up to the June 5th election to succeed President  Alan Garcia  pits the former army officer  Ollanta Humala  against congresswoman  Keiko Fujimori , daughter of former President  Alberto Fujimori . Or, as the Peruvian Nobel Prize laureate Mario Vargas Llosa puts it, a choice " between terminal cancer and AIDS ." Why so morbid? To start, Keiko Fujimori's political pedigree isn't exactly pristine. Her father -- who  appointed her  first lady of Peru in 1994, after he separated from her mother -- now  calls Diroes Prison home . He's serving a  25-year sentence  for corruption and human rights abuses committed during his decade-long presidency, which ended in 2000. Some commentators worry that Keiko Fujimori is stained by her father's legacy and may be unduly influenced by his circle of friends. "The Fujimorato party structure still remains intact," the Peruvian writer Feliciano Padilla  wrote on his blog , Pescador de Luceros, noting that Keiko Fujimori is surrounded by several of her father's old political hands. Padilla also worries that the elder Fujimori might exert a more literal influence on his daughter's presidency -- given a story in La Republica newspaper that Fujimori has set up a  campaign office beside her father's jail . "It seems strange to no one that  Alberto Fujimori  is directing Keiko's election campaign," Padilla wrote. Novelist Jorge Eduardo Benavides, who runs the blog En la Enstanteria de la Izquierda,  agreed  that "voting for Keiko Fujimori is like giving a letter of legitimacy to a government that is not only corrupt, but will likely be a continuation of Fujimori in control." He continued: "We cannot forget that Keiko Fujimori was first lady for the government and was an active partner in this, besides being the main advocate for the idea of granting forgiveness to Alberto Fujimori." If Keiko's campaign carries baggage, it's nothing compared with some of the accusations dogging her opponent. In 2006, Humala  was accused  of committing human-rights abuses while he was an army officer during  Peru 's war against the Shining Path insurgency. (He has denied wrongdoing, and a judicial investigation into the matter  was inconclusive .) He also led a brief military uprising against Alberto Fujimori in 2000. His critics won't let him forget the past. As the Peruvian  commentator Jamie Bayly put it , in a column in Peru 21: Humala's more recent history also hits a nerve with some Peruvians, especially in the business community. He has toyed with amending the constitution, and has advocated some controversial  economic ideas , such as raising fees on gas and mining companies to pay for social spending, increasing the state's role in the economy and renegotiating Peru's free-trade agreement with the U.S. He also has ties with some notorious Latin American lefties: Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  and Bolivian President  Evo Morales . "The economic model to which Ollanta Humala is committed has brought economic destruction to Cuba,  Venezuela ,  Bolivia ,  Ecuador  and  Nicaragua . And his political model implies a systematic attack on democratic institutions,"  said Roger Noriega , a policy analyst and former U.S. assistant secretary of state, in a speech in Miami that received  significant   attention  in the Latin American press. He went on: Where Humala wins points is among the poor. Despite Peru's economic success in recent years -- it was one of the  fastest-growing economies  in  Latin America  last year -- an estimated third of Peruvians still live in poverty. As Humala said  during a debate  on May 29, "We have had growth, but it hasn't reached all." If Humala wins,  wrote Hernan Vasquez Cabrera , the director of the Peru Family Harmony Movement: Humala has  modified  his once-fiery anti-capitalist message, trading in the red shirts he wore in his 2006 presidential campaign for more traditional attire and suggesting that he now sees Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,  Brazil 's former president, as a political role model more than he does Chavez. So as the election nears, what has Vargas chosen -- cancer or AIDS? During a panel discussion in  Buenos Aires  recently,  Vargas said  he'll be pulling for Humala. "Without joy," he said, "and with a lot of fear." (Sheena Rossiter is a contributor to the World View blog. The opinions expressed are her own.)
