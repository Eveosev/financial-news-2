Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which is
part-owned by the U.K. government, will continue to cut costs in
a bid to improve profitability, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio said.  “The bank has to be leaner, more efficient and more
agile,” Horta-Osorio, who took over from  Eric Daniels  this
year, told the  Financial Times  in an interview.  Lloyds has cut about 27,500 jobs since Daniels led the 2008
acquisition of mortgage lender HBOS Plc. Lloyds, which posted a
loss in the first quarter, may not return to “sustained
profitability” for five years, the FT said.  “It will take three to five years to achieve our aims,”
Horta-Osorio said. “I can see a high performing organization in
the future but we will have to build it over time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
