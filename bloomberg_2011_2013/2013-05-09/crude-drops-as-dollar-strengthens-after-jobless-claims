West Texas Intermediate crude fell as
the dollar strengthened against the euro after the number of
Americans filing jobless claims decreased to the lowest level in
more than five years.  Prices dropped as much as 1 percent as the dollar extended
gains on Labor Department data that applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly slid. Crude stockpiles were
the most since 1931 last week, the Energy Information
Administration said yesterday. The spread between WTI and Brent
oil in  London  was below $8 a barrel for a second day.  “The dollar, more than anything, being stronger right now,
seems to be the main reason pushing down oil prices,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
 Chicago . “It’s getting stronger after the very good weekly
jobless claims number. The market is re-examining the fact that
we have plenty of supplies in this country.”  WTI for June delivery slipped 64 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$95.98 a barrel at 9:29 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The volume of all futures traded was 10 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Futures climbed to
$96.62 yesterday, the highest settlement since April 2.  Brent for June settlement decreased 64 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $103.70 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 11 percent below the 100-day
average.  WTI-Brent  The European benchmark grade traded at a $7.72 premium to
WTI, unchanged from yesterday’s settlement, which was the
narrowest level based on closing prices since Jan. 20, 2011.  The dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3106 per euro.
A stronger dollar and weaker euro reduce dollar-denominated
oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
by 4,000 to 323,000 in the week ended May 4, the least since
January 2008, the Labor Department said. Economists forecast
335,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The jobless claims number is overshadowed by the movement
in the dollar,” Flynn said.  Crude  inventories  increased 230,000 barrels to 395.5
million barrels in the seven days ended May 3, rising for a
third week, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm,
reported. Stocks of distillate fuels, including heating oil and
diesel, jumped 1.6 percent to 117.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
