The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
release of an affidavit explaining a mining deal by state-run
Gecamines may allow the International Monetary Fund to proceed
with loans for the country, an official at the lender said.  The IMF halted loans to Congo last year after the country
failed to provide full details of the deal with a company held
by Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler. Gecamines Chairman Albert Yuma and Mines Minster  Martin Kabwelulu  signed an affidavit on
May 7 detailing the 2011 transfer of 25 percent of Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp.’s Comide copper and cobalt project.  “While the publication of the affidavit allows the Fund to
move forward with a new program, there still remain weaknesses
in governance and transparency in the management of mineral
resources, some of which have been revealed by this
transaction,” Oscar Melhado, the Congo representative of the
Washington, D.C.-based IMF, said today by e-mail.  Yuma and Kabwelulu didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
and messages left on their mobile phones seeking comment.  Congo lost out on $225 million in loans after the IMF cut
its program last November. The cancellation also postponed
consideration by the African Development Bank of a possible $87
million in budget support to the central African country.  Congo, the eighth-largest copper producer in 2012, tied for
last in this year’s UN Human Development Index, measuring
indicators of poverty, health, education, and gender equality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
