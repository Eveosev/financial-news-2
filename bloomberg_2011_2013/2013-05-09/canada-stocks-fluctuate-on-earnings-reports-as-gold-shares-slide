Canadian  stocks  fell, snapping a five-day rally for the benchmark index, after financial shares
declined as investors weighed earnings reports and a Federal
Reserve official’s comments about U.S. stimulus efforts.  Sun Life Financial Inc. lost 1.2 percent after its profit
slumped. Detour Gold Corp. fell 7.4 percent after cutting its
annual output forecast from its new Detour Lake project in
Ontario.  Canadian Tire Corp. (CTC/A)  soared 11 percent on plans to
create a real estate investment trust for its properties.
 Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  advanced 5.7 percent after confirming the first
test flight for its CSeries jetliner next month.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 41.15
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,543.90 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge has added 0.9 percent this year.  Stocks fell after Fed Bank of Philadelphia President
 Charles Plosser  said he would favor reducing the U.S. central
bank’s $85 billion monthly pace of bond purchases next month.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has surged 14 percent so far
this year amid optimism central banks will continue to use
stimulus to support economic growth.  Investors also watched corporate earnings. With 161 of 237
companies in the S&P/TSX reporting so far this period, 58
percent have missed sales expectations and 54 percent have
posted declining earnings, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings Season  “In Canada it’s about earnings season,” said Michael O’Brien,  fund manager  with TD Asset Management in Toronto. He
manages about C$3 billion ($3 billion). “Results are fairly
mixed, we’ve had a fair number of high-profile Canadian
companies with weak results. We haven’t seen big beats. It’s a
reflection of the Canadian economy, it’s a bit soft and the end
results are soft.”  Financial stocks  contributed  most to losses in the S&P/TSX,
sliding 1 percent as a group as six of 10 industries retreated.
Royal Bank of  Canada  lost 0.8 percent to C$61.62 and Bank of
Montreal declined 0.9 percent to C$62.76.  Sun Life, Canada’s third-largest insurer, dropped 1.2
percent to C$29.23 after reporting a 25 percent drop in net
income to C$513 million from a year earlier.  Detour Gold slumped 7.4 percent to C$11.41. The company
said it’s taking longer than expected to increase output levels
at the Detour Lake operation, where the first gold bars were
poured in February. Detour still expects to reach commercial
production levels in the third quarter.  Jobless Claims  Goldcorp Inc. tumbled 1.2 percent to C$30.03 while Barrick
Gold Corp. erased 2.1 percent to C$21.06. Gold futures fell 0.3
percent after a report showed the number of Americans filing
claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped last week.  Canadian Tire, the nation’s largest sporting goods
retailer, jumped 11 percent to C$82.36, the highest level since
2007. The company said it will create a REIT worth C$3.5 billion
that will acquire most of its 250 retail stores and a
distribution center. Canadian Tire plans to keep 80 percent to
90 percent of the REIT. The properties represent about 18
million square feet.  Bombardier gained 5.7 percent to C$4.47. The company stuck
to its goal of first takeoff for the CSeries in June after the
delayed jetliner performed well on flight-safety tests that
included bending the wings to gauge structural integrity.  Thompson Creek Metals Co. surged 18 percent to C$3.85 for
the biggest increase in the S&P/TSX. The molybdenum producer
 broke even  in the first three months of this year, ending three
quarters of losses. BB&T  Capital Markets  boosted the stock’s
rating to buy from hold.  Bankers Petroleum Ltd. rallied 13 percent to C$2.86. The
oil and gas company said first-quarter profit doubled from a
year earlier to 6 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
