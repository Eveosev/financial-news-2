Lebanon’s Central Bank has no plans to
intervene in the nation’s currency or interest rate, Governor
Riad Salameh said, even as he forecast a difficult year for the
Levant nation.  “The monetary situation in Lebanon is stable, the pound is
stable, there is no need for intervention,” Salameh said at a
conference in  Beirut  today. “On the contrary, we have more than
$36 billion in foreign currency reserves.”  Lebanon may struggle this year because of unrest in  Syria 
and the region, as well as domestic politics, Salameh said. The
central bank has taken steps to deal with the challenges,
introducing a banking sector stimulus package and offering
lenders more than $1 billion in loans at 1 percent interest. The
bank plans to keep inflation close to 4 percent this year,
Salameh said. Inflation was about 6 percent in 2012, the
governor said in February.  The uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that
began more than two years ago has inflamed sectarian tensions in
Lebanon and sparked clashes between supporters and opponents of
the Syrian government. Lebanon suffered a 15-year civil war that
reduced parts of the capital to rubble, causing its currency to
plummet.  The  Central Bank  now imposes a currency band, allowing the
pound to fluctuate between 1,501 and 1,514 pounds per dollar,
Salameh said in May 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
