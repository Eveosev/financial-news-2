The following table is a historical
summary of the Bank of  Korea â€™s monetary policy decisions.  The Bank of Korea targets the 7-day repurchase rate.  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the Bank of Korea in
October 2005, there have been a total of 93 rate decisions by
the bank, of which 19 were unexpected, resulting in the survey 
matching the actual rate decision 78.9% of the time.  Note: Figures before March 2008 refer to call rates.  The survey result calculation does not include three rate decisions  where no survey was available since the first survey on October 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
