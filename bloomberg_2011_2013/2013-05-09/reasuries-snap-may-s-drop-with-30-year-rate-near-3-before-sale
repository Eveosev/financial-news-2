Treasury 30-year bond yields traded at
almost a one-month high before the U.S. sells $16 billion of the
debt today amid speculation yields at about 3 percent and
falling inflation expectations may attract investors.  The securities were little changed, erasing gains after a
report showed U.S.  initial claims  for  unemployment insurance 
unexpectedly fell last week. The benchmark 10-year yield jumped
on May 3 after a U.S. Labor Department report showed employers
hired more workers in April than economists predicted. Federal
 Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans  said the U.S.
job market is “doing better” with record policy stimulus.  “The interest in long-dated paper north of 3 percent may
be enough to peak people’s interest,” said Jason Rogan,
director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “If it
slides to higher yields, it will be received decently. A lot
will depend on if it’s north of 3 percent.”  The U.S. 30-year  yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.98 percent at 11:37 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
bond due in February 2043 traded gained 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount to 102 27/32. The yield fell as much as three
basis points and rose to 3.02 percent yesterday, the  highest 
since April 4.  The yield on the May 2023 securities sold yesterday dropped
one basis point to 1.80 percent.  Auction Stats  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 2.998 percent at a sale of the
securities on April 11.  “In the wake of the employment report, the market has
priced in a reasonable concession for supply,” said  Ian Lyngen ,
a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  This week’s sales will raise $12.4 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $59.6 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Today’s auction is the last of three U.S. sales of coupon-bearing debt this week. The government auctioned $24 billion of
10-year notes yesterday and $32 billion of three-year debt on
May 7.  Yesterday’s 10-year auction drew  orders to buy  worth 2.70
times the amount of securities sold, compared with an average of
2.92 for the previous 10 sales.  Bidding for the  three-year notes  amounted to 3.38 times the
amount available. The average for the prior 10 auctions was
3.57.  Yield Forecast  The yield on the 10-year note is forecast to end the year
at 2.20 percent, according to the median estimates of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey May 3 to 8. The figure is down from a
forecast of 2.25 percent in a Bloomberg News survey conducted
April 5 to April 9. Thirty-year bonds may yield 3.25 percent at
the end of the year, compared with a forecast for 3.37 percent
in the previous survey.  Treasuries slid earlier in the month after a U.S. Labor
Department report on May 3 showed the  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly fell to a four-year low of 7.5 percent.  The  U.S. economy  is gradually improving as the Fed pursues
its accommodative policies.  “The labor market has improved,” Fed Bank of Chicago’s
Evans said, speaking today in an interview with  Michael McKee  on
Bloomberg Television. “I’d like to have confidence that we can
sustain that improvement in the labor market through the
summer.”  Jobs Data  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
by 4,000 to 323,000 in the week ended May 4, the least since
January 2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists
forecast 335,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The average during the past month was the
lowest since before the last recession began.  Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said it
is “disturbing” to him that “more and more is being expected
of central banks.”  “Our fiscal authorities are not doing a very good job in
any country,” Plosser said in an interview on Bloomberg
television today.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
each month to support the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs. It purchased $1.4 billion of TIPS maturing
between April 2018 and February 2043 today, according to the Fed
Bank of New York’s  website .  Bond Returns  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, fell to as low as 2.24 percentage points today, the least
since September. The five-year average is 2.03 percentage
points.  U.S. government securities have returned 0.4 percent in
2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, even
as equities have surged, as the Fed’s debt purchases kept
borrowing costs under pressure. They declined 0.4 percent this
month, while thirty-year bonds dropped 1.7 percent.  The rate compares with the dividend  yield  of 2.04 percent
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The equities gauge rose 15
percent this year when reinvested dividends are included.  To contact the reporter on this story:
