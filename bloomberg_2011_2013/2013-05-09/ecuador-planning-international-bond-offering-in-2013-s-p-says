Ecuador , which defaulted on $3.2
billion of its foreign debt four years ago, is planning to tap
global credit markets this year as demand for higher-yielding
assets drives down borrowing costs,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The Andean country’s government first probably would try to
buy back bonds from creditors who refused to accept terms of the
country’s 2009 debt repurchase, New York-based S&P analyst
Richard Francis said today in an audio broadcast on the
company’s website. Such a move would reduce legal risks if any
new bonds are issued, he said.  Ecuador, home to South America’s third-largest crude
reserves, would join Bolivia and Paraguay in tapping
international investors amid rising demand for emerging-market
bonds. President  Rafael Correa , who needs about $6.1 billion to
finance the country’s total spending needs this year, has become
“more pragmatic” since his Feb. 17 re-election and may
implement legal reforms needed to boost private investment,
Francis said.  “One of the issues in Ecuador with coming to the market is
simply the prior default,” Francis said. “There are some
holdouts.” Francis didn’t say where his information came from
and didn’t reply today to a telephone message seeking comment.  Ecuador in 2009 bought back 94 percent of its defaulted
bonds at 35 cents on the dollar.  The country may return to international bond markets when
 interest rates  are “adequate,” former Finance Minister
 Patricio Rivera  said Feb. 20.  Current Finance Minister Fausto Herrera, who replaced
Rivera on April 30, said in March that the government may
consider buying back the rest of the defaulted bonds and that
terms would not be better than in the 2009 offer. Herrera didn’t
reply to a telephone message seeking comment on the possibility
of a bond sale.  Yields on Ecuador’s dollar bonds due in 2015, the only
global debt the nation kept servicing, have contracted by 157
basis points, or 1.57 percentage points, this year to 7.21
percent as of 1:11 p.m. in  Quito , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Similar-maturity bonds in  Peru  have fallen 18 basis points,
or 0.18 percentage point, to 0.78 percent in the same time
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Ecuador is rated B by
S&P, five levels below investment grade.  Bolivia in October sold $500 million of 10-year bonds at a
yield of 4.875 percent.  Paraguay  sold $500 million of 10-year
bonds in January at 4.625 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
