  Palm oil  traded near the highest
level in a week as optimism that stockpiles in Malaysia were set
to decline was countered by speculation that India may reduce
imports because of near record domestic cooking oil reserves.  The contract for July delivery ended the morning session at
2,290 ringgit a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives,
erasing losses of as much as 0.8 percent. Futures reached 2,294
ringgit yesterday, the highest price since April 30.  Reserves in Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer,
probably fell 5.1 percent to 2.06 million tons in April, the
least since July, a Bloomberg survey published this week showed.
Shipments fell 6.5 percent to 1.44 million tons, according to
the survey. Official data are due for release tomorrow.  “Market generally expects Malaysian inventories to
decline, but there’s a possibility that it could just be
flattish month-on-month because of weaker exports,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. “There could
be some slowdown from Indian imports of palm oil in the coming
one to two months if they are well stocked.”  India ’s palm oil  imports  may have gained 9 percent to
560,000 tons in April, according to the median of estimates from
five processors and brokers compiled by Bloomberg. Purchases of
vegetable oils, including those for industrial use, probably
fell for the first time in five months as reserves stayed near a
record and summer heat curbed consumption of fried foods, the
survey showed. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India will
release the data next week.  Soybeans for July delivery were little changed at $13.9175
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil climbed 0.2
percent to 48.90 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for September delivery dropped 0.5 percent
to 5,958  yuan  ($971) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  slid 0.4 percent to 7,378 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
