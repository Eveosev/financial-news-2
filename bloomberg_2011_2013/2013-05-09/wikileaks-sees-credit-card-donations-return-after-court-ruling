Anti-secrecy website  WikiLeaks  can
again accept credit card donations today after Valitor hf, the
Icelandic partner of  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and Visa Europe Ltd., began
processing payments after losing a court case.  Valitor was ordered by Iceland’s Supreme Court on April 24
to begin processing WikiLeaks payments within 15 days or face
daily fines amounting to 800,000 kronur ($6,800), according to
the ruling. The company was sued by WikiLeaks’s payment services
provider, Reykjavik, Iceland-based  DataCell , which has also
lodged complaints against Visa and MasterCard with the European
Commission.  Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the
European Union, and MasterCard in December 2010 blocked
WikiLeaks from using their networks to collect funds from
donors. DataCell in 2011 started using an alternative-payment
gateway to process money sent through MasterCard and Visa
 Europe . WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, publishes secret
documents, including confidential U.S. diplomatic and military
information.  “DataCell can start processing WikiLeaks payments as early
as today,” Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, a lawyer representing
DataCell and WikiLeaks, said in a telephone interview. “Visa
Europe has also confirmed to us in writing that they will make
no attempt to prevent the payments from being routed to
WikiLeaks. Today is a good day for the freedom of expression.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
