The coffee harvest in Vietnam, the
largest grower of robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in instant
drinks, will probably increase to the highest level in two years
as rain this month ended drought in the main producing region.  Production may advance 4.9 percent to 1.5 million metric
tons in the 12 months starting October from 1.43 million tons a
year earlier, according to the median of 10 trader and shipper
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the highest since
a record 1.65 million tons in 2011-2012. The harvest had been
forecast to drop as much as 30 percent to an eight-year low
because of the drought in  Dak Lak  province that represents about
30 percent of output, a survey published March 15 showed.  Prospects for a bigger crop in  Vietnam  could extend a
decline in futures from a five-month high in March by boosting
supplies from farmers who may still have about 25 percent of the
previous crop in storage. While rains in the country have
tempered concern about production losses from the drought,
global supplies of the beans will trail demand this year,
Rabobank International said in a report last month.  “There’s regular rain now,” said Mai Ky Van, deputy
director at October Coffee-Cocoa One Member Ltd. Without the
drought the crop would have been bigger, he said. Trees usually
flower from January to March, when dry conditions prevailed, and
fruits are developing now, growers say.  The Central Highlands region, which includes Dak Lak
province, may get more rainfall this month than average, the
National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said in a
May 1 statement.  Buon Ma Thuot , the capital of Dak Lak, may
receive as much as 300 millimeters (12 inches), compared with
the 30-year average of 226 millimeters, it said.  Rain Forecasts  “The drought has ended now as 90 percent of the province
has enough water for agriculture,” said Nguyen Dai Nguong, head
of the Dak Lak weather office. Drought also ended in Gia Lai,
another province in the coffee belt, according to the Central
Highlands Meteorology and Hydrology Station website.  Robusta futures on NYSE Liffe in London traded at $2,002 a
ton at 5:10 p.m. yesterday in  Singapore , down 9.7 percent from
the intraday high on March 13. Prices are still 4.1 percent
higher this year after a 6.3 percent gain in 2012.  “Prices have eased over the past month as concerns about
dry conditions recede,” Rabobank analysts led by Luke Chandler
wrote in the report e-mailed April 17. “Given our tight
fundamental outlook we continue to see price risk skewed to the
upside,” they said. Demand will outpace supply by 300,000 bags
of 60 kilograms (132 pounds) each in 2013-2014, the bank says.  Price Declines  Rabobank, which estimates that Vietnam will produce 26
million bags (1.56 million tons), forecasts prices in  London  to
average $2,125 a ton in the third quarter before falling to an
average of $2,100 in the last three months of the year. The
country’s production probably dropped 13 percent to 1.44 million
tons in 2012-2013 from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
survey published April 5.  In Dak Lak, the beans cost 41,700 dong ($1.99) a kilogram
yesterday,  data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center show.
That was down 8.4 percent from 45,500 dong on March 11, the
highest level since September 2011.  Farmers may have sold 75 percent of the current crop,
similar to the level a year earlier, according to the Bloomberg
survey of traders and shippers. Exports from October to April
are estimated at 973,000 tons, compared with 959,000 tons in the
same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculation of
preliminary data from the General Statistics Office.  Robusta’s  discount  to the more expensive arabica beans,
brewed by specialty companies including  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , was
about 52.74 cents per pound yesterday, compared with a four-year
low of 35.35 cents in March.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
