July $90 puts, which rose 19 cents to 84 cents a barrel on
volume of 11,745 contracts at 4:19 p.m. June $90 puts were the
second-most active, advancing 3 cents to 9 cents a barrel on
2,226 lots.  Puts accounted for 70 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Calls made up 57 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of 139,572
