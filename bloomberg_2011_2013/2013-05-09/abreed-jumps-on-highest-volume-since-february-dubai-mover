National Central Cooling Co. (TABREED)  advanced
on the highest volume in more than two months, extending a rally
since the supplier of air-conditioning systems reported a 30
percent increase in first-quarter profit.  About 88.6 million shares were traded, 7.3 times the
stock’s three-month daily average and the most since Feb. 20,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Abu Dhabi-based Tabreed rose
4.2 percent to 1.72 dirhams, the highest since March 2012. The
stock has gained 12 percent since the company reported profit of
47.6 million dirhams ($13 million) on April 30.  “Tabreed shares are rising on strong first-quarter
numbers,” said Marwan Shurrab, vice-president at Dubai-based
Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  Tabreed, the second most-actively traded stock in Dubai
today, is benefiting from a recovery in the United Arab Emirates
property industry that’s boosting demand for air conditioners.
The company operates 59 plants in the U.A.E. and six in other
Gulf Cooperation Council countries, according to its financial
statements.  The stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose to 69.7
today, just shy of the 70 level that signals to some investors
that the security is poised to decline. The index was at 48
before the company released earnings.  Tabreed’s shares have rallied 42 percent this year,
compared with  34 percent  for the benchmark DFM General Index,
which gained 0.7 percent to 2,177.68, the highest since November
2009, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
