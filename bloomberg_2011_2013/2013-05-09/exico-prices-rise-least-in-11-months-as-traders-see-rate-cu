(Corrects to say prices rose 0.07 percent in month in
second paragraph.)  Mexican consumer prices rose the least
in 11 months in April as Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB and UBS AG
joined other traders in forecasting the central bank will cut
the key  interest rate  again this year.  Prices climbed 0.07 percent, the national statistics agency
said today, lifting  annual inflation  to 4.65 percent from 4.25
percent in March. The median estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for prices to rise 0.09 percent. Core prices,
which exclude energy and agriculture costs, rose 0.08 percent,
compared with the 0.10 percent forecast by 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank forecasts that annual inflation will slow
back to within the 2 percent to 4 percent target range in the
second half of the year. The bank’s Governor Agustin Carstens
said yesterday lax monetary policies in developed nations and
slowing inflation will weigh on future rate decisions.  Policy makers cut the key rate for the first time in almost
four years in March, reducing it by half a point to 4 percent,
before leaving it unchanged on April 26.  Yields on six-month swaps tied to the  interbank rate  fell
0.07 percentage point to a record low 4.14 percent at 8:20 a.m.
in  Mexico  City, extending their drop since the day of the rate
cut to 0.24 percentage point. The swaps indicate that traders
are pricing in about an 80 percent chance that policy makers
will reduce rates over the next six months.  Rate Forecasts  Banorte expects Banxico to reduce the benchmark rate by
half a point to 3.5 percent in July, according to a report e-mailed today. UBS AG said on May 7 that Banxico will cut rates
50 basis points in the second half, predicting 25 basis-point
cuts at the bank’s July and September meetings.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds maturing in December 2013
fell three basis points to 1.62 percent. The peso weakened 0.1
percent to 11.9924 per  U.S. dollar  and has appreciated 7.2
percent this year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Mexico has attracted capital inflows, spurring the peso
rally, as central banks in  Australia , the euro region and  Poland 
cut their key rates to record lows in the past week.  Monetary policy  abroad “is a factor, among many, that this
board will consider,” Carstens said yesterday at a presentation
of the bank’s quarterly inflation report. “It’s a very
important phenomenon, but we can’t in any way say that it’s the
only factor that intervenes in our decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
