Wallabies back Kurtley Beale was
suspended from Super Rugby for the second time this season after
breaking the conditions of his return, jeopardizing his chances
of being selected to face the British and Irish Lions.  Beale, 24, will miss the Melbourne Rebels match against the
Blues in Auckland after breaching “behavioral guidelines” that
were set by his team, the Australian Rugby Union and players’
association, the Rebels and ARU said in a statement.  “The relevant parties will meet to discuss any future
course of action in relation to Kurtley,” the statement read.  Wallabies coach  Robbie Deans  is scheduled to announce an
initial 25-man squad for the three-Test series against the Lions,
who only tour  Australia  every 12 years, on May 19. Beale was
omitted from a 30-man planning camp last month, though Deans
said at the time that he still had time to earn selection.  Beale, who was voted as the Wallabies’ best player in 2011
by his peers, returned for the Rebels last week after being
stood down indefinitely March 28 for punching two teammates on a
team bus following a loss to the Sharks in  South Africa .  The Sydney-based ARU said after that incident that Beale
had agreed to seek counseling for “off-field issues.” The
latest discipline breach involved Beale drinking alcohol after
the Rebels loss to the Chiefs on May 3 and missing a counseling
session,  Melbourne ’s Age newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
