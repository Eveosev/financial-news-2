Ibovespa futures  fell as lower
commodities prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian exports amid
concern growth may be slowing in China, the country’s top
trading partner.  Meatpackers Minerva SA and  JBS SA (JBSS3)  may move after Banco Itau
BBA SA cut its recommendation for both stocks to the equivalent
of hold.  BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) , Brazil’s biggest owner of
shopping malls, may be active after saying it plans to buy back
as many as 22.9 million shares.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in June lost 0.2
percent to 55,630 at 9:04 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little
changed at 2.0061 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index
of 24 raw materials retreated 0.5 percent after a slump in
China’s producer prices signaled growth may be weakening.  The  producer price index  slid 2.6 percent in April from a
year earlier, figures from country’s statistics bureau showed
today. That exceeds the 2.3 percent decline predicted by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Ibovespa has lost 8.4 percent this year, the worst
performer after Colombia’s IGBC index among 19 major  emerging
markets , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 12.4 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, compared with 10.9 for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ equities,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.81 billion
reais ($3.89 billion) yesterday, compared with a daily average
