The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in top producer  Brazil  jumped 32 percent in a week
after the biggest delivery of raw sweetener on ICE Futures U.S.
since 1989, according to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Sugar coming to as much as 1.18 million metric tons was
waiting to be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio, Paranagua and
Santos, the countryâ€™s biggest port, figures e-mailed yesterday
from the Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That
compared with about 896,576 tons a week earlier.  Cargill Inc.,  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and Wilmar International Ltd. took
delivery of about 1.43 million tons of sugar in transactions
involving New York futures contracts. That was the biggest
delivery in 24 years, exchange data showed. Cargill had about
233,998 tons of sugar scheduled, Wilmar had 185,500 tons and
Bunge had 67,500 tons, Williams Brasil data showed.  Raw sugar for delivery in July fell 0.2 percent to 17.43
cents a pound by 5:18 a.m. on ICE in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
