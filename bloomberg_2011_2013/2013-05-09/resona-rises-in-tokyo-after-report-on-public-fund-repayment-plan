Resona Holdings Inc. (8308) , Japan’s fifth-largest bank by market value, headed for a 2 1/2-year high after
the Nikkei newspaper reported the lender plans to complete a
bailout repayment plan in five years.  Shares of Resona rose 1.7 percent to 556 yen as of 10:21
a.m. in Tokyo trading, on course for the highest close since
November 2010. The Topix Banks Index fell 0.3 percent.  The lender, which owes the government 872 billion yen ($8.8
billion), will repurchase as much as 400 billion yen of
preferred shares this fiscal year, the Nikkei reported, without
saying where it got the information. Resona is among lenders
rescued by taxpayers after amassing bad loans in the wake of
 Japan ’s property and stock-market bubble in the 1990s.  “Completion of the repayment is positive in terms of
profitability as it frees up Resona’s management,” said
Yoshinobu Yamada, a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.
“The bank’s shares are rising on the back of the report.”  Resona said in a statement today that nothing has been
decided on the repayment plan.  The bank will defer a deadline for converting 160 billion
yen of preferred shares into common stock, according to the
report. It plans to repurchase 262 billion yen of common stock
with a book value of 520 yen a share, the newspaper said.  Tokyo-based Resona has repaid 2.3 trillion yen of 3.1
trillion yen from the government so far, the Nikkei said. The
bank had previously  planned  to pay back 450 billion yen of
preferred shares by March 2016, using retained earnings.  The report follows  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309) ’s
buyback of 200 billion yen of shares from the government in
March to complete its bailout repayment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
