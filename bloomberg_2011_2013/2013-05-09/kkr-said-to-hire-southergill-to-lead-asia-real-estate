KKR & Co., the buyout firm preparing
to raise its first fund for real estate, hired Bryan Southergill
to oversee Asian property investments, said a person with
knowledge of the situation.  Southergill hasn’t yet started at KKR, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Southergill was a Hong Kong-based managing director and head of
Asia real estate investing for a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unit.  KKR has committed more than $650 million of equity in 10
property transactions since it started its real estate unit in
2011, with balance-sheet cash representing about half the
capital used,  Scott Nuttall , head of global capital and asset
allocation at New York-based KKR, said on an April 25 earnings
conference call. The division is led by Ralph Rosenberg, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner.  Steve Okun, a spokesman for KKR, declined to comment on
Southergill’s hiring.  PERE, a publication of London-based PEI Media that covers
the private-equity real estate business, previously reported the
hiring.  KKR, run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , plans to
create a real estate fund, Nuttall said on the April 25 call.  “But it’s very early days on that,” he said. “We’ll give
you an update in future quarters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
