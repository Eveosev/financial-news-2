European Union member nations should
oppose proposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels that
may hinder free trade and market growth, the U.K.’s  Solar Trade
Association  said.  The provisional tariffs will increase the cost of
photovoltaic panels imported from  China  and other countries and
slow growth, the lobby group said in a statement.  “These duties, if imposed, will damage the U.K. solar
market, particularly the large scale ground-mount sector,” Paul
Barwell, its chief executive officer, said yesterday. “This is
the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the U.K.’s commitment to
both free trade and the environment by urging the other member
states to vote ‘no’ to these duties.”  The European Commission plans to introduce levies of as
much as 67.9 percent by June 6 to punish Chinese manufacturers
for selling panels in the 27-nation bloc below cost, a practice
known as dumping, an official told Bloomberg May 8 on the
condition of anonymity.  “The duties will actually result in a net reduction in EU
solar jobs, restrict the growth of the solar market, and damage
 Europe ’s chances of meeting its 2020 renewable targets,”
Barwell said, urging the U.K. government to vote against them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
