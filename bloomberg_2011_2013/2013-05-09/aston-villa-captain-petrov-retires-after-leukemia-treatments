Aston Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov
retired from soccer today as he recovers from acute leukemia
diagnosed in March 2012, the English Premier League team said.  Petrov appeared in almost 200 games since joining Villa
from Celtic during the 2006-07 season. The Bulgarian was found
to have the disease after getting treated for a fever after
match last year against Arsenal, and hasn’t played since.  The 33-year-old midfielder said he is setting up a
foundation to help the 7,600 people in the U.K. who are
diagnosed each year with leukaemia, with about 2,300 people
having acute leukaemia.  “My leukemia is now in remission and I have finished my
high intensity treatment,” he said in a statement from the
club. “From now on I’ll be on the softer treatment, which is
two years on tablets. I feel lucky. Not everyone is as lucky as
I have been.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
