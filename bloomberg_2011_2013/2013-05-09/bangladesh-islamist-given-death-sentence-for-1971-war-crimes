Bangladesh ’s war crimes tribunal
sentenced a senior member of the country’s biggest Islamic party
to death, a verdict that threatens to inflame tensions in the
country after 14 people were killed in rioting this week.  A panel of judges found Jamaat-e-Islami leader Muhammad
Kamaruzzaman guilty of committing crimes against humanity during
Bangladesh’s independence struggle in 1971, Attorney General
Mahbubey Alam said speaking to reporters outside court today.  The International Crimes Tribunal’s rulings have reopened
wounds from the war more than four decades ago that led to the
founding of Bangladesh. The trial has triggered deadly clashes
between conservative Islamic groups and security forces as they
protest the verdicts, which they say are politically motivated.  Earlier this week, more than 250 people were injured as
Islamic groups rioted in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka demanding
the introduction of blasphemy laws. Those protests were backed
by the Jamaat-e-Islami.  At the end of British colonial rule in 1947, East and West
 Pakistan  were separated by 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) of
Indian territory. Pakistani troops in 1971 attempted to quell a
nationalist uprising in the east. The war ended nine months
later with the creation of Bangladesh after Indian forces helped
defeat Pakistan’s army.  Kamaruzzaman, a key organizer of the Al-Badr force that
backed the Pakistani army in 1971, is the fourth person to be
convicted by the tribunal. He was found guilty of five offences
including murder, abduction and torture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
