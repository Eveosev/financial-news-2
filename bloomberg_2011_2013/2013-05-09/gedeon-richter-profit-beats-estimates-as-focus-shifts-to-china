Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, reported a first-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates as the company shifts its focus to China and
the former  Soviet Union  while  sales  in the U.S. decline.  Net income rose 14 percent from a year earlier to 19.1
billion forint ($86 million), Richter said in a regulatory
statement today. That exceeded the 14.3 billion-forint mean
estimate for adjusted profit in a Bloomberg  survey  of four
analysts. Sales rose to 85.8 billion forint from 82 billion
forint a year earlier, with revenue from China climbing more
than six-fold to 9.6 million euros ($12.6 million).  Richter kept its forecast for a group sales increase of 3
percent in euro terms this year, Chief Executive Officer Erik
Bogsch told reporters today. The company cut its 2013 operating
margin forecast about one percentage point to 14 percent on
higher sales and marketing costs, he said.  While Richter “delivered a positive surprise” with a
“more robust rise in the bottom line,” and jump in sales in
 China , the market reaction was mitigated by “persisting
pressure” on operating margins, Vladimira Urbankova, a Vienna-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, said in a note.  Management sees as much as 35 million euros in annual sales
from China, with Ukraine and former Soviet members representing
other areas of growth, while U.S. revenue drops as much as a
quarter, Bogsch said.  The shares rose 0.4 percent to 34,295 forint at 2:01 p.m.
in Budapest, trimming this year’s drop to 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
