Patrick Murphy won his U.S. House seat
last November by fewer than 2,000 votes. As he prepares to seek
a second term, the Florida Democrat has boosted his fundraising
to try to win re-election by a wider margin.  Murphy raised $557,912 from January to March, 58 percent
more than the $352,449 he brought in during the same period two
years ago. As a member of the House Financial Services
Committee, he received donations from the  banking  industry he
now oversees; he raised $22,500 from financial political action
committees during the first three months of 2013, more than the
$21,000 he brought in for his last campaign.  Freshmen and other vulnerable lawmakers are ratcheting up
their fundraising, often from the industries they help oversee,
six months after the last election and 18 months before the next
one.  The early pace illustrates how lawmakers are adapting to
the permanent presence of independent groups that emerged in
2010 and 2012, raising and spending  unlimited sums  mostly on
attack ads. Outside groups spent $316 million during the last
off-year election of 2010, up from $69 million four years
earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. They
spent $1 billion in 2012, most of which was directed at the
presidential race.  A robust fundraising operation also can be used to
discourage competitors, both in the general election and in
primaries.  Circling Sharks  “In an era where candidates are as concerned, if not more,
with primary challenges on their right or left, early money is
critical for keeping them off the other side’s target list,”
Republican consultant Alex Vogel said. “A low campaign account
balance is like putting blood in the water with sharks around.
It’s asking for trouble.”  House Democrats, who need a net pickup of 17 seats for a
majority, took an early lead in the money chase when their
fundraising arm brought in $22.6 million from Jan. 1 to March
31. Their counterpart, the  National Republican Congressional
Committee , raised $17.5 million. The Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee entered April with $8.9 million still in the
bank, compared with $8.1 million in cash for the Republicans.  Murphy’s Race  Murphy challenged Republican Representative Allen West, a
favorite of the anti-tax Tea Party movement who had raised $19.4
million, in the most expensive House race in the nation,
according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks political giving. The Democrat prevailed
by 1,904 votes, the fifth closest race of 2012, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  A spokeswoman for Murphy, Erin Moffet, said the congressman
has co-sponsored legislation to require nonprofits spending
money on campaigns to disclose their donors, and companies to
get shareholder approval for political spending.  “It is an unfortunate reality that members of Congress are
forced to raise massive amounts of money to support their
campaigns,” Moffet said. Murphy, a former auditor, “has much
experience in the banking and financial services industries and
they have always been supportive of him and having his CPA
experience in Congress.”  Financial Sector  Among the political action committees donating to his re-election coffers are those from  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) ,
which gave $1,000, and  Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , which cut a
check for $3,000.  Republican Jackie Walorski of  Indiana  was elected by less
than 2 percentage points over Democrat Brendan Mullen in the
10th closest race. A freshman, she’s more than doubled her
fundraising during the first three months of the year. She
raised $159,054, compared with $68,440 two years ago.  A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she raised
$17,000 from defense industry PACs, more than double the $6,500
they gave to her entire first campaign. Among her backers are
the PACs from  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , which gave $5,000,  Boeing
Co. (BA) , which donated $1,000, and  Honeywell International Inc. (HON) ,
which contributed $4,000, according to Federal Election
Commission records and the Center for Responsive Politics.  “This is a well-choreographed dance,” said  Sheila Krumholz , the center’s executive director. “Members expect to
receive funds from the industries they regulate and conversely
the industries expect to support those committee members and to
be asked for their support.”  Walorski’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Guyton, didn’t respond to
several requests for comment.  Veteran Fundraising  Longer-serving House members also moved this year to fill
their campaign coffers after almost losing in 2012.  Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican re-elected by 2
percentage points last year, raised $519,034 in the first
quarter, more than three times the $166,157 taken in during the
same period in 2011.  “During the last race we built up our donor base and we
have been able to use it from the start of this campaign,” said
Kristin Strohm, a finance consultant for Coffman’s campaign.  Democrats are eying Coffman’s district, which backed
President  Barack Obama  in 2012, as one of the 17 that they need
for a 218-seat majority. Democratic officials are promoting
 Andrew Romanoff , a former state House speaker who raised
$514,477, almost as much as Coffman.  Representative John Tierney, a Massachusetts Democrat,
tripled his first-quarter fundraising to $264,135 from $88,097
two years ago after prevailing last November by 1.2 percentage
points, the seventh-closest outcome in the 2012 House elections.  Super-PAC Influence  Other lawmakers are bulking up financially in anticipation
of attack ads from super-PACs, which can raise unlimited sums,
and nonprofit organizations aligned against them.  Representative Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican, raised
$143,669 in the first quarter of 2013, compared with $30,290 in
2011. A super-PAC funded by  New York  City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent
Bloomberg LP, spent $2.4 million against him in the 2012
campaign. Webster won by 3.5 points.  “I want to be ready for that,” Webster said. “It may
happen again, maybe from some other group, who knows? So I start
early and stay on it. I think it’s important, and so we were
able to have a good quarter.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
