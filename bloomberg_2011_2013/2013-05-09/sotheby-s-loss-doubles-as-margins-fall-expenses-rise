Sotheby’s said its first-quarter loss
doubled as auction profits fell and expenses rose.  The  New York  auctioneer lost $22.3 million, or 33 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $10.7 million, or 16 cents a
share, a year ago. Revenue fell 3 percent to $101.7 million.  The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was a loss of 12 cents. The auctioneer typically posts a small
loss or profit in the first and third quarters. Its biggest
auctions are held in the second and fourth quarters.  Expenses rose 8 percent to $123 million, which the company
attributed to developing its “presence in growth markets.”  Sotheby’s said that although auction sales increased, the
improvement was in the competitive categories of Impressionist,
modern and contemporary art. The auctioneer often shares its
buyer’s commission with a consignor to win the right to sell a
valuable work.  “The first quarter showed a solid increase in auction
sales compared to the prior year, but the results illustrate how
competitive the market is for the highest-value consignments,”
said William Ruprecht, chairman and chief executive officer, in
a statement.  “That competition resulted in lower commission margins,
which is reflected on the bottom line,” he said.  Commission revenues for every $100 in auction sales
declined from $18.10 to $15,  Sotheby’s (BID)  said. It said an increase
in the buyer’s premium enacted in March would improve margins.  Ruprecht said in a conference call with analysts that
there’d be a jump in the second quarter. Margins were $15.30 for
every $100 in sales in the second quarter of 2012.  On Tuesday night, the auctioneer sold $230 million of
Impressionist and modern works in New York, its second-highest
tally since 2008. Contemporary sales are next week.  Sotheby’s shares are up about 8 percent this year but below
their closing high of $57.64, set in October 2007. Today, they
rose 6 cents to $36.31 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  In 2012, Sotheby’s said it accounted for 46 percent of the
auction sales of fine art and decorative art, jewelry and
collectibles worldwide between the two major auction houses,
down from 51 percent in 2011. Annual profit dropped 37 percent
to $108 million.  To contact the reporter of this story:
