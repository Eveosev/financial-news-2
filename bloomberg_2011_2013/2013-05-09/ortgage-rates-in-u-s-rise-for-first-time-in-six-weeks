Mortgage rates in the U.S. rose for
the first time in six weeks after borrowing costs near all-time
lows spurred demand for home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.42 percent in the week ended today from 3.35 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate increased to 2.61 percent from a record-low 2.56
percent.  Americans are taking advantage of low interest rates to buy
homes or refinance into less-expensive loans. The Mortgage
Bankers Association’s index of home-loan applications rose for a
fifth week in the period ended May 3. The  refinancing  measure
jumped 8.3 percent, the most in two months, and the  purchase 
gauge advanced 2.4 percent, the group said yesterday from
 Washington .  There’s “mounting evidence that mortgage-dependent buyers
are starting to play a fuller role in the housing market
recovery,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for Capital
Economics Ltd. in  London , wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  Buyers are bidding up prices for a tight  supply  of
available properties. U.S. home prices increased 10.5 percent in
March from a year earlier, the biggest gain in seven years,
according to CoreLogic Inc., a  Irvine , California-based data
provider.  The record rate for a 30-year mortgage is 3.31 percent,
reached in November, according to Freddie Mac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
