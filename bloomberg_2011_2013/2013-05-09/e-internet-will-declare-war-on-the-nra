The Internet is good for many things -- conspiracy theories, shopping, sharing funny pictures with friends. But it may prove to be very, very bad for the extreme gun-rights movement.  Here are a few recent stories that the Web, in its collective wisdom, has plucked from relatively obscure locales in the past week and elevated to national prominence. We have  the case  of the 2-year-old who shot himself in the head with a handgun about 50 miles from Dallas. He is dead. There is  the matter  of the 3-year-old Tampa boy who fatally shot himself this week with his uncle's gun. (Like  1 million  Floridians, the uncle has a state permit to carry a concealed weapon. The boy apparently found the weapon in the uncle's backpack.) A 13-year-old in Florida this week  shot  his 6-year-old sister, who survived. And, of course, there is the now  notorious tragedy  of the 5-year-old Kentucky boy who shot his 2-year-old sister to death with a  rifle  specially manufactured and  marketed  to small children.  In his  blog  at the Daily Beast, David Frum has been posting  stories  of hapless gun owners causing pointless tragedy. Here is Frum  responding  to a typically unnecessary death: The National Rifle Association cannot bear to admit it, but many gun owners are not paragons of probity. Some are drunks, drug addicts, wife-beaters, criminals or simply reckless, stupid, irresponsible humans with atrocious judgment. It's anybody's guess, for instance, how many of the one million concealed carry permit holders in Florida are a danger to themselves and others. (Trayvon Martin  isn't around  to make his guess.) There are roughly 30,000 deaths a year in the U.S. due to gunshots. As this week's news makes clear, incidents of children killing themselves or other children are appallingly common. They are also the types of stories -- compact, outrageous, horrifying -- that are readily transmitted through Twitter, Facebook and other forms of social media. As such stories spread, they make it increasingly obvious to increasing numbers of people that American gun laws are uniquely insane.  The NRA has been  remarkably successful  in suppressing government research on gun violence and hindering dissemination of data on guns. Legislators in Washington and state capitals have been ghoulishly accommodating. The Internet, it seems, won't be so easily bought.
