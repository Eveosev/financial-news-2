Ronde Barber, a member of the  Tampa
Bay Buccaneers ’ 2003 Super Bowl-winning team and a five-time Pro
Bowl selection, is retiring after a 16-year National Football
League career with the Bucs.  “I’ve had a better run than I ever could’ve dreamed of
having,” said Barber, 38, according to Fox Sports.com.  Defensive back Barber, a third-round pick for the
Buccaneers in the 1997  NFL draft , set club records by playing in
241 games with 232 starts and making 215 consecutive starts.  Barber tallied 1,428 tackles, 28 sacks, 47 interceptions,
eight interception returns for touchdowns, 243 passes defensed,
15 forced fumbles, 11 fumble recoveries and six additional
touchdowns on fumble returns and blocked/deflected punts.  “Ronde is synonymous with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
establishing himself as one of our franchise’s iconic players
over a 16-year Hall of Fame-worthy career,” Joel Glazer, the
Buccaneers’ co-chairman, said in a statement. “He approached
every day the same, giving everything he had to make himself and
his teammates the best they could be.”  Barber played in 10 playoff games with nine starts,
recording 50 tackles, one sack, two interceptions, one
interception return for a touchdown, 11 passes defensed and one
fumble recovery.  Barber is the twin brother of Tiki Barber, who played
