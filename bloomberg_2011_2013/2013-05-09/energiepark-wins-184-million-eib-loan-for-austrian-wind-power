Energiepark Bruck, an Austrian
renewable-energy developer, won a 140 million-euro ($184
million) loan from the  European Investment Bank  to finance wind
power in the nation.  The money will be used to build seven projects totaling 150
megawatts and requiring about 300 million euros in investment,
according to a statement on Energiepark Bruck’s website. The
first wind parks will use turbines made by German manufacturer
Enercon GmbH, according to the EIB.  The projects are in the Lower Austrian municipalities of
Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, Petronell Carnuntum, Hoflein, Rohrau,
Bruck an der Leitha, Hof and Seibersdorf. The European Union’s
lending arm signed the first 28 million-euro tranche of the loan
on May 3. Austria’s Erste Group Bank AG will act as financial
intermediary, according to the EIB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
