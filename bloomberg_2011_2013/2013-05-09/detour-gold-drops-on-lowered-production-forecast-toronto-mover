Detour Gold Corp. (DGC) , a mine developer
whose biggest shareholder is Paulson & Co., fell after cutting
its annual output forecast from its new Detour Lake project in
Ontario.  Detour dropped 7.4 percent to C$11.41 at the close in
Toronto, where the company is based, the biggest decline since
April 26.  It’s taking longer than expected to increase output levels
at the Detour Lake operation, where the first gold bars were
poured in February, the company said today in a statement.
Detour still expects to reach commercial production levels in
the third quarter.  Detour forecast 2013 gold production of 260,000 ounces to
320,000 ounces of gold, compared with a February 11 prediction
of 350,000 to 400,000 ounces. The company said April 9 that
350,000 ounces would probably be at the higher end for 2013
production.  The market is over-reacting to the news, which shouldn’t be
a surprise after the company said in April it would review its
guidance based on the rate of the ramp up, Daniel Earle, a
Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc., said in a note
today.  “We believe the ramp-up at Detour Lake is progressing very
well in comparison to the experience of other mining companies
that have attempted to ramp-up large, i.e., over 20,000 tons per
day milling projects, in the past five years,” Earle said.  Detour has adequate funds to complete the ramp up, but
management may elect to strengthen its financial position with
an increase in its credit facility or through a new offering of
convertible debentures or high-yield debt, Earle said.  Hedge fund Paulson owned 11.7 percent of Detour as of Jan.
31, 2012, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
