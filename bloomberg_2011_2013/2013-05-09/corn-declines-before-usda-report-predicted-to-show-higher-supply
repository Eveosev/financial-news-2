Corn dropped for a second day before a
U.S. Department of Agriculture report that will probably show
expanding inventories in the U.S. and around the world as
production rebounds. Wheat fell.  Corn for July delivery lost as much as 0.5 percent to
$6.2975 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and was at
$6.3075 at 10:01 a.m. in Singapore on volume that was 29 percent
below the 100-day average. Wheat for July delivery slipped 0.4
percent to $7.0325 a bushel.  U.S. corn stockpiles will surge 167 percent to 51.77
million metric tons (2.038 billion bushels) by next year’s
harvest, the biggest expansion since at least 1960, according to
a Bloomberg survey. The corn harvest in the U.S. will climb 31
percent to a record 358.7 million tons this season, as the
nation recovers from the worst drought since the 1930s, the
survey showed. The USDA outlook is due tomorrow in  Washington .
The U.S. is the biggest grower.  “Trepidation ahead of Friday’s USDA WASDE report is
affecting the trade,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , wrote in a report today,
referring to the estimates by their initials.  U.S. corn production will still be the most important
factor for wheat prices in the year ahead, he wrote. The two
grains compete in feed rations for poultry and pigs.  World corn reserves will advance to 150.9 million tons from
an estimated 125.9 million tons a year earlier, a separate
survey showed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says futures will drop
to $5.25 a bushel in six months, 17 percent less than the $6.33
closing price in Chicago yesterday.  Soybeans for July delivery was little changed at $13.9125 a
bushel in Chicago, after rallying for two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
