Terrorists kidnapped the youngest son
of former Pakistan Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  in the
central city of Multan as he campaigned ahead of a May 11
general election.  Ali Haider Gilani was taken after gunmen stormed a public
meeting he was attending and opened fire, Multan chief police
officer Mehmood Dogar said in comments run on local television.
“This is a terrorist act. We have shut the city down to track
the car the kidnappers used to take Ali Haider away.”  Ali Haider is running as a candidate in the parliamentary
elections, his brother Musa Gilani said in televised comments.
Ali Haider’s secretary was killed in the attack, state-run
Pakistan Television reported.  President Asif Ali Zardari’s Pakistan Peoples Party, of
which the Gilanis are members, had curtailed campaigning after
its leaders received threats from militant groups. The Peoples
Party had largely limited campaigning to advertisements.  Yousuf Raza Gilani was removed as prime minister in April
2012 by the Supreme Court after he failed to follow the court’s
orders to pursue Switzerland-based graft cases against Zardari.
Gilani was replaced with Raja Pervez Ashraf under whom the
civilian government became the first to serve a full five-year
term.  At least 118 people have been killed and 494 injured since
election-related violence began last month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, with members of the Peoples Party, Awami
National Party and Muttahida Qaumi Movement targeted in their
constituencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
