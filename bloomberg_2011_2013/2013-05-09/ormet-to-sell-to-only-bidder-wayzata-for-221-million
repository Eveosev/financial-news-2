Ormet Corp. (ORMTQ) , the operator of an  Ohio 
aluminum smelter, canceled a bankruptcy auction and will sell
virtually all its assets to an affiliate of lender Wayzata
Investment Partners LLC for about $221 million.  The company didn’t receive any qualified competing bids by
yesterday’s deadline to challenge Wayzata’s offer, according to
court documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington,  Delaware .  Ormet will seek court approval at a May 15 hearing of the
deal giving Wayzata the assets in exchange for forgiving about
$221 million in debt it’s owed.  The aluminum producer, based in Hannibal, Ohio, listed
assets of $407 million and debt of $416 million, according to
court documents.  Ormet has the ability to produce 270,000 tons of aluminum a
year when operating at full capacity, court papers show. Its
alumina refinery in Burnside,  Louisiana , one of only four in the
U.S., is capable of producing 540,000 tons of smelter-grade
alumina a year at full capacity.  The case is In re Ormet Corp., 13-10334, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
