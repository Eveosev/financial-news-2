The  International Monetary Fund  is
continuing discussions with  Egypt  for a loan and is awaiting
data and policy plans from Cairo, a fund spokesman said.  “The economic conditions in Egypt have been evolving,”
spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in Washington today. “We
are awaiting updated economic data and reform plans from the
authorities and we are working jointly” to enable a recovery,
he said.  Egypt’s efforts to conclude the final agreement for a $4.8
billion loan hit repeated obstacles, as the country’s post-2011
uprising transition degenerated into divisive politics and
chronic unrest that has battered the economy of the Arab world’s
most populous nation. Rice said no date for an IMF visit had
been set.  The IMF stands “ready to support a home-grown program that
addresses the economic and finance challenges that Egypt is
facing, that is socially balanced and has broad ownership,”
Rice said.  Separately, Rice said the IMF board will meet May 15 to
approve a bailout for Cyprus and May 31 to authorize a
disbursement to  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
