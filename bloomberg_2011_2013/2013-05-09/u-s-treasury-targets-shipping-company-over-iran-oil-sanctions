The U.S. Treasury Department said
today it is sanctioning Sambouk Shipping FZC for attempting to
evade international restrictions on Iranian oil.  The company is tied to Greek businessman Dimitris Cambis,
who along with a network of front companies, was previously
sanctioned in March 14, the department said.  “In an attempt to continue his scheme, Dr. Cambis is using
the recently formed Sambouk Shipping to manage eight of the
vessels that he operates on behalf of the National Iranian
Tanker Co.,” the Treasury said in an e-mailed
statement.  “These vessels have been used to execute ship-to-ship transfers of Iranian oil in the  Persian Gulf .”  “These transfers are intended to facilitate deceptive
sales of Iranian oil by obscuring the origin of that oil,”
according to the department.  David S. Cohen, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and
financial intelligence, said in a statement that “as long as
 Iran  tries to evade our sanctions, we will continue to expose
their deceptive maneuvers.”  The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions against
Iranian Venezuelan Bi-National Bank, “for engaging in financial
transactions on behalf of the previously sanctioned Export
Development Bank of Iran.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
