Gasoline futures followed crude lower
after the  Bank of England  left its stimulus program unchanged,
dimming the outlook for demand. Crack spreads widened.  Futures fell as much as 1 percent. The nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee kept the target for asset purchases at 375
billion pounds ($582 billion). While some surveys for April
suggest the recovery is building momentum, strains in the euro
area that prompted a European Central Bank interest-rate cut
last week might support the case for further stimulus.  “After we saw the ECB move to cut rates, people were
thinking that the U.K. was going to do something to give us some
kind of jump-start,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks
& Opinions LLC in Houston. “When there wasn’t anything there,
it let a little steam out of the market.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.74 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $2.8464 a gallon at 10:05 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on volume that was 37 percent below the 100-day
average.  The fuel’s  premium  over June West Texas Intermediate rose
34 cents to $23.58 a barrel. The  spread  to Brent strengthened 8
cents to $15.63.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 1 cent to
$3.549 a gallon, AAA said on its website today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery gained 0.63 cent
to $2.921 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume was 3 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate
crude strengthened 90 cents to $26.70 a barrel. The  spread 
versus Brent grew 65 cents to $18.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
