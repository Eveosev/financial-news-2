Bats Chi-X  Europe  will become a
recognized investment exchange later this month, enabling it to
compete with stock exchanges across Europe for primary listings.  The multilateral-trading facility’s new status will allow
it to host listings for the first time, Bats Chi-X Europe said
in a statement. The regulatory approval also means that
investors with charters that oblige them to trade on registered
stock exchanges can use the London-based company to carry out
their transactions.  The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority will award Bats Chi-X Europe recognized investment exchange status from May 20.
Under European Union regulations called the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive, stock markets and trading venues that
obtain regulatory approval in one country can offer their
services to investors in the other 26 member states.  “With FCA approval of our RIE application, we will be even
better positioned to support the vision of a border-less
European  capital market  and to compete in other areas, such as
primary listings,” said Mark Hemsley, chief executive officer
of Bats Chi-X Europe. “Our RIE status also enables a broader
range of retail investors and buy-side firms to connect to our
market and enjoy the benefit of competition that Mifid allowed,
including trading venue choice, lower fees and and improved
service and technology.”  Bats Chi-X Europe will become the third registered stock
exchange in the U.K. after  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and
ICAP Plc’s  Securities & Derivatives Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
