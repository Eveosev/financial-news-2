Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index halting a four-day advance, after  China ’s
inflation rose more than expected while producer prices
declined. Solar companies slid on a report of European tariffs.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) , China’s biggest maker of the
material, slid 2.1 percent after the nation’s statistics bureau
said producer prices dropped 2.6 percent in April, a sign demand
is weakening. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd., the world’s largest
producer of polysilicon, fell 2.5 percent after a report the
European Union plans to impose import duties on solar panels
from China.  Hengan International Group Co. (1044) , a maker of tissue,
sanitary napkins and diapers, jumped 5 percent after Bank of
America Merrill Lynch recommended the shares.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent to 23,211.48 at the
close. About twice as many stocks declined as gained on the 50-member gauge, with trading volume 11 percent less than the 30-day intraday average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies declined 0.2 percent to 11,266.89.  “Inflation for everyday use is happening while factory and
industrial prices are declining,” said Jackson Wong, vice
president of Hong Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities Co.
“That gives us a bad picture of the health of the Chinese
economy. At current levels, the Hong Kong market is overbought
so we are seeing some profit-taking across the board.”  The Hang Seng Index climbed 7.9 percent from this year’s
low on April 18 as data from the U.S. signaled an improving
economy. The equity measure traded at 10.6 times  estimated
earnings  yesterday compared with 14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even with
the Hang Seng rallying, the measure is still trading below its
five-year average of 12.8.  China Prices  China’s consumer inflation was subdued in April while
factory-gate price declines deepened. The consumer price index
rose 2.4 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing, compared with a median forecast of 2.3
percent inflation in a Bloomberg News survey. The producer price
index fell 2.6 percent, steepening its 1.9 percent decline in
March.  Anhui Conch dropped 2.1 percent to HK$28.50, while  China
Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the government-backed partner of
SABMiller Plc., slid 4.4 percent to HK$25.80.  Solar stocks slid. GCL-Poly Energy dropped 2.5 percent to
HK$1.57. Hanergy Solar Group Ltd., a Beijing-based renewable-energy producer, sank 1.9 percent to 52 Hong Kong cents.  Solar Tariffs  The EU plans to impose tariffs as high as 67.9 percent on
solar panels from China to counter unfair pricing, according to
a commerce official from the bloc. The European Commission
expects to introduce the levies by June 6 to punish Chinese
solar manufacturers for selling panels in the 27-nation EU below
cost, a practice known as dumping, the official said yesterday
on condition of anonymity.  Hengan International jumped 5 percent to HK$84.55, the
 biggest gain  on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , after Bank of America
Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to buy from neutral
on improving outlook for the company’s products.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 0.3 percent to
23,119. The HSI Volatility Index dropped 2.9 percent to 14.66,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.2 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
