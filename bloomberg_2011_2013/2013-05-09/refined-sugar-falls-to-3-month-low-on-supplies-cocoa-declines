White, or refined, sugar fell to the
lowest level in more than three months in  London  on speculation
of increased sales from the world’s refiners and from  Thailand ,
the second-biggest shipper, to supply Ramadan. Cocoa dropped.  Millers in Thailand have had an incentive to re-melt raw
sugar into the white variety,  Kona Haque , an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd., said at a media briefing yesterday. Sugar
production in the country is running at 4,000 to 6,000 metric
tons a day as mills re-melt raw sugar, F.O. Licht GmbH said on
May 2. Production will be 10.1 million tons this season, up from
a previous forecast of 9 million tons and near the record 10.2
million tons in 2011-12, according to Somsak Suwattiga,
secretary general of the Office of the Cane and Sugar Board.  “There are concerns that Thailand is upping their crush to
make supplies more readily available for July’s Ramadan demand
increase, and that this early production is leading to a glut on
the market over the near term,” Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August fell 0.3
percent to $485.70 a ton by 10:30 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
The price touched $484.90 a ton, the lowest since Jan. 25. Raw
sugar for delivery in July slid 0.2 percent to 17.43 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Trading volumes in New
York were 60 percent lower than the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg.  White sugar for August delivery became cheaper than the
October futures yesterday, a market structure known a contango
that may indicate ample supplies. The August contract was $1.90
a ton cheaper than the futures for October.  Ramadan Rush  A rush to supply demand for Ramadan is creating a “supply
glut near term,” Nick Penney, a senior trader at broker Sucden
Financial Ltd. in London, said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
Muslim nations usually stock up on sugar before the fasting
month of Ramadan, which begins in July. While people fast during
daylight hours, sweet treats are common at night.  The premium white sugar futures command over the raw
variety fell  14 percent  so far this month to $101.54 a ton. Thai
producers have been “blamed for knocking down the white
premium,” according to  Michael McDougall , head of the Brazil
desk at broker Newedge Group in New York.  Robusta coffee futures for July delivery slid 0.3 percent
to $2,000 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee futures for July
delivery were 0.5 percent lower at $1.435 a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.3 percent to 1,553 pounds
($2,417) a ton in London. Cocoa for July delivery slipped 0.3
percent to $2,385 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
