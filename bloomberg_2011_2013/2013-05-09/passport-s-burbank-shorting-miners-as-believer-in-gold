John Burbank , founder of San
Francisco-based hedge-fund firm Passport Capital LLC, said he’s
a believer in gold and is short on bullion miners.  “We made money this year in shorts,” Burbank said today
during a panel discussion at the SkyBridge Alternatives
Conference in Las Vegas. “Mining and steel companies are not
doing well. A lot of things tied to gold growth are not doing
well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
