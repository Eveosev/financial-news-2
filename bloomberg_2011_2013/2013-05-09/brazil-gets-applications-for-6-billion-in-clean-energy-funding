Brazil  received applications from 373
companies and organizations seeking 12.3 billion reais ($6.13
billion) in funding to research renewable power and energy
efficiency through a government program.  The state development bank said that’s about four times the
3 billion-real budget of the Inova Energia program to spur the
development of smart-grid systems, electric vehicles, renewable
power and other technologies.  The development lender Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social, state innovation agency Financiadora de
Estudos e Projetos and power regulator Agencia Nacional de
Energia Eletrica will channel 3 billion reais to the program,
according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
