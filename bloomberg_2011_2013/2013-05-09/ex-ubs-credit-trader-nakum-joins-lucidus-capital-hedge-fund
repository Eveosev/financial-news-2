Lucidus Capital Partners LLP, the
credit hedge fund, hired Anatoly Nakum last month to be a  money
manager  focused on corporate debt.  The former co-head of debt trading for North America at  UBS
AG (UBSN)  is running a long-short credit strategy with William Gaberlavage, Nakum said today in an e-mail. Nakum, who left UBS
in 2011, joins David Gallers, who departed his post as head of
credit-default swap index trading at UBS in October and now is a
money manager focused on the indexes.  Simon Meadows, head of business development at Lucidus in
London, declined to comment on the moves.  Lucidus , the corporate credit hedge fund founded as a unit
of Caxton Associates LLC byDarryl Green and Geoffrey Sherry,
has $1.5 billion in notional assets under management and employs
43 people in London and New York.  At Lucidus, Nakum is focused on high-yield and lower-rated
investment grade debt. Speculative-grade debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
 Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
