Natural rubber imports by  India , the
world’s third-biggest user, are poised to drop for the first
time in five years from a record as declining car sales crimp
demand for the commodity used in tires.  Inbound  shipments  are estimated to drop 17 percent to
180,000 metric tons in the year that started April 1 from an
all-time high of 217,364 tons a year earlier, Sheela Thomas,
chairman of the Rubber Board of India, said in an e-mailed
interview. The biggest slump in car sales since 2001 last year
boosted local rubber stockpiles 13 percent to 266,000 tons, and
will make up for a domestic shortfall in supplies, she said.  Reduced demand from India may accelerate a decline in 
futures in  Tokyo , which have lost about 9 percent this year and
entered a  bear market  in April on signs that weak demand from
China, the largest user, will expand a global glut. A drop in
prices may help lower costs for tire companies including  MRF
Ltd. (MRF) ,  Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY)  and Bridgestone Corp.  “The slowdown in auto sector would definitely adversely
affect domestic consumption of natural rubber as 65 percent of
the consumption is accounted by the sector,” Thomas said.  Car  sales  in the year ended March fell 6.7 percent to 1.89
million units, the biggest decline since 2001, as slowing
 economic growth  and high  interest rates  kept buyers away from
showrooms, according to the  Society of Indian Automobile
Manufacturers . Sales may grow 5 percent to 7 percent this year,
it said April 10. India’s auto market doubled in size from 2008
to 2011, according to  Bloomberg Industries data.  Duty-Free Imports  Rubber demand is forecast to expand 5 percent to 1.02
million tons this year, while production may climb 5.2 percent
to 960,000 tons, Thomas said. The shortfall will be met from
stockpiles and duty-free imports by some users, she said. Indian
consumers, who are allowed to import some quantity without any
import tax, bought 112,513 tons duty-free last year. The country
buys rubber mainly from  Thailand ,  Malaysia  and  Indonesia .  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world’s biggest tiremaker, may use
2.6 percent less rubber in the year though December than
projected in February as demand in the U.S. will be slower than
forecast, Hisahiro Yamaoka, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst, said
on April 11.  “The recovery in global economic growth is expected to be
slower than earlier expectations,” Thomas said. “Bearish
sentiments are reported to weigh on the natural rubber market in
the near future.”  Global Inventories  The contract for delivery in October closed at 276.8 yen a
kilogram ($2,801 a ton) yesterday on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange after slumping 17 percent in the three months through
April. The  benchmark RSS-4  rubber in India has fallen 14 percent
to 167 rupees ($3.08) a kilogram in the past year, according to
the board.  World reserves are poised to advance to the highest level
in 13 years as production exceeds demand through next year,
according to London-based industry adviser The Rubber Economist.
Reserves will total 2.17 million tons in 2014, the highest level
since 2001, Managing Director Prachaya Jumpasut said April 10.  A shortage of labor in the traditional plantation areas in
India has been a major constraint in boosting output to 1.1
million tons by 2015-2016, Thomas said. The country is the
largest consumer of natural rubber after  China  and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
