Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc. (Q) ,
the biggest provider of testing services to drugmakers, jumped
in trading after raising $947.4 million, 20 percent more than
sought, in a U.S. initial public offering.  The shares rose 9.3 percent to $43.71 at 9:49 a.m. in New
York. Quintiles and its owners sold 23.7 million shares
yesterday for $40 each, after offering 19.7 million for $36 to
$40 apiece, regulatory  filings  show. The stock sold is
equivalent to an 18 percent stake.  Quintiles and owners including TPG Capital and Bain Capital
LLC completed the sale amid a surge in demand for equities, as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted its fifth straight record
yesterday. The Durham, North Carolina-based company joins
private-equity-backed companies such as Taylor Morrison Home
Corp. and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. that have taken advantage
of the rising market to accomplish some of this year’s biggest
IPOs.  The offering price values Quintiles at $6.6 billion
including debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares
with an enterprise value of about $3.8 billion for Quintiles at
the time of its 2008 buyout, a person familiar with the terms
said in September.  The offering was enlarged to allow Quintiles’s owners to
sell more stock, while the company itself sold fewer shares than
planned, filings show. Existing owners including TPG, Bain,
London-based 3i Group Plc and Singapore state-owned asset
manager Temasek Pte sold 10.6 million of the shares in the IPO,
78 percent more than they had originally filed to sell, while
Quintiles sold 13.1 million shares, or about 5 percent less than
planned, according to filings.  Cutting Stakes  TPG and Bain, which led the 2008 purchase of Quintiles,
reduced their stakes to 19 percent each, according to  filings .
Executive Chairman Dennis B. Gillings, who founded the company
more than three decades ago, also sold stock in the IPO,
reducing his ownership to 19 percent from 24 percent.  Quintiles generated $4.87 billion of  revenue  in 2012, 12
percent more than in the previous year, and conducted business
in about 100 countries, filings show. Net income last year fell
27 percent to $176.6 million.  The stock is listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange under
the symbol Q. The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Barclays
Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
