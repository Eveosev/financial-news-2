Treasuries with a 30-year maturity
held a gain from yesterday on speculation yields close to 3
percent will attract investors to a $16 billion sale today.  A 10-year auction yesterday drew a yield of 1.810 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.794 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary dealers. The bid-to-cover  ratio , which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 2.70, compared with an
average of 2.92 for the previous 10 sales.  “A 3 percent yield is not easy to find,” said Kazuaki Oh’e, a bond salesman in  Tokyo  at CIBC World Markets Japan Inc.,
a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-largest lender. “Investors would like
to buy.”  The U.S. 30-year  yield  was little changed at 2.98 percent
as of 10:40 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
data. The price of the 3.125 percent bond due in February 2043
was 102 26/32. The rate was as high as 3.02 percent yesterday,
the most in a month.  Benchmark 10-year notes rose for the first time in four
days yesterday, with the yield falling one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.26 percentage points.  The gauge has fallen from this year’s high of 2.61
percentage set in February. The five-year average is 2.03
percentage points.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$777 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.01 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
