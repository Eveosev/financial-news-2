Natural gas futures declined in  New
York  before a report that may show a larger-than-average
stockpile gain.  Gas fell as much as 1.4 percent as supplies may have risen
86 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 3, according to the
median of 26 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain is 69 billion and last year’s addition was 30
billion, according to the Energy Information Administration,
whose report is set for release at 10:30 a.m.  “If we get a surprisingly small injection, then the bulls
will try to jack this market higher,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.  Natural gas fell 1.4 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $3.964 per
million British thermal units at 9:21 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 43 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Today’s U.S. natural gas storage report is the most
important of the year, as it may support last week’s data that
sent prices down by the most in nine months, according to Schork
Group Inc.  “This is going to be a scary day,”  Stephen Schork ,
president of Schork Group, an energy-advisory company based in
Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in an e-mailed report. “For a
second week in row, the template looks to favor another solid
injection report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
