  Spain  beat its maximum target at a
bond auction in Madrid today and its borrowing costs fell after
an interest-rate cut by the  European Central Bank  fueled a rally
in bonds from distressed euro countries.  The Spanish Treasury sold 4.57 billion euros of debt ($6
billion), compared with its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros,
the Bank of Spain said. The 3-year benchmark notes were sold to
yield 2.247 percent, compared with 2.792 percent on April 18,
and the 5-year benchmark 2.789 percent, after yielding 3.257
percent in April.  Spain is seeking to benefit from improving confidence in
the euro area’s fourth-largest economy as the European
Commission forecasts the country’s public debt load will exceed
the euro region’s average next year for the first time in the
currency’s history. In the first quarter, Spain covered a third
of its total  planned  funding for 2013, including bills.  The yield was 4.336 percent for 2026 bonds, compared with
5.555 percent the last time they were tapped on Jan. 10. Demand
for the 2016 notes was 2.34 times the amount sold, compared with
2.84 last month, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.24 for the
2018 securities, compared with 2.52 at the previous sale.  It was 1.62 for the 2026 bonds, compared with 2.85 in
January. The Treasury is due to return to the markets next week
to sell six- and 12-month bills.  Draghi’s Pledge  The yield on Spain’s  10-year bond  rose 5 basis points to
4.15 percent at 11:08 a.m. in  Madrid , leaving the spread with
similar German maturities at 2.91 percentage points. That
compares with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent in July, before
ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever is needed to
hold the single currency together.  The yield dipped below 4 percent on May 3 for the first
time since October 2010 at the end of a week when the ECB cut
its benchmark lending rate to a record low of 0.5 percent to
rekindle growth in the 17-nation region.  The European Commission last month said Spain’s request for
two more years to tackle the  largest budget deficit  in the
European Union is “reasonable.”  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said she supported Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s plan
to push back compliance with the EU’s 3 percent deficit limit to
2016, further encouraging officials in Brussels and Berlin who
are backing away from austerity-first policies. Both the
commission and the IMF forecast Spanish unemployment will peak
this year as output contracts 1.5 percent before the economy
returns to growth in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
