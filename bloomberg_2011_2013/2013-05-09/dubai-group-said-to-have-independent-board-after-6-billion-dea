Dubai Group LLC will have a board of
directors independent from its parent once the investment
company owned by the emirate’s ruler restructures $6 billion of
debt, two people familiar with the matter said.  Creditors to the company will have representation on the
board and ownership structure of the company won’t change once
the restructuring is signed, said the people, declining to be
identified because the matter is private. A spokeswoman for
Dubai Holding LLC, Dubai Group’s parent, who asked not be
identified due to company policy, declined to comment.  Dubai Group today said it agreed on final terms for the
debt with coordination committees of lenders as the emirate
recovers from the 2009 debt crisis. The company is one of
several in Dubai seeking to restructure loans.  Creditors to Dubai Group won’t own an equity stake in the
company as part of the restructuring, four people familiar with
the matter said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
