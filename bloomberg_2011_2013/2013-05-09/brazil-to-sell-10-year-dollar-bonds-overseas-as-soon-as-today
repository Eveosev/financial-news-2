(Corrects headline and second paragraph to remove timing of
sale.)  Brazil ’s government plans to sell more
of its dollar bonds due in 2023 in the Latin American country’s
first issue abroad in eight months.  The  Finance Ministry  said in a statement today that it
plans to issue the 2.625 percent securities. Barclays Plc and
Citigroup Inc. are arranging the transaction.  Brazil may sell the bonds to yield between 2.80 percent and
2.85 percent, said a person familiar with the offering who asked
not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  The yield on the notes climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.72 percent at 9:44 a.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has declined
from 3.28 percent on March 20, the highest level since they were
sold in September.  The extra yield investors demand to invest in Brazilian
dollar debt over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 163
basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
