The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index gained 1 basis point to
97 basis points as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure, which has
ranged from 96.1 basis points to 127.5 basis points this year,
is on track to rise for a second consecutive day, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 1 basis point to 99 as of 8:45
a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. The
benchmark is headed for its first rise this month after dropping
8 basis points through yesterday, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1 basis point to 77
basis points as of 9:08 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The gauge is set to climb for the first time in
a week, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
