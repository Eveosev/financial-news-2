Harbinger Capital Partners LLC lost a
U.K. appeal seeking compensation for a stake in Northern Rock
Asset Management Plc that was valued as worthless when the
British lender was nationalized in 2008.  Philip Falcone ’s hedge fund had argued its shares were
worth as much as 400 million pounds ($622 million). Judge John Mummery upheld the decision today of a lower court.  Andrew
Caldwell , an independent assessor from the accounting firm BDO
International, had determined there was no value in the shares.  “I think that the valuer got it right,” Mummery said in a
written ruling.  Northern Rock, the first British victim of the credit
crisis, was rescued by the government in February 2008 after
customers pulled 4.45 billion pounds of deposits, the first run
on a British lender in more than a century. Harbinger’s lawyer,
 Mark Phillips , said in a 2011 trial that Caldwell’s valuation at
the time was “utterly unreasonable.”  Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for New York-based Harbinger,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Other  Northern Rock  shareholders, including RAB Capital
Ltd. and SRM Global, lost a July 2009 bid for a court review of
how the equity of the bank would be valued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
