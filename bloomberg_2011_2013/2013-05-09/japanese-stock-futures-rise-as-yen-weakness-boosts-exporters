Japanese  stock futures  rose,
indicating the Topix Index will extend its weekly advance, as
the yen weakened to 100 per dollar for the first time in four
years, boosting the earnings outlook for exporters.  American Depositary Receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758)  climbed 4.4
percent from the close in Tokyo as the maker of smartphones and
televisions forecast a 16 percent increase in profit this fiscal
year. ADRs of  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets 85 percent
of sales outside Japan, advanced 5.9 percent as its earnings
forecast topped analyst estimates.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring next
month traded at 14,545 in Chicago yesterday, up from 14,230 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
14,530 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The yen traded at
100.62 to the dollar at 8:08 a.m. in  Tokyo . It last traded at
100 on April 14, 2009. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
were little changed and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.1
percent.  “If you have a supportive export environment with the U.S.
getting better, Europe has stopped getting worse, it actually
augurs well for Japan for the medium term,” Simon Flood, chief
investment officer at Lion Global Investors Ltd. in Singapore,
where he helps oversee $25.5 billion, told Bloomberg TV. “There
are a lot of great companies there, quality is high. If this
Japanese story is more substance than form, you’re going to see
a lot of international investors focusing their attention and
looking for opportunities there.”  Hong Kong  Futures on  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent and
contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies trading in Hong Kong retreated 0.5 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. dropped 0.2 percent in New York yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, increased 10 percent this year through yesterday
amid speculation the  Bank of Japan  will deploy more measures to
beat deflation as policy makers in the U.S. and Europe remain on
standby to buoy growth.  That left the gauge trading at 14.2 times average estimated
earnings yesterday compared with 14.7 for the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  and 13.2 times for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 323 companies that reported earnings since the
beginning of April and for which estimates are available, 51
percent  exceeded expectations , while 48 percent missed
forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s currency has dropped 4.2 percent since April 4 when
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda outstripped economist forecasts by
pledging to double monthly bond purchases and scoop up longer-term debt to reach a 2 percent annual inflation goal.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1
percent. The measure fell 0.4 percent yesterday, following five
consecutive days of record closes, as Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said he favors scaling
back the central bank’s pace of stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
