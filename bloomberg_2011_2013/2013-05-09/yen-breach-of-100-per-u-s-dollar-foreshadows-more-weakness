(Corrects scale of yen move in fourth paragraph)  The yen is poised to weaken even
further versus the dollar after breaking a key support level at
100 for the first time in four years, trading patterns show.  The Japanese currency will pass through support at 101.69
per dollar before completing a so-called triangle pattern in the
range from 103.32 to 104, according to Bank of America Corp. A
fall to 104 would be the yen’s lowest level since October 2008.
A triangle pattern is formed when upper and lower trend lines
intersect. Bank of America has a year-end forecast of 105.  “As we’ve broken out from the triangle, it’s a resumption
of a larger bull trend and should have enough energy that we get
a run up to the 103 or 104 area,”  MacNeil Curry , chief rates
and currencies technical strategist in New York at Bank of
America, said in a telephone interview. “You tend to see very
strong moves transpire at the end of a triangle pattern.”  The yen dropped 1.6 percent to 100.59 per dollar as of 5
p.m. in New York after falling as much as 1.7 percent, the
biggest drop since April 8. It earlier appreciated as much as
0.4 percent. Japan’s currency fell 0.8 percent to 131.21 per
euro.  The 100-per-dollar level was a key bearish point because it
represented a so-called 50 percent Fibonacci retracement between
its high of 75.35 in November 2011 and a decade-low of 124.14 in
2007.  Bond Purchases  Fibonacci retracement is named after a 12th century Italian
mathematician and based on the theory that prices rise or fall
by predictable amounts after reaching a high or low. In this and
other forms of technical analysis, investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
currency, security or index. Support refers to the lower
boundary of a trading range, where buy orders may be clustered.  Analysts drew the yen’s 50 percent Fibonacci retracement at
the 100-per-dollar level because that price represented half of
the currency’s losses against the greenback from 2007 to 2011.
The yen has weakened 14 percent this year, the most among the 10
developed-nation currencies monitored by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The  Bank of Japan  increased monthly bond purchases on April
4 to exceed 7 trillion yen ($696 billion) at BOJ Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda’s first policy meeting in charge, exceeding the
5.2 trillion yen forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. It also suspended a cap on some bond holdings and
dropped a limit on debt maturities.  Policy makers maintained the unprecedented plan at an April
26 meeting and predicted inflation will almost match their
target in two years even after a report highlighted deflation’s
grip.  Inflation Goal  Kuroda told reporters after the second April meeting that
policy adjustments would be made if necessary and the bank will
keep its stimulus until stable 2 percent gains in consumer
prices are realized.  “We’re opening up the door to look at 105 in the next few
months, and 110 by end of year seems perfectly reasonable,”
 Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy in New York at Deutsche Bank AG, the biggest currency
trader in a  Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM)  poll, said
yesterday in a telephone interview.  The yen erased an earlier advance versus the dollar
yesterday after U.S. applications for unemployment insurance
payments decreased by 4,000 to 323,000 in the week ended May 4,
the least since January 2008, Labor Department figures showed.
Economists forecast 335,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The average over the past month
was the lowest since before the last recession began.  ‘Dollar Strength’  “Across the board, we’re seeing dollar strength, not just
yen weakness, which should push dollar-yen even higher,” Curry
said yesterday.  Japan ’s currency extended gains and accelerated beyond 100
after a Treasury auction of $16 billion in 30-year bonds
produced a lower-than-forecast yield.  While Kuroda’s April 4 announcement spurred speculation
that domestic money managers would seek higher yields in the
U.S. and other markets, Japanese investors  cut holdings  of
overseas debt for a sixth-straight week in the period ended
April 19, the longest streak since January 2010, Ministry of
Finance data show. The MOF is scheduled to report the data,
covering the past two weeks, today.  The yen will be at 104 per dollar at year-end, according to
the median of 55 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Of
those polled, 41 saw the currency at 100 yen per dollar or
weaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
