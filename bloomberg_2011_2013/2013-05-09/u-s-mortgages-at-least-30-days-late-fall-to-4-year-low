The rate of U.S. mortgages that are
delinquent or in foreclosure fell to a four-year low as  job
growth  helped some borrowers catch up on payments and rising
demand for homes made it easier for others to sell.  Home loans that were at least one month late or in the
foreclosure process dropped to 10.3 percent of mortgages in the
first quarter, down from 11.25 percent in the fourth quarter and
11.33 percent a year earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association
said in a report today.  An improving job market and rebounding housing market are
spurring Americans to find alternatives to foreclosure, such as
loan modifications and so-called short-sales, in which homes are
sold for less than the amount owed on them. Foreclosures dropped
in April to the lowest level since February 2007,  Irvine ,
California-based research firm RealtyTrac said in a report
today. The U.S.  unemployment  rate fell to a four-year low of 7.5
percent in April, according to Labor Department data.  “The jobs are the key,” Jay Brinkmann, the Mortgage
Bankers Association’s chief economist said in a telephone
interview from  Washington . “People with steady paychecks are
less likely go into default.”  The share of mortgages at least 90 days late or in
foreclosure was 6.39 percent in the first quarter, the lowest
since the end of 2008, the group said. The rate was down from
6.78 percent in the fourth quarter and 7.44 percent a year
earlier.  The share of mortgages in  foreclosure  fell to 3.55 percent
from 4.39 percent from a year earlier, the biggest decline since
2008, the group said. The measure of so-called foreclosure
inventory decreased in 40 states.  The share of loans on which foreclosure actions started
during the first quarter was 0.7 percent, down from 0.96 percent
a year earlier and the lowest level since the second quarter of
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
