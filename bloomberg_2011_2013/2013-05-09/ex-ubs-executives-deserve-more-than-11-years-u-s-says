Three former  UBS AG (UBSN)  executives
convicted of bid-rigging should get prison terms ranging from
more than 11 years to almost 20, U.S. prosecutors argued.  A New York jury in August found former UBS managing
director Peter Ghavami and two co-workers, Gary Heinz and
Michael Welty, guilty of rigging auctions for contracts to
invest the proceeds of municipal bond sales. They are to be
sentenced this month.  Prosecutors from the Justice Department’s Antitrust
Division asked U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in court papers to
sentence Ghavami to at least 17 1/2 years, Heinz to at least 19
years and seven months, and Welty to at least 11 years and three
months.  “Almost from the inception of their business, defendants
embraced a culture of corruption,” prosecutors said in a
sentencing memorandum filed with the court last night. “They
willingly and systematically manipulated the market for
municipal investment agreements through a series of separate
schemes with their competitors, with a broker, and with
providers of municipal investment agreements.”  The three men were found guilty of wire fraud conspiracy
for rigging bids and arranging to pay kickbacks to the brokerage
firm CDR Financial Products Inc. in exchange for helping
manipulate the auctions.  The case is U.S. v. Ghavami, 10-cr-1217, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
