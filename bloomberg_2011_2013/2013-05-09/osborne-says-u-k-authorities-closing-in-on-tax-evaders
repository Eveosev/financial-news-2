Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said Britain’s tax authorities are closing in on more
than 100 wealthy individuals and companies using complex
structures for possible  tax evasion .  Osborne said the U.K., the U.S. and Australia are analyzing
more that 400 gigabytes of data that show the use of companies
and trusts in jurisdictions such as Singapore, the British
Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and the Cook Islands to
conceal assets. The U.K. tax agency has also identified more
than 200 accountants, lawyers and advisers from the records.  “If you evade tax, we’re coming after you,” Osborne said
in a  statement  in London today. “This data is another weapon.”  The U.K. tax agency, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, says
it take action against British residents who use offshore
structures and is asking for voluntary compliance and early
disclosure before seeking criminal prosecutions. The Treasury is
trying to raise more tax revenue as it seeks to narrow Britain’s
budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
