 Eskom SOC Holdings Ltd., the South
African power utility that’s building the world’s third- and
fourth-biggest coal-fired plants, will sell more than $1 billion
of bonds this year, Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dames  said.  “We will this year approach the markets to continue our
fund-raising,” Dames said in an interview at the World Economic
Forum for Africa in  Cape Town . “It all depends on our  capital
expenditures . We haven’t drawn as aggressively. This year we
will be going to the markets to raise some additional debt, just
over $1 billion.”  The utility is spending 500 billion rand ($55.5 billion)
through 2017 replacing old equipment and expanding capacity to
avert a repeat of rolling blackouts that halted operations of
companies including  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  for five days in January
2008. The power system is straining to meet the economy’s needs,
with capacity exceeding demand by razor-thin margins after the
company deferred upkeep on some aging stations to the colder
winter months because of higher unplanned outages in summer.  Eskom is selling 60 billion rand of debt in the five years
through 2017 to help fund the expansion.  South Africa ’s energy
regulator in February gave the utility permission to raise
prices by an average 8 percent in each of the next five years,
half the annual increase Eskom requested.  Yields on the company’s $1.75 billion of bonds due in
January 2021 declined for the first time in three days, dropping
5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.88 percent by
11.45 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
