Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which
generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
posted losses from that business on two days in the first three
months of 2013, compared with one day a year earlier.  The bank’s traders made more than $100 million on 17 days
in the quarter ended March 31, compared with 24 days in the
year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory  filing  today.  The bank generated $5.22 billion from its trading division
in the first quarter of 2013, excluding accounting charges, a 12
percent declined from the year-earlier period. About $230
million of that revenue came from a reinsurance business the
firm sold a majority stake in this month.  Clients were “more active really in the first month of the
quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March,” Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. “As issues
started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to
issues in  Europe , clients obviously pulled back toward the end
of the quarter.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  had perfect
trading records in the first quarter, making money on every day
of the period, while Morgan Stanley posted losses in eight
sessions. Citigroup Inc. doesn’t disclose money-losing days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
