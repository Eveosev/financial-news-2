Sweet and sour crudes priced in
Midland, Texas, weakened on the  spot market  after  Sunoco
Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  delayed part of a project to move West
Texas crude by pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico.  Sunoco Chief Executive Officer Mike Hennigan said a portion
of the West Texas Gulf line that would transport 40,000 barrels
of Permian Basin crude a day to Nederland, Texas, is being held
until  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  restarts its Pegasus pipeline. Sunocoâ€™s
plan includes connecting to Pegasus, he said.  Sunoco expects to start another portion of the line,
carrying 30,000 barrels a day to Longview, Texas, later this
month, Hennigan said today during an earnings call. The company
expects to start operating the Permian Express pipeline from
West Texas to the Gulf at 90,000 barrels a day in June.  West Texas Intermediate crude in Midland weakened 20 cents
to a premium of 5 cents a barrel over the same grade in Cushing,
Oklahoma, at 2:01 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Midland crude averaged a $4.08-a-barrel discount last
year as production from the Permian, the largest onshore oil
basin in the U.S., exceeded takeaway capacity. Prices have
averaged a 35-cent premium in May as pipelines from Sunoco and
 Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  have been expected to start.  West Texas Sour weakened by 25 cents to a 5-cent-a-barrel
premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
