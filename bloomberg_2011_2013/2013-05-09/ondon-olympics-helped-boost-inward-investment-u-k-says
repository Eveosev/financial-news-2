The  London  2012 Olympics helped boost
inward investment into the U.K., the government said, citing
initial figures for the year to April 2013.  Preliminary data showed the total number of projects over
the year rose 4 percent to 1,406 and involved 163,489 jobs, a
45 percent increase.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  stressed the need for
infrastructure projects to get the economy moving when he
addressed an investment conference in London today. Britain has
yet to recover the output lost during the global financial
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
