Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, cut product prices for the
first time in nine months because of domestic oversupply.  The company cut rates of hot-rolled products for June
delivery by 180 yuan ($29) a metric ton and of cold-rolled
products by 150 yuan, according to information posted on its
website  today . The last time Shanghai-based Baoshan cut prices
was on Aug. 10 for September delivery, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Baoshan is cutting prices as production increased. China’s
daily steel production climbed to a record 2.13 million metric
tons during the 10-day period to April 30 adding to inventories,
UOB Kay Hian analyst  Helen Lau  said in an e-mailed note today.  Baoshan shares traded unchanged at 4.96 yuan as of 1:54
p.m. today in  Shanghai , compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index.  Steel reinforcement-bar futures for October delivery in
Shanghai declined 1.5 percent to 3,615 yuan a ton as of 1:46
p.m. today. The contract has fallen 15 percent since Feb. 8.  Iron ore prices arriving China’s Tianjin port have dropped
18 percent to $130.2 a dry ton yesterday from a 16-month high of
$158.90 reached on Feb. 20, according to a gauge compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
