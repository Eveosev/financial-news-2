Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest automaker, plans to install the country’s biggest
rooftop solar power plant at one of its factories to expand the
use of renewable energy and help reduce global warming.  Power produced from the Seoul-based automaker’s plant in
Asan, where Hyundai makes its Sonata hybrid sedans, will be sold
to  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , which will in turn sell the
energy to areas near the plant including Asan city, according to
a statement on Hyundai’s  website  on May 8.  The installation of about 40,000 solar photovoltaic modules
with a peak capacity of 10 megawatts will be completed by the
end of the year, the company said. The panels will occupy 68
percent of the plant’s roof space.  The roof will be able to supply stable energy to 3,200
households, and will help reduce more than 5,600 tons of carbon
dioxide, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
