level since June 2008.  Snam SpA (SRG)  dropped the most in almost a year as Eni SpA sold

participants are taking a pause,” Stephane Ekolo, chief
European strategist at Market Securities in London, wrote in a
message. “Positive economic data this week and a good set of
corporate earnings in the U.S. helped push European bourses
higher. Liquidity from central banks is clearly supportive of
the stock market at the moment.”  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee left the

survey was for a 0.2 percent advance.  In the euro area, Spain beat its maximum target at a bond
