Spain ’s  Supreme Court  chided  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest bank, for abandoning an appeal
against a ruling that ordered it to return money to clients who
bought preferred shares.  The decision by Santander robs the court of an opportunity
to lay down legal criteria that would help resolve similar cases
in the future, the Madrid-based tribunal said in an e-mailed
statement today. The court also said it regretted the time lost
by its staff in preparing for the hearing.  Sales of  preferred shares  to their own customers by banks
anxious to shore up  capital ratios  became a scandal in Spain as
clients said they weren’t made aware of the risks of holding the
junior debt. Customers with preferred shares in nationalized
banks such as Bankia have been left facing losses under the
burden-sharing terms imposed by Europe as part of its bailout
for Spain’s banking system last year.  In 2011, Santander lost an appeal over a decision by a
court in Mallorca to nullify the sale of preferred shares to two
clients who had invested about 225,000 euros ($294,640) in the
securities. Santander’s decision to abandon the appeal means the
original ruling stands, the tribunal said.  A spokesman for Santander, who asked not to be identified
by name, said the bank didn’t have any immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
