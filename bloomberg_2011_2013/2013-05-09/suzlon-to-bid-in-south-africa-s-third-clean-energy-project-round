Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s largest
wind-turbine maker, said plans to build a plant in South Africa
are “advanced” as President  Jacob Zuma ’s government prepares
to accept renewable-power proposals in a third round of bidding.  “We are looking forward to submitting a new bid,” Silas Zimu, chief executive officer of Suzlon’s local unit, said today
in an interview at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town . “We
expect to go big on the third round.”  Suzlon was previously selected to install turbines in South
Africa in the first round of renewable-energy auctions in 2011.
The company said in April 2012 it planned to generate 2,000
megawatts of power in the country within five years.  South Africa, where state-owned utility Eskom Holdings SOC
Ltd. struggles to meet rising power demand with coal-fed plants,
has begun a program to boost electricity generation by awarding
contracts to build wind and solar projects. Bidders in the third
of five rounds must submit proposals by Aug. 19 as the country
seeks 3,725 megawatts of renewable capacity by the end of 2016.  Suzlon, based in the Indian city of Pune, has also been
short-listed for projects in Mozambique and  Madagascar , and has
been invited to bid for others in Zimbabwe and Nigeria, Zimu
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
