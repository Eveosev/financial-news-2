Transnet SOC Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned port and railway operator, has 15 days to respond to
an 85.5 billion rand ($9.5 billion) lawsuit brought against it
by pensioners, according to the applicant’s attorney.  “The application was served on all relevant parties by May
7,” Wynanda Coetzee, a lawyer at  Pretoria , South Africa-based
 Geyser & Coetzee Attorneys , representing the pensioners, said in
a phone interview today. The defendants have 15 days to state
whether they intend to fight the application, she said.  Two members of the Transnet Pension Fund and the Transnet
Second Defined Benefit Fund have lodged an application to the
North Gauteng High Court requesting a class action suit against
Transnet and the managers of the funds. They claim there is a
“legacy debt” owed to the funds of a combined 80 billion rand
as of the end of March while 5.5 billion rand is owed from
canceled bonds, it said.  The application has “no political motive and was not
instituted by or at the behest or on behalf of any political
party or non-governmental organization,” Coetzee said in a
statement on the firm’s website.  Mboniso Sigonyela, a spokesman for Transnet, did not
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
