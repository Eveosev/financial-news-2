Ford Motor Co. (F)  Chief Executive Officer
 Alan Mulally  reiterated the company’s plan that he continue
leading the No. 2 U.S. automaker through at least 2014.  “We’ve said at least through 2014, but I always listen to
my chairman,” Mulally, 67, said today after the company’s
annual meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. Executive Chairman Bill Ford joked with reporters: “I thought it was 2020? Or wasn’t it
2025? He’s got a long run.”  Mulally led Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford back to
profitability without the federal bailouts and bankruptcies that
befell the predecessors of  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group
LLC in 2009. Ford has earned  $35.2 billion  the past four years
after losing $30.1 billion from 2006 through 2008 as Mulally has
pushed to add more competitive cars to the company’s lineup to
complement its pickups and utility vehicles.  Ford last year promoted Mark Fields, 52, to chief operating
officer, making him the front-runner to replace Mulally.  Bill
Ford , 56, said last year he would be surprised if the next CEO
of the automaker founded by his great-grandfather came from
outside the company.  Ford fell less than 0.1 percent to $14.20 at 10:38 a.m. New
York time. The shares gained 9.7 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 14 percent increase for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
