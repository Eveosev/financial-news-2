Halogen Software Inc., a maker of
software that assesses employee performance, raised C$55 million
($54.8 million) in the first initial public offering by a
Canadian technology firm in 18 months, according to two people
familiar with the sale.  Halogen and shareholder JMI Equity Fund VI sold 4.8 million
shares for C$11.50 each, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the terms aren’t public. Ottawa-based Halogen
initially sought to raise C$50 million by selling shares for
C$10 to C$12.  This is Canada’s first technology IPO since  Avigilon Corp. (AVO) 
raised about C$25 million in November 2011. Halogen is the
largest technology IPO by a Canadian company since  Mitel
Networks Corp. (MITL)  sold $147 million in April 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Mitel is listed on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.  Halogen, which sells automated employee-evaluation software
to customers in health care, education and financial services,
plans to use some of its proceeds to expand in  North America ,
the U.K. and  Australia , the company said in an April 2
regulatory filing.  Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF)  and Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc.
led a group of banks on the sale. The banks have the option to
sell an additional 15 percent of the offering, which would raise
the total amount to about C$63.3 million.  Tim Foran, a Halogen spokesman at investor relations firm
TMX Equicom in Toronto, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
