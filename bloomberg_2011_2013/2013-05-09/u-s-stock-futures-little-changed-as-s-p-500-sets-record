U.S. stocks retreated, following five successive records for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , as the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said he favors scaling back the central bank’s pace of stimulus.  Utility and telephone shares fell the most out of 10 S&P 500 groups. AT&T Inc. sank 1.3 percent, among the biggest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST)  (MNST) dropped 5.2 percent after the chief executive officer said sales growth in April slowed.  Precision Castparts Corp. (PCP)  (PCP) jumped 7.6 percent for the biggest S&P 500 gain after posting earnings that topped projections.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  declined 0.4 percent to 1,626.67 in New York today. The Dow fell 22.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,082.62. About 6.2 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges today, in line with the three-month average.  “The market’s scared about what that would bring for equities as we are so addicted to stimulus,” Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mail on the potential for the Fed to taper stimulus soon. His firm oversees $8 billion in assets. “This is why the market is only going up, so any change will make people nervous. It will create more volatility and opportunities going forward.”  Plosser said in New York today he favors reducing the monthly $85 billion bond purchases as early as the next Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to meet June 18-19. He said unemployment will fall to 7 percent at the end of this year.  FOMC Debate  Plosser’s remarks highlight a debate within the FOMC on whether to expand or curb the pace of stimulus that has pumped up the central bank’s balance sheet to $3.32 trillion. At their April 30-May 1 meeting, policy makers said they’re prepared to increase bond buying in response to changes in the labor market or inflation.  U.S. stocks rallied yesterday for a fifth straight day of gains, as companies forecast earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The S&P 500 has  surged 14 percent  so far this year amid optimism central banks will continue to use stimulus to support economic growth. The equity benchmark has entered the fifth year of a  bull market , fueled by three rounds of bond purchases from the Fed.  In  Europe , the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee today left its bond-purchase program unchanged at 375 billion pounds ($584 billion). The bank also kept its key interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent. In Asia, the Bank of  Korea  cut its benchmark seven-day repurchase rate to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent.  Jobless Claims  Applications (INJCJC)  for unemployment insurance payments unexpectedly dropped last week, and the average over the past month fell to the lowest level since before the last recession, Labor Department figures showed today.  A separate report showed inventories at U.S. wholesalers climbed in March as sales slumped by the most in four years, indicating companies may limit orders to factories.  About 71 percent of the S&P 500  companies  that have released results since the start of the earnings season have exceeded profit projections, while 52 percent have missed sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Financial companies declined 0.8 percent as a group, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. slumped 1.5 percent $49.04 for the biggest drop in the Dow. AT&T sank 1.3 percent to $37.33.  Negative Publicity  Monster Beverage tumbled 5.2 percent to $54.01. The largest U.S. energy drink maker by sales volume has experienced a slowdown this year through April, in part due to negative publicity over the safety and caffeine content of its beverages, CEO Rodney Sacks said on a conference call yesterday.
