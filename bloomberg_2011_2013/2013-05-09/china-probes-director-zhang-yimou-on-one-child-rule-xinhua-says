Chinese movie director Zhang Yimou,
who directed the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Olympics,
is being investigated for violating the country’s one-child
policy, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Family planning authorities in the eastern city of Wuxi,
where Zhang’s wife lives, are compiling a report on their probe
that will be released soon, Xinhua reported. Movies Zhang has
directed include “To Live,” “Hero” and “Flowers of War,”
which starred actor  Christian Bale . Zhang was nominated for an
Academy Award in 1991 for the film “Ju Dou.”  A weekly entertainment magazine published by the Nanfang
Media Group reported last week that Zhang had at least four
children. In  China , violating the one-child policy can lead to
fines and has in some cases led to forced sterilizations. In
June, officials in the western Chinese city of Ankang were
suspended from their duties after they were accused of having
forced a local woman to abort her seven-month-old fetus because
she couldn’t pay a 40,000  yuan  fine ($6,524).  A woman who answered the phone at Creative Artists Agency
Inc.’s Beijing office, who declined to give her name, confirmed
that the company represents Zhang. An e-mail sent to the agency
seeking comment from Zhang wasn’t immediately responded to.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
