EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , the
country’s biggest utility, said first-quarter profit slipped 1
percent as tax payments increased.  Net income fell to 335 million euros ($439 million) from
337 million euros a year earlier, Lisbon-based EDP said today in
a regulatory filing. That compares with the 292 million-euro
mean analyst estimate in a Bloomberg  survey . Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization climbed 7 percent
to 1.07 billion euros. Taxes rose 89 percent to 149 million
euros, EDP said.  The former power monopoly is spending on new dams and wind
turbines in  Europe  and  Brazil  to rely less on oil and coal and
tap state incentives for alternative energy. EDP plans to invest
2.1 billion euros on average a year through 2015.  EDP said last year it estimates installed capacity will
increase 14 percent to 26.4 gigawatts in 2015 from 2011.
Hydropower plants and wind farms will represent 73 percent of
the utility’s capacity in 2015.  Net  debt  fell to 18.1 billion euros at the end of March
from 18.2 billion euros at the end of December, EDP said today.
In a March 6 presentation, EDP reaffirmed 2013 Ebitda will be
flat in relation to 2012.  EDP  shares  fell 0.5 percent to close at 2.61 euros in
Lisbon before the earnings announcement. The stock has climbed
14 percent this year, giving EDP a market value of 9.5 billion
euros.  The  Portuguese government  on Feb. 14 sold its remaining 4.1
percent stake in EDP to institutions at 2.35 euros a share. The
government in December 2011 agreed to sell a 21 percent stake in
EDP to China Three Gorges Corp. for 2.69 billion euros. The
Chinese company will also spend 2 billion euros to purchase
minority stakes in EDP wind farms by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
