Turning air into liquid using surplus
energy from wind and solar could be a way to store power from
intermittent sources and open up an industry worth 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) a year to the U.K., a report showed.  The technology would address the “fundamental problem” of
how to store energy from renewable sources when it’s not needed
and may create as many as 22,000 jobs by 2050, lobby group
Centre for Low Carbon Futures said today in the  report .  “We have an opportunity, and growing need, to scale up our
investment in technologies that will ensure the energy from
renewables is not wasted, and the opportunities for the U.K.
industrial sector are not lost,”  Richard Williams , pro-vice
chancellor at the University of Birmingham, who led the study,
said in a statement.  Energy converted to liquid air can be turned back into
electricity for the grid by adding heat. As it warms up, the air
expands 700 times in volume with enough force to drive a piston
engine or turbine. The process can be made more efficient using
waste heat, according to the report.  The process may help the U.K. to exploit its renewables
industry fully as it strives to get 15 percent of its energy
from clean sources by 2020, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
