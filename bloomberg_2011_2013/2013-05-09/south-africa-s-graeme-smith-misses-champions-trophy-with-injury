South Africa Test captain Graeme Smith
will miss the ICC Champions Trophy in  England  and  Wales  next
month because of an ankle injury, Cricket South Africa said.  Smith, who’s been playing for Surrey in English county
cricket, is returning to South Africa today for further
consultation after scans revealed a stress fracture.  “Graeme has been troubled by left ankle pain over the last
few months and despite extensive treatment and physiotherapy it
has recently deteriorated significantly while playing for
Surrey,” South Africa team manager Mohammed Moosajee said on
the governing body’s  website .  Smith will need surgery and has been advised to follow a
rest and rehabilitation program for the next four to six months,
Moosajee said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
