Indonesia ’s anti-terrorism squad
killed seven suspects and arrested 13 in operations that started
yesterday, after two men were held last week in connection with
an alleged plot to bomb Myanmar’s embassy in Jakarta.  The raids took place in Jakarta, Kebumen, about 440
kilometers (275 miles) southeast of the capital, Bandung,
147 kilometers east and Kendal, about 440 kilometers east,
National Police Spokesman Boy Rafli Amar told reporters during a
briefing today. Those killed “fought back” when they tried to
arrest them, Amar said without elaborating.  “These were operations to arrests terrorists,” Amar said
at the briefing. “They hadn’t committed any terrorist acts yet
but they were preparing for their actions, including robbing
banks to get money, making bombs, and owning firearms.”  Police last week arrested two men suspected of planning to
bomb the Myanmar Embassy. The following day members of the
Islamic Defenders Front gathered in front of the embassy to
protest against Myanmar’s treatment of Rohingya Muslims.
Indonesia is investigating possible links between those targeted
in the raids and the embassy plot, Amar said.  Human Rights Watch  in April accused Myanmar’s government of
ethnic cleansing in displacing more than 125,000 Rohingya
Muslims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
