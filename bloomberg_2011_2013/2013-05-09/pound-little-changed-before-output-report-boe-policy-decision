The pound strengthened the most in a
week against the euro as U.K.  industrial production  expanded in
March and the  Bank of England  refrained from adding stimulus
measures that tend to debase a currency.  Sterling gained for the first time in three days versus the
shared currency as the Bank of England maintained its asset-purchase  target , known as quantitative easing, at 375 billion
pounds ($581 billion) and kept  interest rates  at a record low.
The central bank is due to release its latest economic analysis
and inflation projections on May 15. The pound fell against the
dollar after the number of Americans filing claims for  jobless
benefits  unexpectedly dropped.  “Industrial production was better than expected and that
caused a bit of a bounce higher” in the pound, said Kathleen Brooks, research director in  London  at Forex.com, a unit of
online currency-trading company  Gain Capital Holdings Inc. (GCAP) 
“Much more important for the pound is going to be next week’s
inflation report.”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 84.49 pence per euro
at 4:44 p.m. London time after climbing as much as 0.4 percent,
the most since May 2. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5505
after rising to $1.5588. It reached $1.5606 on May 1, the
highest level since Feb. 13.  The pound faces “tough resistance” at $1.56, Forex.com’s
Brooks said. In technical analysis, resistance refers to an area
on a price graph where sell orders may be clustered.  Manufacturing Data  Industrial output increased 0.7 percent from February, when
it gained a revised 0.9 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London. The median forecast of 31 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 0.2 percent. Data
also showed that  manufacturing  rose 1.1 percent in March,
exceeding analysts’ predictions for an increase of 0.3 percent.  The U.K. economy expanded 0.8 percent in the quarter
through April, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research in London said.  The Bank of England’s decision to keep the main interest
 rate  at 0.5 percent was predicted by all 52 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Sterling remained bid after the BOE left rates and its
asset-purchases program unchanged and after the industrial
production and manufacturing data for March surprised on the
upside,”  Valentin Marinov , head of European Group of 10
currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a note
to clients. “Today’s releases add conviction to the view that
QE is unlikely to come any time soon.”  Unemployment Insurance  The pound may strengthen to 0.84 pence per euro, while
sterling may be an “interesting buy” against the yen in the
very near term, Marinov said.  Applications for  unemployment insurance  payments in the
U.S. decreased by 4,000 to 323,000 in the week ended May 4, the
least since January 2008, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists forecast 335,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. For the first time, the average
over the past month was the lowest since before the last
recession began.  The pound has strengthened 1.8 percent in the past month,
the second-best performer after the Canadian dollar among 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The so-called loonie rose 2 percent, the
dollar added 0.5 percent and the euro gained 0.6 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield was at 1.78 percent after rising to
1.81 percent on May 7, the highest since March 26. The price of
the 1.75 percent securities due in September 2022 was at 99.72.  Gilts returned 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.7 percent and Treasuries earned 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
