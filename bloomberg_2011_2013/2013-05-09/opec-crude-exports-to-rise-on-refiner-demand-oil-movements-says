The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase crude exports this month as
refiners boost processing ahead of the peak summer travel
season, tanker tracker Oil Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 23.84 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May
25, up from 23.55 million barrels in the previous period, the
researcher said in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude
Angola and Ecuador.  “Refiner demand is strong,”  Roy Mason , the company’s
founder said today by phone from Halifax,  England . “Refinery
runs are on the way up.”  Middle East shipments will gain 1.6 percent to 17.51
million barrels a day, compared with 17.24 million during the
month to April 27, according to Oil Movements. That figure
includes non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will advance 1.1 percent to 468.12
million barrels versus 463.11 million in the previous period,
data from Oil Movements show. The researcher calculates the
volumes by tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude
held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela . The group will next meet on May 31 in
Vienna to discuss output policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
