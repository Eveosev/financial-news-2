Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, will invest 100 million yuan ($16.3 million)
over three years to improve food safety in China as it works to
bolster its image after a series of food-related citations.  Some of the funds will be used to expand a mobile food-inspection lab program to cover 70 stores in  Guangdong Province ,
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said today in an e-mailed
statement. The retailer will also increase supplier training,
improve store standards, recruit more food-safety experts and
expand its fresh-food distribution.  Wal-Mart last year was cited by the Beijing Food Safety
Administration for selling sesame oil and squid with hazardous
levels of chemicals. In October 2011, police arrested Wal-Mart
workers in Chongqing amid a probe of allegations the retailer
mislabeled ordinary pork as organic. They were later released.  Wal-Mart fell 0.7 percent to $78.25 yesterday in  New York .
The  shares  gained 15 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 14 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
