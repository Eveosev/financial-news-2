Silver Ridge Power Inc. cut the size
of its planned initial public offering by 14 percent to C$150
million ($150 million), the second energy IPO in  Canada  in the
past week to scale back its sale.  Silver Ridge, a solar-power plant company formed by  AES
Corp. (AES)  and private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC, seeks to
sell 11.5 million to 12.5 million shares for C$12 to C$13 each,
according to a revised sales document dated today. Silver Ridge
initially sought to sell 11.3 million to 13 million shares for
C$13.50 to C$15.50 to raise about C$175 million, according to an
April document.  Oryx Petroleum Corp. cut the size of its IPO last week by
29 percent amid weak demand. Oryx sold C$250.5 million in new
shares, the Calgary-based firm said yesterday in a statement,
after initially seeking C$350 million. Oryx fell 2.1 percent
from its C$15 initial sale price to C$14.69 at 12:56 p.m. in
preliminary  trading  in Toronto.  Silver Ridge will acquire solar plants and projects owned
by AES  Solar Energy Ltd. (SLRE) , a March 2008 joint venture of
Arlington, Virginia-based AES and New York-based Riverstone,
according to filings this month with Canadian regulators.  The plants, located in the U.S.,  Europe  and  India , will
have a total generating capacity of 522 megawatts when the Mount
Signal project in  California  is fully operational by next year,
according to regulatory documents.  Silver Ridge Chief Financial Officer Becky Cranna didnâ€™t
immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.  Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. are leading the sale, which is expected to be
completed the week of May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
