LivePerson Inc. (LPSN) , a maker of software
that allows businesses to track customers on their websites,
tumbled the most in almost 12 years in New York after cutting
its forecast for 2013 sales.  Shares of LivePerson plunged 33 percent to an 2 1/2-year
low of $8.48 by 12:14 p.m., set for the biggest one-day slump
since July 2001. Trading volumes were more than 17 times the
daily average over the past three months. LivePerson sank 23
percent in Tel Aviv to a record-low 35.07 shekels, or $9.89.  The loss of a major client lifted LivePerson’s customer
attrition rate to 2.9 percent in the first quarter, from 0.9
percent in the last three months of 2012 and this will impact
sales for the rest of the year, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Murphy said on a conference call yesterday. The company, which
is based in New York and has operations in  Tel Aviv , lowered its
full-year revenue forecast to as much as $179 million from an
earlier projection of up to $186 million, after reporting a
first-quarter loss yesterday.  “They lost that major revenue stream, which is worth
approximately $5 million,” Mark Schappel, a analyst at
Benchmark Co. in New York who rates LivePerson hold, said by
phone. “They lowered the guidance, and I’d expect the stock to
be down.”  Shappel reduced his price target for LivePerson by 7.7
percent to $12 today.  At least four analysts have downgraded their
recommendations on LivePerson since it reported first-quarter
results, including Credit Suisse Group AG and Oppenheimer & Co.
Of the 15 analysts covering the  New York  stock, 47 percent rate
it hold, 40 percent buy and 13 percent sell, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the largest Israeli
companies traded in New York added 0.6 percent to 91.88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
