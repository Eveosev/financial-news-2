Gold traders are divided on whether
surging demand for jewelry and bullion coins will sustain the
rally in prices as a slump in holdings through exchange-traded
products extended to the longest in more than eight years.  Twelve analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to rise
next week, with 10 bearish and five neutral. While rising coin
sales and demand for physical gold in Asia drove prices up 8.2
percent since reaching a two-year low April 16, ETP investors
sold about $9.7 billion of their metal in the 27 days through
May 8, the longest retreat since September 2004.  Gold slid into a bear market in April even as central banks
printed money on an unprecedented scale, Europe’s debt crisis
spread and the  International Monetary Fund  cut to its 2013
economic growth forecast. A majority of the 38 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg last month predicted the 12-year bull run is over
and billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  said last week that gold
has no appeal even after the rout.  “There’s been a lot of physical buying out of  China  and
India and lots of selling still from institutional investors and
that’s where your tug of war is,” said  David Wilson , a metals
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. “Retail buying is not
surprising, it’s in reaction to lower prices. We’re seeing a lot
of investors betting on a continued recovery in the U.S. A lot
of liquidation of gold positions we’ve been seeing from the
institutional side has been flowing into equity markets.”  Gold Prices  The metal fell 15 percent to $1,429.99 an ounce in London
this year. Prices reached $1,321.95 on April 16, two sessions
after sliding into a  bear market , and are 26 percent below the
September 2011 record. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities dropped 3.7 percent this year and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 9.8 percent. Treasuries
returned 0.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Faith in the metal as a store of value has waned as
inflation fails to accelerate and confidence mounts that the
 U.S. economy  is improving. The S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks set
a record and Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose to
its highest level since June 2008 this week.  Gold will close the year at $1,550, 7.5 percent less than
at the end of 2012 and the biggest drop since 1997, the median
of 38 estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said April 23 bullion may slide to $1,390 in 12 months, and
Deutsche Bank AG predicts a drop to as low as $1,050. Societe
Generale SA, Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan
Stanley are also among those forecasting lower prices.  Billionaires Index  “It just sits there, and you hope somebody pays you more
for it,” Buffett, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told reporters in Omaha,  Nebraska , on
May 2. The investor ranks as the world’s third-richest person in
the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  While  hedge funds  and other  speculators  increased their
wagers on price gains by 19 percent in the week to April 30, the
54,762 futures and options held is down 72 percent since
October, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading data show. Investors
sold 390.8 metric tons from gold-backed ETPs since holdings
reached a record 2,632.5 on Dec. 20,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Holdings rose yesterday for the first time since April 1.
Mine output was 2,641 tons in 2012, according to Barclays.  Paulson & Co., the hedge fund company founded by  John
Paulson , lost 27 percent in its Gold Fund last month after the
metal and related securities plunged, according to two people
familiar with the matter. Paulson is the biggest investor in the
 SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) , the largest gold ETP.  Central Banks  Continued central-bank stimulus from the U.S. to Japan to
Europe will support gold, with prices rebounding to $1,700 by
the end of this year, JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Allan Cooke said
in a May 8 report. Prices as much as doubled since the  Federal
Reserve  cut  interest rates  to a record low in December 2008. The
 European Central Bank  cut borrowing costs to a record low May 2.  “Long-term fundamentals still favor gold,” said Adrian Day, who manages about $141 million of assets as the president
of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland . “We
would stand aside for now, but be ready to buy when the selling
seems exhausted.”  There are already signs of stronger demand from some
investors, with the  U.S. Mint  saying April 23 it had run out of
its smallest gold coins. Sales of American Eagle coins in April
rose to the highest since December 2009 and Australia’s Perth
Mint said its volumes jumped to a five-year high.  Indian Imports  The price slump boosted Indian imports to more than 100
tons in April, and shipments probably will top 100 tons again
this month, said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of refiner
MMTC-PAMP India Pvt. The country’s gold imports were 860 tons
last year, the London-based World Gold Council estimates.  Consumption in China, the second-biggest buyer, jumped 26
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the China Gold
Association said May 7. Imports by China from  Hong Kong  more
than doubled to an all-time high in March.  Central banks including those of Russia and Kazakhstan are
among those still adding to gold reserves. Nations bought 534.6
tons last year, the most since 1964, and are on pace to exceed
that this year, according to the World Gold Council.  In other commodities, 12 of 13 people surveyed expect raw
sugar to drop next week and one predicted a gain. The commodity
slid 11 percent to 17.43 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York  this year.  Fifteen of 24 surveyed anticipate lower corn prices next
week and seven said the grain will rise, while 12 said soybeans
will fall and seven expect higher prices. Twelve traders
predicted lower wheat and seven were bullish. Corn slid 9.7
percent to $6.3075 a bushel this year in  Chicago  as soybeans
slipped 0.7 percent to $13.99 a bushel. Wheat is down 9.5
percent at $7.0375 a bushel.  Copper Survey  Seven traders and analysts surveyed expect copper to rise
next week, four were bearish and eight were neutral. The metal
for delivery in three months, the  London  Metal Exchange’s
benchmark contract, slipped 6.8 percent to $7,392 a ton since
the start of January.  Net-bullish wagers across 18 U.S.-traded raw materials
jumped 28 percent to 550,182 contracts in the week to April 30,
the biggest increase in seven weeks, CFTC data show. The S&P
GSCI gauge of commodities climbed 4.6 percent since reaching a
nine-month low April 18.  “The recent improvement in price isn’t really a great
surprise given the scale of declines that preceded it,” said
Ross Strachan, a commodities economist at Capital Economics Ltd.
in London. “Looking at taking yet further stimulus measures
shows how bleak it is. The big picture view is very much that
commodities still have substantial room to fall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
