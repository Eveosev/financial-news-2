Roberto Castro holds a one-shot lead
during today’s second round at golf’s Players championship,
where  Tiger Woods  is two shots back.  Castro, who tied the course record with a 9-under-par 63
yesterday in his debut at the  U.S. PGA Tour ’s marquee event,
begins his second round this afternoon.  He’s one shot in front of Kevin Chappell and Ryan Palmer of
the U.S. and England’s  Lee Westwood , who are currently in the
midst of play at the TPC Sawgrass course in Ponte Vedra Beach,
Florida.  Woods is 2 under today with three birdies and a bogey
through his first nine holes after an opening-round 67
yesterday, marking his best first-round Players championship
score and his lowest round at the event since 2007.  Castro, who began on the 10th hole yesterday, finished with
seven birdies and an eagle. He missed a 13-foot birdie putt on
his final hole, preventing him from breaking the course record
he now shares with  Greg Norman  and  Fred Couples . Castro said he
wasn’t aware of the record at the time.  The Players is golf’s richest tournament with a $9.5
million purse. The winner will receive $1.71 million.  Woods yesterday was on course for his first bogey-free
round at the tournament before a fluffed chip at the last hole
led to a bogey 5.  Vijay Singh  of Fiji is 4 over for the tournament as he
plays his second round and will probably fail to qualify for
weekend play. Singh, 50, on May 8 sued the PGA Tour claiming he
was publicly humiliated by a suspension for using deer-antler
spray before he was cleared of wrongdoing two months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
