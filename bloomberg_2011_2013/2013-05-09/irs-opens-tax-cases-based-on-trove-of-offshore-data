The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service  has
opened cases and begun investigations based on what it calls a
“substantial amount” of information it has received on
offshore companies and trusts.  The U.S., the U.K. and  Australia  are working together to
analyze the data for potential tax-law violations. The countries
disclosed their work today and said the data show how residents
of countries around the world use offshore accounts in
 Singapore , the British Virgin Islands, the  Cook Islands  and the
 Cayman Islands .  “It’s enough for us to move on in several cases at
least,” Michael Danilack, an IRS deputy commissioner for
international issues, said in a telephone interview today.
“When we see information like that, we usually will pursue what
we can on both the owner as well as any advisers that may be
involved.”  The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
released a report on similar -- if not identical -- data April
3. Danilack declined to comment when asked whether it was the
same data. He also wouldn’t discuss how long the IRS has had the
information or how it was obtained.  Danilack described the three-country coordination as an
announcement to tax agencies around the world that they have
information. He said the Canadian government has already
requested information.  “The unique aspect of this is the multilateral effort that
the three of us are essentially kick-starting,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
