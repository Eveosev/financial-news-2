Sharp Corp. (6753) , the unprofitable maker of
Aquos televisions, rose the most in more than four months in
Tokyo trading after the Yomiuri newspaper reported the company
may seek additional investment from Samsung Electronics Co.  Sharp surged 15 percent, the stock’s biggest gain since
Dec. 26, to close at 423 yen. The shares have advanced for four
straight days and climbed 40 percent this year.  Samsung, Asia’s biggest electronics maker, may make an
additional investment of “several tens of billions of yen,”
making it Sharp’s  biggest shareholder , the Yomiuri reported,
without saying where it got the information. Sharp, which last
year mortgaged properties including its Osaka headquarters to
refinance debt following a record loss, sold 10.4 billion yen
($105 million) of shares to Samsung in March.  Sharp wasn’t the source of the Yomiuri report, the company
said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  “We are reviewing ways to cooperate in various areas, but
nothing has been decided,” Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung
said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
