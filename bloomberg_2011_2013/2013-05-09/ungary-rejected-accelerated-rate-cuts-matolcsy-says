Gyorgy Matolcsy considered accelerated
interest-rate cuts as he took over  Hungary ’s central bank in
March before deciding to continue with quarter-point reductions,
Heti Valasz reported, citing an interview with the Magyar
Nemzeti Bank president.  “Gradually” reducing the two-week deposit rate while
creating a targeted-lending plan with rates below the benchmark
was backed by “leading bankers and strategic advisers and was
also closest to the conservative and responsible monetary policy
that I represent,” Matolcsy said, according to a transcript of
the interview with the weekly newspaper received by e-mail.  The other option would have been to “give up on an
interest-rate reduction policy based on small steps and cut the
benchmark to the consensus level in two or three steps,”
Matolcsy was cited as saying. This would have been “less
predictable and more risky.”  The MNB cut the two-week deposit rate by a quarter-point to
4.75 percent on April 23, easing borrowing costs for a ninth
month as policy makers seek to help the government end the
second recession in four years. The bank is also offering 250
billion forint ($1.1 billion) of zero-interest funds to
commercial banks to boost lending to small companies and the
same amount to refinance corporate foreign-currency loans with
preferential forint credits.  While the central bank may boost its Funding for Growth
plan, Matolcsy told Heti Valasz that he didn’t want to
“preempt” the Monetary Council, which makes the decision.  There are “ample conventional and non-conventional tools”
available to the MNB that have been used by other central banks,
meaning there’s no need to resort to non-tested methods,
according to Matolcsy.  Integrating the financial regulator into the central bank
would be a “good tool” to prevent crises, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
