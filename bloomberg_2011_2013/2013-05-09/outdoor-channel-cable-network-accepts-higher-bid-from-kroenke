Outdoor Channel Holdings Inc. (OUTD) , the
owner of a cable channel with hunting and fishing programs, said
its board has accepted an increased buyout offer from
billionaire  Stan Kroenke ’s Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC.  Kroenke, the owner of the  St. Louis Rams , agreed to pay
$10.25 a share for Outdoor Channel, or about $268 million,
beating a previous offer of $9.75 a share from New York-based
InterMedia Partners, according to a statement yesterday.  Outdoor Channel, based in Temecula, California, plans a
special shareholder meeting to consider the proposal next week.
The new agreement calls for Kroenke to receive a $7.5 million
termination fee if the deal doesn’t go through.  The channel, with 39.8 million subscribers on cable,
satellite and telecom systems, has been the subject of a months-long bidding war between Kroenke, 65, and InterMedia, the
investment firm founded by  Leo Hindery , the former Tele-Communications Inc. executive.  Outdoor Channel had agreed to an earlier $9.35-a-share from
Kroenke, according to the statement. Hindery’s InterMedia made a
May 3 proposal for $9.75 a share. Outdoor Channel in November
had agreed to a buyout from InterMedia for $8 a share.  Outdoor Channel rose 1.3 percent to $10.27 at the close in
New York, giving the company a market value of $265.5 million
and suggesting some investors still anticipate a higher offer.
The shares have  advanced  35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
