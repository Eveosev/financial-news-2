Bank Handlowy SA, the Polish unit of
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , said first-quarter net income jumped 46 percent
from a year earlier after gains on bond investments.  Profit rose to 355.4 million zloty ($113 million) from
243.6 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
in a regulatory statement today. That beat the 208.7 million-zloty mean  estimate  of six  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Handlowy posted a 172 million-zloty gain on its bond
holdings in the first quarter, compared with 72.9 million zloty
a year earlier. Polish  government bonds  rallied over the past
year as monetary easing across the world triggered capital flows
into  emerging markets . The yield on  Poland ’s 10-year bonds has
slumped 72 basis points to a record 3.02 percent this year,
extending a 215 basis-point decline in 2012.  Handlowy shares rose as much as 2 percent to a two-year
high of 102.45 zloty and traded up 1.6 percent at 10:37 a.m. in
Warsaw, valuing the bank at 13.3 billion zloty.  The lender’s net interest income fell 18 percent to 327.1
million zloty in the first quarter, while costs declined 17
percent to 331.3 million zloty, Handlowy said. Provisions for
bad loans dropped to 10.5 million zloty from 14.8 million zloty
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
