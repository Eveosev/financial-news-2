Constantly dumped by women, young
Thomas Day decided to create the perfect wife. He adopted two
pre-teen girls from the Foundling Hospital and proceeded to
raise them to his liking.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Day was sure that women were being ruined by their
frivolous 18th-century upbringing, so he used Rousseau’s
“Emile” as a model to teach the girls science, philosophy and
history.  Deeming one “invincibly stupid” after six months, he
focused his attention on the auburn-haired beauty he’d renamed
Sabrina. She was to be clever yet totally subservient to him.  To make her tough, Day stuck her with pins and dripped hot
sealing wax on her bare skin, instructing her not to move or cry
out. He also dumped Sabrina in a cold river when she could not
swim and fired pistols at her petticoats.  It never occurred to the upper-class, rich Day that even an
orphan might rebel at this treatment. The two never married.  I spoke with Wendy Moore, author of “How to Create the
Perfect Wife: Britain’s Most Ineligible Bachelor and his
Enlightened Quest to Train the Ideal Mate,” on the following
topics:  1. Parade of Little Girls  2. Under His Thumb  3. Progressive Education  4. Sadistic Trials  5. Pygmalion  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
