The cost of credit-default swaps
insuring debt of Xstrata Plc is slumping amid speculation the
contracts won’t cover new debt now the mining company has
completed its merger with  Glencore International Plc. (GLEN)   Swaps on Xstrata dropped for 13 of the past 14 trading
days, falling 16 basis points today to a more than three-year
low of 107 basis points. Contracts on Glencore rose 12 basis
point to 172, driving the gap between them to the widest since
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Glencore Xstrata Plc, which after the $29 billion merger is
the world’s fourth-biggest mining company, is raising new
revolving credit facilities to replace existing credit lines.
The Baar, Switzerland-based company has $51 billion of debt
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The reasons behind the move in Xstrata swaps “include the
unwinding of loan hedging as Xstrata loans get refinanced and
future bond issuance gets done out of a Glencore entity, which
will combine to leave Xstrata CDS less liquid,” said  Suki Mann ,
a strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London . “We do not
expect Xstrata CDS to be orphaned given that deliverable
obligations will remain in place post merger.”  Orphaned credit-default swaps are contracts without
underlying securities. A basis point on a credit-default swap
protecting 10 million euros ($13 million) of debt from default
for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay
the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities
or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its
debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
