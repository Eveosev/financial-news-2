Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
second-biggest exporter of the beans, rose year-on-year in April
after a post-election dispute was resolved in neighboring Kenya,
its gateway to the sea.  Shipments last month rose 76 percent to 248,749 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags, from 141,220 bags a year earlier, the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority, the regulator, said late yesterday
by e-mail from Kampala, the capital. The beans were worth $30.4
million, it said.  Exports from the East African nation, which ships its beans
mainly to the European Union, U.S.,  Sudan ,  Switzerland , India,
Singapore and Japan, were less than an earlier forecast by the
authority of 270,000 bags on a delayed harvest. Last month’s
shipments compared with 311,290 bags in March.  Kenya’s  Supreme Court  on March 30 upheld Uhuru Kenyatta’s
presidential election victory earlier in the month, dismissing a
challenge from defeated challenger  Raila Odinga , who called on
his supporters to respect the verdict. In the 2007 election,
ethnic clashes led to 1,100 deaths and 350,000 people being
displaced from their homes in more than two months of fighting.  Exports in the 12 months from Oct. 1 through September may
rise to 3.2 million bags from 2.73 million bags last season on a
bigger crop after favorable weather, Francis Chesang, the
authority’s manager for production, said on Sept. 20. The nation
produces 3.4 million to 3.5 million bags annually, according to
the authority.  The nation’s coffee exports in the first seven months of
the 2012-13 season climbed 27 percent to 1.9 million bags from
1.5 million bags a year earlier, according to a tally of the
authority figures by Bloomberg. The value of exports in the
period rose to $235.9 million from $224.2 million a year
earlier.  The country consumes about 3 percent of its annual crop,
the African Fine Coffees Association says. Robusta beans, used
in espressos and instant drinks, accounted for 70 percent of
Ugandan exports last season, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
