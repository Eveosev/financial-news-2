Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on concern that tight corn supplies before this year’s
harvest will curtail production of the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, shrank by 2.89 cents to
24.19 cents a gallon at 11:55 a.m.  New York  time a day after the
Energy Information Administration said ethanol  output  last week
fell 1.6 percent to 843,000 barrels a day. That was the lowest
level since April 12 and the smallest for the time of year in
records dating to June 2010, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Renewable Identification Numbers slipped.  “There seems to be quite a bit of discipline in this
market right now,” said Julie Ward, an assistant vice president
at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“The plants that are running, most of them, have pulled back.
Some of it is fear of the corn market.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.613 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 21 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery gained 0.11 cent to $2.8549 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel yielding at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.
Returns to make the additive were cut last summer after drought
in the Midwest destroyed crops.  Prices have eased on government forecasts that farmers plan
to sow the most acres since 1936.  Corn Futures  Corn for July delivery gained 8.75 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $6.4175 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for July was 16 cents a gallon,
compared with 17 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.
The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Lower production rates have helped to drain inventories of
the biofuel. Stockpiles last week dropped 1.1 percent to 16.8
million barrels, the lowest since Nov. 4, 2011, and 21 percent
below a year earlier.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 97 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 967 percent the previous week,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm said.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  were unchanged at 79 cents as of
11:58 a.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol decreased 2.3 percent to 86 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
