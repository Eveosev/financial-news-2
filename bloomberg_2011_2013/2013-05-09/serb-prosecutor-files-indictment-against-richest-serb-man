Serbia’s special prosecutor for
organized crime filed an indictment against the nation’s richest
man, Miroslav Miskovic, on abuse of office and tax evasion
charges.  Miskovic, his son Marko and 10 other associates are accused
of causing financial damage totaling 16.95 billion dinars ($200
million) to six road companies and depriving the state budget of
472 million dinars in unpaid taxes, special prosecutor Miljko
Radisavljevic said in an e-mail today. Lawyers at Jankovic,
Popovic & Mitic, the  law firm  representing Miskovic, weren’t
immediately available for comment. Each charge against Miskovic
carries a jail term of 10 years.  Serbia has stepped up its fight against corruption and
organized crime as part of its effort to convince the European
Union that it’s fit to begin membership talks. The government is
reviewing the sale of 24 companies after criticism from the
European Parliament and is waiting on a date to begin
negotiations.  Miskovic has been kept in detention since his Dec. 12
arrest and Radisavljevic has asked judges to keep them detained.
He entered the Forbes list of billionaires in 2007 and has been
ranked among the wealthiest people in eastern  Europe . His
fortune was estimated at $2.8 billion in 2010 by Forbes and
Polish magazine Wprost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
