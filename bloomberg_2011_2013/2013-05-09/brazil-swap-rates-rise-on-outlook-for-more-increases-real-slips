Brazil ’s swap rates climbed amid
speculation the central bank will step up increases in borrowing
costs to contain inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.22 percent at 10:21
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The currency depreciated less than 0.1
percent to 2.0056 per  U.S. dollar .  Claudia Safatle, a former press official at the monetary
authority, cited in her Valor Economico column a comment from
central bank board member Carlos Hamilton last month that policy
makers may have to increase the target lending rate at a faster
pace to contain inflation. “It is not possible to say whether
that means a tightening cycle of 100 points or more,” she said.
The central bank didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment from  Bloomberg News .  “She talks about hikes of 100 basis points of more while
the market had been expecting 100 basis points or less,” Carlos Kawall, an economist at Banco J. Safra in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
