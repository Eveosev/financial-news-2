China ’s government is encouraging
people to report corruption by filing anonymous tips on the
Internet, as the Communist Party presses ahead with a campaign
to crack down on official malfeasance.  Online news portals created links last month directing
users to pages of the party’s discipline department, the land
ministry and other agencies where they can send tips, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the State Internet
Information Office. Daily views of the informant pages have
since tripled and the number of tips has doubled, it said.  Anger over corruption has spurred President  Xi Jinping  and
other leaders to pledge an anti-graft drive that includes trying
to eliminate excessive spending and abuses of military license
plates. Xi told fellow leaders last year that failure to address
corruption could lead to social unrest and undermine the party’s
legitimacy.  News organizations including Xinhua and the People’s Daily,
as well as news portals owned by  Sina Corp. (SINA)  and Sohu.com Inc.,
set up websites on April 19, Xinhua said.  China’s 564 million Internet users increasingly use the Web
to expose cases of corruption. The southwestern city of
Chongqing said May 7 it will expel an official from the
Communist Party after he was identified in a sex video
circulated online.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
