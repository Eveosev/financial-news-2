About 1 in 8 Americans at least 60
years old reported confusion or  memory loss  in the preceding 12
months, according to health officials highlighting the need to
be alert for early signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.  About one-third of those Americans also said they had
functional difficulties including the ability to work or do
household chores, according to a  report  today from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Only 19 percent
of the people with memory loss or confusion discussed their
problems with a health-care provider. The results were from a
2011 survey of almost 60,000 people in 21 states, the CDC said.  More than 5 million Americans suffer from  Alzheimer’s , and
the number may triple by 2050, according to the  National
Institutes of Health . With as many as two-thirds of all cases of
dementia going undiagnosed, today’s report underscores the need
of health-care workers to initiate talks with patients about the
issue, the CDC said.  Discussions about symptoms and possible causes of cognitive
decline “enables individuals and family members to better
anticipate needs and plan for the future,” the CDC said in a
statement accompanying the report.  There is no known cure for Alzheimer’s, the most common
form of dementia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
