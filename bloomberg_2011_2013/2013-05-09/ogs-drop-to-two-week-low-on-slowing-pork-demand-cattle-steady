Hog futures slumped to a two-week low
on speculation that demand for U.S. pork is slowing and supplies
are increasing. Cattle prices were little changed.  Meatpackers processed 1.222 million hogs in the first three
days of this week, down 2.4 percent from a week earlier,
government data show. Yesterday, wholesale  pork  fell 0.2 percent
to 87.72 cents a pound, the second decline this week, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Retailers may have filled
meat orders for grilling demand for the Memorial Day holiday on
May 27, according to U.S. Commodities Inc.  “If the packer slows the kill, the fear is the numbers are
still there and you could add weight,”  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc., said in telephone interview from  West
Des Moines ,  Iowa . “There’s also a concern that the Memorial Day
buying of pork might be coming to a halt.”  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.5 percent to 91.325
cents a pound at 9:23 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
after touching 90.975 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since April 25.  Memorial Day is the second-most-popular day for grilling,
according to the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association. The
Independence Day holiday on July 4 is No. 1.  Cattle futures for June delivery slid 0.1 percent to $1.201
a pound. Prices were up 3.8 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slipped 0.1
percent to $1.4525 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
