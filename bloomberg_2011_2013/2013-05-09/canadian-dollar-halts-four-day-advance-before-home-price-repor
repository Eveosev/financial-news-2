The Canadian dollar snapped a four-day
gain versus its U.S. counterpart before data forecast to show
home-price growth slowed in March, diminishing arguments for the
Bank of  Canada  to raise interest rates.  The currency fell against the currencies of its commodity-exporting peers,  Australia  and New Zealand, as job gains in the
two nations exceeded economists’ forecasts. New home prices in
Canada increased 0.1 percent in March from 0.2 percent the month
before, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists. The
government has acted to head off a housing bubble this year as
the central bank cited record household debt-to-income as a
threat to the economy.  “Markets have really priced out any hike in interest rates
since really the start of this year due to increasing evidence
that these imbalances really are working their way out and the
Canadians really are in control of the economy, and they’re not
going to let there be a house-price bubble,” said Eimear Daly,
a currency market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. by phone from
 London . “That’s Canada-dollar negative because obviously it
means we won’t get a hike in interest rates any time soon, but
it is positive for the economy.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to
C$1.0037 per U.S. dollar at 8:15 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie
buys 99.63 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
