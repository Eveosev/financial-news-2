Komercni Banka  AS declined the most in
three weeks as Citigroup Inc. downgraded the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA to neutral from buy, citing a worsening
outlook for the lender’s earnings.  The stock slumped 3.1 percent to 3,700 koruna by the close
in Prague, its steepest retreat since April 18 and the worst
performance in the  PX (PX)  equity index today. About 67,000 shares
changed hands, 122 percent of the three-month daily average.  First-quarter profit fell 9.9 percent from a year earlier
to 3.15 billion koruna ($160 million) as income from fees and
financial operations shrank and one-time gains booked in 2012
were not repeated, Komercni Banka said on May 7. The net
interest margin, the difference between the bank’s lending and
borrowing rates, declined to 2.9 percent, down 20 basis points
in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Libor Lofler said in a
conference call after the earnings release.  “Komercni Banka reported a weak set of first-quarter
results,” said Simon Nellis, a London-based analyst at
Citigroup. The net interest margin decline is “particularly
worrying,” he wrote in a report to clients dated today.  Citigroup lowered its forecasts for Komercni Banka revenue
by 5 percent for this year and by 3 percent for 2014 and 2015,
according to the report. It also lowered its price projection
for the shares to 3,950 koruna from 4,400 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
