Colombia ’s economy will be best served
by ensuring that inflation converges to target, which policy
makers anticipate may occur next year, central bank co-director
Adolfo Meisel said.  Consumer prices will probably rise less than the target
this year because of weak internal demand, the peso’s gains at
the start of 2012, central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said last
month. Meisel last night said inflation will finish “very
close” to the target in 2014. Colombia targets inflation of 3
percent, plus or minus one percentage point.  “The target is in the long term at 3 percent, which is
considered consistent with Colombian growth,” Meisel said. In
that context, Meisel said the economy will grow 3 percent to 5
percent in 2013 with 4 percent the most likely pace.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said last month the
economy can grow at an annual rate of 4.8 percent without
generating inflation. Gross domestic product rose 4 percent last
year, slower than Chile and  Peru , and down from 6.6 percent in
2011.  The  annual inflation rate  rose to 2.02 in April from 1.91
percent in March and a 55-year low of 1.83 percent in February.
Consumer prices will rise 3.02 percent over the next year
according to an April central bank survey of economists, down
from a 3.04 percent forecast in March.  The peso yesterday fell 0.2 percent to 1,830.82 per  U.S.
dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
