Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest maker
of online customer-management software, increased Chief
Executive Officer  Marc Benioff ’s total compensation 25 percent
to $22.1 million for the last fiscal year.  While his $1 million salary was unchanged and his bonus
decreased, the value of Benioff’s option awards rose, helping to
boost the payout, the San Francisco-based company said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Benioff is seeking to accelerate growth by  pushing beyond 
cloud-computing software for sales management. He’s offering
customer service, online marketing and human-resources software
over the Web. Salesforce closed at a record high on March 1
after reporting sales and profit that topped estimates as those
expansion efforts prompted more businesses to sign bigger deals.  For the 2013 fiscal year, which ended in January, Chief
Financial Officer Graham Smith’s compensation rose 24 percent to
$4.3 million, also aided by options. Co-founder Parker Harris
received a pay package worth $4.8 million, a 40 percent
increase. Vice Chairman Frank van Veenendaal’s payout climbed 90
percent to $6.96 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
