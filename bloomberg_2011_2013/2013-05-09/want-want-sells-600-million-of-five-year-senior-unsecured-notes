Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (WWNTY) , a
manufacturer of rice cakes and beverages, sold $600 million of
bonds in its first offering of U.S. dollar-denominated debt.  The company issued 1.875 percent notes due May 2018 that
yield 115 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale adds to a
surge in dollar offerings from borrowers in Asia’s largest
economy that’s heading for the biggest quarter on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
