Treasuries extend gains after the U.S.
sale of $16 billion in 30-year bonds produced a lower-than-forecast yield.  The bonds drew a yield of 2.980 percent, compared with a
forecast of 2.997 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of
the  Federal Reserve ’s primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.53, compared with an average of 2.6
for the previous 10 sales. The securities erased gains earlier
after a report showed U.S.  initial claims  for  unemployment
insurance  unexpectedly fell last week.  “Higher yields drew demand, as well as the fact that
there’s no supply for two weeks,” said Dan Mulholland, head of
U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets unit of BNY Mellon
Corp. in New York. “It was better than expected. It prompted
some short-coverings.” Short positions are bets than an asset
will decline in value.  The U.S. 30-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.96 percent at 1:07 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
bond due in February 2043 traded gained 19/32, or $5.94 per
$1,000 face amount to 103 9/32. The yield rose to 3.02 percent
yesterday, the highest since April 4.  The yield on the May 2023 securities sold yesterday dropped
three basis points to 1.78 percent.  Bid Details  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 38.8 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 36.5 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.5 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 14.2 percent at the last
10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 0.2 percent this year, compared
with a 0.4 percent gain in the broader U.S.  Treasuries (USGG10YR)  market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $24 billion of 10-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 1.81 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year
notes on May 7 at a yield of 0.354 percent.  The sales will raise $12.4 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.6 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Demand Pattern  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$793 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3 in orders
to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record $3.15 in
2012, according to data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 10-year note is forecast to end the year
at 2.20 percent, according to the median estimates of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey May 3 to 8. The figure is down from a
forecast of 2.25 percent in a Bloomberg News survey conducted
April 5 to April 9. Thirty-year bonds may yield 3.25 percent at
the end of the year, compared with a forecast for 3.37 percent
in the previous survey.  Treasuries slid earlier in the month after a U.S. Labor
Department report on May 3 showed the  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly fell to a four-year low of 7.5 percent.  The  U.S. economy  is gradually improving as the Fed pursues
its accommodative policies.  Fed View  “The labor market has improved,” Fed Bank of Chicago’s
 Charles Evans  said, speaking today in an interview with  Michael
McKee  on Bloomberg Television. “I’d like to have confidence
that we can sustain that improvement in the labor market through
the summer.”  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
by 4,000 to 323,000 in the week ended May 4, the least since
January 2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists
forecast 335,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The average during the past month was the
lowest since before the last recession began.  Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said it
is “disturbing” to him that “more and more is being expected
of central banks.”  “Our fiscal authorities are not doing a very good job in
any country,” Plosser said in an interview on Bloomberg
television today.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
each month to support the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs. It purchased $1.4 billion of TIPS maturing
between April 2018 and February 2043 today, according to the Fed
Bank of New York’s  website .  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, fell to as low as 2.24 percentage points today, the least
since September. The five-year average is 2.03 percentage
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
