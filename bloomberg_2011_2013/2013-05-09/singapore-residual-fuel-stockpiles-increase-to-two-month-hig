Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
for a second week to the highest level in two months, according
to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue
and excluding bitumen gained 1.22 million barrels, or 6.6
percent, to 19.7 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the highest since the week ended March 6.  Light-distillate stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate declined 1.53 million barrels, or 13 percent, the most
since November, to 10.2 million, according to the data. Supplies
fell for the first time in four weeks.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene declined 303,000 barrels, or 2.9 percent,
to 10.1 million, the ministry’s data showed.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
