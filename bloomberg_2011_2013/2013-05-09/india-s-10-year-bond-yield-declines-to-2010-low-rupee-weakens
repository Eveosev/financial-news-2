India ’s bonds due 2022 rose, sending
the benchmark yield to the lowest in almost three years, on
optimism cooling inflation will allow the central bank to add to
this year’s three interest-rate cuts. The rupee weakened.  The pace of wholesale- price  gains slowed to 5.5 percent in
April from a 40-month low of 5.96 percent in March, according to
a Bloomberg survey of economists before data due next week.
Open-market debt purchases by the  Reserve Bank  of India, aimed
at easing cash shortages in the financial system, will spur
demand for bonds, according to Barclays Plc. The RBI cut its
 repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent on May 3,
taking this year’s reduction to 75 basis points.  “Easing expectations are still there,” said  Rohit Arora ,
a Singapore-based fixed-income strategist at Barclays. “Open-market operations support also helps” and yields may move
further down, he said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 dropped
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.61 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the lowest rate on a benchmark 10-year bond since July 2010.  Indian lenders  borrowed  an average 994 billion rupees ($18
billion) a day from the central bank this month to meet fund
shortages, official data show. The Reserve Bank bought 97
billion rupees of sovereign securities at an open-market
operation on May 7, three days after Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
said the monetary authority will “use all options” to manage
cash supply in the banking system.  Foreign Investment  Global funds’ demand for rupee debt has been boosted by a
drop in commodity prices and a government plan to cut taxes on
the securities, Barclays’s Arora said. India will cut the so-called withholding tax, charged on interest income earned by
foreigners, to 5 percent from 20 percent starting June, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on April 30. Brent crude
prices lost 13 percent in the past quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign holdings of Indian bonds surged $4.6 billion this
year to a record $37.5 billion on May 7, exchange data show.  The rupee lost 0.2 percent to 54.2450 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used
to price options, fell 15 basis points to 7.91 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.22 per
dollar, compared with 55.13 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.90 versus 54.73. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
