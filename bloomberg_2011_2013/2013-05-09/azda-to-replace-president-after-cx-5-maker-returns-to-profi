Mazda Motor Corp. (7267) ,  Japan ’s most
export-dependent carmaker, said Takashi Yamanouchi will step
down as president next month to make way for younger managers
after the company returned to  profitability .  Yamanouchi, 68, will be replaced by senior managing
executive officer Masamichi Kogai, 58, as part of broader
management moves that will take effect after the June 25 annual
shareholders’ meeting, the Hiroshima, Japan-based company said
in a statement. Mazda, which a year ago was reeling from its
biggest loss in 11 years, said it delayed the executive changes
because of its “financial situation.”  “I want to go to the front line of R&D, production and
sales and see what people feel and think,” Kogai told reporters
in Tokyo today.  Mazda (7261) , which last month posted its first annual  profit  in
five years, said net income may double to 70 billion yen ($709
million) this fiscal year. The stock has more than tripled in
the past six months as the carmaker benefited from a weaker yen
and demand for its CX-5 sport utility vehicle and Mazda 6 sedan.  Mazda fell 1.2 percent to 332 yen at the close in Tokyo
trading, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.7
percent. The carmaker has  climbed  91 percent this year, beating
the benchmark’s 37 percent advance.  Kogai joined Mazda in 1977 and oversees production and
purchasing.  Yamanouchi, who has been president since 2008, will remain
chairman, having overseen the company’s transition to an
independent automaker after Ford Motor Co. began cutting its
stake. Executive Vice President Seita Kanai, 63, will become
vice chairman, according to the statement.  “I’d like to hand over the work to younger people,”
Yamanouchi told reporters today in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
