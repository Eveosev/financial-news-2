Allscripts Inc., the electronic
medical records provider, declined 8.3 percent in extended
trading after reporting first-quarter  sales (MDRX)  and earnings that
were lower than analysts’ estimates.  Sales fell 4.8 percent to $347.1 million compared with the
$368.6 million average of 14 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit excluding certain items was 9 cents a share,
the Chicago-based company reported today in a statement.
Analysts had estimated 15 cents a share.  The company in December fired Glen Tullman as chief
executive officer and replaced him with a director, Paul Black,
after a year marked by board turmoil, a shareholder revolt and a
failed effort to sell itself to private equity buyers. Black
called 2013 a “rebuilding” year for the company, which sells
its products to doctors, hospitals and other health-care
providers.  “We are investing heavily in both our clients and our
products and so while our financial results for the quarter are
not surprising, they are not satisfactory and not indicative of
our long-term potential,” Black said in the statement.  Allscripts reported a first-quarter  net loss  of $11.6
million, or 7 cents a share, from a profit of $5.8 million, or 3
cents, a year earlier.  The company’s shares declined to $12.70 in extended trading
at 4:39 p.m.  New York  time after closing at $13.85. The shares
have gained 28 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
