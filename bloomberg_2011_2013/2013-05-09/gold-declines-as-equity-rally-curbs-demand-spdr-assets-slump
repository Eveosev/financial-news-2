Gold futures fell after a report
showed that the number of Americans filing claims for jobless
benefits unexpectedly dropped last week, easing pressure on the
Federal Reserve to expand monetary stimulus.  Jobless claims declined to 323,000 in the week ended May 4,
the fewest since January 2008, government data showed today.
Last week, the Fed affirmed that debt purchases will continue
“until the outlook for the labor market has improved
substantially.” Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s
largest exchange-traded fund backed by the metal, extended a
 slump  yesterday to a four-year low.  “Today’s numbers are a big surprise and negative for
gold,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien
& Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Also,
the ETF holdings continue to drop.”  Gold futures for June delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$1,466.80 an ounce at 9:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Trading was 23 percent higher than the average in the past 100
days for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The metal tumbled into a bear market last month as some
investors lost faith in the commodity as a store of value amid
speculation that the Fed will slow the pace of bond purchases.  Silver futures for July delivery fell less than 0.1 percent
to $23.91 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
