Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest water
treatment company, posted a 4.7 percent increase in first-quarter profit as it reduced spending on raw materials and
labor.  Net income climbed to S$8 million ($6.5 million) in the
three months ended March 31, from S$7.7 million a year earlier,
Hyflux said in a statement to the stock exchange today.
Operating costs and expenditures fell by about 8 percent,
according to the company, which built Singapore’s first water-recycling plant.  The industrial water sector’s outlook is improving, Hyflux
said. Countries such as China and  India  “impose more stringent
water discharge standards and encourage industries to seek
alternative sustainable sources of water, such as recycling and
desalination,” according to the statement.  Hyflux said its Tuaspring Desalination Plant in the city-state is undergoing testing and commissioning and is scheduled
to begin operations in the second half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
