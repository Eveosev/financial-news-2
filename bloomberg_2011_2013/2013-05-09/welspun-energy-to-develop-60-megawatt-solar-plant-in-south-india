Welspun Energy Ltd. ,  India ’s biggest
developer of solar projects, said it will build a 60-megawatt
solar power plant in south India after winning a local
government auction.  The company is in talks with banks to raise 4 billion
rupees ($74 million) to fund the project in the state of Tamil
Nadu, Managing Director Vineet Mittal said today in Chennai. In
December, Tamil Nadu had invited bids from developers to set up
solar projects of as much as 1 gigawatt in capacity.  Welspun, based in New Delhi, expects to complete raising
funds in two months, Mittal said. Electricity generated from the
plant will be sold to Tamil Nadu’s power distributor. The
company received a letter of intent for the project from the
state government on Monday, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
