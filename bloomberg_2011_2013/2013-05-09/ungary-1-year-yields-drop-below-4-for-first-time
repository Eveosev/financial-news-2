Hungary’s 12-month Treasury-bill
 yields  dropped below 4 percent for the first time on record at
an auction today on anticipation the central bank will extend
nine months of interest rate cuts.  The Debt Management Agency sold 50 billion forint ($224
million) in bills at an average yield of 3.96 percent, compared
with 4.02 percent at the last sale of the same maturity two
weeks ago. The agency also raised 10 billion forint in floating-rate bonds due in 2019.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points to a record 4.75 percent on April 23, saying that more
easing is possible if the inflation outlook and financial
markets allow, according to a statement on the bank’s website.
While central bank President Gyorgy Matolcsy considered
accelerating the pace of cuts, “gradually” reducing borrowing
costs was the “conservative” and “responsible” policy, Heti
Valasz reported today, citing an interview with him.  “The main question remains whether bigger rate cuts will
happen than so far,” Peter Fazekas and Gergely Palffy,
Budapest-based analysts at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a
research report.  The forint gained less than 0.1 percent to 293.10 per euro
by 1:39 p.m. in Budapest, giving it an advance in the second
quarter of 3.8 percent, the best performance among more than 100
currencies worldwide tracked by Bloomberg.  Forward-rate agreements used to wager on three-month
interest in three months traded at 3.77 basis points, 81 basis
points below the Budapest Interbank Offered Rate, indicating at
least 75 basis points of rate cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
