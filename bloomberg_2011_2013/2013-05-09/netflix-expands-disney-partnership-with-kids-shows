Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the world’s largest
subscription video service, added five shows from Walt Disney
Co.’s cable channels, strengthening its programming for families
with children.  The multiyear agreement gives Los Gatos, California-based
Netflix exclusive U.S. subscription streaming rights to Disney
Junior’s “Jake and the Never Land Pirates” and “Tron:
Uprising,” which airs on Disney XD, the companies said today in
a statement. Terms for the shows, which began streaming today,
weren’t disclosed.  The deal bolsters Netflix’s lineup of kids’ shows as it
focuses on exclusives and children’s programming to stand out
from competitors such as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest Web
retailer, and Hulu LLC. The new rights build on an agreement in
December giving Netflix access to films from Disney’s Pixar,
Marvel and Lucasfilm.  Netflix, the leading online subscription service, has also
funded original programs such as the political thriller “House
of Cards,” and obtained rights to the revived Fox show
“Arrested Development,” which begins streaming new episodes
May 26.  As part of the new Disney agreement, Netflix will begin
streaming “Handy Manny,” “Special Agent Oso” and “JoJo’s
Circus” on a non-exclusive basis this month.  Netflix signed a multi-year accord with Disney in December,
covering films that become available starting in 2016.  Netflix rose 3.7 percent to $216.41 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have more than doubled this year, the biggest
rise among members of the  S&P 500 Index. (SPX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
