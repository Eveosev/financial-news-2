AES Corp. (AES)  sees limited growth
opportunities in Europe as the global power producer seeks to
narrow its geographic footprint to boost cash flow and earnings.  “The growth we talk about is very much in the  United
States ,  Latin America , Central America and  Asia ,” Chief
Financial Officer Thomas O’Flynn said in a phone interview
today. “We don’t have as many growth defined plans in Europe.”  AES has exited six countries and raised $1.1 billion from
assets sales since the end of 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Andres Gluski said during an  investor conference call  today. The
Arlington, Virginia-based company is planning about $500 million
in sales this year, including the $109 million divestment of its
Ukraine utilities that closed last month, O’Flynn said.  AES sees earnings little changed or declining through 2015
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where it has about 8,200
megawatts of generation, according to an  investor presentation 
posted today. “Part of it is the economy,” O’Flynn said of the
projections for Europe, where the company owns about 4,800
megawatts.  O’Flynn declined to comment on particular power plants or
utilities that may be targeted for a sale.  AES reported first-quarter earnings that missed analysts’
estimates. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit was 26
cent, 2 cents less than the average of five  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The shares fell 4.9 percent to $13.22 at the close
in New York, the biggest decline since Nov. 9, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
