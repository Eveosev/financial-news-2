Venezuelan  consumer prices  soared the
most in three years last month as President  Nicolas Maduro ’s
government reduced dollar sales to importers and the central
bank’s scarcity index reached the highest on record.  Prices rose 4.3 percent from March, the central bank said
today, the most since April 2010 and faster than the 3 percent
median estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
annual inflation rate reached 29.4 percent, the highest since
August 2010.  Venezuela ’s government introduced a complementary currency
system this year, after a February devaluation, that auctioned
$200 million on March 27. The system, known as Sicad, has not
auctioned any foreign currency since. Finance Minister Nelson Merentes said May 2 that 85 percent of the country’s economic
problems would be solved “soon.” Fewer dollars for importers
make it harder to buy goods abroad, exacerbating shortages.  The scarcity index, which measures the amount of goods that
are out of stock on the market, rose to 21.3 percent last month,
the highest since the central bank started tracking the measure
in April 2009, according to the central bank report. Food prices
climbed 6.4 percent in April, the central bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
