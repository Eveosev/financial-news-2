The Shard’s first restaurant,  Adam Ant’s  comeback and a designer craft fair are among Muse’s arts and leisure recommendations for London this weekend.  STAGE  Infidelity is the theme of “Passion Play,” the Peter Nichols comedy opening at the Duke of York’s Theatre.  Zoe Wanamaker ’s character Eleanor is thrown off course when her husband cheats with a flirtatious young woman. The play ends Aug. 3. Information:  http://www.passionplaylondon.com .  The Spice Girls musical “ Viva Forever ” isn’t quite living up to its name: It’s closing June 29. You have a few more weeks to hear hits like “Wannabe” punctuate a plot by Jennifer (“Absolutely Fabulous”) Saunders.  The plot goes something like this: Young Viva, who lives on a houseboat, performs in a TV talent show with the girl band she’s just joined. Then a divisive TV judge singles her out for a solo career.  Piccadilly Theatre, Denman Street, W1D 7DY. Information:  http://www.vivaforeverthemusical.com  or +44-844-871-7627.  DINING  Mark Wogan, son of entertainer  Terry Wogan , opens a wood-fired pizza joint in Covent Garden this week. Homeslice serves regular varieties such as Margherita at 4 pounds ($6.21) a slice or 20 pounds for the whole 20-inch pizza. More exotic options feature bone marrow, spring onion and watercress. Information:  http://www.homeslicepizza.co.uk/  or +44-20-7836-4604.  The Shard is finally accepting diners: at Oblix, which also opens this week. The modern, 32nd-floor restaurant is inspired by New York grills and serves dishes such as Caesar salad (9 pounds) or whole lobster, lemon verbena & garlic butter (34 pounds). There’s a 100-seat lounge with live music, too. You may need to book early as Oblix is attracting a lot of interest. Information:  http://oblixrestaurant.com/  or +44-20-7268-6700.  VISUAL ARTS  What’s that gaping hole doing in the middle of an abstract painting? It’s a leftover from the Lebanese civil war: A bomb sent glass flying through artist Saloua Raouda Choucair’s apartment, leaving tears in her oil-on-canvas “Two=One” (1947-51), which she never restored.  Choucair, now 97, has a standalone show at Tate Modern. Though the works reveal her Modernist training in Paris, Choucair’s personality comes through. Don’t miss “Chores” (1948-9), where three bored women, drawn in the manner of Matisse, iron, scrub and sweep.  Ends Oct. 20 at Tate Modern.  http://www.tate.org.uk  or call +44-20-7887-8888.  MUSIC  Adam Ant ’s career comes full circle at the Roundhouse: He returns to the Camden venue he played in May 1978 supporting X Ray Spex. Ant will sing tracks off his new album and some greatest hits. Also on the bill: Alexa De Strange and New Killer Shoes.  http://www.adam-ant.com/   U.S. singer-songwriter  Jon Regen  swings through London on a European tour. The jazzy pianist has just done a sellout show with  Dionne Warwick  and signed with Sly Dog Records for his single “ Revolution .” He is at Pizza Express Jazz Club Saturday with bassist P.J.
