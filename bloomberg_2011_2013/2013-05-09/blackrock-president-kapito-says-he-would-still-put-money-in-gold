BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s  Robert Kapito ,
president of the world’s largest asset manager, said he thinks
gold is a good investment even after bullion tumbled into a bear
market last month.  It’s easier for clients to get access to the commodity now
through exchange-traded funds and gold is an asset class
investors should have long-term in their portfolios, Kapito said
today in an interview with Tom Keene on “Bloomberg
Surveillance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
