Hospira Inc. (HSP) , a maker of acute-care
products, sued a U.S. unit of Germany’s B. Braun Melsungen AG
alleging infringement of patents for drug-infusion pump
technology.  B. Braun Medical Inc., based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is
using inventions that belong to Hospira, of  Lake Forest ,
Illinois, by making and selling its drug-delivery systems
without permission, Hospira contends in a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Hospira is the owner of the entire right, title and
interest” in the patents, and Braun should pay damages for lost
profits and legal fees and be prohibited from its wrongful
actions after a  jury trial , plaintiff’s lawyers said in court
papers.  Hospira itself was sued in  New York  Federal court in
February over a canceled influenza-vaccine supply contract by
GlaxoSmithKline Plc., which questioned the quality of the
product. The case is continuing.  Jason Ford, a B. Braun spokesman, didn’t immediately reply
to voice and e-mail requests for comment on the patent action.  The case is Hospira Inc. v. B. Braun Medical Inc., 13-cv-00819, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
