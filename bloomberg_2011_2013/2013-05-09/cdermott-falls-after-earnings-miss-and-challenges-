McDermott International Inc. (MDR) , the
Houston-based maker of pipelines for offshore  oil fields , fell
the most in 18 months after quarterly earnings missed analysts’
estimates and the company said it sees “near-term challenges.”  McDermott declined 15 percent to $9.33 at 11:39 a.m. in  New
York , after earlier having the biggest intraday drop since
October 2011.  First-quarter net income decreased 67 percent to $20.6
million, or 9 cents a share, from $62.8 million, or 26 cents, a
year earlier, the company said in a statement issued yesterday
after the close of regular trading. Excluding one-time items,
per-share profit fell below the 14-cent average of 16 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The profitability drop represented “another
disappointing” quarter, Michael Marino, an analyst at Stephens
Inc. in Houston, wrote in a note to investors today. “This
quarter the disappointment was in the  Middle East  where several
projects experienced profitability adjustments.”  Operating margins, which were 7 percent in the first
quarter, may be at break even levels or a loss for the second
and third quarters after its largest project was completed in
 Australia  and with continuing losses forecast for its Atlantic
division, Chief Financial Officer Perry Elders said on an
investor conference call today.  The company has about $1.8 billion in backlog work that
will “roll off” in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Stephen M. Johnson said on the call. “We still have work to do to book
additional business for 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
