Gleacher & Co., the brokerage that’s
closing its fixed-income business, reported a wider first-quarter loss and said its prospects are “highly uncertain.”  Net loss from continuing operations was $13.7 million,
compared with $3.03 million in the same period a year earlier,
the New York-based company said today in a statement. Net loss
from discontinued operations was $4.3 million, the company said.  Gleacher said last month that it’s closing the credit
business, which generated most of the firm’s revenue, as
salesmen defected and customers suspended trading. The brokerage
has had talks to combine with Sterne Agee Group Inc., people
familiar with the matter said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
