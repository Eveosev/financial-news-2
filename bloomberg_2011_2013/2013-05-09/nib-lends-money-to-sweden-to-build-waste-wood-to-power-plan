The Nordic Investment Bank will lend
20 million euros ($26 million) to  Sweden â€™s Vimmerby Energi &
Miljo AB to build a facility in the southeast that will use
bark, wood chips and forest waste to produce heat and power.  The project is expected to start working at the end of next
year and will have a 26-megawatt thermal output and a 7.5-megawatt electric capacity, according to  a statement  on the
website of the NIB. The loan has a 20-year term, it said.  Energy produced from organic matter such as wood chips,
food and agricultural waste accounts for about 29 percent of
total final energy use in Sweden. The country plans for as much
as half of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
