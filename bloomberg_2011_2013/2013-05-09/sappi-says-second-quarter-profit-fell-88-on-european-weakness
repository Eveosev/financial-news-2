Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s biggest maker
of glossy paper, said second-quarter net income fell 88 percent
as sales in  Europe , its main market, weakened.  Profit declined to $7 million in the three months through
March, compared with $58 million a year earlier, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Sales
dropped to $1.5 billion in the quarter compared with $1.6
billion a year ago, it said.  “The European business experienced very weak market
conditions during the quarter and, despite the significant cost
reductions implemented over the past year, the performance of
the business was substantially weaker than a year ago,” the
company said.  Sappi  shares  fell as much as 7.6 percent and were down 3.5
percent at 24.80 rand at 9:13 a.m. in Johannesburg, the lowest
level since November. The share price has declined 19 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared
with a 34 percent gain for papermaker  Mondi Ltd. (MND)   Sappi, which generates 55 percent of revenue in Europe, is
converting mills at a cost of about $540 million in South Africa
and  Minnesota  to produce specialty pulp used to make goods from
sports clothing to mobile-phone screens and pills. The company
hasn’t paid a dividend to shareholders since 2008.  Sappi is rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service, three
levels below investment grade. It issued bonds worth 1.5 billion
rand ($166.62 million) on April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
