Spanish 10-year government bonds pared
a decline after the nation sold 4.57 billion euros of debt at an
auction, compared with a maximum target of 4.5 billion euros.  Ten-year yields were one basis point higher at 4.11 percent
as of 9:47 a.m. London time. They climbed as much as four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point before the auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
