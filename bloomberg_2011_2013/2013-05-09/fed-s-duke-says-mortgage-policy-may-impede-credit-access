Federal Reserve Governor  Elizabeth Duke  said new mortgage regulation may inhibit lending to
borrowers with low credit scores even amid a rebound in the
housing market.  “The housing market is improving, but mortgage credit
conditions remain quite tight for borrowers with lower credit
scores,” Duke said today in a speech in  Washington . “New
mortgage regulations will provide important protections to
borrowers but may also lead to a permanent increase in the cost
of originating loans to borrowers with lower credit scores.”  Policy makers have tried to correct lax lending standards
that helped pump up a bubble in  home prices  which burst last
decade, leading to the worst recession since the Great
Depression. The Fed will consider the impact of new rules on the
availability of credit, Duke said.  Lenders may be unsure of the conditions in which they will
have to repurchase loans sold to government-sponsored mortgage
finance companies, Duke said. Mortgage servicing standards have
become tighter as a result of recent settlements, she said.  “A sustained recovery in the housing market appears to be
under way,” the Fed governor said. “Although I expect housing
demand to expand along with the economic recovery, if credit is
hard to get, much of that demand may be channeled into rental,
rather than owner-occupied, housing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
