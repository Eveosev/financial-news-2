China  can’t be “blindly optimistic”
about its inflation outlook at a time when uncertainties remain
in areas such as property and farm produce prices, the country’s
central bank said.  China will continue to pursue a prudent monetary policy to
keep prices stable, the People’s Bank of China said in its
 first-quarter monetary policy implementation report . The bank
will also further push forward interest-rate liberalization and
reform of mechanisms for forming the yuan’s exchange rate,
according to the report.  The central bank’s comments came after China’s statistics
bureau reported today that the  consumer price index  rose 2.4
percent in April, compared with a median forecast of 2.3 percent
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Moves to loosen government control over utilities and
resources may also lead to higher inflation later in the year,
the central bank said in the report. Food prices rose 4 percent
last month from a year earlier, compared with 2.7 percent the
previous month, with fresh-vegetable prices helping drive the
pickup in broader inflation from March’s 2.1 percent pace,
according to the statistics bureau.  Surging capital inflows into the country also complicated
the central bank’s task in guarding against any flare-up in
inflation, according to the report. China’s monetary-market rate
snapped a three-day drop as the central bank sold bills today
for the first time since 2011, draining cash from the financial
system as accelerating  yuan  gains spur capital inflows.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
