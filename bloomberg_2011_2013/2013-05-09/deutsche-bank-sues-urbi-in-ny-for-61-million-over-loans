Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  sued  Urbi (URBI*)  Desarrollos
Urbanos SAB de CV, a Mexican real-estate developer, in  New York 
for $61.1 million for defaulting on loans.  Deutsche Bank made loans valued at $50 million and
$55 million to Mexicali-based Urbi, according to a complaint
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. In
April, Urbi failed to make a $3 million payment on the
$55 million loan and also failed to pay $1.55 million in
interest on the two loans, Deutsche Bank said.  The bank also said that because of the default it
terminated a swap agreement with Urbi involving interest-rate
and foreign-exchange option transactions. Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank said in the complaint that it told Urbi it owed
$37.7 million on that agreement and claimed the payment hasn’t
been made.  Foreclosures in  Mexico  more than doubled last year to a
record 43,853. Urbi’s  cash  and cash equivalents fell 95 percent
in the first quarter from the previous quarter. The company has
hired Rothschild to advise it on a possible restructuring.  Urbi, the biggest Mexican builder by the number of homes,
was sued in New York last month by Credit Suisse Group AG and
Barclays Plc, Britain’s second-biggest lender, over financial
derivatives.  Deutsche Bank also sued the guarantors of the loans and
seeks damages of $46.8 million from them.  The case is Deutsche Bank v. Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos,
651676/2013, Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
