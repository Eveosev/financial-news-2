David Moyes will leave as Everton
manager at the end of the season and wants to succeed Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.  Moyes, 50, met yesterday with Everton Chairman Bill Kenwright to confirm his interest in joining United, the club
said in a  statement  on its website. The Scot was linked with the
Premier League soccer champion after Ferguson announced
yesterday he would retire after the season.  “Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the club
at the end of the season,” the club’s statement read. “He has
been an outstanding manager.”  Moyes’s contract at Everton expires after this season and
he’d yet to sign an extension. The club said it will immediately
begin the search for his replacement.  United has made no comment on the identity of Ferguson’s
successor.  Moyes has been at Everton since 2002, making him the
Premier League’s third-longest serving current manager. Though
he hasn’t won any trophies, Everton has consistently finished in
the top half of the Premier League working with a budget far
smaller than those of larger clubs.  Everton hasn’t finished outside the top eight in the 20-team league since 2006. The Toffees qualified for the Champions
League in 2005 and reached the 2009 F.A. Cup final, where they
lost to Chelsea.  Moyes’s final two matches will be against West Ham on May
12 and Chelsea seven days later. Everton is currently sixth in
the Premier League, six points behind fifth-place Tottenham and
five points ahead of Merseyside rival Liverpool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
