Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-largest
U.S. satellite-television provider, reported first-quarter sales
that trailed estimates after adding fewer customers than
analysts projected.  First-quarter net income fell to $216 million, or 47 cents
a share, from $360 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier, the
Englewood, Colorado-based company said in a statement today.
Sales fell 0.7 percent to $3.56 billion, lower than the $3.61
billion average analyst estimate.  Dish added about 36,000 customers in the quarter, compared
with the 57,000 average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company raised prices for the first time in about
two years, although average monthly revenue per pay-TV customer
rose just 3 percent to $78.54, trailing the $79.59 average
analyst estimate.  “The first rate increase in two years could not fully
offset programming expense and subscriber acquisition cost
increases,”  Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI Group in  New York ,
said in a note to clients. He has a buy rating on the shares.  Dish’s stock  fell 2 percent to $38.80 at the close in New
York. The shares have climbed 6.6 percent this year.  Broadband Subscribers  Dish added 66,000 satellite broadband customers, almost all
of which bundled the service with satellite-TV service, Chief
Executive Officer Joseph Clayton said in the statement.  Dish is seeking to bundle its satellite-TV and Internet
services with a mobile product through a merger with  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)  Dish is awaiting a decision from a special
committee of Sprint’s board members to determine if its offer is
superior to a $20.1 billion offer from  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , a
Japanese carrier.  Billionaire  Charlie Ergen , Dish’s chairman and co-founder,
said in a conference call he expects SoftBank will raise its
bid, based on the operating cost savings the Tokyo-based company
said it could bring to Sprint by 2017.  In a filing today, Dish said it owned $592 million in
Sprint derivative financial instruments as of May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
