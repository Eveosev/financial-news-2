Investment Corp. of Dubai, the
emirate’s main state-owned holding company, will increase the
size of a planned syndicated loan to $2.45 billion, two
bankers familiar with the deal said.  The facility, originally intended to be $2 billion, will
close soon, said the bankers, who asked not to be identified
because the information hasn’t been made public. ICD is
increasing the loan because of demand from lenders, they said.  The Dubai Media Office didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
