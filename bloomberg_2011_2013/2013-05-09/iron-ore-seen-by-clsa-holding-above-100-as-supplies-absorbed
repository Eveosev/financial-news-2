Iron ore  will be well-supported at
more than $100 a ton this year on sustained demand from  China ,
the largest user of the steel-making raw material, according to
CLSA Ltd., which said the longer-term outlook is more bearish.  Ore may trade between $110 to $120 in 2013 amid below-average inventories, Ian Roper, commodities strategist, told a
conference in Singapore today. Ore with  62 percent iron content 
at China’s Tianjin port was at $130.20 a ton yesterday, and last
traded below $100 in September, The Steel Index data show.  The commodity has lost 10 percent this year, nearing bear-market territory, amid forecasts for increased global seaborne
supplies, especially from Australia in the second half. Demand
is still there, and while global supply growth is coming, it
perhaps won’t be as great as some people feared, Roper said.  “My long-term view, I’m still structurally very bearish on
the iron ore outlook,” said Roper, who’s based in  Shanghai .
“Nearer term, more neutral, not quite so bearish. I don’t think
it’s too much of a disaster this year.”  Imported ore at Tianjin has lost 18 percent since peaking
at $158.90 on Feb. 20, nearing the 20 percent decline that some
investors use to define a  bear market . Last September, the raw
material plunged to $86.70 as  China’s economy  slowed for seven
consecutive quarters and mills destocked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
