Umpires made an “improper call” in
disallowing what replays showed to be a home run by the Oakland
Athletics against the Cleveland Indians last night, Major League
Baseball said in a statement.  The call still stands under the rules and the Indians get
the 4-3 victory,  Joe Torre , MLB’s vice president for baseball
operations, said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
