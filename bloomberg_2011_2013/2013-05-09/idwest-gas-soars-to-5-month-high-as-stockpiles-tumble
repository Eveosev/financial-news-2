U.S. Midwest gasoline strengthened
against futures to the highest level in more than five months as
 area inventories  slumped amid work at local refineries.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Midwest, the PADD 2 region,
tumbled  1.34 million barrels , or 2.7 percent, to 48.7 million in
the week ended May 3, the lowest level since Nov. 30, according
to Energy Information Administration data. It was the third
consecutive decline.  “Inventories are uncharacteristically snug for this time
of year,” Steve Mosby, vice president of supply consultant ADMO
Energy LLC, said in a phone interview from  Kansas City ,
 Missouri . “We’ve had a really strong turnaround schedule.”  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Group 3, or Midcontinent, area widened by  4.5 cents  to 24.5
cents a gallon versus  New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at
1:04 p.m., the  strongest differential  since Sept. 24, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional, 85-octane gasoline,
or CBOB, in  Chicago  gained 3.5 cents to a premium of 16.5 cents
a gallon.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut all operating units at the 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet refinery on April 14 for several weeks of
planned work.  BP Plc (BP/)  idled an alkylation unit at its  Toledo,
Ohio, plant  for planned repairs, while crews at the Whiting,
Indiana, refinery are replacing equipment. The two plants make
up a combined capacity of 580,000 barrels a day.  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) ’s Wynnewood site in  Oklahoma  is operating
at reduced rates after an unexpected malfunction in late April.  Crack Spreads  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the Group 3 region, a rough
measure of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, gained $2.67 to $33.52 a barrel, a seventh
consecutive advance. Group 3 includes states north of Tulsa,
Oklahoma, to Minnesota and  North Dakota .  The same spread for refineries in Chicago widened $1.41 to
$33.70 a barrel.  “These guys have been making great crack spreads and
running the plants hard,” Mosby said. “So the turnarounds have
been more extensive this time around. Whereas they normally
might work on one unit here or there, we’re seeing more units go
down simultaneously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
