Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , India’s largest
refiner, said a lack of oil and natural gas export pipelines in
 Canada  is a hurdle that’s preventing its investment in energy
companies and assets in the country.  Indian Oil wants access to Canada’s crude and future
exports of liquefied natural gas, A.M.K. Sinha, director of
planning and business development on the board of the Mumbai-based state-controlled company, told reporters today at a
conference in Calgary.  “We want to diversify and we are looking at Canada as a
possible source,” Sinha said. The biggest constraint to
investment by Indian Oil in Canada’s energy sector is
“infrastructure problems, pipelines mainly,” he said. Conduits
are needed from Western Canada to the Atlantic Coast, which is
closer to  India , he said.  Canada, with the world’s third-largest reserves of crude,
is seeking new export markets for oil and gas as its main
consumer, the U.S., produces more of the fossil fuels. There are
more than 10 Canadian proposals to export gas in liquid form to
 Asia , and Indian Oil may consider investing in the sector, Sinha
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
