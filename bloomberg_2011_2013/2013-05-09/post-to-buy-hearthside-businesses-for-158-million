Post Holdings Inc. (POST) , the maker of the
Raisin Bran, Honeycomb and Alpha-Bits cereals, agreed to buy
Hearthside Food Solution’s branded and private-label cereal,
granola and snacks businesses for about $158 million in cash.  The acquisition will add $70 million to full-year sales and
as much as $19 million to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, St. Louis-based Post said today
in a statement. Post said the deal should be completed by June.  Chief Executive Officer William P. Stiritz is adding brands
to Post’s portfolio of cereal labels after the company was spun
off from Ralcorp Inc. last year. Post also will gain a 135,000
square-foot factory and a 30,000 square-foot warehouse as part
of the deal.  Post  rose  0.1 percent to $45.50 yesterday in New York. The
shares gained 33 percent this year through yesterday, compared
with a 14 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
