Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the U.K.’s
biggest mortgage lender, is cutting 850 jobs in its business
banking, consumer, insurance, wealth, consumer and asset-finance
divisions to control costs.  Lloyds will also close its office in Southend,  England , the
London-based company said in a statement today. The reductions
are part of the 15,000 job losses Chief Executive Officer
Antonio Horta-Osorio announced in June 2011.  Horta-Osorio, 49, is seeking to strengthen Lloyds’s  balance
sheet  by selling assets and cutting costs. Lloyds has eliminated
more than 35,000 positions and closed overseas units to focus on
the U.K. since the bank received a 20 billion-pound ($31
billion) bailout amid the 2008 banking crisis.  “Where it is necessary for employees to leave the company,
it will look to achieve this by offering voluntary redundancy,”
the bank said. “Compulsory redundancies will always be a last
resort.”  Lloyds has cut more than 2,750 since the start of the year,
the Unite union said in a separate statement today.  “Lloyds is celebrating a return to profit and there are
hints of dividend pay-outs to shareholders but the bank’s
workers are in constant fear that they will be next for the
chop,” Unite National Officer Dominic Hook said in the
statement. “It’s time to urgently review this continuous tide
of cuts and build the bank’s strength.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
