GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , a Japanese battery
maker, forecast net income will jump 73 percent this fiscal year
and said it resumed output of cells for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787.  Production of the batteries was restarted last month after
being halted in January, Makoto Yoda, president of the company,
told reporters today in Kyoto, Japan. GS Yuasa had stopped
making the batteries after some overheated, leading to the
grounding of 787s as a safety precaution.  The company, which also sells lead-acid batteries for cars,
is aiming to make lithium-ion units a key business, from about 7
percent of sales in the year ended March 2012.  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) 
and  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) , the two biggest operators of the  787
Dreamliners , plan to restart commercial services with the planes
next month after test flights with upgraded batteries.  “Probably in a year or so people will forget about” the
aircraft battery overheating, Edwin Merner, president of
Atlantis Investment Research Corp. in  Tokyo , said before today’s
announcement.  Net income will rise to 10 billion yen ($101 million) in
the year ending March 31, compared with 5.8 billion yen in the
previous 12 months, GS Yuasa said in a statement today. That
target missed the 11.8 billion yen average of nine analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit slumped 51 percent in the year ended March, as
weaker demand for electric car batteries lead to a 3.8 percent
drop in sales, Yoda said.  Yuasa makes lithium-ion batteries for  Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. (7211) , through a venture with the carmaker and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) 
Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors put its plug-in hybrid Outlander
on sale in Japan on Jan. 24 and had sold 4,305 of the model as
of the end of March, according to the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
