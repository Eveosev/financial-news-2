The  England  Cricket team will be
sponsored by U.K. grocery chain Waitrose for three years,
starting in 2014.  Waitrose, part of John Lewis Partnership Plc, will have its
logo on all England teams’ apparel, advertisements on the
cricket grounds and access to team members for marketing.  Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed in a
 statement  from the England and Wales Cricket Board. The Daily
Telegraph newspaper reported it was worth more than 20 million
pounds ($31 million).  Waitrose’s sponsorship will begin with a Test series
against Sri Lanka in May 2014 and includes the International
Cricket Council World Cup and a home Test series against
Australia in 2015, and the Twenty20 and Women’s World Cups in
2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
