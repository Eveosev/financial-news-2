Canada’s new home price  index  rose 0.1
percent in March on gains in Calgary.  Prices in Calgary increased 0.3 percent from February, as
builders reported higher materials and labor costs,  Statistics
Canada  said today from Ottawa. Prices gained 0.1 percent in
Toronto and fell 0.2 percent in  Vancouver .  From a year earlier, new home  prices  increased 2.0 percent
in March, slower than February’s 2.1 percent rate, Statistics
Canada said.  Economists predicted the index would advance by 0.1 percent
on the month and 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to
median estimates in Bloomberg News surveys.  The Bank of Canada projects housing investment will be a
drag on economic growth this year and next. Governor  Mark Carney 
has also said that consumers need to be prudent with borrowing
as debt burdens have reached record highs relative to income.  Canadian housing  starts  declined for the first time in
three months in April led by multiple-unit projects, the federal
housing agency said yesterday, with work beginning on 174,900
homes at a seasonally adjusted annual pace, down 3.5 percent
from March and 31 percent slower than the same month in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
