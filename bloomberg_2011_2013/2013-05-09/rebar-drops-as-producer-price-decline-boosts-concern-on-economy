Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  fell for the first time in five sessions after the
government said the decline in factory-gate prices deepened,
raising concern that an economic slowdown may be protracted.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to 3,630  yuan  ($592) a
metric ton, and traded 3,640 yuan at 10:42 a.m. in Beijing.
Before today, futures rebounded 3.9 percent from a five-month
low of 3,530 yuan on May 2.  The producer price  index  fell 2.6 percent from a year
earlier, after March’s 1.9 percent drop, while  consumer
inflation  was 2.4 percent, below the government’s annual goal of
3.5 percent, the statistics bureau said today in Beijing.  “The deflation in producer prices raises concern that the
recovery is weakening,” Oliver Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures
Co., said by phone from Beijing. “It’s given the market a
reason to mull whether the rally was overdone,” he said.  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,593 yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose
0.2 percent to $130.20 a dry ton, Steel Index Ltd. data show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
