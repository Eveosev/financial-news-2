Investors withdrew a record $9.3
billion from commodity exchange-traded products as gold sales
pushed the metal into a  bear market ,  BlackRock Inc (BLK)  said.  The outflow for commodities in April pushed the total for
the first four months this year to $17.8 billion, compared with
inflows of $6 billion for the same period last year, BlackRock
said in a report dated April 30. The previous record for
commodity sales was $5.2 billion in February. Gold outflows were
an all-time high of $8.7 billion last month as the metal slid to
a two-year low in  London  on April 16, two sessions after falling
into a bear market.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials fell
4.7 percent last month, the most since May. Investors cut gold-backed ETP assets that reached a record in December as faith in
the metal as a store of value waned after inflation failed to
accelerate and confidence mounted that the  U.S. economy  is
improving. Gold prices that rallied for 12 years in the best run
in at least nine decades are down 23 percent from the September
2011 peak as U.S. equities climbed to a record.  “The challenges facing the category have intensified as
moderating inflation expectations and other factors led to a
recent record plunge in the spot price for gold,” BlackRock
said in the report.  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities dropped 2.4 percent
this year, the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained
10 percent and gold is down 12 percent. Treasuries returned 0.4
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Gold ETPs  Gold investments through ETPs dropped $17.9 billion so far
this year through April, BlackRock said. Investors now own about
2,239.2 metric tons of billion through the products that first
listed in 2003, compared with a record 2,632.5 tons in December,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Hedge funds  and other
 speculators  have cut bets on rising prices by 72 percent since
October, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading data show.  Prices reached $1,321.95 an ounce on April 16 and traded at
$1,471.38 today. Analysts at banks including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG are among those
forecasting further declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
