Egypt ’s central bank today kept its
benchmark overnight deposit rate unchanged at 9.75 percent.  The overnight lending rate was also maintained at 10.75
percent, the Cairo-based bank said in a statement. Governor
Hisham Ramez was expected to raise the deposit rate by 25 basis
points to 10 percent, according to the median of six estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  Egypt’s inflation accelerated to 8.1 percent in April,
pushed up by rising food prices that are pressuring the
government as it seeks to conclude a $4.8 billion International
Monetary Fund loan. More than two years after the ouster of
 Hosni Mubarak , Egypt is mired in a polarizing and sometimes
violent battle between supporters and opponents of Islamist
President Mohamed Mursi.  The turmoil hurt revenue from tourism and dried up foreign
investments in local-currency government debt. It has also
disrupted efforts to conclude the IMF loan accord, which
authorities say can unlock more funds in external support.  The central bank raised the deposit rate in March, the
first increase since November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
