The Australian and New Zealand dollars
climbed against most of their major peers after reports in both
nations showed the unemployment rate dropped.  New Zealand’s currency ended a three-day decline versus the
greenback after employers added the most workers on record in
the last quarter. The so-called kiwi recouped a loss from
yesterday that was driven by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme
Wheeler’s comment that the central bank sold the currency and
can do so again to protect growth.  Australia ’s dollar rose
against the yen as traders pared estimates for further cuts to
the nation’s benchmark interest rate.  “There’s a lot of short positioning in the Australian
dollar from the speculative community, so that does make the
exchange rate susceptible to a squeeze,” said Andrew Salter, a
Sydney-based currency strategist at  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , referring to reduction in bearish bets on
the currency. “This employment data is a good catalyst.”  The Australian dollar jumped 0.7 percent to $1.0242 at 4:47
p.m. in Sydney. It gained 0.4 percent to 101.12 yen and was
unchanged at NZ$1.2104. New Zealand’s currency advanced 0.7
percent to 84.63 U.S. cents, after yesterday’s 0.7 percent drop.
It strengthened 0.4 percent to 83.55 yen.  Australia’s employers added 50,100  jobs  in April, more than
the median estimate of 11,000 positions in a Bloomberg News
survey, a statistics bureau report showed today. The
unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent from 5.6 percent in the
previous month.  RBA Outlook  Traders lowered bets on cuts to the benchmark rate in
Australia over a year to 33 basis points from 41 yesterday,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on overnight-index swaps. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens
cut the rate to a record low 2.75 percent on May 7.  Stanley Druckenmiller, who made $1 billion for  George Soros 
as his chief strategist by forcing a devaluation of the British
pound in 1992, said investors should bet against the Aussie.  “We think the Australian dollar will come down and will
come down hard,” Druckenmiller said yesterday at the Sohn
Investment Conference in New York. “It’s expensive.”  The currency has dropped 2.5 percent over the past month,
the worst performance among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The kiwi fell
0.7 percent.  Statistics New Zealand said today that employment surged
1.7 percent, or 38,000 jobs, from the fourth quarter. The median
forecast in a separate Bloomberg survey was for a 0.8 percent
gain. The jobless rate fell to 6.2 percent, lower than the 6.8
percent rate predicted by economists.  ‘Natural Support’  New Zealand’s currency rose as much as 0.6 percent against
the Aussie after its jobs report before paring gains. The
currency touched NZ$1.1958 per Australian dollar on May 7, the
strongest since October 2009.  The Aussie-kiwi cross has “quite a bit of natural support
around that NZ$1.1950 to NZ$1.20 area,” said Tim Kelleher, the
head of institutional foreign-exchange sales at ASB
Institutional, a unit of  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  in
Auckland. “It would struggle to get down through there.”  Kelleher said he would look to sell the kiwi above 85 U.S.
cents.  New Zealand’s two-year  swap rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, rose to 2.84 percent from 2.80 yesterday.  Australia’s three-year bond yield rose six basis points,
the most since March 25, to 2.57 percent. The 10-year  rate 
climbed to 3.16 percent from 3.12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
