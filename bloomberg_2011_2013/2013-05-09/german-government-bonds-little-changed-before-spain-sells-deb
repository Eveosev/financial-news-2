Spanish  government bonds  fell, pushing
10-year yields to the highest level this month, as demand
dropped when the nation sold a combined 4.57 billion euros
($5.99 billion) of securities at an auction.  Longer-maturity debt led declines as investors submitted
bids for 1.62 times the amount of the 13-year bonds sold today,
down from 2.85 times at the previous auction in January. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio also worsened for three- and five-year
notes.  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell to the lowest in three years
last week after the  European Central Bank  cut its main
refinancing rate to boost growth. Italian bonds also declined.  “The market is taking a breather, reflecting the fact that
yields have fallen so much in recent weeks,” said Pablo Zaragoza, a strategist at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in
 Madrid . “There’s a digestion effort, it’s not the market losing
confidence. The auctions were good, the top of the range target
was surpassed and the rates were at lower levels than we have
seen in recent auctions.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 4.19 percent at 4:31 p.m.  London  time,
after rising to 4.21 percent, the highest level since April 29.
The 5.4 percent security maturing in January 2023 fell 0.77, or
7.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 109.495.  The government sold the 13-year bonds at a yield of 4.336
percent, compared with 5.555 percent at the previous auction on
Jan. 10. The three-year notes were allotted at 2.247 percent,
compared with 2.792 percent on April 18, and the five-year yield
dropped to 2.789 percent from 3.257 percent last month.  ‘Funding Continues’  Spain raised 58.1 billion euros from sales of medium- and
long-term debt in the first four months of this year at an
average cost of 2.68 percent, compared with 3.01 percent last
year, the  Economy Ministry  said today in a statement.  “The key thing is that the funding continues and this is
another step toward achieving Spain’s issuance plan,” said
 Orlando Green , a strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “They sold the debt at multi-year
lows in terms of yields and that’s a positive. Yields can
continue to go a bit lower.”  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Austria and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian 10-year bonds dropped for the first time in three
days with the yield rising five basis points to 3.88 percent.  German Bunds  Germany’s bunds were little changed with the 10-year yield
at 1.27 percent after dropping as much as three basis points.
The rate climbed to 1.31 percent on May 7, the highest level
since April 11.  European government bonds have rallied since European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged in July to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the euro and as policy makers
around the world add stimulus to boost growth.  In addition to the ECB, policy makers in  Australia ,  India 
and  South Korea  have all cut interest rates this month. The  Bank
of Japan  said April 18 it plans to purchase more than 7 trillion
yen ($70.5 billion) of bonds.  Irish  two-year yields  dropped to a record 0.742 percent
yesterday, while French 10-year yields fell to an all-time low
1.659 percent on May 2.  ‘Huge Fall’  “There’s been a huge fall in peripheral yields,” said
 John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, speaking on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown”
with  Mark Barton  and Anna Edwards. “We are wary because the
underlying economic data in these economies remain deeply
troubling. There are still deep recessions going on in the
periphery, huge and rising unemployment, and this all spells big
trouble down the road in terms of paying back debt.”  Greek bonds fell after a government report showed
unemployment climbed to a record 27 percent in February as the
recession left more than six in 10 young people out of work.  The 10-year yield climbed eight basis points to 9.65
percent after dropping to 9.44 percent, the lowest since October
2010.  Draghi said at the ECB’s latest policy meeting on May 2
that the “risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro
area continue to be on the downside.” The ECB reiterated that
view in its monthly bulletin today.  Spanish bonds returned 8.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 5.3 percent and German bonds rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
