The head of Lebanon’s militant
Hezbollah movement said  Syria  will supply his group with “game-changing” weapons and his fighters are ready to support any
popular resistance to liberate the  Golan Heights .  Hassan Nasrallah  said Syria has several options to respond
to Israeli strikes in the vicinity of Damascus on May 5,
including sending sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah and opening
the Golan Heights to action by what he termed the popular
resistance.  Israel  has not officially confirmed it was
responsible.  Speaking to supporters in Beirut via video link broadcast
on the group’s Manar TV, Nasrallah said the aim of Israel’s
strikes was to subjugate Syria and prevent his group from
building up its arsenal.  Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the
1967 Middle East war. While there have been no major military
exchanges in the area for decades, Israeli forces have returned
fire in the area several times this year.  Nasrallah said that Syria will give sophisticated arms to
the group, which will be accepted “even if if they are game-changing.” Israel regards Hezbollah as a terrorist organization
and says it won’t allow the group to receive shipments of
advanced weapons.  As many as five Syrian soldiers died in the airstrike, the
Hezbollah leader said. The strike hit a military research center
in Jamraya, northwest of the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
