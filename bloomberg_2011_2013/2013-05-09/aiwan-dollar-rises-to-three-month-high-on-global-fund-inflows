Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in three months as global funds increased
purchases of local shares and on speculation the government will
exempt some stock investors from a capital gains tax.  Overseas investors bought $558 million more Taiwanese
equities than they sold yesterday, the biggest net purchase in
nine months. The  Taiex (TWSE)  index rose 0.4 percent to the highest
level since August 2011. The market may advance more because of
hot money inflows, Marc-Andre Gilbert, a trader in Taipei at KGI
Securities Investment Advisory Co., said in a note to clients
today.  “It’s the flows from easy policy” driving the market
rally, said Jenny Huang, an economist in Taipei at Sinopac
Financial Holdings. “The central bank will likely come in to
keep it around the NT$29.50 level.”  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.5 percent to NT$29.358 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 10:36 a.m., Taipei Forex Inc. prices
show. The currency earlier reached NT$29.341, the strongest
level since Jan. 28. The central bank has sold the currency in
the run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according
to traders who asked not to be identified.  Taiwan may exempt individual investors from a capital gains
tax on stocks, the Commercial Times reported today, without
citing anyone. The government approved the tax in April last
year.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.327 against the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 15 basis
points to 3.73 percent.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 was little changed at 1.198 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices. The yield has climbed three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, since May 3.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
