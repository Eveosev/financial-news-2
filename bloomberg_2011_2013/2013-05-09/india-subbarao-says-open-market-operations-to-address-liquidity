Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao comments on managing cash in the banking system and
interest rates. He spoke to reporters in the northern Indian
city of Srinagar today.  “We do not use forex intervention as a measure of managing
liquidity. Liquidity gets affected as a result of our forex
intervention, whatever that be. Open-market operation is part of
liquidity management. So, as and when necessary we will do open-market operations or other liquidity management measures.”  On liquidity outlook:  “We will manage liquidity, we will ensure that it is
within plus or minus 1 percent of net demand and time
liabilities, subject of course to frictional constraints that we
face. There are uncertainties about liquidity in the system. We
will try to manage that actively.”  On  interest rates :  “You will have to wait for our next policy review. We
cannot speculate or give a view on policy stance in a press
conference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
