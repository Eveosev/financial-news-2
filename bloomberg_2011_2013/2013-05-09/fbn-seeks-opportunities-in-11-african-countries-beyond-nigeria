FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) , owner of Nigeria’s
third-largest bank by market value, is looking for opportunities
to enter 11 other countries in  Africa , said Chief Executive
Officer Bisi Onasanya.  “Essentially we’re looking at West Africa, Francophone and
Anglophone countries,” Onasanya said in an interview today at
the World Economic Forum in Cape Town. “We will never do
greenfields and it has to be in line with our retail banking
strategy,” he said, declining to name the countries.  FBN Holdings, owner of First Bank Nigeria, won’t undertake
any expansion that hurts its plan to “dominate” in its home
market, Onasanya said. The 119-year-old lender, which has more
than 700 branches in Africa and 7 million customers, said
yesterday that it plans to sell a $500 million euro bond this
year to fund loans and help the bank expand.  “A listing elsewhere is part of the medium-term to long-term strategy,” Onasanya said, adding that he met with
representatives of Johannesburg’s stock exchange yesterday.  FBN Holdings has gained 27 percent this year in Lagos
trading, beating the 22 percent increase in the Nigerian SE
Banking Index, which tracks the country’s 10 biggest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
