Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index retreating from a five-year high.
Japan’s Topix Index erased gains as the yen strengthened,
dimming the outlook for the nation’s exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which loses almost $80 million for every 1 yen
Japan’s currency gains against the dollar, fell 1 percent.
 Bridgestone (5108)  Corp., the world’s biggest tire maker, sank 6.6
percent in  Tokyo  after keeping its full-year profit forecast
below analyst estimates. GS Engineering & Construction Corp.
jumped 6.8 percent after the  Bank of Korea  cut  interest rates .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.3 percent to 143.00
as of 6:20 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge increased 11 percent this
year through yesterday amid speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
deploy more measures to beat deflation as policy makers in the
U.S. and Europe remain on standby to buoy growth.  “It’s not surprising that shares slipped a bit after big
gains,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about
$61 billion. “It’d be odd if they didn’t have a correction.”  Shares on the gauge traded at 14.3 times estimated earnings
yesterday compared with 20.7 for the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average,
14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.3 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day  relative strength index , which
measures trading momentum, climbed above the 70 threshold for a
third day, indicating to some traders that shares have risen too
far, too fast. The gauge rose 37 percent this year through
yesterday, making it the best-performing developed market
benchmark equity index in the world.  Shares Inexpensive  “The market may have a correction after rising so steeply,
but valuation-wise you can’t say shares are very expensive,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , a Tokyo-based strategist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$103 billion.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent. The broader  Topix
Index (TPX)  slipped 1.1 percent, retreating from the highest since
September 2008. The Japanese yen climbed as much as 0.4 percent
against the dollar today, paring this week’s decline. A stronger
yen reduces the value of exporters’ earnings when repatriated.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed after a
report showed the nation’s unemployment rate fell in April as
companies hired more workers than analysts estimated. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index also was little changed.  China Inflation  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.6 percent. China’s
consumer prices rose 2.4 percent last month from a year earlier,
while producer prices fell 2.6 percent, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today in Beijing. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
dropped 0.1 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index jumped 1.2 percent after the
nation’s central bank today joined Australia, Europe and India
in cutting interest rates. Taiwan’s Taiex Index added 0.2
percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index climbed 0.6 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped 0.1 percent today. The
gauge yesterday climbed 0.4 percent, a fifth day of gains, as
earnings forecasts from Whole Foods Market Inc. and Electronic
Arts Inc. beat estimates.  Japanese exporters fell. Canon, the world’s biggest camera
maker, slipped 1 percent to 3,470 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, fell 1.4 percent to 5,760, erasing
gains of as much as 2.2 percent. Honda Motor Co. dropped 1.3
percent to 3,930 yen.  Bridgestone, Sumitomo  Bridgestone declined 6.6 percent to 3,475 yen. The company
said yesterday it expects full-year net income will increase 37
percent to 235 billion yen. That compares with the 254 billion
yen average estimate by 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. (6302)  slumped 11 percent to 409
yen, the most on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The Japanese
shipbuilder said net income for the year ending March 2014 will
more than double to 14 billion yen, missing the 17.6 billion yen
average estimate by eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Of the 312 companies that reported earnings since the
beginning of April and for which estimates are available, 52
percent exceeded expectations, while 48 percent fell short,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that advanced,  News Corp. (NWSA)  climbed 2.9 percent
to A$32.47 in Sydney after saying third-quarter net income
tripled to $2.85 billion on higher licensing fees for cable
networks such as  Fox News . Profit at the Rupert Murdoch-led
media company was 36 cents a share excluding some items, versus
the 35 cents average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  South Korean builders gained. GS Engineering jumped 6.8
percent to 32,800 won.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. (000720) ,
the nation’s biggest construction company, rose 3.2 percent to
62,000 won. Samsung Engineering Co. increased 5.9 percent to
102,000 won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
