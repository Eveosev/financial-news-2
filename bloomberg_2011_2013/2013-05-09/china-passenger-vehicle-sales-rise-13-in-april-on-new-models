China ’s passenger-vehicle sales rose
13 percent in April on rising demand for new models in the
world’s biggest vehicle market.  Wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport-utility vehicles climbed to 1.44 million units in April,
according to the state-backed China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers. Five analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  had a
median estimate of 1.404 million units.  Automakers such as  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  are
adding new models in China on expectation that a rising  urban
population , which has grown an average of about 4 percent
annually in the past two decades, will spur demand for cars.
Passenger-vehicle demand has surged by an average of 25 percent
since 2006, according to  Kevin Tynan , an auto analyst for
Bloomberg Industries.  “The strong momentum in small sedan and SUV segments,
which have been driving auto sales year-to-date, will
continue,” Hou Yankun and Ming Xu, Hong Kong-based analysts at
UBS AG, wrote in a note to clients. “Retail pricing remains
largely stable for the mass market in April, despite being in
the slack season of passenger vehicle consumption.”  Total sales of  vehicles , including buses and trucks, gained
13 percent to 1.84 million units last month, the association
said.  For the first four months of the year, auto sales gained 16
percent to 5.86 million units, CAAM said.  Commercial vehicle sales rose 15 percent to 400,300 units
in April.  SUVs Surge  Sales of SUVs, the fastest-growing segment last year,
continued their gains, surging 46 percent to 228,000 units.
Sedan deliveries gained 10 percent to 977,000 vehicles.  Volkswagen’s Lavida was the best-selling sedan last month,
while  Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) ’s Haval remained the nation’s top-selling SUV.  Among the companies seeing the biggest increase,  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  deliveries gained 37 percent to 75,331 units.  GM, the biggest foreign automaker in the world’s second-biggest economy, posted a 15 percent increase in China
deliveries last month, helped by record Cadillac sales. Cadillac
sales surged 99 percent to a record 4,077 units, helped by the
recently-introduced XTS model.  The Detroit-based automaker, vying with Volkswagen AG for
the lead among foreign automakers in the world’s largest auto
market, continued to woo buyers away from Japanese brands.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
