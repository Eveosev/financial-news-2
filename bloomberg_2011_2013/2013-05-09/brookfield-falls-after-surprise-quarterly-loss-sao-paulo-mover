Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) , the
worst-performing Brazilian homebuilder in 2013, tumbled to a
four-year low after posting an unexpected loss for a second
consecutive quarter.  The shares  sank 3.3 percent to 2.03 reais at 12:37 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the lowest since April 2009. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  equity
benchmark gained 0.2 percent.  Brookfield’s adjusted  net loss  was 47.7 million reais
($23.8 million) in the three months through March, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg after the company released its
earnings report late yesterday. The average estimate of six
analysts was for a profit of 27.5 million-reais.  The quarterly results were “disappointing” and hampered
by “problems in the construction of some projects, which caused
an extra cost of 10.4 million reais,” the Rio de Janeiro-based
homebuilder said in a regulatory filing. The company posted an
adjusted net loss of 419 million reais in the fourth quarter of
2012 while analysts had forecast a 59.6 million-real profit,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brookfield slumped 41 percent this year, the worst
performance on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index, which slid 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
