Copper fell by the most in a week as a
larger-than-expected retreat in  China ’s producer prices
indicated weaker demand from the largest user. Aluminum, lead,
zinc, nickel and tin also declined.  Copper for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.2
percent, the most since May 1, to $7,330 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange and was at $7,345.25 at 1:14 p.m. in
 Shanghai . The metal climbed as much as 3 percent yesterday to
$7,480 a ton, the highest since April 12.  China’s producer prices fell 2.6 percent in April from a
year ago, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed
today. That compared with a 2.3 percent drop in a Bloomberg News
survey and a 1.9 percent decline in March.  “PPI fell below expectations, indicating that relatively
weak growth momentum may last longer than expected,” Lian Zheng,
an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“Technically, copper is also facing strong resistance at
$7,500.”  Stockpiles in bonded warehouses in Shanghai may have fallen
to 650,000 tons, the lowest since September, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange slid 0.3 percent to 52,920  yuan  ($8,268) a ton, while
copper for July delivery on the Comex dropped 1 percent to
$3.3375 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
