Corporate earnings are likely to rise
long enough to send the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a record
after accounting for inflation, according to Michael T. Darda,
MKM Partners LLC’s chief economist and chief market strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the  S&P 500  has yet to
surpass its two previous peaks on an inflation-adjusted basis
even after setting records in the past six weeks. The so-called
real values were based on the  consumer price index , as compiled
by the Labor Department.  The real record for the S&P 500 was set in March 2000, and
the index would have to rise 28 percent from yesterday’s close
to surpass that high. A 7 percent advance would lift the U.S.
stock gauge above its peak in October 2007.  “The S&P 500 should have a solid shot at reaching an all-time high in real terms,” Darda wrote yesterday in a report.
Several years of earnings growth lie ahead, he wrote, because of
the availability of workers and the  Federal Reserve ’s efforts to
bolster the economy through monetary policy.  Last month’s unemployment rate of 7.5 percent was higher
than in nine years when profit margins peaked since World War
II, according to data cited in the report. Consumer prices for
the 12 months ended in March increased 1.5 percent, less than
the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.  “The labor market remains loose and the Fed is trying to
support the business cycle instead of leaning against it,” the
New York-based strategist wrote. The opposite would have to be
true before margins fall and stocks follow suit, in his view.  To contact the reporter on this story:
