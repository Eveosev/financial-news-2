South Korean  stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark  index  to a five-week high, after the  Bank of Korea 
joined central banks in  Australia , Europe and India in cutting
 interest rates  this month to boost growth.  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  climbed 6.8 percent,
leading building companies higher. Mirae Asset Securities Co.
advanced 2.2 percent. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. paced gains
among the nation’s shipyards, rising 7.6 percent amid
speculation the company’s earnings will improve in the second
half of the year.  The  Kospi index  rose 1.2 percent to 1,979.45 at the close
on the  Korea  Exchange, the highest since April 3. The central
bank lowered the benchmark  seven-day repurchase rate  to 2.5
percent from 2.75 percent, a move that was predicted by six of
20 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Ruling New Frontier
Party floor leader Lee Hahn Koo yesterday urged a “more active
role” for the bank, adding to political pressure for a cut.  “The market has been waiting for the cut for a long time,
and it seems the central bank and the government are now working
on policy coordination, which is a positive signal,” Kim Jae Dong, a  fund manager  at Baring Asset Management Korea Ltd. in
 Seoul , said by phone today. “The reduction would improve
domestic consumption.”  The 33-member Kospi Construction Index rallied 3.4 percent,
the biggest gain since Dec. 20. It was the  best performer  among
the Kospi’s 19 industry groups.  Domestic institutions purchased a net 189 billion won ($173
million) of stocks today, while foreign investors bought a 134
billion won, according to Korea Exchange data.  The Kospi has lost 0.9 percent this year, compared with a
0.7 percent gain by the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The South
Korean gauge trades at 9.1  times  12-month projected profit,
compared with the MSCI gauge’s 10.6 times, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
