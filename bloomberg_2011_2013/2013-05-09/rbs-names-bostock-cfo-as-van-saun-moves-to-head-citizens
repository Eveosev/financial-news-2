Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  named
Nathan Bostock as finance director to replace Bruce Van Saun,
who is moving to run Citizens Financial Group Inc. as the
British lender prepares to sell a stake in the U.S. division.  Bostock’s deputy David Stephen will become chief risk
officer, the Edinburgh-based bank said in a statement today. Van
Saun, 55, replaces Ellen Alemany who is retiring after more than
five years at the Rhode Island-based consumer lender. The
appointments take effect on Oct. 1.  Britain’s biggest government-owned bank said in February it
plans to sell a 25 percent stake in Citizens in the next two
years after coming under pressure from regulators to boost
capital. Van Saun joined RBS in October 2009, after RBS received
45.5 billion pounds ($70.6 billion) in the biggest banking
bailout in the world in 2008 and 2009. RBS has since shrunk the
bank’s balance sheet by more than 900 billion pounds.  Bostock, 52, joined RBS in June 2009 from Banco Santander
SA’s U.K. unit where he was chief financial officer. He was
named head of wholesale banking at  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in
July 2011. Four months later, he decided to remain at RBS.  Before joining RBS, Van Saun was CFO at Bank of  New York 
Mellon Corp. He held the same position at Deutsche Bank AG’s
U.S. division.  Citizens, which RBS bought in 1988, had revenue of about
$3.1 billion in 2012, accounting for about 12 percent of the
British bank’s total. Alemany was the highest-paid employee
below board level, earning 4.78 million pounds in 2012, a person
familiar with the matter said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
