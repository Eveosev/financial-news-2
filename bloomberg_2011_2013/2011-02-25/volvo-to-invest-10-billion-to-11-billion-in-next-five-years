Volvo Cars, the Swedish automaker
acquired by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., plans to invest as
much as $11 billion worldwide over the next five years to tap
rising demand in markets including  China .  Volvo is also working to win government orders and is
considering making cars in China for export, Chief Executive
Officer  Stefan Jacoby  said today in an interview in Beijing.  “It is obvious that at some point manufacturers will
export from China,” Jacoby said. “We, as a global premium
brand with European heritage, have a very good opportunity to be
owned by a Chinese enterprise and to utilize our manufacturing
capacities here.”  Premium marques including Volvo, Audi AG and  Daimler AG  are
expanding in China, the world’s biggest automobile market and
second-largest economy, as rising incomes and economic growth
boost spending. The Swedish brand, whose chief executive
presented its China strategy this afternoon in Beijing alongside
Geely Chairman Li Shufu, is counting on increasing Chinese
demand to help double sales to 800,000 vehicles in 10 years.  Shares in  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd ., the group’s Hong
Kong-listed unit, were unchanged at HK$3.30 as of 3:12 p.m.
local time. The stock has lost 2.9 percent in 2011.  Discount Effect  “There is no doubt about the super importance of the
Chinese market to Volvo,” said Yu Bing, an analyst with Pingan
Securities Co. in Shenzhen. “The vital question lies with
whether Volvo would be able to avoid any discounts in its
brand’s premium value because of the takeover by a Chinese
homegrown carmaker.”  Volvo, which  Ford Motor Co . sold to Zhejiang Geely in
August for $1.5 billion, aims to sell 200,000 cars in China by
2015, up from 30,522 in 2010, Jacoby said today. Volvo also
plans to increase its dealers in China to more than 220 by 2015
from the current 106, according to the company.  The carmaker is working to increase sales to the central
and local governments in China, Jacoby said.  “Being owned by a Chinese enterprise offers us additional
opportunities in getting into the government fleet business,”
he said.  Volvo will invest in a new plant in the city of  Chengdu ,
southwestern China, and will continue to consider setting up a
plant in Daqing in northeastern China, the company said.  Shanghai  will serve as Volvo’s China headquarters and center for
product development, design and sourcing.  Geely produced its first car, a subcompact, in 1997 and was
the eighth-biggest automaker in China last year.  Economic growth and government incentives boosted China’s
vehicle sales 32 percent to 18.1 million in 2010, making the
nation the world’s largest auto market for a second year.  Volvo’s main rivals boosted their China sales last year.  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi sold 227,938 cars in China, up 43 percent
from 2009. Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz more than doubled sales to
148,400, while Bayerische Motoren Werke AG sold 168,998 units,
an 87 percent gain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
