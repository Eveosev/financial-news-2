  Getin Holding SA  gained the most in
a week after the Polish financial-services company controlled by
billionaire Leszek Czarnecki said 2010 profit rose as higher
revenue on loans more than offset an increase in provisions.  Getin shares rose 0.31 zloty, or 2.5 percent, to 12.88
zloty as of 9:13 a.m. in Warsaw. It was the steepest advance
since Feb. 17. The net income advanced to 421.1 million zloty
($146.3 million) from 276 million zloty, the Warsaw-based
company said in a regulatory statement today. That beat the
320.7 million-zloty mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
