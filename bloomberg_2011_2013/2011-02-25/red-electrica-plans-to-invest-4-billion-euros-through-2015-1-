Red Electrica Corp. SA, the manager
of  Spain ’s power grid, plans to invest 4 billion euros ($5.5
billion) through 2015 as it extends and upgrades the
distribution network.  The company aims to report annual growth in earnings per
share of more than 12 percent in the medium term, according to a
presentation posted on Madrid-based Red Electrica’s website.  Full-year net income climbed 18 percent to 390 million
euros after it invested in the network and started operating
more assets. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 19 percent to 1 billion euros in 2010.  The company earns a fixed return on investments to operate
and maintain the Spanish high-voltage grid. Power demand in
Spain has revived after a 4.6 percent slump in 2009, and Red
Electrica estimates it will increase about 2 percent a year in
the medium term.  Investment in 2010 totaled 2.31 billion euros, up from 759
million euros in 2009, Red Electrica said. Net debt rose to 4.76
billion euros in December from 3.12 billion euros a year
earlier.  Since July 1, Red Electrica has announced the purchase of
Spanish electricity transportation assets from utilities EDP-
Energias de Portugal SA, Gas Natural SDG SA and  Endesa SA .  The company’s shares rose 1.9 percent to 38.47 euros as of
1:42 p.m. in  Madrid . Red Electrica has advanced 9.3 percent this
year, increasing its market value to 5.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
