  Gulf Coast  gasoline rose versus
futures after  Valero Energy Corp . shut a 90,000-barrel-a-day
catalytic cracker for maintenance.  The unit will be converted “to traditional fluid catalytic
cracker technology, which will enhance its reliability,” Bill Day, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The work is
expected to last 56 days.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2 cents to 15.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:02 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, rose from parity
to futures to a premium of 0.13 cent a gallon.    ConocoPhillips ’s Ponca City,  Oklahoma , refinery had
mechanical problems Feb. 23 in fluid catalytic cracker No. 4,
according to state regulators.  The unit appears to have been shut, Skylar McElhaney, a
spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Environmental
Quality, said in an e-mail. She couldn’t confirm whether it was
returned to service.  ConocoPhillips does not comment on day-to-day operations or
regulatory filings, Rich Johnson, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail yesterday.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline in New York Harbor widened
its discount 0.03 cent to 2.13 cents gallon.  The differential for jet fuel versus Nymex heating oil
futures slipped 0.5 cent to a premium of 17 cents a gallon.
Yesterday, the fuel reached its highest level at the hub since
Oct. 13, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
