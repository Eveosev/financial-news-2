Ethanol futures soared to a 31-month
high in Chicago as corn gained on higher export demand and on
speculation that unrest in northern  Africa  and the Middle East
will disrupt crude oil shipments.  The grain-based additive climbed to the highest level since
July 2008 after an Agriculture Department report showed corn
export sales last week were 67 percent higher than the prior
four-week average. The biofuel also gained with crude oil and
gasoline on concern unrest in  Libya  will affect other oil-
producing nations.  “Nobody wants to be short going into the weekend because
anything can happen,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in
Chicago. “Lots of things going on with corn, with the global
situation in the Middle East.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery jumped 5.8 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $2.544 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures are 49 percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.47 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive increased 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.525, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.585 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel advanced 4
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.575.  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 2.28 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.7395 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn futures for May delivery jumped 25.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to close at $7.22 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the CBOT,
the biggest gain since Jan. 12. Earlier, the most-active
contract jumped by the exchange limit of 30 cents. On Feb. 22,
the grain reached a 31-month high at $7.4425.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 7 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 1 cent on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
