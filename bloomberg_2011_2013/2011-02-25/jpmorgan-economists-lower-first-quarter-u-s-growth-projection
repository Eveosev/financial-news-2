  JPMorgan Chase & Co . revised down
its first-quarter growth estimate for the  U.S. economy  to an
annual rate of 3.5 percent from a prior forecast of 4 percent,
according to chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli.  “Consumers stumbled a bit to start the year,” Feroli
wrote in a note e-mailed to clients today. “The recent rise in
energy prices poses a notable headwind.”  The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent rate in the fourth
quarter, less than the earlier estimate of 3.2 percent as state
and local government spending declined, the Commerce Department
reported earlier today. Consumer spending grew at a 4.1 percent
rate, compared with a prior estimate of 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
