South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said he is looking to private industry to create
more jobs and reduce inequality, which is a risk to stability in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  “If you want stability in our country and if you want
growth in our country then people need money in their pockets,”
Gordhan told business leaders in Johannesburg today.
“Inequality is not sustainable. We’re not talking about
charity, we’re talking about self-interest.”  The  unemployment rate  fell to 24 percent in the fourth
quarter from 25.3 percent in the previous three months, mainly
due to an increase in jobs in the public sector.  South Africa 
needs 7 percent growth a year for two decades to continue to
slash unemployment, Gordhan said.  Growth will probably reach 3.4 percent this year, down from
an October forecast of 3.5 percent, and accelerate to 4.1
percent in 2012, according to the budget announced on Feb. 23.  South Africa’s Gini coefficient, a measure of  income
inequality , is 0.68, one of the highest in the world. The
coefficient measures inequality in a range from zero to 1, with
zero referring to total equality.  Gordhan’s national budget for the fiscal year through March
2012 detailed plans for a 9 billion-rand ($1.3-billion) jobs
fund, 5 billion rand to subsidize wages for young people and 73
billion rand that will be spent by departments on state building
projects.  A lack of skills remains “one of our biggest
impediments,” to jobs growth, Gordhan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
