Ukraine posted a current-account
surplus in January for the first time in six months as global
demand revived for the nation’s exports of metals and chemical
products, the central bank said.  The surplus reached $282 million last month, compared with
an $815 million deficit in December, as exports jumped 54
percent, the Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy in Kiev said today on its
 website . The current account is the broadest measure of
international trade, tracking goods, services and investment
income.  The Eastern European nation returned to growth last year
after slumping 14.8 percent in 2009 as the financial crisis
eroded demand for Ukraine’s commodity exports and its currency
slumped. The economy expanded an annual 6 percent in January,
according to the central bank.  Imports rose 56 percent last month as the country purchased
more natural gas from  Russia , the bank said. The increase in
import volume was offset by the declining price of the fuel as
the gas imports more than doubled. Demand for cars and equipment
also spurred imports, according to the central bank.  Foreign direct investment surged 39 percent in January from
the same month a year ago to $230 million, the bank said in the
same statement.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Balazs Penz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
