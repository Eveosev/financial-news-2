Rajeev Jyoti, head of Indian
transportation at Bombadier Inc., comments on the Indian
Railways’ annual budget, released today by Minister Mamata Banerjee. She said the $12.7 billion plan outlay for the year
starting April 1 will promote private industry participation
through public-private partnerships.  Banerjee’s plans include setting up bridge, metro coach and
locomotive factories in the South Asian nation. Jyoti spoke to
reporters in  New Delhi  today.  “This year’s budget was unveiled with a great deal of
caution. Many projects were announced without details of how
they will be financed, so we are not entirely sure how we will
fit in.  “Obviously, if you are cautious, you will tend to be
slightly slow. We will have to play a bit of a waiting game
before completely understanding how the PPP picture will move
forward and how we can go about winning projects.”  On project delays:  “These are not short-term projects. They are need-based
projects over the long-term. By delaying these projects, as we
have seen in the past, you can be an impediment in the Indian
economy and GDP growth. Sitting as a CEO of a multinational
company that is the biggest challenge: how do we keep ourselves
engaged.”  “The good news is that these policies and projects are
being announced rapidly and with strong rigor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
