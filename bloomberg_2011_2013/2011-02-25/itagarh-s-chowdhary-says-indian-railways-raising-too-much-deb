J. P. Chowdhary, chairman of  Titagarh Wagons Ltd . comments on the Indian Railways’ budget
released today by Minister Mamata Banerjee.  The $12.7 billion budget plan outlay involves doubling of
borrowing to $4.5 billion in the year starting April 1.
Additional investment will come through private industry
participation through public-private partnerships. Chowdhary
spoke to reporters in New Delhi.  Titagarh Wagons tumbled 13 percent, the most in 19 months,
to 332.55 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai.
The benchmark Sensitive Index rose 0.4 percent.  “There’s too much emphasis on borrowing. She needs to take
advantage of the eagerness of the industry and resolve  India ’s
financial constraints by engaging in PPPs instead of taking on
further debt.  “The emphasis she has given on PPP projects by announcing
a mechanism for single window clearance is very welcome. We feel
that there will be a lot of progress in this direction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
