  SABMiller Plc , the world’s second-
largest brewer by volume, plans to build a $100 million brewery
in  Nigeria ’s southeastern city of Onitsha within two years, an
official said.  “The timing is right to capitalize on our company’s growth
potential by expanding our footprints in  Nigeria ,” Simon Hawad,
the brewer’s strategy development director for  Africa , told
reporters today in Onitsha, about 600 kilometers (375 miles)
east of the country’s economic capital, Lagos. “We’re therefore
confident the benefits will be significant.”  Africa’s most populous country, with more than 140 million
people, is potentially the continent’s largest consumer market.
SABMiller, which has brewing or beverage interests in 32 African
countries, entered the Nigerian market in 2009 with the purchase
of controlling interests in Pabod Breweries, based in the
southern oil hub of  Port Harcourt .  The London-based company will compete in Africa’s second-
biggest beer market with rivals including Diageo Plc, which has
sold more Guinness in Nigeria than in the beer’s native Ireland
since 2007, and Heineken BV, which controls Nigeria Breweries
Plc, the country’s biggest brewer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
