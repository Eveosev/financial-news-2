Oil dropped for a second day in New
York after assurances by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the  International Energy Agency  that they can compensate for any
disruption of Libyan shipments.  Futures for April delivery declined as much as 67 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $96.61 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract yesterday surged to
$103.41, the highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008 amid
estimates that as much as two-thirds of Libyaâ€™s oil production
is cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
