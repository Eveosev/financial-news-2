Vietnamese bonds had the biggest
weekly drop since November after inflation accelerated to a two-
year high in February, raising speculation the central bank will
further increase  interest rates . The dong gained.  Consumer prices rose 12.31 percent from a year earlier, the
fastest pace since February 2009, data from the General
Statistics Office showed on Feb. 23. The  State Bank  of  Vietnam 
lifted its seven-day reverse repurchase rate, or what it charges
commercial banks in daily open-market operations, to 12 percent
from 11 percent on Feb. 22.  “Rising prices have created pressure on the government to
curb inflation through monetary policy tightening,” said Pham
Minh Hoang, a fixed-income dealer at Hanoi-based Ocean
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “Higher interest rates would push
up bond yields.”  The yield on five-year bonds climbed 12 basis points this
week, the biggest advance since the five days ended Nov. 12, to
11.58 percent as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The government has cut its credit-growth target and ordered
ministries to narrow the  budget deficit  as the country seeks to
curb inflation, according to an official resolution approved
yesterday. The impact of the dong devaluation and the increase
in fuel and electricity prices will raise the inflation rate by
2 percentage points, Finance Minister Vu Van Ninh said yesterday.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,870 per dollar this week,
the most since the period ended Oct. 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It traded between 21,960 and 22,080 at
gold shops in  Ho Chi Minh City , compared with 21,920 to 22,050
yesterday, according to a telephone-directory information
service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  The central bank set the daily  reference rate  at 20,683,
unchanged for a second day. The currency is allowed to trade up
to 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
