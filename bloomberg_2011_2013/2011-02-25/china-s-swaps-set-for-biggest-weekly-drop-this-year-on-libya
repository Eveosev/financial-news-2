  China ’s interest-rate swaps dropped
the most this week since December as political instability in
the Middle East pushed up  oil prices , raising concern the global
economic recovery will slow.  The one-year swap, the fixed cost needed to receive the
floating seven-day repurchase rate, slid 21 basis points to 3.72
percent as of 11:31 a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest weekly decline
since Dec. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Crude
reached a two-year peak yesterday as escalating unrest in  Libya ,
which holds the largest proven oil reserves in  Africa ,
threatened to disrupt supplies of the commodity.  “The market is still choppy and is in a flight-to-quality
mood,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “People are worried about the
development of oil prices, they’re buying U.S. dollars as a
safe-haven bid.”  The seven-day repo rate, a gauge of the availability of
funds, dropped for a third day. It fell 29 basis points to 3.11
percent, according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank
Funding Center published at 11 a.m. in Shanghai. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Crude dropped 0.2 percent to $97.11 a barrel, retreating
from $103.41 reached yesterday, the highest level since
September 2008. China imported 54 percent of the oil it used in
2010, industry data show.    China Petroleum & Chemical Corp ., the nation’s second-
biggest crude producer, yesterday completed the sale of 23
billion yuan ($3.5 billion) of six-year bonds convertible into
equity. Pressure from the issuance seems to be dissipating,
freeing up funds again, said Chong.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 rose for the first time in four days. The rate
climbed six basis points to 3.97 percent, according to Chinabond,
the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
