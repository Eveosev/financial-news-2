Cameroon  may increase cotton output
by as much as 35 percent this season by using higher yielding
strains and improving agricultural techniques, according to
Sodecoton, the state-owned producer.  “We intend to produce at least 39,000 metric tons more of
the crop,” Ibrahim Ngamie, director of agricultural production,
said in an interview today in the capital, Yaounde. That would
boost output of the fiber to about 150,000 tons, up from 111,000
tons last year, he said.  Cotton, mostly grown by about 227,500 small-scale farmers
in the north of the country, is Cameroon’s fifth-largest foreign
exchange earner, according to the government. The West African
nation plans to boost output by reorganizing the industry,
training farmers and increasing the use of more resistant and
higher-yielding crop strains.  Cameroon’s annual output four years ago was nearer 300,000
tons, according to Iya Mohammed, Sodecoton’s general manager.  Sodecoton, Cameroon’s only cotton company, is 59 percent-
owned by the government, while the rest is held by the Compagnie
Francaise de Developement du Textile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
