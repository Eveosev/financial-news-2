Metallurgical coal prices on the
U.S. spot market decreased on scarce trading prior to the
settlement of negotiations on the quarterly benchmark contract,
Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal slumped $12.92,
or 4 percent, to $308.33 a ton in the week ended today,
according to the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-
volatility coal dropped $27.50, or 9.6 percent, to $260.  “Spot activity remains sparse, but the terminals are
bustling with export business booked earlier,” Energy
Publishing said.  UBS AG said Feb. 21 that BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, may offer discounted prices for its
metallurgical coal to Japanese steelmakers as it seeks to
transition to monthly contracts from quarterly.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
