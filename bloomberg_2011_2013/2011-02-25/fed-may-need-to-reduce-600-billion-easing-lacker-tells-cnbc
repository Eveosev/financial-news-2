Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President Jeffrey Lacker said an early end to the central bank’s
plan to purchase $600 billion in  Treasury securities  may be
needed to limit inflation pressures.  “The improvement in the growth outlook has been noticeable
enough to tilt the case further against QE2,” Lacker said today
in a CNBC television interview, referring to the second round of
so-called quantitative easing. “To my mind, it was a close call
to begin with.”  Lacker also said in the interview that rising oil and
commodities prices pose a risk to inflation later in the year as
companies seek to recoup the costs.  “As long as inflation expectations are managed pretty
well, I think we’re going to get through this without a big
burst of inflation,” he told CNBC.  The Richmond Fed leader, St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  and Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  have
urged the central bank to review its plan to purchase $600
billion in U.S. Treasuries in light of a strengthening economy
and concern over potential inflation. Dallas Fed’s  Richard Fisher  has said he may oppose any additional easing after the
purchases conclude in June as planned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
