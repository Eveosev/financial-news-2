Higher energy costs may “impact”
coffee production in  Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of
robusta beans, Hamburg-based coffee broker Eugen Atte GmbH said
in a report.  Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance raised petroleum prices today
and electricity prices will go up by an average 15 percent
starting March 1, according to Hoang Quoc Vuong, deputy minister
of trade and industry. Vietnam’s coffee production was hampered
this year after rains delayed the harvest.  There will be “additional impact on production and
irrigation as farmers will have higher costs,” Atte said in the
report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
