  Bank of America Corp . said a
bondholder group pressuring the lender to repurchase soured
mortgages has almost doubled the number of securitizations on
which it is challenging the company.  There are 225 securitizations in dispute with the group,
compared with 115 as of Oct. 18, the Charlotte, North Carolina-
based bank said today in a regulatory filing. In October, the
dispute covered about $46 billion in bonds.  The group includes Pacific Investment Management Co.,
BlackRock Inc. and the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York , people
familiar with the matter said in October. The group said then in
a letter that the bank failed in its role as a loan servicer to
provide required notice of faults in the underlying mortgages.  “There are a number of questions about the validity of the
assertions set forth in the letter, including whether these
purported investors have standing to bring these claims,” Bank
of America said in today’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
