Widely spread throughout the world,
the swastika has been around for at least 10,000 years as an
auspicious symbol, often associated with the power of the sun.
Hitler appropriated it as the official emblem of the Nazi Party
on Aug. 7, 1920.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In the 1870s, Volk movements began idealizing the racial
purity of their Teutonic forebears and worshipping the sun,
believing it was “the sole God of true Germans.”  At the same time, the swastika gained popularity after
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann found multiple instances of
the hooked cross when digging out Troy.  After World War I, anti-Semitic and militaristic groups
adopted the swastika as their central symbol, until Hitler
finally chose it for the Nazis.  When  Charlie Chaplin  -- as Adenoid Hynkel of Tomania --
skewered Hitler in his prescient 1940s film “The Great
Dictator,” he sat underneath two black crosses inside a radiant
circle. This represented the party of the “Sons and Daughters
of the Double Cross.”  I spoke with Richard Cohen, author of “ Chasing the Sun :
The Epic Story of the Star That Gives Us Life,” on the
following topics:  1. Sunspot Cycles  2. Eyes of Artists  3. Sovereign Symbolism  4. Solar Deities  5. Getting Tan  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
