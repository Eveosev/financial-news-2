Lithuania is in talks with Japan
about cooperation on nuclear energy after  Korea Electric Power
Corp . withdrew a bid to build an atomic facility last year.  Energy Vice Minister Arvydas Darulis held discussions today
with his counterpart, Yoshikatsu Nakayama, in Tokyo today about
nuclear power, renewable energy and technologies to increase
efficiency, he said after the meeting.  Japan “has very high standard of nuclear safety” that
would allow Lithuania to meet environmental commitments required
by the European Union, Darulis said.  Korea Electric Power,  South Korea ’s biggest electricity
producer, withdrew a proposal for a nuclear plant in Lithuania
two weeks after submitting a financially “attractive” offer,
Deputy Energy Minister Romas Svedas said on Dec. 3. Lithuania is
looking for an investor to build the plant by 2020 through
direct negotiations, Svedas said at the time.    Lithuania  plans to replace its Soviet-built Ignalina
facility, which was shut last year to comply with European Union
commitments.  “European Union has very high standards of CO2 emissions,
very high standard of environmental policy,” Darulis said. “In
order to reach these ambitious targets, we need technologies. We
need high technologies. And these technologies are what we
believe are here in Japan.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
