Kenya Power and Lighting Ltd., the
East African nation’s monopoly electricity distributor, said
first-half profit rose 16 percent as power sales increased.  Net income for the six months through December advanced to
2.2 billion shillings ($27 million), or 2.2 shillings a share,
from 1.9 billion shillings, or 1.97 shillings a share, the
Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Electricity sales jumped 8 percent to 20.6 billion
shillings in the period. Total revenue declined 17 percent to
31.1 billion shillings as the company reduced collection of the
fuel cost-recovery charge after two-year drought ended in 2010.
The charge allows the company to retrieve the increasing cost of
using emergency diesel-power generators, when levels at
hydroelectric dams, the country’s main source of installed
capacity, are reduced because of low rainfall.  The company declared a dividend of 35 cents for the period,
down from 38 cents a year earlier, the statement said.  The stock erased an earlier gain of as much as 2.2 percent,
or 50 cents, and closed unchanged at 22.5 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
