Rwandan production of tea, the
African nation’s second-largest export crop, may jump 18 percent
to 26,000 metric tons this season as new plantations produce
more of the leaf, according to Anthony Butera, director general
of the  Rwandan Tea Authority .  “Our target this year is based on harvesting more from the
new gardens,” he said by phone today from the Kenyan port city
of  Mombasa . Of last year’s 22,000 tons of production, only 600
hectares (1,480 acres) were harvested from the combined 2,700
hectares of new plantations, he said.  “If nothing bad happens and the weather is okay, we should
achieve our target,” Butera said.  Rwanda is rebuilding its economy after the nation suffered
a genocide that left 800,000 people dead following a 100-day
slaughter in 1994. The East African country plans to boost
earnings from tea exports to $90 million by 2015, from about $56
million last year, according to the government.  The nation is also selling tea plantations to private
companies and developing new ones in an effort to boost output.  Rwanda ’s government recently sold Gisovu Tea Co. to U.K-based
Boreli Tea Holdings Ltd. as part of this program, Butera said.  The Rwanda Development Board has also received expressions
of interest from at least four Indian companies for another five
tea plantations put up for sale by the government, the
organization has said.  The sale of the farms is worth an estimated 6.6 billion
Rwandan francs ($11 million), Daniel Ufitikirezi, head of asset
and business management at the Kigali-based board, said on Feb.
14. The plantations cover about 2,316 hectares, according to the
board. Coffee is Rwanda’s largest export crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
