Turkish gasoline prices, the highest
in the world, may climb about 25 percent due to the rising cost
of oil as a result of unrest in North Africa,  Dunya  reported,
citing the head of a fuel retailers association.  The price of gasoline may rise to 5 liras ($3) a liter by
summer, the newspaper said, citing Mehmet Sukuroglu, head of the
Istanbul-based Fuel Distributors Association of  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
