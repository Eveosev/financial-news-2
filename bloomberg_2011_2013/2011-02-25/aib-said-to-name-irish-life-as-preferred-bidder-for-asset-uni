  Allied Irish Banks Plc  chose
Irish Life & Permanent Plc as preferred bidder for its
investment unit, according to three people familiar with the
situation.  Dublin-based Irish Life Investment Managers, the biggest  fund manager  in the country, is in exclusive talks to buy  AIB
Investment Managers , also known as AIBIM, according to the
people, who declined to comment because the process is not yet
complete. The unit has  8.5 billion euros  ($11.7 billion) of
assets under management, according to its web site.  Allied Irish is selling assets to raise capital as the
country’s banks struggle with mounting loan losses following the
collapse in 2008 of a decade-long real-estate boom. The
government is taking a 93 percent stake in the lender after
injecting 3.7 billion euros into the bank in December.  Bidders had offered as much as 25 million euros for the
business, according to two people.  Bellevue Group AG, the Swiss asset manager, and Irish
securities firm Bloxham, had also offered to buy AIBIM, a person
said on Jan. 14. Dublin-based  Goodbody Stockbrokers  is handling
the sale for Allied Irish.  Allied Irish spokeswoman Catherine Burke and Irish Life
spokesman Ray Gordon declined to comment, while Goodbody
spokesman Gerry O’Sullivan was not immediately available for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
