Russian foreign direct investment
dropped an annual 13 percent to $13.8 billion last year as the
economy was slow to recover from its record contraction in 2009.  Overall foreign investment, including credits and flows
into the securities markets, advanced 40 percent from a year
earlier to $114.7 billion, the Moscow-based  Federal Statistics
Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gross domestic product grew 4 percent in 2010 after
shrinking 7.8 percent a year earlier. The world’s biggest energy
supplier needs “new sources of economic growth” to achieve GDP
expansion “substantially” above 6 to 7 percent, Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin said on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
