  Romania  signed oil exploration
agreements with seven companies including Audax Resources Ltd.,
OAO Lukoil and Vanco International for eight blocks in the
country, according to the National Agency for  Mineral Resources .  The eastern European country completed yesterday the
agreements for the onshore and offshore exploration blocks
awarded with 12 others last year, the agency said in a  statement
on its website.   Audax, an Australian minerals and gold explorer, Clara
Petroleum Ltd., Universal Premium SA, Ireland-based Moesia Oil
and Gas Plc were awarded licenses for five on-shore exploration
blocks, while Petro Ventures Europe BV and a venture between
Lukoil and Vanco got licenses for three blocks in Romania’s
Black Sea waters.  Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, said
yesterday its venture will seek to identify structures and then
hold talks with Romania on drilling terms. A three-dimensional
seismic study will be performed to assess the structures of the
Est Rapsodia and Trident blocks, which lie in water at depths of
90 meters to 1,000 meters (0.6 mile), according to Grigory Volchek, a spokesman for Lukoil Overseas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
