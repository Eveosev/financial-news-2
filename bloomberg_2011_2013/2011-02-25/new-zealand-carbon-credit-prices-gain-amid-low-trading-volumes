Carbon-emission credit prices in  New
Zealand  rose this week as trading volumes declined, Auckland-
based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said.  Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$19.60 ($14.72) a metric
ton, compared with NZ$19.20 a week ago, the broker said today in
an e-mailed statement. About 200,000 tons worth of credits were
traded, down from 250,000 tons last week.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits on the ICE Futures
Europe Exchange in  London  traded at 11.85 euros ($16.38)
yesterday.  New Zealand credits may rise to NZ$20 as buyers opt for
them, rather than pay the higher price for UN contracts, the
broker said. The premium for UN contracts over local credits has
widened in part due to the New Zealand dollarâ€™s decline against
the euro, the broker said.  New Zealand companies that emit  greenhouse gases  have the
option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy local
carbon credits or UN CERs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
