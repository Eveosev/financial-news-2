European Union member-countries will
have to connect their business registers, so information about
companies is more readily accessible, under proposals put
forward by the European Commission yesterday, the Financial
Times reported.  Registers vary in terms of frequency of updating, legal
value of information and possibility of accessing in different
languages; also, some countries keep registers at national
level, while in others they’re operated in localities or
regions, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
