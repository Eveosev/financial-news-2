Pakistan’s stocks fell the most in  Asia  as the main political opposition party’s resistance to
increasing fuel prices raised concerns among investors that the  budget deficit  may widen.  Oil & Gas Development Co., Pakistan’s biggest energy
explorer, fell 3.5 percent to 152.60 rupees at the 4:30 p.m.
local time close at the Karachi Stock Exchange, its lowest since
Oct. 21. The  Muttahida Qaumi Movement , a party in the ruling
coalition, won’t support any government move to increase
gasoline prices as that would increase the burden on consumers,
the party said in a statement yesterday. The Karachi Stock
Exchange 100 Index plunged 2.74 percent, the most since Aug. 16,
to 11,223.52, the lowest in over six months.  “The government seems to be in a fix because they will be
criticized by the opposition and allied parties if they increase
the price of fuel and even if they don’t,” said Khaldoon bin Latif, head of international equities at AKD Securities Ltd.    Pakistan Petroleum Ltd ., the nation’s second-biggest fuels
explorer, sank 2.65 percent, the most since Aug. 9, to 194.8
rupees.  Pakistan Oilfields Ltd ., the nation’s third-biggest
fuels explorer, tumbled 3.14 percent, the most since Oct. 18,
to 282.50 rupees.  Pakistan hasn’t raised gasoline prices since October as the
government of Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  struggles to
control inflation above 14 percent and pacify coalition partners
that have threatened to quit the government if fuel becomes more
expensive. Keeping prices unchanged, the government lost 13.5
billion rupees ($160 million) in duty revenue from December to
February, according to ministry of finance estimates.  The government is scheduled to review domestic gasoline
prices on Feb. 28.  Oil headed for its biggest weekly gain since 2009 on
concern the turmoil which has cut  Libya ’s output may spread to
other parts of the Middle East and speculation the U.S. economic
recovery will boost fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
