OAO  Uralkali , Russia’s second-
biggest potash producer, rose the most in almost seven months in
Moscow trading on a report it plans to boost prices in  Brazil .  Uralkali climbed 9.4 percent, the steepest gain since Aug.
2. Belarusian Potash Co., its trading company, aims to increase
prices in Brazil to as high as $530 a metric ton, FMB Group’s
weekly potash report said, citing a notice to clients. On Nov.
8, BPC said it would charge buyers in Brazil $450 a ton.  Uralkali’s press service and BPC spokesman Filipp Gritskov
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  “This is a pretty high price taking into account that
prices for  China  were as high as $440 per ton and negotiations
with India are still ahead,” said Alexey Bachurin, a trader at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow. “The expected price for India
was $470 per ton,” Bachurin said.  Uralkali climbed 20.03 rubles to 232.82 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close of Moscow trading. OAO Silvinit, Russia’s biggest
potash producer, rose 8 percent to 29,471.87 rubles.  “The market had expected this” potash “price level to be
reached only by year-end,” Marina Alexeenkova, an analyst at
OAO Gazprombank, said by phone today from Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
