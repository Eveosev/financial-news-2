  HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest
bank, said Laura May Lung Cha will join the board in March as a
non-executive director.  Cha, 61, is a non-executive director or  Hong Kong  Exchanges
& Clearing Ltd. and vice chairman of the International Advisory
Council of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, London-
based HSBC said in a statement today. Vincent Cheng, 62, will
retire as an executive director at HSBC’s annual general meeting
on May 28, though will continue as an adviser, the bank said.  “Laura brings a rare breadth and depth of policymaking and
regulatory experience spanning two of HSBC’s most strategically
important markets, Hong Kong and China,” said Chairman Douglas Flint in the statement.  The appointment comes as HSBC, which gains more than half
of its profit in Asia, seeks to trade its shares in Shanghai. In
addition, a U.K. government-sponsored report by  Mervyn Davies ,
the former chairman of  Standard Chartered Plc , yesterday
recommended Britain’s biggest 100 companies double the
proportion of women on their boards to 25 percent.  Cha will become the fourth woman on the HSBC board. Total
membership will fall to 17 when Cheng departs, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
