Russia will raise its export duty on
most crude shipments by 5.3 percent on March 1 after Urals
prices climbed.  The standard  tax rate  will probably rise to $365 a metric
ton ($49.80 a barrel) from $346.60 a ton in February, according
to an order signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and
published today in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the government’s official
newspaper. The discounted rate on oil pumped via Russia’s East
Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline to Asia and from the Caspian Sea
will climb to $150.40 a ton from $137.60.  The export tax on light oil products may increase to
$244.60 a ton from $232.20 a ton. The duty on heavy products may
rise to $170.40 a ton from $161.80 a ton.  Russia sets the duty based on the average Urals price from
the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next. Urals,  Russia ’s benchmark export blend, averaged $95.79 during the most
recent monitoring period, Alexander Sakovich, a Finance Ministry
adviser, said last week.  The tax on liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and
butane will decrease to $150.20 a ton, compared with $198.80 in
February, according to the decree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
