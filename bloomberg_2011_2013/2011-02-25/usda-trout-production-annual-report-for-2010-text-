The following is the text of the
trout production report for 2010, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture :  Trout Value of Sales Decreased 5 Percent from 2009  The total value of fish sales received by trout growers in the United States
totaled 71.3 million dollars for 2010, a decrease of 5 percent from 2009.  Idaho  accounted for 49 percent of the total value of fish sold.  The number of trout 12 inches and longer sold during 2010 totaled
38.7 million fish, down 5 percent from the previous year.  The average price
per pound was $1.39, up 1 cent from 2009.  The value of sales for the 2010
marketing year was 63.1 million dollars, down 6 percent from 2009.  For trout
12 inches or longer, 64 percent were sold to processors and 17 percent were
sold for recreational stocking.  The number of 6”- 12” trout sold during 2010 totaled 5.27 million fish, a
decrease of 5 percent from 2009.  The average price per pound was $3.14
during 2010, up 26 cents from the 2009 price.  The total value of sales was
6.34 million dollars during 2010, a 4 percent decrease from the previous
year.  The major sales outlets for 6“-12” trout were for recreational
stocking accounting for 50 percent of total sales, followed by wholesale to
other producers with 22 percent.  The number of 1”- 6” trout sold during 2010 totaled 8.78 million, a
26 percent increase from the previous year.  The average value per 1,000 fish
was $218 during 2010, down from $232 in 2009.  The total value of sales was
1.92 million dollars, up 18 percent from last year’s total.  Distributed Trout  Trout distributed for restoration, conservation, and recreational purposes,
primarily by State and Federal hatcheries, included 8.3 million 12” or longer
fish, 65.0 million 6”- 12” fish, and 80.7 million 1”- 6” fish.  The estimated
value of fish distributed totaled 104.2 million dollars, up 4 percent from
2009.  Trout Losses  Total losses of all trout intended for sale were 18.4 million fish during
2010.  Disease accounted for 80 percent of these losses, followed by
predators, which totaled 9 percent.  Trout:  Number of Operations Selling and/or Distributing Fish and/or Eggs,    United States , 2009-2010 1/

1/  Revised.
2/  Other States include State estimates not shown.  Reliability of Trout Production Estimates  Survey Procedures:  Data for trout production are collected from all known
producers in the sixteen published states and a sample of producers from the
remaining states.  Individual NASS field offices maintain a list of all known
trout producers and use known sources of producers to update their lists.
Operators are mailed a questionnaire as close as possible to January 1 and
given adequate time to respond by mail.  Those that do not respond by mail
are telephoned or possibly enumerated in person during the middle of January.  Estimation Procedures:  Sound statistical methodology is employed to derive
the estimates from reported data.  All data are analyzed for unusual values.
Data from each operation are compared to their own past operating profile and
to trends from similar operations.  Data for missing operations were
estimated based on similar operations or historical data.  NASS field offices
prepare these estimates by using a combination of survey indications and
historic trends.  Individual State estimates are reviewed by the Agricultural
Statistics Board for reasonableness.  Revision policy:  Estimates for the previous year are subject to revision
when current estimates are made.  Revisions are the result of late or
corrected data.  Reliability:  In the sixteen published states, Trout production estimates are
based on a census of all known active producers and therefore, have no
sampling variability.  However, since all operations in the other states
category are not included in the sample, survey estimates are subject to
sampling variability.  Survey results are also subject to errors such as
omissions, duplication, and mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing
the data.  While these errors cannot be measured directly, they are minimized
through strict quality controls in the data collection process and a careful
review of all reported data for consistency and reasonableness.  Terms and Definitions Used for Trout Production Estimates  12” or Longer Fish:  Grown commercially for food, usually weighing from
three-fourths to one and one-half pounds.  6”- 12” Fish:  Usually stockers that weigh less than three-fourths of a

middleman.  Chemicals:  Includes losses from pesticides or herbicide poisoning.  Disease:  Includes losses from both parasitic and bacterial caused sickness.  Drought:  Includes losses from lack of water causing oxygen depletion.  Floods:  Includes losses from too much water washing the fish away.  Predators:  Includes losses from mink, otters, birds, and other animals.  Theft/Vandalism:  The unauthorized removal of fish and/or the destruction of
property causing a loss of fish by intentional acts by persons known or
unknown.  Terms and Definitions Used to Describe Point of First Sale  Government Agencies: Sales to Federal, State, or local government agencies
