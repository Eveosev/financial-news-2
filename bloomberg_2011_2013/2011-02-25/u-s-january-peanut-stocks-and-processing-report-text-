(D)  Withheld to avoid disclosing data for individual operations.  Statistical Methodology  Survey Procedures: The peanut stocks and processing estimates in this report
are based on a survey conducted during the first three weeks of the month.
The survey is required by law under Title 7 of the United States Code
(7 U.S.C. 951, 2010). Peanut stocks are a census of all known cleaners,
shellers, crushers, warehouses, cold storage plants, and processors of
peanuts who handle more than 30,000 pounds annually. Every effort is made to
obtain a report from all facilities.  Estimating Procedures: Since a complete report is not always received from
all facilities, estimates are made for missing facilities to assure complete
coverage. Peanut stocks survey data are reviewed at the national level for
reasonableness and consistency with historical estimates.  Revision Policy: Peanut stocks are subject to revision at any time during the
marketing year. Revisions can be made when late reports are received and
errors are detected in reporting and calculating. Once the marketing year
ends, no revisions can be made to the previous marketing year.  Reliability: The peanut stocks and processing survey is subject to non-
sampling errors such as omission, duplication, imputation for missing data,
and mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing the data. These errors
cannot be measured directly, but are minimized through rigid quality controls
in the data collection process and a careful review of all reported data for
consistency and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
