The  Ontario Power Authority  awarded
contracts to 40 renewable energy projects totaling 872 megawatts
of capacity under the Canadian province’s incentive program.  The projects, including 35 solar, 1 hydro and 4 wind
plants, will require about $3 billion in private investment, the
authority said today in a  statement .  Ontario’s program gives renewable projects a guaranteed
price for their energy under long-term contracts. The province
 awarded  184 contracts in April to clean energy plants totaling
2.5 gigawatts of capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
