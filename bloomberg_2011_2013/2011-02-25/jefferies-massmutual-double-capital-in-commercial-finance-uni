  Jefferies Group Inc ., the New York-
based investment bank, and  Massachusetts  Mutual Life Insurance
Co. doubled their capital commitments to Jefferies Finance LLC,
the companies’ commercial-finance joint venture.  Jefferies and MassMutual each contributed an additional
$250 million in equity to the unit, bringing total
capitalization to $1 billion, Jefferies said today in a
statement. The companies also initiated a $1 billion revolving  credit line , to be funded equally by Jefferies and MassMutual, a
policyholder-owned carrier in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Jefferies Finance, founded in 2004, provides senior loans
to companies and has originated more than $20 billion of debt
during the last five years, Jefferies said in the statement. As
of Nov. 30, Jefferies had funded $107.5 million of its original
$250 million commitment, leaving $142.5 million unfunded,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  “The further growth and development of Jefferies Finance
will enable us to better serve our investment banking client
base of companies and financial sponsors,” Jefferies Chief
Executive Officer Richard B. Handler said in the statement.  Babson Capital Management LLC, a MassMutual affiliate, will
continue to provide portfolio-management services, Jefferies
said in the statement.  Jefferies Finance had net earnings of $71.7 million in the
11 months ending Nov. 30, compared with $67.5 million in 2009,
according to the  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
