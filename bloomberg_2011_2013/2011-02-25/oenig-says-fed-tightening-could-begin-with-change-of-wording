The  Federal Reserve  could begin to
reverse course and tighten policy by removing its pledge to keep
interest rates near zero for an “extended period,” said  Thomas Hoenig , the central bank’s longest-serving policy maker.  “I know we need to start by, if we were to do that,
communicating to the market that we are not guaranteeing them
the yield curve, that we are going to remove this language of
‘extended period,’” Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed,
said in an interview with CNBC today. He said he didn’t know
when the central bank may make such a move, while expressing a
preference the Fed act this year.  The Fed first lowered its target interest rate to a range
of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 and, in March 2009, it
began saying it would keep rates low “for an extended period.”  The economy “has been improving,” said Hoenig, who added
that he believes the Fed should begin to consider
“renormalizing” policy and that he favors “non-zero”  interest rates .  Rising oil prices are not a “permanent” or “defining”
factor for the economy right now, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
