  MetLife Inc ., the biggest U.S. life
insurer, said costs tied to a class-action lawsuit by tenants of
Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in New York may be
greater than it previously expected.  Additional charges may be needed to provide for possible
losses, the New York-based insurer said today in a regulatory
filing. A provision set aside for losses is probably adequate
and the suit won’t materially affect results, MetLife said.  Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for New York-based MetLife,
declined to comment.  Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, Manhattan’s
largest apartment complex, was previously owned by MetLife. The
insurer sold it in 2006 to PCV ST Owner LP and Tishman Speyer
Properties LP for $5.4 billion. The tenants filed a lawsuit
seeking $215 million for alleged rent overcharges. PCV and
Tishman Speyer are also named as defendants.  “It is reasonably possible that the company’s total
exposure may be greater than the liability currently accrued and
that future charges to income may be necessary,” MetLife said
in the filing.  The case is Amy L. Roberts v. Tishman Speyer Properties,
100956/2007,  New York  state  Supreme Court  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
