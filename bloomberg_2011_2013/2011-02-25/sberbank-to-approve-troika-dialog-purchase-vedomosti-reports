OAO Sberbank will approve the
purchase of Troika Dialog,  Russia ’s oldest investment bank, at a
meeting today of its advisory board, Vedomosti reported, citing
an unidentified board member.  State-run Sberbank plans to buy an 80 percent stake in
Troika Dialog, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  The investment bank, whose entire shareholding was
originally valued at $1.25 billion, may fetch a lower price,
Vedomosti said.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  said on Dec.
29 that there was a “high degree of probability” that Russia’s
largest lender would purchase an investment bank in the first
quarter of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
