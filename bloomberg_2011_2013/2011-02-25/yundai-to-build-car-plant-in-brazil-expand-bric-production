  Hyundai Motor Co . will begin
construction of its first plant in  Brazil  as  South Korea ’s
largest carmaker expands factories in emerging markets to meet
rising demand.  Hyundai is investing $600 million in the factory in
Piracicaba, Brazil, which will have an annual capacity to build
150,000 vehicles, the company said in a statement today.
Production of a small car will start in November 2012, it said.  The Brazilian plant completes Hyundai’s manufacturing
presence in the BRIC nations after it set up facilities in
China, Russia and  India . The factory will help Hyundai compete
more aggressively with  Volkswagen AG  and  General Motors Co . in
the South American nation and boost its market share, said Kim Byung Kwan, a Seoul-based analyst at Mirae Asset Securities Co.  “We want to enhance our competitiveness against major U.S.
and European automakers in Brazil by setting up a production
site,” Hyundai said in the statement. The plant will be the
company’s “gateway to Central and South American markets.”  Hyundai’s exports to Brazil rose 19 percent to 80,000
vehicles last year, according to the statement. Sales in Latin
America gained 27 percent to 230,000. The Seoul-based automaker
expects to sell 93,000 vehicles in Brazil this year.  Hyundai joins automakers including GM, Volkswagen and  Toyota Motor Corp . in operating factories in Brazil. The South
Korean company expects Brazil to become the world’s third-
largest auto market by 2015. Mirae’s Kim expects Hyundai’s
Brazilian market share to reach 6 percent by 2014.  Seventh Country  The completion of the factory will help Hyundai build as
many as 4.51 million units worldwide a year by 2012, according
to the statement. Production outside South Korea will account
for 2.65 million units. Brazil is the seventh country where
Hyundai is setting up an overseas production facility.  Hyundai rose 2.3 percent to 175,000 won at the close of
Seoul trading today. The shares have gained 54 percent in the
past year.  Hyundai said in September it will complete the construction
of its third plant in  China  with capacity to make 400,000 units
a year by 2012. The company has two plants in India with a
combined annual capacity to build 600,000 vehicles.  It started operating a factory this year in Russia with a
capacity of 150,000 units. The automaker also runs plants in the
U.S., Turkey and the  Czech Republic .  The small hatchback car that Hyundai plans to build in
Brazil will be aimed at customers in Central and South American
markets, the company said in the statement. More models may be
added after 2013 depending on demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
