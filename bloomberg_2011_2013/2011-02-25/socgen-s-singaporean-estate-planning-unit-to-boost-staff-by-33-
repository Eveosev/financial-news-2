  Societe Generale  SA, France’s
second-biggest bank, will expand headcount at its trust unit in
Singapore by about a third in the next two years as growing
wealth in Asia bolsters demand for succession planning.  SG Trust (Asia) Ltd. plans to increase its workforce in
Singapore to 40 people from 30, Chief Executive Officer Steven
Lim said in a telephone interview.  Estate-planning services are gaining popularity in Asia,
where many of the largest business groups are controlled by
founding families, amid disputes over fortunes amassed by
billionaires  Stanley Ho  and Dhirubhai Ambani.  The number of millionaires in the Asia-Pacific region
equaled  Europe  for the first time in 2009, according to a report
by Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.  “The rich worry about their wealth,” said Lim. “When
people are getting more affluent, they will start seriously
thinking about having succession-planning structures.”  At least 50 percent of individuals in Asia with assets
under management of at least $3 million will be seeking advice
on bequeathing their wealth within the next five years, compared
with about 30 percent to 40 percent now, said Lim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
