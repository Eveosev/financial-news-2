Italy’s  Saras SpA  will shut a
gasification unit in the second quarter at Sarroch, the biggest
refinery in the Mediterranean, for “major” maintenance that
happens every 10 years.  The shutdown will last about 35 days, Saras’s General
Manager Dario Scaffardi said today on a conference call with
analysts. During the halt, a vacuum unit, hydrocracker, topping
plant, and visbreaker will also be idled for repairs, he said.  The plant in Sardinia can process 300,000 barrels of crude
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Hydrocrackers
mainly produce diesel and jet fuel. Visbreakers raise the amount
of diesel and gasoil that can be processed from heavy oil-
product. Gasification units produce hydrogen, steam and power
for the refinery.  Saras, based in Milan, would be interested in “extending
further the relationship” with national  oil companies  and has
had a number of requests from “new entrants,” Scaffardi said
on the call. “A third-party type processing contract that is
long-term and beneficial to both would be of definite interest
and it is basically the equivalent of a partnership,” he said,
without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
