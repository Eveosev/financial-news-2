Asian stocks rose after a four-day
sell off as crude oil fell below $100 a barrel amid easing
concern about supply disruptions in the Middle East, and as
chipmakers climbed.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd . climbed 3.6 percent in  Hong
Kong  as the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the International Energy
Agency said they can compensate for any disruption to Libyan oil
shipments. Hynix Semiconductor Inc. gained 4.1 percent in Seoul
after analysts said prices for memory chips may climb next
month.  Toyota Motor Corp . rallied 2.2 percent in Tokyo after
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended the world’s largest carmaker.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.9 percent to 136.57 as
of 7:39 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than twice as many stocks
advancing as declining. The gauge has dropped 2.4 percent this
week as crude climbed above $100 a barrel for the first time in
two years amid escalating violence in  Libya , which has the
largest oil reserves in Africa.  “Shares are correcting from the recent declines, helped by
an easing in the oil price,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average and  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index climbed 0.7 percent, while  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.6 percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index was little
changed. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  rallied 1.8 percent.  “The reassurance from Saudi Arabia to lift output and
offset Libyan production seems to have helped,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney.  U.S. Futures Rise  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6
percent today. Most stocks in the index climbed yesterday,
boosted by the drop in oil and a bigger-than-estimated decline
in U.S. jobless claims last week.  Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s biggest airline, surged 3.6
percent to HK$17.70. Korean Air Lines Co., South Korea’s largest
carrier, advanced 4.8 percent to 64,000 won, ending the week
with a 9.2 percent plunge.  Qantas Airways Ltd ., Australia’s
largest carrier, rose 2.2 percent to A$2.38 in Sydney today.  New York oil futures retreated from $103.41 yesterday, the
highest in 29 months, after President Barack Obama said the U.S.
will be able to “ride out” a cut resulting from turmoil in
Libya. Crude for April delivery lost as much as 0.7 percent
$96.61 a barrel. It traded at $97.77 a barrel at 11:37 a.m.
Sydney time.  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s grip on the nation weakened
yesterday as a close adviser abandoned him, opponents
consolidated their control of the country’s oil-rich east, and  Switzerland  froze some of his assets.  ‘World Could Cope’  “The world could adequately cope without Libyan oil if
supply was disrupted for a period of time,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd.
in  Melbourne . “The greater concern is the contagion of civil
unrest throughout the Middle East and North  Africa .”  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., which generates
about 38 percent of sales from the Middle East, climbed 6.5
percent to 75,500 won in Seoul, while rival Samsung Engineering
Co. advanced 5 percent to 187,500 won. Samsung has the biggest
exposure to the Middle East and North Africa region at 79
percent of its third-quarter order backlog, said UBS AG.  Hynix, Elpida Gain  Information-technology companies rose the most among the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups. Hynix, the world’s
second-largest maker of computer-memory chips, jumped 4.1
percent to 28,000 won. LIG Investment & Securities Co. said
contract prices for chips may rise in March and analysts will
increase their first-quarter earnings estimates for the company.    Elpida Memory Inc ., the world’s No. 3 maker of computer-
memory chips, rallied 6.4 percent to 1,216 yen in Tokyo. The
company has scrapped plans to merge with Taiwanese memory makers
because of opposition from the target companies, President and
Chief Executive Officer Yukio Sakamoto said today.  HTC Corp., the world’s largest maker of handsets using
Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. operating systems, surged by the
6.8 percent daily limit in Taipei to a record NT$1,065 on
speculation the sale of new handsets from next month will boost
revenue, according to Chen Wei-hang, an analyst at President
Capital Management Corp.  Toyota increased 2.2 percent to 3,755 yen in Tokyo after
Credit Suisse boosted its investment rating on the carmaker to
“outperform” from “neutral.” The shares climbed even after
the company recalled 2.17 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles in
the U.S. for carpet and floor-mat flaws that could jam gas
pedals.  Profit Boosts AIA    AIA Group Ltd . jumped 5.7 percent to HK$22.30 in Hong Kong
after the third-largest Asian insurer by market value reported
better-than-estimated earnings. The company had the biggest
percentage gain in the MSCI Asia Pacific Financials Index.  Jiangxi Copper Co. advanced 3.4 percent to HK$24.05 in Hong
Kong as China’s largest producer of the metal said its annual
tax rate will drop to 15 percent from 25 percent for three years
after the company was recognized as a “high-tech enterprise”
by the provincial government.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.7 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 3.9 percent by the S&P 500
and 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
