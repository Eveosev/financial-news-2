PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara may
consume 3.5 percent more natural gas this year as the Indonesian
state utility reduces the use of oil as a fuel at its  power
plants , a director said.  Gas consumption may increase to 293 trillion British
thermal units this year from 283 trillion British thermal units
last year, according to Nur Pamudji, primary energy director at
Jakarta-based Listrik Negara.    Indonesia ,  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy, is increasing
domestic use of natural gas to make up for falling crude output
from aging fields, which led to the country withdrawing from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008.  “There will be 150 megawatts of power capacity that we
will switch to gas from oil,” Pamudji told reporters in Jakarta
today. The plan will reduce fuel costs by as much as $120
million this year, he added.  To support the increase in demand for the cleaner burning
fuel, Listrik Negara is considering building a liquefied natural
gas-receiving terminal in Bekasi, east of Jakarta, with an
annual capacity of 1.5 million metric tons, Pamudji said.  Listrik Negara plans to raise its gas-fired power capacity
to 21,000 megawatts by 2019 from 9,800 megawatts currently,
Planning Director Nasri Sebayang said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
