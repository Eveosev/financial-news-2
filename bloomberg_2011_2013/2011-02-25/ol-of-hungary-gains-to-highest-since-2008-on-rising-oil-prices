Mol Nyrt., Hungary’s largest
refiner, rose to the highest closing level since February 2008
as the turmoil in Libya pushed  oil prices  higher.  The stock climbed 3.7 percent to 23,835 forint, extending
its increase this week to 8.2 percent, the biggest since the
five days through May 14.    Brent crude , the benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s
oil market, surged to a 30-month high of $119.79 a barrel
yesterday. Oil rallied as much as 2.3 percent to $113.91 a
barrel before trading at $111.25 in London today.  “Mol is again swinging around the 23,000 level as oil
prices rise,” analysts at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB Zrt. unit
led by Zsolt Kondrat in Budapest wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
