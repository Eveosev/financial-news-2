Lebanon’s Prime Minister  Saad Hariri 
agreed to cut gasoline prices by 5,000 Lebanese pounds ($3.30)
per 20 liters, the state-run National News Agency reported.  Hariri sent his decision today to the ministers of energy
and finance, the Beirut-based news agency said. It didn’t
provide more details.  Popular uprisings throughout the Middle East have toppled
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt this year and have prompted
governments to boost public spending to ease discontent. Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi , whose country belongs to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is facing an unprecedented
rebellion against his four-decade rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
