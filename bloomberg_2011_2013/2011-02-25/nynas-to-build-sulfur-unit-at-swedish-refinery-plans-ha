Nynas AB, a venture of  Neste Oil Oyj 
and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, plans to halt production at its
Nynaeshamn refinery in  Sweden  in the fourth quarter.  The refinery will shut for about five weeks of planned
maintenance in November, Hans Oestlin, a spokesman at the
Stockholm-based company, said today by telephone.  The facility can process 22,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nynas has a smaller
plant in Gothenburg, Sweden, and two sites in the U.K.,
according to the companyâ€™s  website . Production is largely based
on heavy crude oil, which is upgraded to produce bitumen and
naphthenic specialty oils.  Nynas is building a sulfur recovery plant at the Nynaeshamn
refinery at a cost of 600 million Swedish kronor ($94 million)
to cut pollutants, Oestlin said. The plant is scheduled to start
operations in May 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
