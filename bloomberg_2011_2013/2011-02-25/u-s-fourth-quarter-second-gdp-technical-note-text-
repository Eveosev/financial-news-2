Following is the technical note of the Gross
Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background information about the source data and
estimating methods used to produce the estimates presented in the GDP news
release.  The complete set of estimates for the fourth quarter is available on
BEA's Web site at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of "highlights" is also posted
on the Web site.  In a few weeks, the estimates will be published in BEA's
monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business, along with a more detailed
analysis of the estimates ("GDP and the Economy").  Sources of Revision to Real GDP  The real GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter was revised from 3.2 percent to
2.8 percent (annual rate). An upward revision to imports and downward
revisions to state and local government spending and to  consumer spending  were
partly offset by an upward revision to exports.  *       The upward revision to imports primarily reflected newly available
Census Bureau data on U.S. trade with Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for
December. (The national income and product accounts treat transactions with  Puerto Rico  and the U.S. territories as exports and imports, whereas the
international transactions accounts treat them as domestic transactions. A
territorial adjustment√ºE  accounts for this difference in treatment.)
*       The downward revision to state and local government spending was
primarily to gross investment and reflected newly available Census
construction spending data for December and revised data for October and
November.
*       Consumer spending was revised down, reflecting revised Census retail
sales data for November and December and newly available and revised natural
gas usage data from the Energy Information Administration.
*       Exports were revised up, primarily based on newly available Census
goods data for December.  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases increased 2.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, the same increase as in the advance estimate.  Revisions to Wages and Salaries and Disposable Personal Income  In addition to presenting revised estimates for the fourth quarter, today's
release also presents revised estimates of third-quarter wages and salaries,
personal taxes, and contributions for government social insurance.  Wage and
salary disbursements are now estimated to have increased $54.9 billion in the
third quarter, an upward revision of $2.9 billion.  These estimates reflect
newly available wage and salary tabulations for the third quarter from the BLS
quarterly census of employment and wages.  These data are more comprehensive
than the monthly employment and earnings data that were used for the earlier
estimates the QCEW data include irregular pay, such as bonuses and gains from
the exercise of  stock options .  Real disposable personal income is now estimated to have increased 1.0 percent
in the third quarter and 1.4 percent in the fourth.  (By comparison, the
estimates that were available last month showed increases of 0.9 percent in
the third quarter and 1.7 percent in the fourth.)  Table A.--SOURCE DATA FOR THE ADVANCE AND SECOND  ESTIMATES OF GDP FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010  This table shows the actual data used for the second estimate of GDP for the
fourth quarter of 2010.  For these key series, actual data for December were
not available in time for inclusion in the advance GDP estimate released on
January 28, 2011, and BEA made assumptions for these source data.  The numbers
in brackets show the December values that had been assumed for the advance
estimate.  For most series, the data incorporated for November and, in some
cases, for October, were preliminary, and the numbers shown in brackets are
the values used last month.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted
at annual rates, and are published by the Bureau of the Census.  2010  Jul.      Aug.      Sep.      Oct.      Nov.      Dec.  Private fixed investment:  Nonresidential structures:
