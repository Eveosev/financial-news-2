  American International Group Inc .,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, is seeking better returns from its
investment portfolio by extending the duration on its fixed-
income holdings.  “We expect the redeployment of cash in short-term
investments in the longer-term, higher-yielding securities will
provide an opportunity to improve future earnings,” Chief
Financial Officer David Herzog said today on a conference call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
