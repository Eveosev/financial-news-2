European Union carbon allowances
advanced to their highest price in four months as German power
rose, boosting the incentive to sell electricity forward.  EU carbon permits for December increased 0.3 percent to
15.45 euros ($21.25) a metric ton as of 5:12 p.m. on the ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange in  London . That would be the highest
close since Oct. 25. Traded volume for the contract rose to 61.8
million tons for the past five days, a weekly record, according
to ICE data.  German power for next year increased 0.3 percent to 53.25
euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Power can track coal prices. Coal for next year in
northwest Europe advanced 0.6 percent to $121.25 a ton after
rising to $124.25 a ton on Feb. 22, the highest level since
October 2008.  Spot carbon prices on BlueNext SA, the Paris-based
exchange, fell 0.6 percent to 14.80 euros a ton, a discount of
65 cents compared with the most recent December contract. The
discount was 39 cents or less last month before a 15-day halt
started on Jan. 20 following reports of stolen permits.  Spot trading remains hampered in the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas trading program by traded volume. About 60
million euros of allowances were stolen since November, roiling
traders.  “Understandably, the market is favoring those EU
allowances that come freshly minted from governments,” such as
in this week’s sale by  Germany , Alessandro Vitelli, director of
strategy at IDEAcarbon in London, said today by e-mail. “Even
though the European Commission has underlined that stolen EU
allowances are still valid for compliance, it’s clear that
traders and compliance buyers are not prepared to pay for the
reputational risk that association with these allowances
brings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
