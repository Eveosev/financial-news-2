A European Union plan known as the
roadmap to set aside carbon permits starting in 2013 and slash
emissions through 2050 amounts to “confiscation,” said a
steel-industry lobby group.  “The confiscation of allowances from the emissions trading
system, as proposed by the roadmap, will have exactly the same
effect as a unilateral move” to a 30 percent carbon reduction
target by 2020, Eurofer Director General Gordon Moffat said
today in an e-mailed statement. “This is unacceptable. We hope
member states will not fall into this trap.” The plan  will
lead to “the deindustrialization of  Europe ,” the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
