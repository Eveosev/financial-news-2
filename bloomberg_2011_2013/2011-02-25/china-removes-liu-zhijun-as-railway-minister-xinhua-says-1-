  China  replaced Minister of Railways
Liu Zhijun after the ruling Communist Party said he was under
investigation for “severe” disciplinary violations, the Xinhua
News Agency reported.  The National People’s Congress replaced him with Sheng
Guangzu, 62, the head of the customs administration, Xinhua said.  Liu, 58, became railway minister in 2003 and led China’s
investment boom in the industry. The government plans to spend
800 billion yuan ($122 billion) on high-speed rail projects as
it plans to build a faster and bigger network.  Liu is accused of abusing his position and receiving “a
large amount of money” in bribes, Xinhua said Feb. 12, citing
the Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision.  -  Henry Sanderson . Editors: John Brinsley  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
