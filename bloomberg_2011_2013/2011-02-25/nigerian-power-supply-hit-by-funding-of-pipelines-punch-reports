  Nigeria ’s efforts to improve its
electricity supply may be threatened by a failure to fund the
construction of pipelines needed to carry gas to new power
plants,  Punch  said, citing Bart Nnaji, a presidential adviser on
power.  The government hasn’t included the 725 billion naira ($4.74
billion) needed to complete the necessary projects in its 2011
budget, the Lagos-based newspaper said, citing Nnaji.  Power cuts occur daily in Nigeria, where demand for
electricity is almost double the current supply of more than
3,000 megawatts. The government wants to increase output to
40,000 megawatts by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
