  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  reported the
release of sulfur oxide at its Martinez, California, refinery in
an “unplanned event,” according to a  filing  with state
regulators.  The incident at the 158,000 barrel-a-day plant at about
8:35 p.m. local time yesterday probably resulted in more than
500 pounds of additional emissions, according to the filing with
the California Emergency Management Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
