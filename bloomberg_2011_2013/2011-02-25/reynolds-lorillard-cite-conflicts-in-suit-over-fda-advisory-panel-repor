R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and
Lorillard Tobacco Co. sued to block the  U.S. Food and Drug
Administration  from receiving recommendations from an advisory
committee that includes members that the cigarette makers claim
have conflicts of interest.  Reynolds and Lorillard, the second- and third-biggest U.S.
cigarette makers, filed the complaint today in federal court in  Washington . They seek an order preventing the FDA from receiving
the report, which is to include recommendations on the use of
menthol in cigarettes.  Three of the eight committee members “have severe
financial and appearance conflicts of interest and associated
biases,” the companies said in their complaint. The three
members serve as paid expert witnesses in lawsuits against the
tobacco industry and take money from drug companies that make
nicotine-replacement products and other smoking-cessation aids,
according to the complaint.  Reynolds, a unit of Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based  Reynolds American Inc ., makes Camel and Winston cigarettes in
addition to its Kool and Salem menthol brands. Lorillard Tobacco
is a unit of  Lorillard Inc ., based in Greensboro,  North
Carolina . It makes Newport, the top-selling menthol brand.  Jeffrey Ventura, an FDA spokesman, declined to comment on
the suit.    Altria Group Inc .’s Philip Morris USA unit is the biggest
U.S. cigarette maker.  The case is Lorillard Inc. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-00440, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
