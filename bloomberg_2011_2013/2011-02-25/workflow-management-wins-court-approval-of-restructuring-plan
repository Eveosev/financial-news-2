Workflow Management Inc., a provider
of marketing services and business documents, won court approval
of a restructuring plan that reduces debt by more than
$170 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen C. St. John overruled
objections to the reorganization plan at a hearing yesterday in
Norfolk,  Virginia , according to court papers filed today.  The company “is ready to exit bankruptcy in a much
stronger position than when we initiated the process five months
ago,” Workflow Chief Executive Officer Dave Davis said in an
e-mailed statement. “We have significantly de-leveraged our
balance sheet, streamlined our operations through the
elimination of unprofitable capacity, and continued to reduce
costs.”  Workflow, based in Dayton,  Ohio , is the result of the 2005
combination of Workflow Solutions LLC, which started as Newport
News Printing in 1912, and Relizon Co., which began as a part of
Reynolds & Reynolds in 1866, according to its  website .  The company listed assets of $366.5 million and debt of
$466.6 million as of Sept. 30 in court filings. The company had
sales of $433.3 million for the nine months through September,
resulting in a loss of about $39 million.  Workflow has about 2,200 employees in the U.S., serving
about 10,000 clients from 17 business centers, according to
court documents.  New Notes  Under the restructuring plan, Workflow will sell virtually
all of its assets to the newly formed company for new notes,
plus cash to pay administrative costs and fund a trust for
unsecured creditors. Second-priority lenders would get
58.5 percent of the equity. Investment funds managed by
affiliates of Perseus LLC, Workflow’s current owner, will
receive the remaining 41.5 percent for a $12.5 million capital
infusion.  Lenders with a first priority of repayment, owed about
$141.5 million, will get $141.5 million in new notes with the
same security on the buyer’s assets.  Second-priority lenders owed about $196.5 million, which
have Silver Point Finance LLC as agent, have a $170 million
secured claim and a $26.5 million unsecured claim under the
plan. They would get $140 million in new notes with the same
security they currently hold, as well as preferred-equity
interests valued at about $30 million. Unsecured creditors will
share a $2 million fund.  The lead case is In re Workflow Management Inc., 10-74617,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk).  To contact the reporter on this story:
