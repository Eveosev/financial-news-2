  Wells Fargo & Co .’s lending and
foreclosure practices probably will draw an enforcement action
that may include a fine, the bank said today in a regulatory
filing.  “It is likely that one or more of the government agencies
will initiate some type of enforcement action against Wells
Fargo, which may include civil money penalties,” the San
Francisco-based lender said in its annual report. “Wells Fargo
continues to provide information requested by the various
agencies.”  Wells Fargo said the high end of estimated litigation
losses could be $1.2 billion beyond the reserve already set
aside, according to the filing. The bank, which ranks as the
biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said it didn’t expect litigation
costs to have a “material adverse” impact on its financial
position.  Wells Fargo completed its own review of foreclosures in the
fourth quarter and doesn’t believe any unwarranted seizures
occurred, according to the filing.  U.S. regulators may try to extract $20 billion of penalties
in a settlement with banks that serviced flawed loans, two
people briefed on the talks said this week. Terms of an accord,
from regulators led by the Treasury Department and Department of
Housing and Urban Development, haven’t been formally presented
to banks, according to the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the discussions aren’t public.  Wells Fargo rose 96 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $32.40 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 4.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
