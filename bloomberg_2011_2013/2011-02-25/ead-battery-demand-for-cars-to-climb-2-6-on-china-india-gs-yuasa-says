Global demand for lead-acid
batteries may rise 2.6 percent this year amid increased car
sales in China,  India  and Southeast Asia, said an executive at  GS Yuasa Corp ., the world’s third-biggest producer.  Demand for  car batteries  will rise to 390 million units
from 380 million in 2010, Hiroharu Nakano, general manager at
the Kyoto, Japan-based company, said in an interview yesterday.
GS Yuasa forecast demand will climb to 400 million units in 2012.    Johnson Controls Inc . and  Exide Technologies , both based in
the U.S., are the biggest producers. GS Yuasa has a 7 percent
share in the automotive battery market and has partnerships with
Honda Motor Co. and  Mitsubishi Motors Corp . to make lithium-ion
power cells for electric and hybrid cars.  “Demand from China, India and Southeast Asian nations has
been leading global growth and this will continue for the time
being,” Nakano said in Tokyo. Battery demand for new vehicles
has increased in those countries, while worldwide replacement
demand has risen moderately, he said.  In 2010, actual demand was expected to exceed the company’s
forecast of 380 million units by about 5 million units following
higher-than-expected car sales in  China  and other emerging
markets, he said.  China’s vehicle sales will grow 10 percent to 15 percent
this year after jumping 32 percent to 18.06 million vehicles in
2010, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers forecast.  China Demand  Demand in China will increase 9 percent to 49 million units
in 2011 and then 54 million units in 2012, while consumption in
India may climb to 14.5 million units in 2011 and then 16
million in 2012 from 13 million last year, Nakano said.  Lead for immediate delivery was little changed at $2,499 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 4:28 p.m. in Tokyo.
The price has gained 16 percent in the past year, touching
$2,712.75 on Jan. 6, the highest level since May 2008.  Demand for  lithium-ion batteries  will jump to 3.8 million
cells in 2015 from 1 million cells in 2012, he said.  Nakano said the lead-acid battery market will not be
affected by growing demand for lithium-ion cells. Battery demand
for new idling-stop systems, which consume more lead, has also
been increasing, he said.  GS Yuasa plans to produce 30 million units this year, up
from 28 million units last year, and 32 million in 2012, Nakano
said. The company produces about 70 percent of these overseas.  The company plans to increase its share in China to 11
percent or 6 million units in 2012 from 9 percent or 3.8 million
units in 2009. It also expects to raise its share in  Southeast
Asia  to 45 percent or 9.4 million units from 43 percent or 7.5
million units in 2009, and 10 percent or 1.6 million in India
from 5 percent or 0.6 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
