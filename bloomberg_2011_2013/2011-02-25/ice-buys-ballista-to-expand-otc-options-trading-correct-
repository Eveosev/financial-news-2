(Corrects initials of CME Group in last paragraph.)  Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the
second-largest U.S. futures market, said it acquired Ballista
Securities to boost its options trading platform for customers.  Ballista, a broker-dealer with an electronic system for
buying and selling complex options transactions, will be
integrated into Atlanta-based Intercontinental’s YellowJacket
options negotiating system, the company said in a statement
today. YellowJacket allows traders to communicate via instant
message, receive data and negotiate trades in over-the-counter
natural gas, crude oil and weather markets, according to
Intercontinental.  Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed.  CME Group Inc., based in  Chicago , is the nation’s largest
futures market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
