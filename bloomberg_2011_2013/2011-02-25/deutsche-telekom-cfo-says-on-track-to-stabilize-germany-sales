  Deutsche Telekom AG  is on track to
stabilize its German revenues by 2012, Chief Financial Officer
Timotheus Hoettges said at the annual press conference today,
according to the text of prepared remarks.  “Revenue trends have significantly improved in the fourth
quarter,” Hoettges said, referring to the German operations.
“We are well on our way to stabilizing German revenues as a
whole by 2012.”  Deutsche Telekom’s share of new broadband connections in  Germany  was negatively affected by “very aggressive unbundlers
who gained market share at the expense of cable,” Hoettges
said. “We are not happy with the resulting 30.1 percent share
in the fourth quarter, but we remained competitive overall.”  German mobile revenues rose 5 percent in the fourth
quarter, when adjusted for lower mobile termination rates,
driven by data revenue growth of 28 percent, he said.  “Despite the loss of iPhone exclusivity, we continued very
strong iPhone sales with almost 350,000 iPhones sold in the
fourth quarter alone,” Hoettges said. In addition, Deutsche
Telekom sold almost 50,000 smartphones based on Microsoft
Corp.’s Windows 7 operating platform.  For Related News and Information:
