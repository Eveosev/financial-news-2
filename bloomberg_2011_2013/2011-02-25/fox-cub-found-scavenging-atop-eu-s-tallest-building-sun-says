Workers building what will be the
European Union’s tallest building found a fox cub living on the
72nd floor, scavenging scraps of food left by workers, the Sun
reported, citing local pest control experts.  The male fox, estimated at less than six months old,
apparently negotiated the central stairwell on the building,
known as the Shard, which will soar to 1,012 feet on  London ’s
South Bank when it is completed in 2012, the newspaper said.  Animal welfare workers finally trapped the fox with
chicken carcasses after two weeks and after health checks, he
was released, the Sun reported, citing local pest control
manager Les Leonard.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
