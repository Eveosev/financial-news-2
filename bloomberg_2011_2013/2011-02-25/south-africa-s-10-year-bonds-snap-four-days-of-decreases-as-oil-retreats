South African 10-year bonds rose for
the first day in five as gains in the rand and a retreat in  oil
prices  from a more-than two-year high helped alleviate concern
of a global inflation increase.  The 6.75 percent security due March 2021 rose 18.4 cents to
86.75 rand as of 4:58 p.m. in Johannesburg, reducing the yield
by 3 basis points to 8.755 percent. The move pared the bond’s
biggest weekly slump in three months to 1.98 rand, and the
increase in its yield to 33 basis points.  Oil traded below a 29-month high reached yesterday after
the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and the  International Energy Agency  made
assurances they can compensate for any disruption of supply due
to unrest in  Libya , holder of Africa’s largest crude reserves.  Brent crude  for April settlement fell as much as 0.8 percent to
$110.52 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, down from yesterday’s $119.79, which was the highest
since August 2008.  “Oil is slightly lower and you’ve also got a stronger
rand, which is back close to 7 to the dollar, so that helps the  bond market  a bit,” Deon van Zyl, head of fixed-interest
investment at Metropolitan Asset Managers in Cape Town, said by
telephone. “With equities under pressure there’s also a bit of
a flight to the safety of bonds.”  The rand gained 1 percent to 6.9973 per dollar, taking its
advance this past week to 2 percent. Against the euro, the rand
added 1.2 percent to 9.6084 for a weekly increase of 1.8
percent.  “Higher precious metals prices are giving the rand some
protection,” said Van Zyl. “Gold especially is doing well.”  Gold headed for its fourth weekly advance, the longest run
of gains since October, as investors seek to protect their
wealth from the risk of inflation stemming from higher oil
prices. Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.5
percent to $1,409.77 an ounce and last traded at $1,402.38, a
0.9 percent gain this week.  -- With assistance from Sikonathi Mantshantsha in Johannesburg.
