Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President Jeffrey Lacker said the central bank should help
ensure financial stability by performing stress tests on large
banks that are based on dire economic scenarios.  Stress tests “are only as good as the imagination of the
scenario designers, who need to resist the temptation to dismiss
extreme scenarios as too far-fetched or focus too much attention
on preparing for the last war,” Lacker said today in a speech
in  New York . “Stress tests are not a panacea.”  U.S. stress tests of large banks in 2009 helped to restore
investor confidence in the banking system, Lacker said at the
University of Chicago Booth School of Business’s annual U.S.
Monetary Policy Forum. The Dodd-Frank Act passed last year
mandates that the Fed conduct annual stress tests of the largest
U.S. banking companies to ensure they can weather a greater-
than-expected downturn.  “One critical question about stress tests is whether or
not to disclose the results, and if so, at what level of
detail,” Lacker said in prepared remarks. “A good case can be
made for transparency,” while at the same time “there can be
good reasons to restrict the release of bank-specific
supervisory information.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
