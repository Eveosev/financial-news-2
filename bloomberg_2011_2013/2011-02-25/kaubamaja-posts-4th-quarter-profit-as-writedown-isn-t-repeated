AS Tallinna Kaubamaja,  Estonia ’s
largest retailer, reported a fourth-quarter profit after a
writedown of Latvian assets was not repeated.  Net income was 7.4 million euros ($10.2 million), compared
with a loss of 11.1 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-
based company said in a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose
5 percent to 110 million euros.  Kaubamaja, which in 2009 decided to shut all its six
supermarkets in neighboring  Latvia  because of the recession,
wrote down 15.3 million euros of land and buildings in the
country in the fourth quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
