Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG and
Croatian gas pipeline operator Plinacro Ltd. signed a memorandum
of understanding to boost gas markets in southeast Europe.  The three-year agreement means the two companies will
exchange technical information and coordinate activities, the
companies said in a joint e-mailed statement.  TAP is a 520-kilometer (323-mile) pipeline planned to
transport from 10 billion to 20 billion cubic meters of gas a
year via Greece and Albania across the Adriatic Sea to Italyâ€™s
southern Puglia region and on to the rest of Europe.  The pipeline is estimated to cost 1.5 billion euros ($2.1
billion).  EGL AG  and  Statoil ASA  each hold 42.5 percent of TAP
and E.ON Ruhrgas AG owns the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
