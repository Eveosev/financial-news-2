The presidents of  Kenya  and the
Democratic Republic of Congo have ordered an investigation into
rumors that 2.5 metric tons of gold was smuggled from Congo into
Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.  Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  agreed to allow a team of
Congolese experts to stay in his country to investigate claims
that a shipment of Congolese gold had arrived in the East
African nation illegally, Congolese Mines Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  said in an interview today in the capital, Kinshasa.  “There are documents saying there was 2.5 tons of gold but
they were false documents,” he said. At today’s price in
London, 2.5 tons of gold would be worth about $113 million.  An estimated 80 percent of Congo’s gold exports are
smuggled, according to the Ministry of Mines. Congo has been
trying to cut links between mineral smuggling and armed groups
in the east of the country.  The gold shipment that’s being probed doesn’t appear to be
linked to the seizure of a plane carrying more than 400
kilograms of gold on Feb. 4 in Goma, capital of Congo’s North
Kivu province, said Kabwelulu. Two Nigerians, a U.S. citizen and
a French national are being investigated for smuggling in that
case, he said.  Gold for immediate-delivery was little changed at $1,402.65
an ounce by 11:35 a.m. in  London , bringing the gain this month
to 5.2 percent, the most since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
