Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas said
financial proceeds from higher value-added-tax will go to the
pension reserve account and will be used only to adjust for
pension change,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  Pension change will allow people to put 3 percent of what
they pay for social security taxes into private accounts,
effectively lowering their taxes, Necas told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
