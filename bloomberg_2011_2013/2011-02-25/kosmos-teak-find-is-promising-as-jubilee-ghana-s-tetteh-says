Kosmos Energy LLC’s Teak discovery
off west Africa “looks to be as promising” as the 800-million-
barrel Jubilee offshore oil project, Ghanaian Trade Minister
Hannah Tetteh said.  Kosmos, backed by private equity firms Warburg Pincus LLC
and  Blackstone Group LP , announced the Teak find off Ghana’s
coast on Feb. 10. Kosmos operates the block and holds a 31
percent interest. Other partners in the field include state-
owned Ghana National Petroleum Corp.,  Anadarko Petroleum Corp .
and  Tullow Oil Plc .  Kosmos, which filed for an initial public offering last
month, is also a partner in the Jubilee field, which began
production on Dec. 15. Jubilee’s output is expected to rise to
120,000 barrels a day later this year, according to Tullow Oil,
the field’s operator.  While Ghana can now benefit from rising oil prices, “I
hope it does not go up much above $100 a barrel,” Tetteh said
in an interview in  Washington  today.  “I would be alarmed if the oil price goes to $120 a
barrel,” she said. “We will not survive on oil alone as there
will be a ripple effect because of higher energy costs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
