Fourteen people were charged with
operating a scheme to acquire more than $47 million in  mortgage
loans  and 22 residential properties in the Sarasota, Florida,
area, prosecutors said.  The defendants are accused in an indictment unsealed today
of lying on financing documents from October 1997 to March 2008
to get loans from banks and mortgage lenders in the Sarasota
area, according to a statement from the  U.S. Attorney’s Office 
in Tampa.  “Mortgage fraud has negatively affected many areas of
Florida,” U.S. Attorney Robert E. O’Neill said in the
statement. “This case represents the depth of that impact and
the tenacious commitment by  law enforcement , at all levels, to
vigorously investigate and prosecute these types of crimes.”  The defendants face charges including of conspiracy to make
false statements to federally insured banks in connection with
mortgage loans, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $1 million fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
