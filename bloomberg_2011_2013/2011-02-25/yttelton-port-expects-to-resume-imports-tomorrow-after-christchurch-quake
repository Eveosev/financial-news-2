Lyttelton Port of Christchurch,  New
Zealand ’s largest coal-exporting hub, expects to resume
unloading vessels tomorrow after port infrastructure was damaged
in this week’s earthquake.  “Fuel and essential supplies are expected to start flowing
through the port from Saturday,” the company said in a
statement dated yesterday and released today to New Zealand’s
stock exchange.  Exports of products including wool and dairy products may
resume from the port in two to three weeks, Chief Executive
Officer Peter Davie said yesterday. A ship with emergency
vehicles and water supplies will arrive tomorrow and general
supplies will arrive Feb. 27, the company said. The port’s oil
berth is undergoing final damage assessment today, it said.  Rescuers have recovered 103 bodies following the 6.3-
magnitude temblor that struck Christchurch on Feb. 22, and say
that figure is likely to rise. New Zealand is the world’s
largest dairy exporter and produces about 40 percent of the
supply of heavy-grade crossbred wool used in carpets.  The port had earlier suffered damage to its wharves, cranes
and other facilities when a magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck the
region on Sept. 4  To contact the reporter for this story: Phoebe Sedgman in
