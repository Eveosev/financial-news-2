U.K. short-sterling futures rose
after data showed Britainâ€™s economy shrank more than initially
estimated in the fourth quarter, as traders pared bets for
higher  interest rates .  The implied yield on the contract expiring in December fell
six basis points to 1.64 percent as of 9:31 a.m. in  London .  Gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, compared with an initial
estimate for a 0.5 percent drop, the Office for National
Statistics said today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
