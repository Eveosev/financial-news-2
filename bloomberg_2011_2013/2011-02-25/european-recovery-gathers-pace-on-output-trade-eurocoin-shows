The economic recovery in the euro
region strengthened in February after slowing down last month as
industrial output and exports rose, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The index measuring economic expansion in the 17-nation
region climbed to 0.57 percent from 0.48 percent in January, the
London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of
Italy , which co-produce the index, said in an e-mailed report.  “The rise mainly reflects a quickening of industrial
activity and foreign trade, flanked by highly positive results
of the main business opinion surveys,” Eurocoin said. “The
rise was limited by a decline in the indicators of demand and by
an increase in the differential between long-term and short-term
interest rates.”  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
