Natural gas futures for April
delivery may rebound from a 12 percent decline this year after
it becomes the front-month contract today, according to a  technical analysis  by Chris Kostas, a senior analyst at Energy
Security Analysis Inc.  The relative-strength index, known as the RSI, for the
April futures fell to 31.62 yesterday. The index touched 31.41
on Feb. 17, the lowest level since Oct. 25. Readings near 30
suggest prices will increase, while figures above 70 can be sell
signals.  “Once March expires, there is a good chance that the April
contract could see upside price movement, most likely up to
$4.40, maybe even $4.60,” said Kostas, based in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “The RSI indicates the contract has been
oversold.”  April gas futures dropped 6.4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$3.872 per million British thermal units yesterday on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price for the
contract since it began trading in 2005.  The March contract, which expired yesterday, fell 2.7
percent, to $3.793 per million Btu, the lowest settlement price
since Oct. 27 for a front-month contract. Gas futures have
declined 14 percent this year.  The April contract gained 7.1 percent in the four days
after Oct. 25, when the RSI declined to 24.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
