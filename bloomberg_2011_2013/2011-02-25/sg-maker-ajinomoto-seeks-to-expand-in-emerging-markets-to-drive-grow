Ajinomoto Co., the Japanese
seasonings maker that first sold monosodium glutamate, aims to
increase operating profit by 26 percent in three years by
expanding in overseas markets including Asia and  Africa .  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, may rise to 87 billion yen ($1.1
billion) in the 12 months ending March 2014, from an estimated
69 billion yen this fiscal year, Tokyo-based Ajinomoto said in a
statement today. The company expects sales of 1.37 trillion yen
in the year ending March 2014.  Ajinomoto, which began selling the food flavoring known as
MSG more than a century ago, is expanding sales abroad as
domestic demand eases with a shrinking population. The company
plans to set up offices in  Turkey ,  Egypt , Myanmar and the  Ivory
Coast , and expects overseas sales of consumer products to
increase by an average 11 percent a year, President Masatoshi Ito said at a briefing in Tokyo.  “We will focus on emerging and developing countries to
speed up our growth, Ito said.  Ajinomoto, whose name means ‘‘the essence of taste,’’ rose
3.3 percent, the biggest gain since Nov. 18, to 937 yen at the 3
p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has added 11
percent in 2011 after falling for the past four years.  Operating profit may climb to 100 billion yen by the year
ending March 31, 2017, the company said. The maker of Royal
Dragon chicken powder is targeting 180 billion yen in capital
expenditure for the year through March 2014.  In addition to food products, Ajinomoto makes amino acids
used in  animal feed . The company is revamping its production of
lysine, an amino acid, to cut costs, Ajinomoto said in October.  Overseas Expansion  Ajinomoto’s last acquisitions were in 2007, when it made
three purchases. The company bought the 75 percent it didn’t
already own in Calpis Co., a maker of dairy-based beverages, for
82.5 billion yen. It acquired New Season Foods Inc., an Oregon-
based supplier of ingredients for instant soup, and also  bought
33 percent of  Yamaki Co. , a Japanese maker of soup stocks.  Ito said the company is seeking to buy food brands and
sales channels, without saying how much it plans to spend. The
company will increase prices and cut costs as rising raw
materials prices raise expenses by a projected 17 billion yen
this financial year, he said.  Sales at the company fell 1.6 percent to 1.17 trillion yen
in the 12 months ended March 31, the second year of declines. Of
the total, revenue from Japan dropped to 812.5 billion yen from
843.4 billion yen a year earlier.  Net income will surge 62 percent to 27 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, and sales may gain 3.1 percent to 1.21
trillion yen, Ajinomoto forecast on Jan. 31. Operating profit is
expected to climb 7.8 percent to 69 billion yen, it said.  Ajinomoto, which sells Rosdee seasoning powder in  Thailand ,
will invest 14.7 billion yen to build a seasonings factory in
the country, it said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
