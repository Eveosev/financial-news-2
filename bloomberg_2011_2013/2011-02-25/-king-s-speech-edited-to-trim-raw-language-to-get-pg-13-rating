A version of best-picture nominee
“The King’s Speech” edited to remove strong language has been
assigned a PG-13 rating by Hollywood’s largest industry
association.  The Weinstein Co., the movie’s distributor, plans an
advertising campaign to inform viewers of changes in the film
before the amended version is released in theaters, the  Motion
Picture Association of America  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Changing the film’s rating to PG-13 will open it to a wider
audience. The “R” rating prohibits admission of anyone under
age 17 unless accompanied by an adult. The movie has generated
$237.6 million in worldwide ticket sales for Weinstein Co. since
it was released on Nov. 26.  The film, about Britain’s King George IV, is nominated for
12 Academy Awards, including best actor for star  Colin Firth .
The 83rd Academy Awards ceremony will be televised on  Walt
Disney Co .’s ABC on Feb. 27.  A telephone call to Ron Hofmann, an outside spokesman for
Weinstein Co., wasn’t immediately returned.  Editors: Donna Alvarado, Niamh Ring  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael White  in Los
