  Saras SpA , owner of the
Mediterranean’s largest oil refinery, said refining margins rose
in the fourth quarter and will likely improve further on demand
for diesel.  While political unrest in North African countries poses
some “short-term bearish risks” for the oil industry, “the
underlying trend for refining margins is positive,” the Milan-
based company said today in a stock exchange statement.  Saras, which swung to a fourth-quarter net loss of 10.3
million euros ($14.2 million) today on depreciation and
amortization charges, reported a 60 percent increase in revenue
to 2.5 billion euros.  The company said production of middle distillates, a
category that includes diesel and jet fuel, failed to keep up
with demand, helping to boost margins. Saras also said cost
cutting and measures such as increased availability of refinery
units will deliver savings of up to 45 million euros in 2011.  Shares rose as much as 2.8 percent today in Milan trading
to a two-week high, and were little changed at 1.79 euros as of
10:00 a.m. local time.  Saras’s Sarroch refinery on the Italian island of Sardinia
processed 287,000 barrels a day in 2010, an 8 percent increase
on a decline in maintenance activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
