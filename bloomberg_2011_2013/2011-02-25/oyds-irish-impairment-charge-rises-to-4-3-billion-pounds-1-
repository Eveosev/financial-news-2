  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  said
impairment charges on Irish loans rose by 1.3 billion pounds
($2.1 billion) to 4.3 billion pounds last year as commercial
real-estate loans soured.  Irish commercial property prices “are expected to be flat
over 2011 and 2012,” Lloyds said in a  statement  today. The U.K.
lender said that it assumed peak-to-trough falls in Irish
commercial real estate of 60 percent in assessing its impairment
losses. It said the impairment loss was “in line with
expectations” following its trading update on Dec. 17.  Market sentiment towards Ireland “continued to be
negatively affected by uncertainty about the political situation
and about the economic effect of the austerity measures
introduced in the Irish budget” in December, Lloyds said in a
statement.  Ireland agreed to an 85 billion-euro international bailout
on Nov. 28 to shore up the company’s public finances and its
debt-laden banking system. It introduced 6 billion euros in tax
increases and spending cuts in the 2011 budget. Lloyds began to
wind down its Irish portfolio last year and outsourced
management to a company set up by former Irish staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
