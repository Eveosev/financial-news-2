Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA climbed
the most in five months in  Madrid  after the Spanish wind-turbine
makerâ€™s 2010 profit beat analyst estimates and it turned its net
debt into a net cash position.  The stock rose 8.9 percent, the most since Sept. 14, to
close at 6.20 euros a share, beating the 0.9 percent gain of the
100-member WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index.  The Zamudio-based company reported 210 million euros ($289
million) of cash, compared with net debt of 259 million euros a
year earlier. Profit slid 56 percent to 50.2 million euros ($69
million), the company said yesterday after the market closed.
Analysts expected profit of 49.3 million euros, according to the
median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
