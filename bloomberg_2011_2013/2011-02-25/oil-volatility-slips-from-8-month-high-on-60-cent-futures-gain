highest level in eight months as the underlying futures
increased by the smallest amount this week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 40.4 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 40.8 percent yesterday and up from 27.9 percent on
Feb. 18.  Oil for April delivery rose 60 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $97.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,

turmoil that has cut  Libya â€™s output may spread to other parts of
the Middle East.  April $105 calls were the most active options in electronic
