  Joe Torre  is expected to be hired as
Major League Baseball’s vice president for operations after a
46-year career as a player and manager, SI.com reported.  The selection of Torre, who led the  New York Yankees  to
four World Series championships and stepped down as manager of
the  Los Angeles Dodgers  at the end of last season, will be
announced tomorrow,  SI.com said , without saying where it got its
information. Major League Baseball said in a release today that
Commissioner Bud Selig will make a major announcement tomorrow
regarding on-field matters.  Torre would oversee on-field operations that include
umpires and on-field discipline, making him one of baseball’s
top executives, the New York Daily News said in January, when
Torre’s discussions with baseball officials first surfaced.  Torre, 70, was a 17-year major leaguer and a nine-time All-
Star. He managed for 29 seasons, becoming the fifth winningest
in major league history with a 2,326-1,997 record, and led the
Yankees to World Series titles in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
