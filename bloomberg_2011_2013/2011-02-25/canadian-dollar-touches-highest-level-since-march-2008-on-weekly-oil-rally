  Canada ’s currency climbed to its
strongest level in almost three years against its U.S.
counterpart as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, had its
biggest weekly gain since 2009.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was poised for a 2.4
percent monthly increase versus the U.S. dollar before the  Bank
of Canada ’s meeting next week.  “The loonie’s been doing very well over the last couple of
sessions,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. in  Washington . “We could see
the Bank of Canada upgrade some of their language regarding
growth, and I think that could provide the Canadian dollar with
a little bit of a boost.”  Canada’s dollar appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 97.73
cents per  U.S. dollar , the strongest level since March 7, 2008,
before trading at 97.74 at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with
98.26 cents yesterday. It gained 1 percent on the week. One
Canadian dollar purchases $1.0231.  Morgan Stanley boosted yesterday its 2011 growth forecast
for the Canadian economy to 2.9 percent from 2.6 percent, citing
higher exports.  “The improving growth dynamics should make the Bank of
Canada more comfortable to resume its tightening cycle,” Yilin Nie, a New York-based currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, and
David Cho, an economics analyst, wrote in a note to clients,
predicting the benchmark lending rate will rise to 2 percent by
the end of the year. “We view April as the most likely time for
the bank to move away from the sidelines,” they wrote.  Rate Expectations  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, is expected to
boost its benchmark by a quarter-percentage point in the second
quarter, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 16 economists.  The central bank will hold its target rate on March 1 at 1
percent, where it has been since September, according to all of
the 8 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  has called a strengthening loonie a risk to
the economy.  “The market is looking for the Bank of Canada to hint that
an early-summer rate hike is in the cards next week,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia
in Toronto.  Crude oil for April delivery gained 1 percent to $98.23 a
barrel after rising yesterday to $103.41, the highest intraday
price since Sept. 29, 2008. Futures surged 14 percent this week,
the most since the five days ended on Feb. 27, 2009, over
concern  Libya ’s political turmoil will reduce supplies.    Trade Surplus   Canada unexpectedly posted its first trade surplus in 10
months in December as energy and metals powered the biggest jump
in exports in almost three decades,  Statistics Canada  said Feb.
11. Exports climbed 9.7 percent to C$37.8 billion, the most
since February 1982 as energy shipments surged 25 percent and
industrial goods such as metals rose 7 percent to a record.    Government bonds  rose today, with the yield on the 10-year
security falling three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 3.29 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent note maturing in
June 2020 increased 22 cents to C$101.68.  The loonie briefly pared its gain after the U.S. Commerce
Department reported that America’s economy grew at a 2.8 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, slower than previously
calculated. The U.S. is Canada’s biggest trading partner.  To contact the reporter for this story:
