  Germany ’s top utilities regulator,
Matthias Kurth, wants builders of new electricity power lines to
lay glass fiber cables at the same time to speed up spreading
access to high-speed Internet services,  Handelsblatt  reported.  The proposal is aimed as a compromise to defuse a dispute
between Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle and Agriculture and
Consumer Affairs Minister Ilse Aigner, who wants to force
telecommunication companies to accelerate building Internet
networks, the newspaper said, citing an interview with Kurth.  Germany lags behind countries including Turkey, Russia and
Sweden in the number of buildings linked directly to glass-fiber
networks, Handelsblatt said. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet
will discuss proposals next month, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Brian Parkin  in Berlin at
