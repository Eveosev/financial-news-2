  BP Plc  said it will shut its Greater
Plutonio oil field in  Angola  in April to install new water
injection equipment to maintain the extraction rate.  The field was pumping at about 95,000 barrels a day a last
week, said  Robert Wine , a London-based spokesman at BP. Greater
Plutonio has pumped an average of about 180,000 barrels a day
since its start in October 2007, lower than the expected plateau
of 200,000 barrels a day, he said.  “Because we can’t inject as much water it affects the
performance of the reservoir,” Wine said by phone today.
Production will resume in May or June, Gaspar Martins, an
administrator for Angola’s state-owned Sonangol EP told
reporters today in Luanda, the capital.  The floating, production, storage and offloading vessel at
Plutonio can process as much as 240,000 barrels of crude oil a
day and 400 million standard cubic feet of natural gas,
according to BP. The company plans to supply gas to Angola LNG,
a project being developed by  Chevron Corp .  Angola’s crude output may drop by as much as 15 percent in
the first half of this year from its 2010 peak due to “chronic
operational problems” at the Greater Plutonio field, the  International Energy Agency  said Feb. 10.  BP expects production of about 3.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2011, compared with 3.8 million barrels in
2010. Output fell 9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
