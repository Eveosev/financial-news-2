Oil headed for its biggest weekly
gain in two years on concern the turmoil which has cut  Libya ’s
output may spread to other parts of the Middle East and
speculation the U.S. economic recovery will boost fuel demand.  Futures rose as much as 1.7 percent before U.S. data today
that may show economic growth quickened and  consumer confidence 
improved. Crude surged to a 29-month high yesterday amid
estimates that Libya’s output was cut by as much as two-thirds.
It fluctuated after the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the  International
Energy Agency  made assurances they can compensate for any
disruption of Libyan supplies.  “Supplies should be secured by other countries as long as
the disruptions are limited,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity
fund manager with Astmax Ltd. in Tokyo. “When oil prices
reached $147 in 2008, the economy was already pushing lower but
currently the economic situation is expanding on a global
basis.”  Crude for April delivery gained as much as $1.67 to $98.95
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $98.86 a barrel at 3:45 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, it fell to $97.28 after climbing as high as
$103.41. Prices dropped as much as 0.9 percent to $96.39 today.    Brent crude  for April settlement rose as much as $2.55, or
2.3 percent, to $113.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it climbed to $119.79, the highest
since Aug. 22, 2008, before settling at $111.36. Brent is up 11
percent this week, the most since March 2009.    U.S. Economy   The Commerce Department may say today the U.S. economy
expanded at a 3.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter, faster
than the 3.2 percent pace the estimated in January, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. crude supplies climbed 822,000 barrels to 346.7
million in the week ended Feb. 18, the Energy Department said
yesterday in a weekly report. Inventories were forecast to climb
by 1.1 million barrels, according to the median of 15 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.    New York  oil’s 14 percent gain this week is the biggest
since the 15 percent surge in the seven days ended Feb. 27,
2009, exchange data show.  Crude advanced above $100 this week as violence in Libya
forced companies including Total SA and Eni SpA to halt
production. Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to fight a
growing rebellion until his “last drop of blood.” As much as 1
million barrels of the country’s daily output may have been
shut, according to a Feb. 23 estimate from  Barclays Capital .  Libya, which pumps 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, is the
ninth-largest producer among the 12 members of OPEC, shipping
most of its crude and fuels across the Mediterranean to  Europe .
The country has the largest reserves in  Africa .  Price Swings  Prices swung the most in a year yesterday as Saudi Arabia
and the IEA moved to allay concern that Libya’s lost output
would lead to a supply shortfall. Brent traded in a range of
$10.19, the most since Sept. 29, 2009, while New York’s West
Texas Intermediate fluctuated in a range of $7.79 a barrel.  The Paris-based IEA said it is ready to release emergency
stockpiles, if needed. Saudi Arabia and other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said they won’t
wait for an emergency meeting of the group to increase output,
according to a person with knowledge of producer-nation policy.  OPEC is prepared to meet any shortage if needed,  Saudi
Arabia  Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said Feb. 22. The country pumps
8.4 million barrels a day and says it has the ability to bring
on a further 4 million.  Crude Supplies  The production cuts in Libya were the first instance of
crude supplies being reduced by the civil unrest spreading
through the Middle East and North Africa.  Protests ignited by the ouster of Tunisia’s president last
month and fanned by the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have also spread to Yemen and Bahrain, prompting Saudi
Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, to introduce moves
intended to increase  living standards .  While OPEC spare capacity is sufficient to make up for any
shortfall from Libya, there is a “significant upside risk” to
prices if the unrest starts to reduce supplies from other oil-
producing countries, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a Feb. 23
report.  Nomura Holdings Inc. predicted on the same day that  oil
prices  may surge to $220 on the Libyan outages and any expansion
into neighboring  Algeria .  Oil may gain next week amid the Middle East turmoil, a
Bloomberg News survey showed. Twenty-three of 40 analysts, or 58
percent, forecast WTI futures will climb through March 4. Last
week, 44 percent said crude would increase.  Brent crude has gained every week since protests spread
into Egypt on Jan. 25. About 3.5 percent of global oil output is
shipped through  Egypt  via the  Suez Canal  and adjacent Suez-
Mediterranean Pipeline.  New York’s gains have lagged behind Brent’s as a crude glut
in the U.S. suppresses prices. WTI futures have risen 12 percent
since Jan. 24, compared with 17 percent for Brent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
