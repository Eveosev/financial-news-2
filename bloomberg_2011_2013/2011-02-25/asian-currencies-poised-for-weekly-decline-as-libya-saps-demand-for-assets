Asian currencies completed a weekly
decline, led by the  Taiwan dollar  and South Korea’s won, as an
uprising in Libya pushed up oil prices and sapped demand for
emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies, had its worst week since Jan.
7 after crude climbed to a 29-month high of $103.41 a barrel
yesterday on escalating political turmoil in Libya, holder of
Africa’s largest oil reserves. Global funds sold $1.5 billion
more Taiwanese, South Korean and Indonesian stocks than they
bought this week through yesterday, exchange data show.  “Geopolitical risks increased risk-aversion sentiment in
the region,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Asian markets continued to
experience foreign outflows.”    Taiwan ’s dollar slumped 1.2 percent this week to NT$29.754
versus the greenback as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. South Korea’s won dropped 1.3
percent to 1,126.45, the Philippine peso weakened 0.8 percent to
43.708 and the Malaysian ringgit fell 0.5 percent to 3.0505.  Oil prices have climbed more than 14 percent this week,
raising concern inflation will accelerate and threaten global
economic growth. Deutsche Bank AG estimates a sustained increase
of $10 a barrel would cut growth in the  U.S. economy  by 0.5
percent over two years.  Equity Sales  Taiwan’s dollar sunk to the lowest since Jan. 7 after
overseas investors sold a net $1 billion of the island’s
equities in the first four days of the week. The benchmark Taiex
index of stocks retreated 2.8 percent from a week ago.  The peso had its biggest weekly decline since the period
ending Jan. 7 on concern the rising oil price will push up its
import costs.  The Philippines is “watching closely” the tension in the
Middle East and its impact on crude prices, Economic Planning
Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said today. The country imports
almost all of the oil it uses.    Oil prices  rising to record levels spooked financial
markets,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in  Manila . “Markets will remain relatively cautious.”  The won touched 1,135.45 on Feb. 23, its weakest level this
year. South Korea imports almost all of its oil and higher
prices may hurt the nation’s current-account surplus, which
narrowed to an 11-month low in January.  Malaysian Inflation  The ringgit posted a weekly decline after official data
this week showed inflation accelerated to 2.4 percent in January
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since May 2009.  “The risk aversion because of the Middle East was rapid,”
said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Investors are concerned that cash
may be taken out of  Asia .”  Elsewhere, the Indian rupee dropped 0.3 percent this week
to 45.3525 against the dollar, the Thai baht declined 0.2
percent to 30.64 and the Singapore dollar was little changed at
S$1.2751, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s yuan
was little changed at 6.5750, while Indonesia’s rupiah
strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,838.  To contact the reporters on this story:
