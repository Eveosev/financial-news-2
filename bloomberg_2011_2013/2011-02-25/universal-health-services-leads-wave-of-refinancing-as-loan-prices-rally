  Universal Health Services Inc . and  IStar Financial Inc . are leading companies this week that have
announced more than $14 billion in loan transactions to lower
interest-rate expense or extend their maturity schedules amid a
rally in prices.  Universal Health, the operator of more than 100 U.S.
medical facilities, is arranging a $3.45 billion loan to
refinance existing debt, which will lower interest cost by 1.5
percent, according to a person familiar with the matter who
declined to be identified because the talks are private.  Prices in the U.S. leveraged-loan market are approaching a
three-year high as a record amount of new investments have
flowed into the debt allowing the neediest borrowers to
refinance. Low  interest rates  and a stronger economic outlook
have pushed yields lower, spurring demand in lower-rated assets.  “Repricings continue, which certainly reflects a healthy
demand for the asset combined with -- at least from a U.S.
perspective -- a more comfortable and optimistic view of the
future,” said Leland Hart, money manager at New York-based
BlackRock Inc., which oversees more than $20 billion in
leveraged-finance assets.  The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, dropped 0.2 cent yesterday to 96.09 cents on
the dollar. On Feb. 14, it closed at 96.48 cents on the dollar,
the highest level since November 2007 and up from a low of 59.2
cents on Dec. 17, 2008, three months after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed.  Low Default Rate  The  Federal Reserve ’s decision to keep benchmark interest
rates at almost zero while purchasing Treasuries has eased
access to debt financing and helped push down default rates. The
speculative-grade default rate fell to 2.75 percent at the end
of January, its lowest level since August 2008 and down from 11
percent at the end of January 2010, according to rating company
S&P.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to the highest
since April 2008, reflecting an improving jobs picture. The
gauge of  consumer confidence , formerly the ABC News U.S. Weekly
Consumer Comfort Index, was minus 39.2 in the week to Feb. 20,
compared with minus 43.4 the prior week. Forty-nine percent of
those polled held positive views on their financial situation,
the most in a year.  The Fed raised its inflation-adjusted economic growth
forecast to 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent, according to the minutes
of a Jan. 25-26 meeting released last week. Central bankers said
in November that gross domestic product would grow at 3 percent
to 3.6 percent.  “The more benign economic outlook and the falling default
rate, combined with the potential for rising interest rates, has
made the asset class look more attractive,” said BlackRock’s
Hart. “Even with the rally, what you’re getting paid today on a
relative or absolute basis is very attractive.”  IStar’s Refinancing  IStar, the commercial real-estate lender that was facing
bankruptcy as recently as September, said the $3 billion in
loans it’s seeking will be split equally between portions due in
2013 and 2014, according to a statement yesterday announcing
fourth-quarter results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is arranging the
financing package for the New York-based company.  A $1.5 billion A-1 portion will mature in June 2013 and a
$1.5 billion A-2 slice comes due in June 2014, the company said
in the statement. Amortization payments will be applied first to
the A-1 loan and borrowings under the credit pact will be
collateralized by a first lien on $3.75 billion of assets,
primarily performing loans and corporate tenant-lease assets,
IStar said.  Term Loan Pricing  The company is proposing to pay 3.25 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate for the portion due June
2013, and 4.75 percentage points more than the lending benchmark
on the part due June 2014, according to a person, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private. Libor on both
loans will have a 1.25 percent floor.  The tranche due 2013 is expected to price at 99.5 cents on
the dollar and the piece due 2014 is expected to price at 98.5
cents, the person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and
boosting the yield for investors.  Proceeds from the transaction will be used to refinance
IStar’s secured bank facilities due in June 2011 and 2012 and to
repay some of its unsecured debt that matures in 2011, according
to the statement.  Once the financing is complete, 29 percent of IStar’s debt
will mature over the next two years, down from the current 72
percent, making its maturity profile more manageable, according
to a Feb. 23 report by  Fitch Ratings . Upon completion of the
deal Fitch expects to raise the company’s issuer default rating
to B- from C.  “Despite the improvement in debt maturity profile pro
forma for the refinancing transaction, the quality of the
company’s loan portfolio continues to be challenged, with non-
accrual loans representing over 43 percent of IStar’s gross loan
portfolio balance as of Sept. 30, 2010,” New York-based analyst
Steven Marks wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
