Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based
currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd., comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency gained
0.1 percent to 45.72 per dollar as of 11:35 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.7 percent from the spot rate of
45.39.  “The rupee might continue to weaken for the time being as
the dollar seems to be the preferred currency because of the
Middle East crisis and high oil prices. The concerns on the
Middle East haven’t eased a lot because  oil prices  are still
high.  “Yesterday, there was a sell-off in stocks. It doesn’t
look like the rupee will strengthen because the overall global
scenario is a concern.  “A trading range of 45.45 and 45.65 seems to be very good
for the rupee today.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
