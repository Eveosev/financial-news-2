  Bank of America Corp ., the largest
U.S. lender, may face “material fines” from state and federal
probes into possible irregularities in its foreclosure
processes, the company said today.  The investigations “could result in material fines,
penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default-
servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement
actions, and result in significant legal costs,” the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based lender said today in its annual report to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  U.S. regulators may try to extract $20 billion of penalties
in a settlement with banks that serviced flawed loans, two
people briefed on the talks said this week. Terms of an accord,
from the Treasury Department and Department of Housing and Urban
Development, haven’t been formally presented to banks, according
to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
discussions aren’t public.  “The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny
has the potential to subject the corporation to inquiries or
investigations that could significantly adversely affect its
reputation,” Bank of America said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
