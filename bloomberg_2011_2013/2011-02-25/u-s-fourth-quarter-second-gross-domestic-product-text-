Following is the text of the Gross Domestic
Product from the Commerce Department.  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by
labor and property located in the  United States  -- increased at an annual rate
of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, (that is, from the third quarter
to the fourth quarter), according to the "second" estimate released by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the third quarter, real GDP increased 2.6
percent.  The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data
than were available for the "advance" estimate issued last month.  In the
advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 3.2 percent (see "Revisions" on
page 3).  The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected
positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports,
and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative
contributions from private inventory investment and state and local  government
spending .  Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP,
decreased.  The small fourth-quarter acceleration in real GDP primarily reflected a
sharp downturn in imports, an acceleration in PCE, an upturn in residential
fixed investment, and an acceleration in exports that were mostly offset by
downturns in private inventory investment and in federal government spending,
a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment, and a downturn in state and
local government spending.  Final sales of computers added 0.30 percentage point to the fourth-
quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.29 percentage point to the third-
quarter change.  Motor vehicle output subtracted 0.31 percentage point from
the fourth-quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.49 percentage point to
the third-quarter change.  _______________________  FOOTNOTE.--Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally adjusted
annual rates, unless otherwise specified.  Quarter-to-quarter dollar changes
are differences between these published estimates.  Percent changes are
calculated from unrounded data and are annualized.  Real√ºEestimates are in
chained (2005) dollars.  Price indexes are chain-type measures.  This news release is available on BEAs Web site along with the Technical
Note and Highlights related to this release. _______________________  The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid
by U.S. residents, increased 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the same
increase as in the advance estimate; this index increased 0.7 percent in the
third quarter.  Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross
domestic purchases increased 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with
an increase of 0.4 percent in the third.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 4.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 2.4 percent in the third.
Durable goods increased 21.0 percent, compared with an increase of 7.6
percent.  Nondurable goods increased 4.8 percent, compared with an increase of
2.5 percent.  Services increased 1.4 percent, compared with an increase of 1.6
percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 5.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with an increase of 10.0 percent in the third.
Nonresidential structures increased 4.5 percent, in contrast to a decrease of
3.5 percent.  Equipment and software increased 5.5 percent, compared with an
increase of 15.4 percent.  Real residential fixed investment increased 2.8
percent, in contrast to a decrease of 27.3 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 9.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with an increase of 6.8 percent in the third.  Real imports
of goods and services decreased 12.4 percent, in contrast to an increase of
16.8 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment
decreased 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase of 8.8
percent in the third.  National defense decreased 2.1 percent, in contrast to
an increase of 8.5 percent.  Nondefense increased 3.7 percent, compared with
an increase of 9.5 percent.  Real state and local government consumption
expenditures and gross investment decreased 2.4 percent, in contrast to an
increase of 0.7 percent.  The change in real private inventories subtracted 3.70 percentage points
from the fourth-quarter change in real GDP, after adding 1.61 percentage
points to the third-quarter change.  Private businesses increased inventories
$7.1 billion in the fourth quarter, following increases of $121.4 billion in
the third quarter and $68.8 billion in the second.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private
inventories -- increased 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an
increase of 0.9 percent in the third.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods
and services wherever produced -- decreased 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter,
in contrast to an increase of 4.2 percent in the third.  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of goods
and services -- increased 3.2 percent, or $115.9 billion, in the fourth
quarter to a level of $14,861.0 billion.  In the third quarter, current-dollar
GDP increased 4.6 percent, or $166.4 billion.  Revisions  The downward revision to the percent change in real GDP primarily
reflected an upward revision to imports and downward revisions to state and
local government spending and to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) that
were partly offset by an upward revision to exports.  Adv.   Second  (Percent change from preceding quarter)  Real GDP...............................     3.2        2.8
Current-dollar GDP.....................     3.4        3.2
Gross domestic purchases price index...     2.1        2.1  2010 GDP  Real GDP increased 2.8 percent in 2010 (that is, from the 2009 annual
level to the 2010 annual level), in contrast to a decrease of 2.6 percent in
2009.  The increase in real GDP in 2010 primarily reflected positive
contributions from private inventory investment, exports, PCE, nonresidential
fixed investment, and federal government spending. Imports, which are a
subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The upturn in real GDP primarily reflected upturns in exports, in
nonresidential fixed investment, in PCE, and in private inventory investment
and a smaller decrease in residential fixed investment that were partly offset
by an upturn in imports.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.3 percent in
2010, in contrast to a decrease of 0.2 percent in 2009.  Current-dollar GDP increased 3.8 percent, or $538.8 billion, in 2010.
In contrast, current-dollar GDP decreased 1.7 percent, or $250.1 billion, in
2009.  During 2010 (that is, measured from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the
fourth quarter of 2010), real GDP increased 2.7 percent.  Real GDP increased
0.2 percent during 2009.  The price index for gross domestic purchases
increased 1.2 percent during 2010, compared with an increase of 0.5 percent
during 2009.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department,  http://www.bea.gov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
