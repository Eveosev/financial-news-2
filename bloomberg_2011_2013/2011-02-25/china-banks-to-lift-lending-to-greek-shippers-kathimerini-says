Chinese banks may provide Greek
shipowners with as much as $10 billion in financing to purchase
vessels built in  China ,  Kathimerini  reported.  Funding terms from Bank of China, China Development Bank
and Export-Import Bank of China will be among the most favorable
in the international market, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified officials from the three banks who met this week
with Greek shipping minister Yiannis Diamantidis in China.  A $5 billion shipping fund will be set up to strengthen
relations between China’s and Greece’s maritime industries and
facilitate the sale of Chinese-built ships to Greeks, Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in October during a visit to Athens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
