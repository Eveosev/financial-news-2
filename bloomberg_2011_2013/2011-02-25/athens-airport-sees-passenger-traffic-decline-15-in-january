Athens International Airport SA  said
passenger traffic declined 15 percent in January from the same
month a year earlier as  Greece ’s economic crisis hit domestic
travel.  The number of people passing through Greece’s biggest
airport dropped to 897,368 from 1.1 million in the same month a
year earlier, according to a statement posted on the company’s
 website  today.  The number of domestic passengers in the first month of the
year fell 28 percent to 323,875, according to the statement.
Travel budgets have been hit by government-imposed austerity
measures, including wage cuts and higher sales taxes agreed in
exchange for emergency loans from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  last May to avoid a default.  International travelers passing through the airport fell
4.5 percent to 573,493 in January, the statement showed.  Athens airport is majority-owned by the Greek state and
managed by German construction company  Hochtief AG .  Tourism accounts for 16 percent of Greece’s gross domestic
product and about one in five jobs, according to the  World
Travel and Tourism Council , an industry group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
