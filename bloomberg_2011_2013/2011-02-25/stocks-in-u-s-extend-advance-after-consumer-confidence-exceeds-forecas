U.S. stocks extended gains after a
measure of  consumer confidence  rose more than economists
estimated.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index climbed 0.7 percent to
1,315.09 at 9:56 a.m. in  New York .  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment for February climbed to 77.5 from 74.2 the
prior month, a report today showed.  Economists projected the gauge would rise to 75.5,
according to the median of 59 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates ranged from 74.8 to 78. The index averaged 89
in the five years leading up the recession that began in
December 2007 and ended in June 2009. The preliminary reading
issued earlier this month was 75.1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
