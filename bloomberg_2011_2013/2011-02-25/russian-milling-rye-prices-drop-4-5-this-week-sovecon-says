Milling rye led declines of Russian
grains prices this week, falling 4.5 percent to 7,400 rubles
($255) a metric ton, the Moscow-based researcher  SovEcon  said
on its website today.  The fourth-grade wheat and feed barley each fell 50 rubles
to 6,750 rubles and 8,750 rubles a ton, respectively. The third-
