A forensic examination of bullets
used by rebels in  Senegal â€™s separatist province Casamance showed
that  Iran  had supplied the weapons, President Abdoulaye Wade
said at a ministerial meeting yesterday, according to the
minutes of that meeting e-mailed by the Communication Ministry.  The West African nation, a member state in the Organization
of Islamic Countries, broke ties with Iran on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
