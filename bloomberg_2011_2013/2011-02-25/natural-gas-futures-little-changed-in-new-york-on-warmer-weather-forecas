Natural gas futures rose, gaining
for the first week in five, on speculation that an 9 percent
price decline this year was enough to boost demand.  Gas for April delivery advanced 3.4 percent as it started
trading as a front-month contract today. The March contract
expired at $3.793 per million British thermal units yesterday,
the lowest settlement price in almost four months, as mild
weather crimped demand.  “The market declined yesterday into the expiration of the
March contract,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group
Inc., a consulting company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “Gas
down at the $3.80 range is an attractive level. I would look for
a retrace back up to the $4.20 area.”  Natural gas for April delivery rose 13.3 cents to settle at
$4.005 per million Btu at 2:37 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Gas futures gained 3.3 percent for the week.  The April contract may move up to $4.40, according to
technical analysis of the relative-strength index by Chris Kostas, a senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc.  The index, known as the RSI, for the April futures fell to
31.62 yesterday. Readings near 30 suggest prices will increase,
while figures above 70 can be sell signals.  Mild Weather  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit
higher than average in the East and Midwest through March 6,
according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in
Rockville,  Maryland .  “The weather is moderating and it’s reducing gas demand,”
said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta.  The high temperature in  Washington  on Feb. 28 will be 68
degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius), 18 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The high in New York will be 56, 12 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas storage fell 81 billion cubic feet last week to 1.83
trillion, the smallest withdrawal since the week ended Nov. 26,
the department said yesterday.  Inventories were 3.2 percent below the five-year average
compared with 6.3 percent the previous week. A deficit to year-
earlier supplies narrowed to 2.6 percent from 6.9 percent.  Gas inventories may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet by the
end of March, down from 1.662 trillion a year earlier, the
Energy Department estimated on Feb. 8 in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
237,029 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 300,000. Volume was 244,979 yesterday. Open interest was
948,058 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
826,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
