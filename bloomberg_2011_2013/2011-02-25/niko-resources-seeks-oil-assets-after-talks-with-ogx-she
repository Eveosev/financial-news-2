  Niko Resources Ltd ., a Canadian
company that explores for oil and gas in seven countries, said
it is planning to bid for Brazilian oil blocks or buy stakes in
existing exploration areas.  Calgary-based Niko has studied areas  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA , Royal Dutch Shell Plc., and Petra Energia SA
are selling in Brazil, Marty Wittstrom, Niko’s general manager
for South America, said today in an interview in Rio de Janeiro.
Niko is also trying to contact Galp Energia SGPS SA, Portugal’s
biggest oil company, about a possible partnership, he said.  Oil companies including BP Plc., Sinochem Group and Total
SA have bought stakes in Brazilian oil projects over the past
year as the country increases production.  Brazil  holds the two
largest oil discoveries in the Americas in over three decades.  “We’re on the hunt for the right entry point,” Wittstrom
said. “Niko is developing a competency in deepwater
exploration, so it’s natural to what we’ve gravitated towards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
