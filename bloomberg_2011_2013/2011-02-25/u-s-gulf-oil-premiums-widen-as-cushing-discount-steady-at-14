U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened as the benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate, priced in
Cushing, Oklahoma, held steady at about $14 compared with its
European counterpart.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, the
basis for European and West African crudes, narrowed 2 cents to
$14.06 at 1:31 p.m. in  New York . The differential settled at a
record $15.94 Feb. 16.  When Brent is higher than WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oils
priced against Brent. The spread averaged 63 cents in 2010.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 75 cents to $19.75
a barrel at 12:12 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI also
strengthened 75 cents, to $19.50.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI strengthened $2 to $15 a barrel, while Poseidon’s
premium widened $1.65 to $15.25 over the benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened 25 cents to
$18.25. Southern Green Canyon’s discount narrowed $1.80 a barrel
to $14 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 25 cents to $3.75. WTS
is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced
by imports.  Syncrude’s premium gained $1.15 to $8.15 a barrel. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25
cents to $26.25.    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP ’s Platte oil pipeline
system was oversubscribed in March between Guernsey, Wyoming,
and Wood River, Illinois, resulting in a 53-percent
apportionment, the company said yesterday in an e-mail. The
pipeline’s capacity will be about 170,000 barrels a day, Kinder
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
