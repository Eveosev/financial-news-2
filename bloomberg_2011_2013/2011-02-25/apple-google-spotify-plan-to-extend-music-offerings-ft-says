  Apple Inc .,  Google Inc . and Spotify
Ltd., a European music-streaming service based in the U.K., are
pressing ahead with plans to deliver digital music services as
early as this summer, the Financial Times reported.  Apple will use remote storage, known as the cloud, to
enable iTunes users to back up their collections and get access
to them by way of any Apple devices, the newspaper said, citing
several unidentified music-industry executives.  Google has told labels it wants to start its own music-
download store and is in talks aimed at concluding rights
agreements it will need; the company hopes to combine the
download store with a digital locker service, so users can keep
copies of their media in the cloud, the FT said, citing three
unidentified people familiar with the talks.  Spotify is in talks to introduce its unlimited subscription
service in the U.S. and potential investors, including Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers, a U.S. venture-capital firm, may
provide $100 million of funding that would value Spotify at $1
billion, the newspaper said.  Apple, Google and Spotify declined to comment, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
