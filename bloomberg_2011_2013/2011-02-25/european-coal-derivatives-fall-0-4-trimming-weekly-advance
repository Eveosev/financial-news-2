Benchmark European coal derivatives
fell, trimming a weekly advance.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year slid 50 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $120 a
metric ton at 9:40 a.m. in  London . A close at that level would
be a 0.3 percent gain for this week.  The data are drawn from information supplied by ICAP Plc,
