Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. said it
won an order worth 1.35 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to build a
floating oil production and storage unit as rising crude prices
prompt energy companies to boost investments.  The unit will be delivered to a “major  oil company  in
Europe” by May 1, 2016, the Ulsan, South Korea-based company
said today in a regulatory filing, without elaboration.  Maeil
Business Newspaper  said the customer was  BP Plc , citing
unidentified industry officials.  Hyundai Heavy said in December that it expects total orders
to climb to $26.6 billion this year, the highest since 2008, as
oil producers including Total SA and Petroleo Brasileiro SA
boost spending to meet rising demand for fuel. Crude prices
jumped 15 percent last year and passed $100 a barrel this week
amid political instability in  Libya  and other Arab nations.  Hyundai Heavy, the world’s biggest shipyard, rose 1.1
percent to close at 451,500 won in Seoul before the order
announcement. The stock has more than doubled in the past year
compared with a 24 percent climb in  South Korea ’s Kospi index.  The company won orders worth about $2.1 billion for four
drill ships with options to build three more earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
