The dollar remained higher against a
basket of currencies of its major trade partners after data
showed U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter was slower
than initially estimated.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against six major counterparts, was up 1 percent
at 8:40 a.m. in  New York .  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2.8 percent
annual pace in the fourth quarter, compared with an earlier
estimate of 3.2 percent. The forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 3.3 percent increase.  The Swiss franc earlier retreated from a record high
against the dollar on speculation the Libyan rebellion won’t
trigger an oil-price rally sufficient to stall the global
economic recovery. The pound slumped to its weakest level this
month against the euro after a report showed Britain’s economy
shrank more than initially estimated in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
