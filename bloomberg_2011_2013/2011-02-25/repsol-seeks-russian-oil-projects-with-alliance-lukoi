  Repsol YPF SA ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, is in talks with Alliance Oil Co. and other Russian
companies as it seeks projects in the world’s biggest oil
producing country, said Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau.  “We’d like to do more things together with Alliance, or
with Lukoil, or other companies,” Brufau said today in an
interview in  St. Petersburg . “Russia is a country that we have
to be in.”  Repsol is the second-largest shareholder in Alliance, a
Swedish-listed explorer and refiner operating in Russia, and is
comfortable with a stake of about 3 percent, he said.  Repsol and Alliance are “trying to work together on
improving the performance of the fields, trying to go for new
exploration blocks or studying the way to cooperate  in a deeper
manner inside the company,” Brufau said.  Brufau said “he doesn’t think” any Russian company is
interested in buying into Repsol.  Lukoil,  Russia ’s largest non-state oil producer, isn’t
interested in Repsol, CEO Vagit Alekperov said today. In June
2009, Alekperov said the Moscow-based company was considering
acquiring shares, RIA Novosti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
