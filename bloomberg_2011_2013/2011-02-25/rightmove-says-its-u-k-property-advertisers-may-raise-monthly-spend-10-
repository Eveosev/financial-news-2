  Rightmove Plc , the operator of
Britain’s  most-visited property website , said its customers will
spend at least 10 percent more on average to advertise
properties for sale or rent in the coming year.  Monthly revenue from the company’s 18,000 advertisers rose
to 379 pounds ($612) per customer last year from 308 pounds in
2009, London-based Rightmove said in a statement today. The
company also reported a 93 percent gain in net income and raised
its dividend.  A fall in mortgage lending has reduced U.K. home sales,
increasing competition between real estate brokers and forcing
them to spend more to showcase properties for sale. A higher use
of premium advertising packages boosted Rightmove’s profit
margin by 6 points to 69.4 percent of revenue.  “We would be confident of double-digit growth,” Managing
Director Ed Williams said on a conference call. Average revenue
per customer above 400 pounds a month is “highly achievable,”
he said.  As more prospective homebuyers switch to online searches,
websites such as Rightmove and those owned by the  Daily Mail &
General Trust Plc  are grabbing a larger share of real estate
advertising, largely at the expense of local newspapers.  Rightmove said 2010 net income rose to 58 million pounds,
or 34.6 pence a share, from 30 million pounds, or 26.33 pence, a
year earlier. The company raised its dividend to 12 pence a
share from a 10-pence payout for 2009.  Rightmove rose 14.5 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 871.5 pence
at 9:38 a.m. in  London  trading. That lifted the market value of
the company to 978 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
