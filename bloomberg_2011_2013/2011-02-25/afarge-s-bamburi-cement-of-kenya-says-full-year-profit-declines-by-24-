  Lafarge SA ’s Kenyan unit, Bamburi
Cement Co., said full-year profit dropped 24 percent on slower
sales and higher electricity prices.  Net income for the year through December fell to 5.3
billion shillings ($65 million) from 7 billion shillings a year
earlier, Bamburi said in an e-mailed statement after the market
closed from Nairobi today. Revenue declined 6.3 percent to 28.1
billion shillings.  The start of operations at a $120 million cement plant in  Uganda  from October will increase annual output of the building
material by as much as 500,000 metric tons and probably help the
company elevate profit this year, according to the statement.  The company’s board is responding to the “increased
competitive environment and continues to implement appropriate
strategies to enhance the group’s growth and profitability,”
Bamburi said in the statement.  Bamburi will pay a final dividend of 7 shillings a share,
taking the total for the year to 8.5 shillings a share,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
