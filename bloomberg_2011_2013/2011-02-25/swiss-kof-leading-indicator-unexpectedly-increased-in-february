  Switzerland ’s leading economic
indicator unexpectedly rose in February, as the economy showed a
pickup in momentum.  The monthly gauge, which aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months in advance, rose to 2.18 from a
revised 2.16 in January, the  KOF Swiss Economic Institute  in
Zurich said in an e-mailed statement today. Economists forecast
a drop to 2.06, the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  “The moderate downwards movement observed in the second
half of 2010 has been reversed,” the KOF institute said in its
statement. “The present pace of growth of the Swiss economy
should gain a bit momentum.”  The report suggests that Switzerland’s economy is showing
resilience at a time the strength of the franc has weighed on
exports. Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann earlier
this week forecast the currency’s ascent to curb economic growth
and elevator maker Schindler Holding AG said on Feb. 17 the
“strong” franc will hurt net income this year.  The Swiss government will release fourth-quarter gross
domestic product on March 1. In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest
economy, growth weakened to 0.4 percent in that period from 0.7
percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
