Innovation is not simple, but there are simple ways to get better at it. One of my favorite techniques is to remember a game that many of you probably played in your childhood — musical chairs. For the uninitiated, it's pretty simple. A group of kids gather around a group of one fewer  chairs. The teacher plays music. When the music stops everyone scrambles to sit in a chair. Since the number of people exceeds the number of chairs, each round features at least one loser. The game continues until the last two kids vie for the final chair. I hope you're still with me, even if you're a bit confused about where I'm going.  The connection between musical chairs and innovation came to me when I recently attended a two-day corporate offsite. The meeting was in an unfamiliar hotel. There were no assigned seats, so in the first day the 15 or so people semi-randomly spread themselves across four tables. Some people sat with friends, some with people they had never sat with before. Then, the next day I watched as people returned into the room. To a person, they sought out the seat they had occupied yesterday. They didn't think about it at all — it just felt like a natural behavior to them. There's nothing wrong with routines or the familiar. But innovation requires taking a fresh perspective. After all, you're unlikely to get breakthrough insight by asking a loyal customer the same question you've been asking them for years. Nor should you expect a group of the "usual suspects" to produce blinding insight without some kind of new stimuli. When you sit in a new seat, you notice all sorts of different things. You can see non-verbal cues from colleagues that might have been out of your direct line of sight. If you have sidebar conversations, they are with different people. You might be able to see out a window or door that was previously blocked.  Whenever I get stuck on a particular problem, I forcibly move myself to a different environment to see if the change in perspective can unlock my brain.  These same subtle changes can influence a group's discussion and train your brain to try new ways to solve old problems.   So play some musical chairs — and I don't mean that you should set your team members against one another. The next time you are in a meeting in your company avoid taking your usual seat. If you lead the meeting, ask everyone to shift around midway through. Take everyone with you to an unfamiliar location. Hold a standing meeting if you usually sit. While it's unlikely that you'll suddenly have a blinding insight that spits out the next Groupon, these simple routine breakers will help you look at things in a new way. And that, after all, is what innovation is all about.
