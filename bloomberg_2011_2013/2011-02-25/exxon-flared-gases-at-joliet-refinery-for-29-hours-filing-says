  Exxon Mobil Corp ., the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,  Illinois , for more than 29 hours,  according to a filing  with
state regulators.  The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
didn’t say what caused the flaring or why it occurred for so
long before being discovered at 5:20 p.m. local time yesterday.  “Operating conditions necessitated flaring, there was no
impact on production,” Tricia Simpson, an Illinois-based
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
