  Naiade Resorts Ltd ., a Mauritian
hotel operator, erased an earlier decline to a three-week low,
prompted by the resignation of Managing Director Patrice Hardy.  The stock closed unchanged at 25.9 rupees by 1:30 p.m. in  Port Louis , erasing an intraday drop of as much as 3.5 percent.  Hardy, who founded the company 20 years ago, said he would
resign as of Feb. 28 following a mutual agreement with
management, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday. Hardy
said he would retain his 6 percent stake in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
