  Google Inc .’s classified-
advertisement service, Google Trader, accounts for as much as 8
percent of all searches from Ghana, according to the company.  The service became available in the West African nation
three months ago and has become a “killer app,” Nelson Mattos,
Google’s vice president of product management and engineering
for  Europe , the Middle East, and Africa, said in an interview
yesterday in Dakar, Senegal, where the company was holding a
conference.  “In terms of the success of people trying to sell goods
finding more buyers, and people looking for jobs finding more
opportunities, this has a tremendous effect on the overall
economy,” he said. Ghana had 4.3 Internet users per 100 people
in 2008, according to the most recent data available from the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
