International Monetary Fund  European
Department Director Antonio Borges said that faster inflation
threatens to trigger higher wage demands in the euro region.  “We cannot exclude the possibility of second-round
inflationary effects if headline inflation increases in the
context of a strong recovery,” Borges said in an interview
published by the Washington-based lender’s IMF Survey Magazine
today. “The  European Central Bank  has strong credibility, and
we support the current policy stance. We also have a strong
euro, which helps fight inflation.”  Inflation in the 17-nation euro area accelerated to 2.4
percent last month, breaching the ECB’s limit. With the euro
area’s recovery gaining strength, due largely to Germany’s
booming economy, policy makers have expressed concern that
workers will seek compensation for rising prices, setting off a
wage-price spiral.  “Faster inflation could very well prove more persistent
than expected,” Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said
yesterday. “Second-round effects cannot be excluded. Hence, the
medium-term upside risks for  price stability  have increased.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
