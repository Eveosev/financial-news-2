  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had its credit outlook upgraded by  Standard & Poor’s , which said the lender’s profit is likely to
rise.  The outlook was raised to “stable” from “negative”
because the New York-based firm “is well-positioned to resume
significant earnings growth as the general economy recovers,”
S&P said today in a statement.  The credit rater said JPMorgan has a “very strong
competitive position” and implicit backing for the company’s
debt from the federal government because of the bank’s size and
importance in the global economy.  “The stable outlook assumes that JPM’s earnings and
capitalization will continue to strengthen, and that it will
retain a sound funding and liquidity position,” S&P said. New
York-based S&P also warned that JPMorgan’s ratings could fall if
the credit quality of the bank’s lending book deteriorates or if  home prices  significantly decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
