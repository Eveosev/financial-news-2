Output of natural rubber from so-
called key producing countries is forecast to grow 4.8 percent
to 9.77 million metric tons in 2011, the  Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries  said in a monthly bulletin. The
group’s members account for 92 percent of global production.  The forecast was below a growth target by member
governments of 8 percent with an estimated output of 10 million
tons, assuming favorable weather conditions and a continuation
of high prices this year, it said.  Natural-rubber supply from key growers may expand 6 percent
in the first quarter as high prices attracted farmers to tap
trees during the low-output season, the bulletin said.  Demand for natural rubber in China, India and Malaysia,
which account for 48 percent of global usage, is expected to
increase this year, the bulletin said. Demand in  China , the
largest user, may gain 9.1 percent to 3.6 million tons;  India ’s
usage may gain 5 percent to 991,000 tons and consumption in  Malaysia  may rise 7 percent to 490,000 tons.  Rubber futures in Tokyo have gained 15 percent this year,
extending last year’s 50 percent rally, as rising car sales led
by China and India boost demand. The price reached an all-time
high of 537.7 yen per kilogram on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
