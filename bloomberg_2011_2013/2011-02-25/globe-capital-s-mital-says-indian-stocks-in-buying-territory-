K.K. Mital, a New Delhi-based fund
manager with Globe Capital Market Ltd., comments on the outlook
for India’s stock market after the government presented the
railway budget for the year starting April 1 today.  India  will
announce its budget for the period on Feb. 28. Mital spoke in a
phone interview.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
rose 68.50, or 0.4 percent, to 17,700.91 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai.  “There was no positive trigger in the railway budget for
private players. Projects that are mentioned will give benefit
to government companies rather than private companies.  “Market sentiment is negative. There is a fear about
corruption and foreign money. Valuations have come down, so the
market is in buying territory. These declines are opportunities
and one can buy on a staggered bases.  “We are waiting for the positive cues from the budget. We
are positive on agriculture companies and on information
technology companies.”  Mital recommends Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s largest
company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
