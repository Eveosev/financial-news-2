The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options decreased the most since November as higher-than-
expected  consumer confidence  pushed equities to their first
advance this week and  oil prices  stabilized.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 9.9 percent to 19.22 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which
climbed 1.1 percent. The VIX has averaged 17.35 this year.  “With the VIX, there’s constant gravity pulling it back to
the mean -- so when you get a big spike like we did on Tuesday,
in order for the fear to continue, there needs to be continued
pressure,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at
Warren Financial Services & Associates Inc., which trades VIX
options and manages $65 million in Exton,  Pennsylvania . “In
this case, with the geopolitical issues, that’s not happening.”  Stocks snapped a three-day losing streak after a measure of
U.S. consumer confidence exceeded estimates. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final index of sentiment climbed
to 77.5, exceeding the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, from 74.2 in January, according to a report
today. Oil swung between gains and losses as Muammar Qaddafi
bolstered defenses in Libya’s capital.  April VIX futures lost 5.4 percent to 21.15, while June
contracts fell 3.4 percent to 22.51. The most-active VIX options
were March 35 calls, which fell 48 percent. The VIX is up 17
percent for the week, the most since the week ended Jan. 21.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
lost the most since Dec. 16. The  VStoxx Index , which measures
the cost of protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, decreased 7.5 percent to 23.10 in  Frankfurt . The
Euro Stoxx 50 stock index rose 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
