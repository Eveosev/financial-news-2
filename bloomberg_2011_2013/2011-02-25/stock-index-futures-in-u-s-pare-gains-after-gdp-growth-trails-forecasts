U.S. stock futures pared their gain
after the economy expanded at a slower rate than previously
calculated.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in March rose
0.6 percent to 1,310.10 at 8:31 a.m. New York time. It had
climbed as much as 0.8 percent earlier.  The revised increase in gross domestic product compares
with a 3.2 percent estimate issued last month and a 2.6 percent
gain in the third quarter, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . The economy, excluding inventories,
grew at a 6.7 percent pace, the most since 1998.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
