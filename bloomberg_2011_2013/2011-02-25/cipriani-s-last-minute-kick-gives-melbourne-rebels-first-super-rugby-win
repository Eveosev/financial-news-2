Danny Cipriani kicked a last-minute
penalty as the  Melbourne  Rebels beat the ACT Brumbies 25-24 for
their first Super Rugby victory.  Cipriani finished with 20 points as the Rebels rebounded
from a 43-0 loss to the New South Wales Waratahs last week in
their debut in the southern hemisphere provincial competition.
The England fly-half booted six penalties and also converted
Stirling Mortlockâ€™s try tonight at AAMI Park in Melbourne.  Pat McCabe and Henry Speight touched down for the Brumbies,
who outscored the Rebels two tries to one, and  Matt Giteau 
kicked 14 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
