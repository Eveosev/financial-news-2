Monojit Dasgupta, secretary general
of the  Indian Tea Association , comments on the outlook for tea
industry and expectations for the federal budget for the year
starting April 1 to be announced Feb. 28.  Dasgupta, whose group comprises 200 companies accounting
for 400 million kilograms of production, spoke in an interview
in Kolkata yesterday.  On duty concessions:  “We would request the government to extend concessional
duty on tea-bagging, packaging and tea leaf cutting-rolling
machines, to zero for three years from April 1 with no special
additional duty.”  On subsidy:  “The orthodox subsidy scheme has helped in correcting the
product-mix and enabled availability of more orthodox varieties
for sustaining Indian exports. The association would request the
government to allocate adequate funds to the commerce ministry
to enable the Tea Board to clear the backlog.”  On production outlook:  “The high cost of production in India has been a critical
factor impeding  India ’s competitiveness in tea. Tea production
in 2009 touched 981 million kilograms. 2010 will see a sharp
decline to around 960 million kilograms due to adverse weather
conditions and virulent pest attacks. This will adversely affect
the revenue stream of tea companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
