Gold futures fell for the first time
in two weeks on sales by investors following the longest rally
since August. Silver dropped for the second straight day.  Political turmoil in parts of the Middle East and North
Africa drove gold higher in the previous eight sessions. The
metal’s 14-day relative-strength index topped 70 in the past two
days, a signal that prices were poised to fall. The metal has
climbed 5.6 percent this month after tumbling 6.1 percent in
January.  “Gold had a corrective move, but new buying will come in
because the geopolitical instability is far from over,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in  Chicago .  Gold futures for April delivery fell $6.50, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,409.30 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. This week, the metal advanced 1.5 percent, the fifth
straight gain.  Yesterday, the price reached $1,418.80, the highest since
Jan. 3. On Dec. 7, the metal surged to a record $1,432.50.  “Gold may still have the potential to advance toward the
Dec. 7 high with support coming from growth in investment,
geopolitical factors and inflation threats,” Tom Pawlicki, an
analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report.  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 25.7 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $32.923 an ounce. Yesterday, the price declined 0.4
percent. The metal gained 1.9 percent this week.  On Feb. 22, silver reached $34.315, the highest since March
1980. The commodity has doubled in the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $7.90, or 1
percent, to $787.60 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. This week, the price fell 8.2 percent, the most since
early July.  Platinum futures for April delivery gained $16.60, or 0.9
percent, to $1,803.40 an ounce. The metal fell 2.2 percent this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
