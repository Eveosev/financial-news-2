  JPMorgan Chase & Co . boosted its
2011 oil-price forecast for Brent oil by $9 to $104 a barrel,
citing supply shut-ins in  Libya .  The $104 forecast “assumes that supply problems will be
limited to Libya, that OPEC will supply additional oil and that
demand for precautionary inventories will moderate over time
from their crisis-levels of today,” analysts led by  Lawrence Eagles  in  New York  said in a note to clients today.  There is a “smaller but significant chance” prices could
head toward $180 a barrel if the disruptions spread, with the
probability at 5 percent, the report showed.  Brent will likely average $108 a barrel in the first
quarter of the year, a 7.9 percent increase from its quarterly
average to date of $100.08 a barrel, the report said. JPMorgan
also raised its 2012 forecast by $5 to $110. The previous
forecasts were issued on Dec. 2.  Brent crude oil for April settlement rose 78 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $112.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it touched $119.79, the highest
price since Aug. 22, 2008. Brent gained 9.2 percent this week.  JPMorgan also changed its estimates for West Texas
Intermediate in the U.S., increasing the 2011 forecast by $4 to
$97 a barrel and lowering the 2012 outlook by $1 to $103. The
oil will likely average $96 a barrel in the first quarter of
this year, the report showed. Oil has averaged $89.47 so far
this quarter.  Oil for April delivery gained 60 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $97.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil touched $103.41 yesterday, the highest intraday price since
Sept. 29, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
