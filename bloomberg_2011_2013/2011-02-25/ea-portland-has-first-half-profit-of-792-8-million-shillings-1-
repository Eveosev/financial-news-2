East African Portland Cement Co., a
Kenyan manufacturer of the building material, said first-half
earnings jumped 26 percent after local sales advanced.  Net income climbed to 792.8 million shillings ($9.7
million), or 8.81 shillings per share, compared with 630.1
million shillings, or 7 shillings a share, a year earlier, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement sent through the  Nairobi Stock Exchange . Sales for the six months through
December rose to 5.2 billion shillings from 4.8 billion
shillings a year earlier.  “Revenue in the first six months grew 8 percent, driven by
increased volume due to strong cement demand in the local
market,” according to the statement. “Export sales declined
marginally as a result of increased capacity and competition in
our main export market.”  Sales should remain on the “growth path” and the start of
operations of a coal-fired plant in December will help reduce
the cost of energy in the second half of the financial year, the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
