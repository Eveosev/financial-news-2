Bank lending in Cyprus rose an
annual 7.8 percent in January, the slowest pace in 14 months,
reflecting weakness in corporate lending, said the  Central Bank
of Cyprus .  Lending fell to 61.3 billion euros ($84.3 billion) in
January from 61.5 billion euros in December, the central bank of
the eastern Mediterranean island said in a  statement  on its
website today.  Household loans increased 9.4 percent to 25.7 billion euros
on a 13 percent advance in mortgages, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
