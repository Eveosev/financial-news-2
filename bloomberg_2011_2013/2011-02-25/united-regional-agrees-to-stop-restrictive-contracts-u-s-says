United Regional Health Care System 
has agreed to stop entering into contracts with insurers that
make it harder for them to work with rivals of the Wichita
Falls,  Texas , hospital, the U.S.  Justice Department  said today.  United Regional, which dominates the region’s acute-care
inpatient service and outpatient surgical services, forced
insurers to sign contracts that effectively banned them from
reaching agreements with competitors, the Justice Department
said in a press release.  The arrangement led to higher health-care costs, the
department said.  “Today’s settlement prevents a dominant hospital from
using its market power to harm consumers by undermining its
competitors’ ability to compete in the marketplace,”   Christine Varney , who heads the department’s antitrust division, said in a
statement.  The settlement, which requires court approval, would last
for seven years, the department said.  The settlement shows heightened enforcement in the
Antitrust Division, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer and
senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington
research group that favors Democratic policies.  “This is precisely what we need in health-care markets to
battle” overly powerful companies, he said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
