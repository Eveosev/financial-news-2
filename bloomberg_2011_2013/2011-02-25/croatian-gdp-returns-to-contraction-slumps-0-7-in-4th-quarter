Croatia’s economy shrank 0.7 percent
in the fourth quarter and 1.4 percent for all of 2010, the
 statistics office  said today on its website, citing preliminary
data.  Gross domestic product dropped following third-quarter
growth of 0.2 percent on an annual basis, the first gain since
2008, according to the statistics office in Zagreb.  The Adriatic Sea nation’s government is struggling to boost
the economy as cash flows from abroad dried up. GDP slumped 5.8
percent in 2009 during the global slowdown after growth averaged
4.6 percent a year between 2000 and 2007.  “The lack of  capital investment  continues to impede the
growth although personal consumption has stabilized,” said
Zdeslav Santic, chief economist for Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d.  Croatia had its long-term sovereign credit rating reduced
in December to one step above junk at  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited the country’s “deteriorated fiscal position and
continuously weak external financing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
