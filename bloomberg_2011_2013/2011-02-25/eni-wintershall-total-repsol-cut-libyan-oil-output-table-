Following is a list of  oil companies 
active in  Libya  with information as to whether they have reduced
production because of violent protests in  Africa ’s third-largest
crude producer.  The output figures are for crude in barrels a day and are
the latest estimate of pre-crisis production unless a timeframe
is given in brackets. Libya produced 1.59 million barrels of
crude a day in January, according to Bloomberg estimates.  All figures except those for  Repsol YPF SA  refer to each
company’s share of production where fields are jointly owned
with partners.  -With assistance from Edward Klump in Houston,  Jim Polson  in  New
