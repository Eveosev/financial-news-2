The Canterbury Crusaders will play
their first two Super Rugby home games in Nelson after
Christchurch’s AMI Stadium was closed following  New Zealand ’s
deadliest earthquake in eight decades.  The Crusaders, who have won southern hemisphere rugby’s top
provincial competition a record seven times, will host the March
4 and March 11 games against the New South Wales Waratahs and
ACT Brumbies 267 miles (429 kilometers) away from their
Christchurch home at Nelson’s Trafalgar Park, the New Zealand
Rugby Union said.  “We are especially grateful to the Waratahs and the
Brumbies who have willingly agreed to change their travel
schedules from  Australia  to accommodate our change of venue,”
Crusaders Chief Executive Officer Hamish Riach said in a
statement.  AMI Stadium operator Vbase said it closed the venue until
March 15 while it assesses the damage done by the 6.3-
magnitude temblor that rocked the nation’s second-largest city
Feb. 22, killing at least 113 people.  The Christchurch stadium is scheduled to stage five pool
matches and two quarterfinals at this year’s  Rugby World Cup ,
which starts Sept. 9.  Local organizer Rugby New Zealand 2011 said two days ago it
would allow rescue efforts to take priority before assessing the
city’s ability to host the games. The assessment will encompass
infrastructure including the stadium, hotels, training
facilities and the transport network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
