Germany’s Maria Riesch extended her
lead over  Lindsey Vonn  in the overall skiing  World Cup  standings
by winning today’s super-combined race in Are,  Sweden .  Riesch finished with a total time of 1 minute, 59.60
seconds in the event, which combines separate runs in the
super-G and slalom.  Tina Maze  of Slovenia was second, 0.4
seconds behind, with Elisabeth Goergl of Austria 0.66 back
in third.  Olympic downhill champion Vonn of the U.S., who had led
after the first leg, finished in sixth place, 1.16 seconds
behind Riesch.  Riesch now leads the  World Cup  with  1356 points . Vonn, who
is trying to win her fourth consecutive overall championship, is
216 points behind in second place.  It was Vonn’s first official race since she pulled out of
the  FIS Alpine Ski World Championships  in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,  Germany , on Feb. 14 to recover from a concussion sustained in a
training crash at the start of the month. Although the American
won a silver medal in the downhill, she had told reporters in
Garmisch the injury made it hard for her to focus.  The women’s World Cup continues tomorrow in Are with the
downhill, and a super-G on Feb. 27. A victory is worth 100
points in the standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
