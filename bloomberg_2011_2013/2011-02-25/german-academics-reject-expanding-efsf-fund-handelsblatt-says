A group of German academic
economists  formed  last year to comment on the euro debt crisis
rejects plans to extend and enlarge the currency’s rescue fund,
the European Financial Stability Facility,  Handelsblatt  said.  About 189 members from the group, which calls itself the
“Economists’ Plenum,” called on European leaders not to
prolong the fund and to agree rules to force insolvent euro-
region states to undergo orderly defaults, the newspaper said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
