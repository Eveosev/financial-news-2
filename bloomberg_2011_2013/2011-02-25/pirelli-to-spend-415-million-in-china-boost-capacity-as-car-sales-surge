  Pirelli & C SpA ,  Europe ’s third-
largest tiremaker, will invest about 300 million euros ($415
million) in China over the next three years to tap rising demand
in the world’s biggest vehicle market.  The company will double capacity at its factory in Jining,
Shandong province, to 10 million tires a year within the next
two years, Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV in the Chinese city yesterday.  Pirelli expects Asia sales to grow 20 percent this year, up
from a previous estimate of 15 percent, helped by rising demand
for more expensive vehicles in China, Tronchetti Provera said.
China’s overall vehicle sales surged 32 percent last year,
helped by economic growth and government stimulus measures.  “For us, what’s important is the high-end, expensive
cars,” he said. “We are not looking for the mass market.”  The Milan-based tiremaker may get 10 percent of sales from  China  within two years from 7 percent how, he said. The company
also plans to invest $210 million by the end of 2012 to build a
new plant in  Mexico .  The tiremaker in November said earnings before interest,
taxes and restructuring costs will climb to as much as 11.5
percent of revenue in 2013, from about 8.8 percent last year.  The price of rubber, used to make tires, will peak this
year, Tronchetti Provera said. Pirelli is working to reduce its
use of natural rubber to offset costs that hit a record this
month.  Pirelli fell 1.1 percent to 5.66 euros yesterday in Milan.
The shares rose 40 percent last year, the sixth-best performance
on  Italy ’s benchmark FTSE MIB.  The company completed the spinoff of its real-estate unit,
now called Prelios SpA, in October and it also sold Pirelli
Broadband Solutions to concentrate on tires.  --Tian Ying, Stephen Engle and Christine Hah. Editors: Terje Langeland, Neil Denslow  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
