European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Mario Draghi  said the bank will ensure stable
prices in the 17-nation euro region, the  International Herald
Tribune  reported.  ECB monetary policy should “first and foremost be geared
toward price stability,” Draghi told the newspaper in an
interview published today. The Frankfurt-based central bank,
which hasn’t changed  interest rates  “for a very, very long
time,” has to “guarantee that inflation expectations remain
well anchored,” he was quoted as saying.  Draghi shares the concerns of Bundesbank President Axel Weber about purchasing government bonds, said Francesco Giavazzi, a classmate of Draghi in his doctoral program in
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who
later served as his deputy in the Italian Treasury.  “He was as uneasy as  Axel Weber  with the purchase of bonds
by the ECB,” Giavazzi told the IHT. “But he is more of a
diplomat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
