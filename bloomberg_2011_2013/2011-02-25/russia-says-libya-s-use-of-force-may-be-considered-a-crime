Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
condemned Libya’s use of force against civilians saying that
such acts may qualify as crimes under international law,
according to a statement on the Kremlin’s  website  today.  “We resolutely call on Libya’s current authorities and all
responsible political figures in the country to show restraint
in order to prevent further deterioration of the situation and
deaths of civilians,” Medvedev said. “Such acts, if they
continue, will be qualified as crimes with all the ensuing
consequences under international law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
