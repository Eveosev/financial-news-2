The South Korean government plans to
introduce preliminary primary dealers to boost competition in
the  bond market , the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said.  Preliminary primary dealers who perform strongly will be
able to become primary dealers while primary dealers who perform
badly will lose the status, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Under a system introduced in  South Korea  in 1999, primary
dealers receive preferential treatment in underwriting  government bonds , while also being required to help support the
secondary market.  Preliminary primary dealers will have no minimum
underwriting requirement while also having fewer privileges,
according to the statement.  There are currently 20 primary dealers in South Korea. The
system for preliminary primary dealers will begin in March, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
