Inflation in Botswana, the world’s
biggest diamond producer, will stay above a 3 percent to 6
percent target this year, posing a “challenge” to monetary
policy, said central bank Governor Linah Mohohlo.  Annual inflation will probably remain outside the target
band until the second quarter of next year, Mohohlo told
reporters today in Gaborone, the capital. Higher value-added
tax, state-set prices and an increase in a levy on alcohol
boosted inflation in 2010, she said.  “The formulation of monetary policy will need to take into
account the impact of short-term price developments on medium-
term inflation expectations,” Mohohlo said.  The Bank of Botswana on Feb. 22 kept its  bank rate  at 9.5
percent as the economy recovers from recession in 2009, even as
inflation accelerated. The annual rate jumped to 7.9 percent in
January from 7.4 percent a month earlier, according to the
country’s statistics agency.  The government raised a levy on alcohol, first introduced
in 2008 at 30 percent, by 10 percentage points in December to
help curb alcohol abuse and increased VAT by 2 percentage points
to 12 percent last year to counter a decline in  tax revenue .  The central bank will maintain the “modest downward
crawl” on its currency to boost the competitiveness of exports,
given inflation is higher than in its trading partner countries,
Mohohlo said.  The pula has weakened 6 percent against the rand, the
currency of its bigger neighbor, over the past year, according
to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
