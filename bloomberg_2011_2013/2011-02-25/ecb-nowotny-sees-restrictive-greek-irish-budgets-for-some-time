European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that euro-area nations
including Greece and Ireland will require “budgetary policy
that will tend to be restrictive” for “some time.”  “We have European aid measures, but they only are
instruments which should ultimately help them to help
themselves,” Nowotny said at a panel discussion in Vienna
today, adding that the loans weren’t “transfers” or “gifts.”  The loans “should help bridge the time until normal
conditions return” in those countries, Nowotny said.  Nowotny also said that the revival of the real economy has
become self supporting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
