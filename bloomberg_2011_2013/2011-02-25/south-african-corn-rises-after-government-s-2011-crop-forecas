Corn advanced in  South Africa , the
continent’s largest producer of the grain, after the government
forecast the smallest harvest in four years.  The crop may fall 14 percent to 11.04 million metric tons
from 12.82 million tons last season, Marda Scheepers, a
spokeswoman for the committee, said yesterday. The estimate lags
behind the 11.5 million-ton median forecast of 14 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg this week.  White corn for July delivery rose 72 rand, or 4.6 percent,
to 1,628 rand ($227) a metric ton by the close of trading on the
 South African Futures Exchange  in Johannesburg. Meal made from
the grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery gained 71 rand, or 4.4
percent, to 1,673 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal
feed  in  South Africa .  Wheat for May delivery declined 19 rand, or 0.6 percent, to
3,135 rand a ton.  The gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
following crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
