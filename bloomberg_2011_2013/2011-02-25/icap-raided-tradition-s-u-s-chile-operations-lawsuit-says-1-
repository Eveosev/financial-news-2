  ICAP Plc  units raided the U.S.-
Chilean operations of Compagnie Financiere Tradition SA, taking
employees and customers, according to a lawsuit filed in New
York.  ICAP, a broker of trades between banks, sought to
“destroy” Tradition’s business by raiding its U.S.-Chilean
capital-markets and foreign-exchange desks and poaching the most
productive brokers, the Swiss company said in the complaint
filed yesterday in New York state Supreme Court.  ICAP’s scheme “is perhaps the most significant and
audacious misappropriation ever in the highly competitive U.S.-
Latin American broker-dealer industry,” Tradition said in court
papers.  A spokesman for London-based ICAP couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment after normal work hours in  Europe .
Tradition’s lawsuit seeks at least $183 million in damages plus
additional punitive damages, according to the complaint.  The case is Tradition Chile Agentes de Valores Ltda v. ICAP
Securities USA LLC, 650521-2011,  New York  State Supreme Court
(Mahattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
