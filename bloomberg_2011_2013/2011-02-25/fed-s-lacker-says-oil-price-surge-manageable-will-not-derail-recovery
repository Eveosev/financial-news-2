President Jeffrey Lacker said the recent increase in  oil prices 
is a “manageable” risk that won’t derail the economic
recovery.  “I think the oil price increases we’ve seen so far don’t
pose a risk to the recovery,” Lacker told reporters today at a
monetary policy conference in New York. “Oil price changes
could have the potential, if they were very large, for slowing
the recovery,” he said, adding that so far it’s “manageable.”  Lacker spoke to reporters at the University of Chicago
Booth School of Business’s annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum.  The Richmond Fed chief sees a “risk that the high
visibility of things like gasoline and food price increases
would pose a little more risk for inflation dynamics this time
than in the past,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
