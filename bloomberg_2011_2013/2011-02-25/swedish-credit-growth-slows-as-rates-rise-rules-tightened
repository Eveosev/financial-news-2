Swedish household credit growth
eased to the slowest pace in at least eight years in January
after the central bank raised  interest rates  and the financial
regulator capped mortgage lending.  Household credit growth slowed to an annual 7.7 percent
from 7.8 percent the previous month, the Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said in a statement today.  The Riksbank on Feb. 15 raised its benchmark lending rate
by 0.25 percentage point for a fifth time since July, bringing
the rate to 1.5 percent. The bank also signaled it will increase
the rate to 2.5 percent by the end of the year to prevent the
economy from overheating.  Borrowing growth should ease to about 2 percent to 3
percent no later than the start of the next economic slowdown to
prevent a housing bubble, Riksbank Deputy Governor Lars Nyberg
said in an interview on Feb. 23.  “We have already done the most important thing by raising
rates,” Nyberg said. “It remains to be seen” whether the rate
path is steep enough to slow down borrowing further.  The Financial Supervisory Authority has capped mortgage
lending to 85 percent of a property’s value since October. The
central bank has said it’s tracking the development to see how
much more needs to be done.  To contact the reporter on this story:
