Flint Hills Resources LLC planned to
put an exchanger associated with a light olefins unit back in
service at its chemical plant in  Port Arthur ,  Texas , according
to a filing with state regulators. The exchanger was shut in
early 2010, the filing said.  “The nitrogen within this exchanger will be displaced, to
the LOU Flare, in preparation for placing the exchanger in
service,” the Wichita, Kansas-based company said in a  filing 
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Flaring associated with the maintenance started today at 3
p.m. local time and was expected to last 14 hours, the filing
said.  Katie Stavinoha, a company spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Flint Hills is a subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
