  General Electric Co .’s workforce
declined 5.6 percent to 287,000 employees last year as the
company shed some overseas businesses at its GE Capital
division.  The number of U.S. employees dropped less than 1 percent to
133,000, according to the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company’s
annual  regulatory filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is shrinking the
finance unit’s total contribution to GE profit and sales in part
by shedding some consumer finance assets overseas while adding
jobs via research and manufacturing projects in the U.S. GE last
year drew 53 percent of its sales from outside the U.S., the
company said today.  Immelt, 55, heads an outside panel of advisers for
President Barack Obama that is focusing on  job creation  and
competitiveness.  GE, the world’s biggest maker of power-generation
equipment,  jet engines  and locomotives, may have to contribute
about $1.4 billion to its pension plans in 2012, according to
the filing. It would be the first such contribution required
since 1987. GE said it doesn’t expect to need to add to the plan
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
