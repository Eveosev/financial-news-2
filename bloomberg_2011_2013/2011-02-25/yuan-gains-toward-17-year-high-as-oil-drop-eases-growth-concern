  China ’s yuan rose to near a 17-year
high as a retreat in  oil prices  eased concern that soaring fuel
costs will slow the global economic recovery.  Crude dropped below $100 a barrel after reaching a two-year
peak yesterday on assurances from the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and the
International Energy Agency that they can compensate for any
disruption in supplies from Libya, which holds the largest
proven oil reserves in Africa. Pressure on the yuan to
strengthen is increasing, according to a statement yesterday
from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  “Asian currencies got a mild lift from softer oil and
commodity prices,” said Hong Kong-based Edmond Law, deputy head
of foreign exchange at BWC Capital Markets. Chinese officials’
reiterations that the yuan will stay on an appreciation trend
also supported the currency, he said.  The yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.5750 per dollar in  Shanghai 
as of 4:43 p.m., according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It has gained 3.4 percent since a two-year peg was
relaxed in June and touched a 17-year high of 6.5654 on Feb. 21.  The central bank set its daily reference rate 0.06 percent
stronger at 6.5757, following a 0.9 percent loss in the Dollar
Index in the past two days. The currency is allowed to trade up
to 0.5 percent on either side of the official rate.  Crude traded at $98.37 a barrel today, retreating from
$103.41 reached yesterday, the highest level since September
2008. China imported 54 percent of the oil it used in 2010,
industry data show.  Chinese companies are facing rising production costs and
increased pressure to manage inflation expectations, the
statement from the ministry said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.09 percent
to 6.4255, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 2.3
percent in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  --Fion Li, Sonja Cheung. Editors: Simon Harvey,  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
