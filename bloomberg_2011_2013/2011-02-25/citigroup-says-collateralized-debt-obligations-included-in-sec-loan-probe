  Citigroup Inc ., the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said its structuring and sale of
collateralized debt obligations is among practices included in
U.S. investigations of how it handled home loans.  The “ongoing” CDO probe is among mortgage-related
inquiries in which the New York-based company is cooperating
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other watchdogs,
the company said today in an annual report filed to the SEC.  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for the  New York  based firm,
declined to comment.  CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packed into
new securities. Citigroup’s last quarterly report in November
had listed CDOs among investment products tied to “various
formal and informal inquiries” into subprime mortgages and
other businesses affected by the credit crisis.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed in July to pay $550 million
to settle SEC claims it misled investors during the 2007 sale of
a CDO. The New York-based firm acknowledged it made a “mistake”
in providing “incomplete information” in marketing materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
