  Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, said it expects “tightness” for the steelmaking
raw material to persist for as many as four years because of
rising demand and a limited number of new projects.  The economic recovery is boosting demand for steel, while
tight supply is driving up ore prices, Chief Financial Officer
Guilherme Cavalcanti said today on an earnings conference call.
The market will be constrained for three to four years, he said.  Vale’s fourth-quarter net income climbed to $5.92 billion,
or $1.12 a share, from $1.52 billion, or 28 cents, a year
earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said late yesterday in
a statement. Vale’s earnings beat analyst estimates after
selling  iron ore  at $121 a ton, up from $56 a year earlier.  The company plans to invest $24 billion this year, more
than rivals  BHP Billiton Ltd . and Rio Tinto Group, to expand its
output capacity to 522 million metric tons of iron ore by 2015,
enough to supply about 10 months of China’s demand. Iron-ore
prices rose to the highest since at least 2008 last week on
rising Chinese consumption and speculation that  India , the
world’s third-largest exporter, will further curtail supplies.  “Vale will continue to post impressive financial figures
as commodity prices, particularly for iron ore, have risen
dramatically,” Jonathan Brandt, an equity analyst at HSBC
Holdings Plc in  New York , said today in a note to clients. The
company should have a “robust” year as it brings on additional
capacity through new projects, he said.  Vale Rises  Vale rose 21 centavos to 49.46 reais as of 13:43 in  Sao
Paulo  after earlier rising as much as 2.3 percent, the most
since Jan. 3. Before today, the stock had gained about 1.6
percent this year, compared with a 3.4 percent decline for the
benchmark Bovespa Index.  Vale was expected to post per-share profit of $1.01 on an
adjusted basis, according to the average estimate of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Revenue more than doubled to $15.2 billion from $6.54
billion in the fourth quarter.  The price of ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to  China  fell 0.4 percent to $184.10 a metric ton yesterday,
according to Steel Business Briefing Commodities Research.  Vale shipped 81.9 million tons of iron ore and pellets in
the period, up 17 percent from a year earlier, the company said
yesterday in the filing. Quarterly profit fell short of a
previous record of $6.04 billion in last year’s third quarter.  Market Imbalance  “The performance of iron-ore and pellet prices over the
year shows the imbalance between global demand and supply,”
according to the company. The imbalance “was the main reason
for the significant revenue increase.”  Annual iron-ore production reached 307.8 million tons last
year, a record for the miner and 29 percent higher than in 2009,
Vale said. The company expects “a robust expansion” of the
world economy this year, “supportive of a strong demand for
minerals and metals,” it said.  BHP plans to spend $80 billion by the end of the 2015
financial year to expand and develop its mines, including coking
coal and iron-ore projects, of which $15 billion will be
invested during 2011.  Rio Tinto  said Feb. 10 that it expects to
invest about $13 billion during this year.  Melbourne-based BHP is the world’s largest mining company
and Rio Tinto is the third largest by market value.  Vale will be “disciplined” with its capital allocation
and wait to see its performance during the year before deciding
on any potential increase of dividend payments, Chief Executive
Officer Roger Agnelli said today during the call with investors.  Copper Target  Agnelli also said the target to produce 1 million tons of
copper a year by 2015 is “still alive” and that it is seeking
opportunities in countries such as Zambia and Congo. Vale
produced 207,000 tons of copper during 2010, up 4.5 percent from
2009, according to its production report released yesterday.  Nickel output for the fourth quarter more than doubled from
a year earlier to 65,000 metric tons, while copper production
climbed to 76,000 tons from 32,000 tons.  The company said last week that its total nickel production
will be cut by about 5 percent this year as it repairs a damaged
furnace at its Copper Cliff plant in  Canada . The company, which
last year said it was expecting to become the world’s top nickel
producer in 2011, will lose about 15,000 metric tons of annual
refined nickel production because of the downtime.  Rain in Australia and Brazil also affected the company’s
production of coal and iron ore in the first quarter of this
year, Vale said. Coal output in  Australia  was cut by 500,000
metric tons, or about 10 percent, and storms in  Brazil  reduced
production of iron ore by about 600,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
