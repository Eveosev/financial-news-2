Japanese stocks rose for the first
time in four days as oil retreated and economic reports tempered
concern about turmoil in the Middle East.  Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest electronics exporter, gained
1.2 percent. Sharp Corp., a maker of flat-screen panels that
gets almost half of its sales abroad, advanced 2 percent after
the yen weakened. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-
largest publicly traded bank, rose 1.9 percent. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s No. 1 carmaker, climbed 2.2 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its rating on the stock.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.7 percent to 10,526.76
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 0.8
percent to 941.93, with more than three stocks advancing for
each that fell. Both gauges had the biggest gain since Feb. 14.  “Shares are correcting from recent declines,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion. “Oil and the
yen have settled down a little bit and that’s helping to lift
shares.”  Indexes rose after assurances yesterday by the  International Energy Agency  it would release oil stockpiles to
offset supply disruptions stemming from the unrest in Libya.
Markets from  New York  to Tokyo declined this week, halting a
rally in stocks that on Feb. 21 drove the Topix to its highest
level since April, as concern about unrest in the Middle East
overshadowed reports the global economy is improving.  Weekly Drop  For the week, the Nikkei lost 2.9 percent, while the Topix
slid 3.3 percent, the biggest weekly drop since August, as oil
surged amid the escalating conflict in  Libya . Leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has lost control of much of the country’s oil-rich east
and at least 300 people have died since a crackdown began 10
days ago on protesters calling for regime change.  Japanese exporters gained after the yen weakened, improving
the outlook for overseas earnings. Sony advanced 1.2 percent to
2,967 yen. Sharp increased 2 percent to 885 yen. Nintendo Co., a
videogame maker that gets about 85 percent of its sales outside
of Japan, climbed 3.5 percent to 25,000 yen.  The yen fell to 113.46 against the euro, compared with
112.99 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A
weaker currency boosts the value of overseas sales when
repatriated.  ‘Ride it Out’  Oil declined, reducing costs for Japanese companies and
easing pressure on central banks in emerging economies to raise  interest rates  to combat inflation. New York oil futures
retreated from $103.41 yesterday, highest since September 2008,
after President  Barack Obama  said the U.S will be able to “ride
out” supply disruptions resulting from turmoil in Libya.  “The crisis in the Middle East probably won’t be resolved
quickly, but it doesn’t look like it will spread to major oil
producing countries like  Saudi Arabia ,” said Jun Nishizaki,
chief portfolio manager at Nissay Asset Management Corp. “It
doesn’t look like crude oil will keep going up.”  Banks also rose after economic reports in Japan and the U.S.
beat forecasts. Mizuho climbed 1.9 percent to 165 yen, while
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest lender,
rose 0.7 percent to 450 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc., the No. 2 bank, gained 0.7 percent to 3,060 yen.  Japan’s consumer prices excluding fresh food declined 0.2
percent in January from a year earlier, the statistics bureau
said today in a report that showed deflation eased for a fourth
month. Economists predicted prices would drop 0.3 percent.  In the U.S., Labor Department figures showed applications
for jobless benefits fell last week by 22,000 to 391,000.
Analysts forecast claims would drop to 405,000.  Carmakers were the biggest support for the Topix among the
index’s 33 industry groups. Toyota jumped 2.2 percent to 3,755
yen and was the most-actively traded stock in Japan. Nissan
Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker by sales, gained 0.7
percent to 838 yen. Credit Suisse yesterday raised the
companies’ ratings to “outperform” from “neutral.” Honda
Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, advanced 1.9 percent
to 3,540 yen after Citigroup Inc. raised its rating on the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
