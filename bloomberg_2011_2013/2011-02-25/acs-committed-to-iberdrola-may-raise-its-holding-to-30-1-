Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA may raise its stake in  Iberdrola SA  to 30 percent
as it battles in court to gain representation on the power
company’s board, Chief Executive Officer Florentino Perez said.  “We are more committed than ever to our holding in
Iberdrola and being its biggest shareholder,” Perez said today
during a webcast, without providing details on Madrid-based
ACS’s strategy for increasing the stake.  ACS,  Spain ’s biggest construction company, already controls
20.2 percent of Iberdrola’s shares and is suing the Bilbao,
Spain-based utility, the country’s largest, to give it board
seats. The case is being heard in a court in Bilbao, and trial
proceedings started on Jan. 18. Phone calls to Iberdrola’s press
office seeking comment on Perez’s remarks weren’t answered.  The building company’s holding, valued at about 7 billion
euros ($9.6 billion), has risen from about 12 percent in April.
A stake exceeding 20 percent allows ACS to incorporate a share
of Iberdrola’s profit in its own earnings rather than just
booking dividend gains.  Iberdrola is also the world’s biggest producer of  wind
energy , and it takes in more revenue than any peer in the U.S.
Iberdrola has rejected ACS’s demand for board representation,
saying the two companies compete in areas such as renewable-
energy services. ACS has said its renewable-energy business is
too small to be considered competition and has put the division
up for sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
