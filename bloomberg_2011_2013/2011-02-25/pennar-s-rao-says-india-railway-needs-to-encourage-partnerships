Nrupender Rao, chairman at Pennar
Industries Ltd., comments on the Indian Railway’s annual budget,
announced by Minister Mamata Banerjee today. Rao spoke in a
phone interview from Hyderabad, where the company, which makes
metal products for railway, automotive and engineering
industries, is based.  “The dedicated rail corridor is a wonderful idea, which is
guaranteed to transform north and west  India . Last year, also
they had announced this but I don’t think they made too much
headway. We would like to see some reality come into the picture.
It’s a huge project. But I hope they would have a separate
organization for doing that. As part of the Railways, it may not
happen.”  Banerjee “also said that she would encourage public-
private partnership, which is a good thing. In our country,
highways have been developed successfully on the PPP basis. When
private sector is in command of the project, it’s easier to fund
it. Railways, so far, have not been greatly successful with PPP
projects.  “Railways have failed to meet the targeted number of new
wagons last year. I hope they put a lot more emphasis on this
and try to put out more wagons this year. As a company which
supplies components to the Railways, we would be happy if more
wagons and coaches are made.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
