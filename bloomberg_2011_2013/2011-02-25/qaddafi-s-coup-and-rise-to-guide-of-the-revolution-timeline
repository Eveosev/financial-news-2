Popular protests that ousted long-
serving presidents in Tunisia and  Egypt  this year served as a
catalyst for demonstrations against  Libya ’s Muammar Qaddafi.
This timeline tracks Qaddafi’s 42 years in power. He holds no
official title and is referred to as “Leader and Guide of the
Revolution.”  June 7, 1942  Qaddafi is  born  near Sirte, Libya, to a Bedouin family.  Sept. 1, 1969  Qaddafi and a group of military officers overthrow King
Idris I in a coup.  1970  The  U.S.  and  Britain  close  military bases  in Libya. About
20,000 Italian residents are expelled.  1972  Qaddafi and leaders of Egypt and  Syria  proclaim a
‘Federation of Arab Republics.’ The attempt at unity fails.  1973  Qaddafi announces the  nationalization  of foreign oil
assets. The Irish navy  discovers  Libyan-supplied arms destined
for the  Irish Republican Army  aboard the ship Claudia.  1975  Qaddafi publishes his  Green Book  outlining his opposition
to capitalism and Marxism.  1978  Lebanese Shiite leader Imam Moussa al-Sadr goes missing on
a visit to Libya. More than three decades later, a former member
of Libya’s revolutionary command council says that al-Sadr was
killed by Qaddafi’s regime and buried in southern Libya.  1984  British police officer killed in  London  by gunfire from
inside Libyan embassy. Libyan suspects are allowed to leave
country under diplomatic immunity. U.K.  breaks relations  with
Qaddafi.  April 9, 1986  President  Ronald Reagan   calls  Qaddafi the “mad dog of the
Middle East” four days after Libyan agents bomb a disco in
Berlin,  Germany ,  killing  two U.S. soldiers, a Turkish woman and
wounding 229 others.  April 15, 1986  U.S.  bombs  Tripoli in response to Libyan-backed bombing of
the German disco. Qaddafi escapes injury but his 15-month old
adopted daughter, Hanna, is killed, along with about 100 others.  June 9, 1988  Qaddafi tells other Arab leaders to  “go to hell”  and
wears a white glove on his right hand to avoid tainting it by
shaking hands with them.  Dec. 21, 1988  Pan Am Flight 103 is  blown up  over Lockerbie,  Scotland ,
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.  1992  The United Nations agrees to an air embargo and other
sanctions against Libya in an effort to pressure Qaddafi into
handing over suspects in Pan Am 103 bombing.  1996  Libyan security forces open fire on 1,200 inmates of Abu
Salim prison in retaliation for uprising in eastern city of
Benghazi.  1999  Libya hands over Lockerbie suspects, UN lifts sanctions.  2003  Qaddafi’s government takes responsibility for Lockerbie,
agrees to renounce terrorism and its nuclear weapons program.
Foreign  oil companies  begin returning to country.  2004  U.K. Prime Minister  Tony Blair  visits Libya and says the
country shares a “common cause” with the U.K. and U.S. in
fighting terrorism and should be viewed as a partner. U.S. moves
to ease sanctions on Libya complicated by Qaddafi’s alleged plot
to assassinate Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.  2007  Libya releases five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian
doctor who faced the death penalty for allegedly infecting
Libyan children with HIV, paving the way for more normal
relations with the European Union.  2008  Qaddafi has himself  crowned  “King of Kings” in Benghazi
by a group African traditional leaders wearing gold crowns and
sequined capes.  Feb. 2, 2009  Qaddafi, who supports the creation of a United States of  Africa , is elected chairman of the  African Union  and denounces
democracy on the continent.  March 30, 2009  Qaddafi storms out of Arab League summit in Doha, and calls  Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah “a British product and American
ally.”  Aug. 30, 2009  During a visit to  Rome , Qaddafi pays 200 young women to
listen to him lecture on Islam.  Sept. 23, 2009  Qaddafi delivers a rambling 90-minute speech at the  United
Nations  during which he attempts to rip the UN Charter, asks  Europe ’s former colonial powers to pay $7.77 trillion in
restitution to Africa and chastises world leaders for dozing off
during his address. His speech follows his failed bid to pitch
his Bedouin tent in  New York ’s Central Park.  Feb. 16, 2010  Libya begins revoking visas and detaining visitors from
most European countries, escalating a row with  Switzerland  over
the 2008 arrest of his son Hannibal and wife Aline for allegedly
mistreating employees. The move follows an earlier Qaddafi
proposal to  abolish  Switzerland.  March 19, 2010  Nigeria recalls its ambassador to Libya after Qaddafi tells
African students visiting Tripoli the West African nation should
be divided into separate Muslim and Christian states.  Jan. 14, 2011  Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali ends his 23-year
rule by fleeing in the face of popular protests.  Feb. 11, 2011  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigns after 17-days of
popular protests paralyze Cairo and Alexandria.  Feb. 16, 2011  Protesters in eastern city of Benghazi begin demonstrations
against Qaddafi’s rule.  Feb. 18, 2011  At least 19-killed in “Day of Anger” anti-Qaddafi
protests.  Feb. 22, 2011  With members of the regime defecting to the opposition and
his control slipping outside of Tripoli, Qaddafi appears on
state television to deny reports he’s fled the country and says
he’ll die fighting the uprising to his “last drop of blood.”  Feb. 24, 2011  Qaddafi, speaking by telephone on state television, blames
the uprising against his 41-year rule on al-Qaeda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
