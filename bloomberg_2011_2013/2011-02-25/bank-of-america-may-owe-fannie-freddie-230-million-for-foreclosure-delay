  Bank of America Corp . said it will
probably have to pay government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae
and  Freddie Mac  an additional $230 million because of delays
foreclosing on mortgages bought by the firms.  Bank of America’s agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac “provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through
workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary,” the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based lender said today in its annual report to
the Securities and Exchange Commission. “In the fourth quarter
of 2010, we recorded an expense of $230 million for compensatory
fees that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of
foreclosure delays.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
