LG Display Co., the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, appealed against the
European Union’s decision to fine the company for fixing prices.  LG filed an appeal on Feb. 23, asking for a reduced
penalty, the Seoul-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The company was fined 215 million euros ($297 million) in
December, along with Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. and four
other display makers, the European Commission said in December.  The company reported its first quarterly loss in almost two
years in January after it reflected the penalty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
