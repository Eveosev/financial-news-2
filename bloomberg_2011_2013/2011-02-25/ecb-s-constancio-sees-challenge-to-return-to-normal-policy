European Central Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio  sees a “challenge” for the bank in
withdrawing stimulus, while saying that an increase in bank
reserves may not spur inflation.  “The bank’s challenge is to go back to normal
implementation of monetary policy,” Constancio said today in a
speech in  New York . An “increase in reserves or in the monetary
base is not per se inflationary,” he said at the University of
Chicago Booth School of Business’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum.  The ECB, which has kept its benchmark interest rate at a
record low of 1 percent for almost two years, is growing more
concerned that soaring energy and food prices will drive up
wages and entrench faster inflation. At the same time, raising
borrowing costs too soon could exacerbate  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis by increasing pressure on stressed banking systems
in countries such as Greece and Ireland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
