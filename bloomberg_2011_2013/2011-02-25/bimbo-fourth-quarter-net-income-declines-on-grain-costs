Grupo Bimbo SAB, the world’s largest
bread maker, said fourth-quarter profit fell 22 percent on
rising grain costs and extraordinary expenses.  Net income dropped to 1.37 billion pesos ($113 million)
from 1.76 billion pesos in the year-earlier period, the Mexico
City-based company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Sales climbed 1.6 percent to 30.4 billion pesos.  Bimbo and competitors such as Nestle SA and  Kraft Foods
Inc . are struggling with soaring costs of commodities, including
wheat and corn, which are prompting the companies to raise
prices to reduce pressure on earnings. Bimbo said it expects
that the “total impact” of its price increases will be
reflected in first-quarter earnings.  The bakery company posted 568 million pesos in
extraordinary expenses. Bimbo said it paid 222 million pesos in
consulting fees after acquisitions in 2010 and it also spent 346
million pesos for “legal contingencies in  Brazil , taken in
accordance with a more conservative accounting policy,”
according to the statement.  Wheat futures soared 47 percent in 2010, while corn has
gained 52 percent. Kraft, the world’s second-largest food
company, on Feb. 10 lowered its full-year earnings forecast
because of rising commodity costs.  Bimbo plans to invest about $400 million in 2011, mainly on
Brazilian and U.S. markets, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Servitje said today on a conference call.  Servitje said the company’s volume of sales may grow
between 3 percent and 4 percent this year. Total revenue growth
may be “higher than that,” he said.  Grupo Bimbo agreed on Nov. 9 to acquire Sara Lee’s North
American bakery business for $959 million.  The company’s shares rose 0.5 percent to 94.4 pesos in
Mexico City trading at 1:41 p.m. The shares have lagged 16
percent behind  Mexico ’s Bolsa Index in the past six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
