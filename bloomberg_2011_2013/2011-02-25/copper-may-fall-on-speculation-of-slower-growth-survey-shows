Copper may fall as protests in the
Middle East and North  Africa  boost oil prices and inflation,
hampering global growth, a survey showed.  Eight of 12 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said the metal will drop next week.
Three predicted higher prices and one forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was down 3.9 percent this
week at $9,475 a metric ton by 2:47 p.m. yesterday on the
London Metal Exchange.  Copper will be “down a bit until things in the Middle East
settle down,” Joseph Gartland, president of H.M. Hillman
Brass & Copper Inc. in Willow Grove,  Pennsylvania , said by e-
mail.  Oil climbed to a 30-month high in London yesterday as  Libya , Africa’s third-largest producer, cut supplies.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Feb. 18.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
59 of the past 125 weeks, or 47 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 8 Bullish: 3 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
