Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, the
owner of Latin America’s largest convenience-store chain, said
fourth-quarter profit rose 21 percent, led by sales gains at its
Oxxo unit.  Net income climbed to 4.94 billion pesos ($407.6 million)
from 4.07 billion pesos a year earlier, the Monterrey, Mexico-
based company said today on its website. Sales, excluding the
beer unit sold last year to  Heineken NV , rose 3.8 percent to
45.7 billion pesos, said Femsa, as the company is known.  Profit was higher than the 3.41 billion pesos forecast by
Marco Montanez, an analyst with Mexico City-based brokerage
Vector Casa de Bolsa. He predicted sales of 46.2 billion pesos.  A manufacturing recovery in Mexico, led by exports in the
northern part of the country, has boosted consumer buying power,
driving Femsa’s retail sales higher. Same-store sales at the
Oxxo chain of  convenience stores  rose an average of 7.9 percent
in the quarter, the company said. Mexico’s economy expanded 5.5
percent last year, the fastest pace since 2000.  Femsa sold its beer unit in April for a 20 percent stake in
Heineken. Net income included 597 million pesos from that stake.
Total sales fell 15 percent from the 53.7 billion pesos reported
a year earlier, which included the beer unit.  Femsa rose 92 centavos, or 1.4 percent, to 67.70 pesos at
the close of  Mexico  City trading. The shares have dropped 2.3
percent this year.  Oxxo Sales  Oxxo generated revenue of 16.8 billion pesos, a 19 percent
increase from a year earlier. The retail unit had operating
income of 1.98 billion pesos, a 20 percent gain. The chain added
a net 415 new stores and had 8,426 at the end of the year.  The company plans to open about 1,100 stores this year, and  capital expenditures  will be $250 million at the retail unit,
Chief Financial Officer Javier Astaburuaga said today on a
conference call with analysts. Femsa had 17 stores in  Colombia 
at the end of the year and will open a “reasonable amount”
there as the company continues in a testing phase, he said.  Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the company’s soft-drink unit that
trades separately, reported on Feb. 22 that fourth-quarter net
income rose 6.9 percent to 3.02 billion pesos as sales fell 3.6
percent to 28 billion pesos.  Femsa’s board proposed a dividend of 4.6 billion pesos for
2011, a 77 percent increase from a year earlier. Shareholders
will vote on the proposal in a March meeting, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
