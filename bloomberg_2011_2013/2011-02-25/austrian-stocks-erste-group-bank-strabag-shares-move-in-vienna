Austria’s benchmark ATX Index gained
0.7 percent to 2,882.05 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Vienna,
snapping six days of losses. Even so, the gauge posted a 3.2
percent drop this week.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Austrian market. Symbols are in parentheses.    Erste Group Bank AG  (EBS AV) declined 1 percent to 37.61
euros. Eastern Europe’s second-biggest lender said taxes and its
Hungarian and Romanian units will hold back earnings growth even
as it reported that lower bad-debt charges helped fourth-quarter
profit rise 52 percent. Net income in the three months ended
December climbed to 278.6 million euros ($383.2 million) from
183.3 million euros a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates.  The shares were cut to “hold” from “buy” at Deutsche
Bank AG after the results today.    Voestalpine AG  (VOE AV) rose 2.4 percent to 32.90 euros.
Austria’s biggest steelmaker was raised to “neutral” from
“reduce” at Nomura Holdings Inc.  “Voestalpine’s defensive business model and focus on
higher value added steel products, along with the strong
performance of the German economy, have helped steer Voestalpine
from the trough to near normalized margins in a relatively short
time frame,” analysts led by Jeff Largey wrote in a note today.  The brokerage raised its share price estimate to 36 euros
from 30 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
