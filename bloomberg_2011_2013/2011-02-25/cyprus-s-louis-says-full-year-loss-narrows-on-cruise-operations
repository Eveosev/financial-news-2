     Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) --Louis Plc, the largest tourism
company in Greece and Cyprus, said losses narrowed last year
after higher sales from cruise operations offset a drop in
revenue from hotels.  The net loss in 2010 dropped to 9.4 million euros ($13
million) from 13.5 million euros a year earlier, Nicosia-based
Louis said today in a  statement  to the Cyprus Stock Exchange.  Overall sales rose 8 million euros to 275.7 million euros
after a 15.3 million-euro, or 8 percent, increase in revenue
from cruise ship operations offset an 8.8 percent, or 7.2
million-euro fall in revenue from hotel operations, according to
the statement.  Louis said its new ship Louis Majesty boosted cruise
activities after starting trips early last year.  The company said it expects a loss for the whole of 2011,
that will be narrower than the loss of 2010 on better results
from cruise and hotel activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
