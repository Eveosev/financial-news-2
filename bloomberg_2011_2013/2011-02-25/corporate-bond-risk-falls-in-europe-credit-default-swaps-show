The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 3
basis points to 398, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis points to 100.5. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers declined
2.75 to 163.75 and the subordinated index was 3 lower at 283.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 2.5 basis points to 184, Markit Group Ltd.
prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
