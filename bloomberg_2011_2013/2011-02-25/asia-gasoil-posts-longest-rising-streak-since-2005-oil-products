Asia gasoil advanced for the eighth
week, the longest rising streak since 2005, as crude costs
climbed. Naphtha posted its biggest weekly gain since July 2009.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan increased
8.3 percent to $949 a metric ton, the biggest weekly gain since
July 24, 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore rose
8.7 percent to $117.15 a barrel, the biggest gain since October
2009.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha jumped to $13.40 a barrel
from $12.10 on Feb 18. A wider reforming margin means the profit
from turning naphtha into gasoline is increasing.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude , or
the crack spread, climbed to $100.29 a ton from $98.94 at the
end of Asian trading on Feb. 18, according to Bloomberg data.  BP Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline loading
March 17 to March 21 from PetroChina Co. at $117.40 a barrel,
traders said. BP bought a similar 92-RON cargo from Trafigura
Beheer BV at $117 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, increased
$7.95, or 6.9 percent, this week to $124.05 a barrel, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices gained for the eighth
week, the longest rally since July 2005. Jet fuel rose $8.10, or
6.8 percent, from last week to $127.  In  Singapore , Vitol Group bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoline from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 40 cents a
barrel below benchmark quotes, traders said. That’s the biggest
discount since Feb. 9.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rebounded 81 cents to
$16.40 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit, was down for a second week.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil declined for the third day,
losing 25 cents to $2.20 a barrel, PVM said. A narrowing regrade
indicates  aviation fuel  is less profitable than diesel.  Fuel Oil  Asian benchmark fuel oil dropped the most in nine months
today. The price of 180-centistoke fuel oil fell 4.1 percent,
the most since May 21, to $641.75 a ton, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price of 380-centistoke  fuel oil ,
mainly used as marine fuel, decreased 3.6 percent to $633.25 a
ton.  The benchmark fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or crack
spread, narrowed to $8.44 a barrel from $9.88 a barrel
yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the viscosity spread, fell $3.5 to $8.50 a ton, the
lowest since Jan. 31.  Itochu Corp. sold two cargoes of 20,000 tons of 180-
centistoke fuel each to Vitol Group at $7 a ton over Singapore
fuel oil assessments for loading from March 12 to March 16, said
two traders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
