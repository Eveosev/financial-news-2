  Ellaktor SA  will appeal to a
European court over a European Commission decision that a mining
company now owned by  European Goldfields Ltd . must repay the
Greek government 15.3 million euros ($21.2 million), Kathimerini
reported, citing unidentified company officials.  A 2003 sale of gold mines by Greece to Ellinikos Xrysos
took place legally and not for less than the minesâ€™ real value,
the Athens-based newspaper reported, citing the company
officials.  Ellaktor owns a 5 percent stake in Ellinikos Xrysos with
the remaining shares belonging to European Goldfields, in which
Ellaktor has a 19 percent holding, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
