ChaCha Search Inc., the operator of
a question-and-answer website, sued  HTC Corp . for trademark
infringement over the planned introduction of a smartphone
called the ChaCha.  ChaCha, based in Carmel, Indiana, seeks a preliminary
injunction that would prevent HTC from using the name or
trademark, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in
Indianapolis on Feb. 22.  HTC, based in Taoyuan, Taiwan, announced this month it
plans to release the HTC ChaCha phone in Europe and  Asia  during
the second quarter and in the U.S. later this year, according to
the complaint.  “HTC’s use of the entirety of the ChaCha mark in
connection with the infringing phone is likely to cause
consumers to mistakenly believe that there is an affiliation
between ChaCha and the infringing phone,” ChaCha said in its
complaint.  ChaCha, which registered its U.S. trademark in 2007, said
it contacted HTC by letter about its concerns and the Taiwanese
company “has yet to substantively respond.”  “HTC does not comment on open litigation,” Jessa Moon, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The case is ChaCha Search Inc. v. HTC America Corp. 11-
0262, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Indiana 
(Indianapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
