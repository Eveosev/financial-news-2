  Belgacom SA , the largest telephone
company in Belgium, said it will maintain its dividend next year
even as earnings may drop as much as 2 percent and resumed
buybacks after quarterly earnings beat analyst estimates.  Belgacom will pay a dividend of 2.18 euros ($3.01) a share
over 2011 earnings and buy back as much as 200 million euros of
shares by the end of next year, the Brussels-based company said
today in a statement. Fourth-quarter earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortization and special items rose 6 percent
to 495 million euros, beating the 480.8 million-euro average
estimate of 16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Solid full-year earnings with a buyback as cherry on the
cake,” Nico Melsens, an analyst at KBC Securities NV in
Brussels, wrote in a note. “All in all, Belgacom published a
very decent outlook.” Melsens kept his “hold” rating on the
stock and projects the stock may drop to 26.30 euros in the next
six months.    Belgium ’s state-controlled telephone company generates an
increasing proportion of its revenue from lower-margin businesses
including international carrier services and digital television
and needs to offset declining voice revenue with cost savings,
workforce reductions and price increases. Chief Executive Officer
Didier Bellens promised a year ago to pay out in coming years
most of cash not required for reinvestment, which climbed 23
percent to 980 million euros last year.  Fourth-Best Performance  Belgacom retreated 4 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 27.22 euros
at the 5:35 p.m. close of trading on Euronext Brussels. The
shares have gained 8.3 percent so far this year, the fourth-best
performance among the 20 companies included in the Stoxx 600
Telecommunications Index.  The phone company forecast 2011 Ebitda excluding special
items may drop as much as 2 percent to 1.94 billion euros, twice
the rate of its forecast revenue decline. That compares with
analyst projections of 1.92 billion euros, the average of 22
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Capital spending  may climb to as
much as 12 percent of sales, or about 784 million euros, from 734
million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
