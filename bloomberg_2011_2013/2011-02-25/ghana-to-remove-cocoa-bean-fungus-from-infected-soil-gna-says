Ghana  is attempting a new way to
control fungus and rehabilitate ageing cocoa farms, the  Ghana 
News Agency reported, citing Kofi Boa, an agricultural
consultant.  The method will remove the disease from soil, replacing
chemicals that can be damaging, the Accra-based news agency
cited Boa as saying. Farmers in the Sekyere East District of
Ghanaâ€™s Ashanti region have started using the new technique,
which will be extended to cover all growing areas, the state-
owned GNA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
