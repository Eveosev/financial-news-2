  Interserve Plc  said today it is in
discussions with  Mouchel Group Plc . about a possible bid for the
supplier of grit to London roads.  Interserve has entered into a cooperation agreement with
Mouchel, the Twyford, England-based company said in a statement.
Interserve’s potential proposal is a combination of cash and
shares, and would be “highly attractive” to Mouchel
shareholders, if made, the company said.  Mouchel, which has already rejected two offers from builder  Costain Group Plc , said yesterday it is in “advanced” talks
with a potential bidder, which would provide the “best option”
for shareholders. Interserve said its approach is “friendly”
and a merger would “accelerate the enlarged group’
international scale and reach.”  Costain sweetened an offer last month for Mouchel to about
172 million pounds ($277 million) valuing Mouchel shares at
about 153.2 pence each. Mouchel’s shares rose 12 percent to
152.5 pence yesterday.  Interserve is an outsourcing and infrastructure company,
which offers advice, design, construction and facilities
management services in the U.K. and overseas for the public and
private sectors, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
