China’s stocks fell, pushing the
benchmark index toward its first weekly drop in more than a
month, on concern tightening measures will slow the economy and
speculation a rally for commodity producers may be excessive.    China Petroleum & Chemical Corp ., the nation’s largest
refiner, slid to the lowest in six weeks on prospects higher  oil
prices  will curb earnings. China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate
Group Co., the biggest developers, declined after Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  urged construction of social housing to help cool
property investment. Zijin Mining Group Co., the largest gold
producer, led precious metal producers lower.  “The unrest overseas triggered concerns about inflation
again and sent the market lower,” said Deng Eryong, chief
strategist at Changjiang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Investors
tend to make quick defensive moves in this volatile market.”  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 17.6 points, or 0.6
percent, to 2,860.99 at 9:54 a.m., extending this week’s slide
to 1.4 percent, the first drop since the week ending Jan. 21.
The CSI 300 Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,173,68.  The  Shanghai  gauge has advanced 1.8 percent this year,
after plunging 14 percent in 2010. The central bank has boosted
banks’ reserve requirements eight times since the start of last
year while raising  interest rates  three times in an effort to
tame inflation that reached a 28-month high in November and curb
asset bubbles.  China Petroleum, or known as Sinopec, lost 1.6 percent to
8.41 yuan, the lowest since Jan. 17. The government caps the
price of refined oil and refiners cannot pass on rising costs of
crude by increasing prices.  Oil futures prices surged to $103.41 yesterday, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008 amid estimates that as much
as two-thirds of  Libya ’s oil production is cut. Futures for
April delivery declined as much as 0.7 percent, to $96.61 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Property Stocks  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s world was shrinking
yesterday as a close adviser abandoned him, opponents
consolidated their control of the country’s oil-rich
east, and  Switzerland  froze some of his assets. Libya is the
latest country in the region to be rocked by protests that
toppled presidents in Tunisia and  Egypt  this year.  China Vanke slipped 0.6 percent to 8.12 yuan. Poly Real
Estate retreated 1 percent to 12.30 yuan.  Vice Premier Li urged construction of social housing and
pledged to strongly support building of public rental homes,  China  Central Television reported yesterday. The government will
cut taxes and increase financial supports for social housing
this year, the report said.  Gold Producers  The government is building more low-income housing in an
effort to bring down property prices. China extended property
curbs last month, including raising the minimum down payment for
second-home purchases, telling local governments to set price
targets on new properties, and introducing taxes for residential
homes in Shanghai and Chongqing. January new home prices rose
from a year earlier in all but two of the 70 cities monitored by
the government, defying curbs to keep housing affordable.  Zijin Mining fell 2.6 percent to 8.14, cutting its weekly
gain to 7.1 percent. Zhongjin Gold Co. lost 2.2 percent to 32.27
yuan. Gold producers rallied this week on speculation they would
be more sheltered from faster inflation and global turmoil.  Bullion for immediate-delivery rose as much as 0.2 percent
to $1,405.52 an ounce and traded little changed at $1,403.15 at
9:16 a.m. in  Singapore , a 1 percent gain this week. Futures for
April delivery decreased 0.8 percent to $1,404.10 an ounce,
after extending its longest rally in six months yesterday.  Money Supply  Even with this week’s drop, the Shanghai Composite has
risen 2.3 percent this month. China’s stocks may extend this
year’s gains as money supply growth approaches a level that will
force the government to ease its “tightening campaign,”
according to China International Capital Corp.  M1 growth, which averaged 17 percent for the past 16 years,
rebounded each time it neared 10 percent such as in 1998, 2002,
2005 and 2008, CICC said. The rate slowed to 13.6 percent last
month, compared with a 15-year high of 39 percent in January
2010.  “Whenever M1 growth approached 10 percent,  money supply 
growth started to rebound, and together with it the A- and H-
shares in Shanghai and  Hong Kong ,” Hao Hong, a global equity
strategist at CICC, said in a report this week.  --Irene Shen. Editor: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
