Gold and the euro will benefit the
most from Middle East turmoil as some governments in the region
shun dollars, traditionally a safe haven, because of their views
on “imperialist”  U.S. foreign policy , according to Fairfax IS.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the euro, in orange, has risen
against the dollar in line with Egypt’s five-year credit-default
swaps in green, a proxy for political unrest in the region. Gold
price gains in purple have accelerated as the euro advanced.  Opponents of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  consolidated
control over cities in the oil-rich east while he clamped down
on Tripoli, using tanks to block highways and security forces to
attack residents, witnesses said yesterday.  “Middle Eastern investors appear to prefer the euro as a
more stable and secure currency these days, while the idea of
buying ‘imperialist’ U.S. dollars may not appeal to your average
North African dictator,”  John Meyer , an analyst at Fairfax IS
in  London , wrote in a report yesterday. “Global crisis usually
causes funds to flow into U.S. dollars. Gold prices normally
pull back when the dollar rises. This time funds may prefer to
flow into the euro rather than into U.S. and this may be helping
gold.”  Gold will rise to $1,485 an ounce within a few weeks, Meyer
said yesterday by phone, from $1,411.78 at 5:03 p.m. in London
yesterday. It rose to a record $1,431.25 an ounce in December.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporters on this story:  Tony Barrett  in London at
