The following is
the text of the investment intentions report
for 2011 released by  Statistics Canada .  Investment in capital construction and
machinery and equipment is expected to rise
3.3% in 2011 to $349.1 billion.  Much of the recovery from the 2009 economic
downturn occurred in 2010 due to strong
growth on the part of both public (+17.5%)
and private (+8.0%) investment. If intentions
are realized, increases in 2011 will be led
by private investment, which is expected to
grow 3.8% to $261.3 billion.  Significant private capital spending
intentions are anticipated from the mining
and oil and gas extraction sector, which is
expected to grow 11.4% to $53.0 billion.  Note to readers
Housing starts are forecast under high,
medium and low scenarios by Canada Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. These scenarios are
used to estimate new housing investment, a
key component of the overall housing forecast
estimates.  The 2011 estimates for housing in this
release are based on the the mid-case
scenario for each province. The table
  Capital spending  in Canada, 2011 intentions,
by scenario", which appears at the end of
this release, covers all three scenarios.  Investment intentions for non-residential
construction and machinery and equipment are
based upon a sample survey of 28,000 private
and public organizations. This survey was
conducted between October 2010 and late
January 2011.  Data in this release are expressed in current
dollars.  By investment component, construction is
expected to increase 3.6% to $240.6 billion
and will account for more than two-thirds of
total capital spending.  Canada's housing sector is forecast to
increase to $94.7 billion in 2011, up 1.5%,
following 15.5% growth in 2010.  Mining and oil and gas extraction sector
fuels investment
Investment intentions by companies in the oil
and gas extraction sector will reach an
estimated $35.7 billion in 2011, up $3.0
billion (+9.1%) from 2010.  Powered by a host of new projects in the  Alberta  oil sands, investment in non-
conventional oil extraction is expected to
rise 27.8% in 2011 to $14.3 billion.  Investment in the mining sector is expected
to total $11.5 billion in 2011, up 23.8%.
This is the second year of strong growth in
this sector, following a 31.8% increase in
2010. Much of the additional capital spending
is earmarked for the development of several
metal ore mining projects.  Investment in support activities for mining
and oil and gas extraction is expected to
rise 3.9% in 2011 to $5.7 billion.  Primary metal manufacturing set to increase
Overall, the manufacturing sector intends to
invest 15.1% more on capital construction and
machinery and equipment in 2011, reaching a
total of $17.1 billion. This growth is
expected mainly to be due to strong gains in
the primary metal manufacturing industry
(+67.7%), which will account for more than
half of the entire sector's expected
increase. Investment intentions for most of
the remaining industries in this sector are
expected to increase modestly from 2010.    Canada 's transportation and warehousing
sector is expected to rise 14.4% to $22.1
billion in 2011. Most of this increase can be
attributed to an increase of over $1.5
billion (+28.0%) in the transit and ground
passenger transportation industry.  Investment by public administration expected
to remain stable
Following a 19.3% increase in 2010,
investment spending by the public
administration sector is expected to total
$42.8 billion, down 0.2%.  Only provincial governments are expecting to
increase their capital spending in 2011.
Provincial government capital outlays are
expected to reach a total of $17.5 billion,
up 2.5%. Spending by the federal government
is expected to fall by 7.2%, while municipal
capital spending is expected to decrease
slightly by 0.4%.  Investment increases in most regions
Although increases in investment intentions
are widespread across Canada, both Alberta
and  Quebec  show considerable strength.  Capital outlays in Alberta are expected to
increase 4.3% to $73.5 billion, primarily due
to higher investment intentions in oil and
gas extraction.  In Quebec, higher investment intentions in
the manufacturing, utilities, mining and oil
and gas extraction sectors are behind an
anticipated increase of 3.8% to $66.6
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
