Morgan Stanley raised its forecasts
for the euro against the dollar and the yen, citing increased
rhetoric from the  European Central Bank  about the need for
tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.  The U.S. bank also boosted its targets for the single
currency saying recent flexibility from European officials in
addressing the sovereign debt issue have significantly reduced
the risk of the crisis spreading.  “We’ve trimmed and pushed back our call for euro
depreciation to reflect the ECB’s hawkish policy posture and
more sanguine assessments of EMU sovereign risk,” Gabriel de Kock, an executive director at Morgan Stanley in  New York , wrote
in a note to clients sent yesterday.  The U.S. bank increased its March 31 target for the single
currency to $1.32 from $1.25, and boosted its year-end forecast
to $1.24 from $1.20, according to the note. The company raised
its end-of-March prediction for the euro to 111 yen from 108 yen,
and its year-end target to 115 yen from 112.  The euro traded at $1.3822 as of 10:55 a.m. in Tokyo after
climbing to $1.3837 earlier today, the strongest since Feb. 2.
The single currency was at 113.23 yen.  Morgan Stanley lowered its March-end prediction for the
dollar to 84 yen from 86 yen, and maintained its year-end
forecast of 93 yen.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the euro will
weaken to $1.32 by March 31, and trade at $1.33 by year end.
They predict the dollar will be at 85 yen by March 31, and 89
yen by Dec. 31.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds, Jonathan Annells  To contact the reporter on this story:
