  Ferrexpo Plc , a mining company with
operations in Ukraine, agreed to buy 400 open rail-car wagons,
with an option to purchase 600 more, to transport iron-ore
pellets to the Ukrainian border.  The supplier, Stakhanov Wagon Works, is an associate of
Ferrexpo Chief Executive Officer Kostyantin Zhevago, making the
acquisition a so-called related party transaction, Ferrexpo said
today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
