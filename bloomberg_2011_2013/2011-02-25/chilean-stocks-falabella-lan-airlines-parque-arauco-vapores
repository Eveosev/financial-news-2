The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in

percent to 389.64 pesos. Latin America’s largest container
shipping company has lost 7.6 percent in the last two days after
reporting 2010 profits below analysts’ estimates.    Parque Arauco SA  (PARAUCO CC), the shopping mall operator
with operations in Chile, Peru and Colombia, rose 3.7 percent to
980 pesos. Chilean stocks aren’t showing “excessive”
valuations and look “attractive,” while Brazilian stocks are
“expensive,”  Mark Mobius , chairman of Templeton Asset
Management’s Emerging Markets Group, told El Mercurio, adding
that he favors Chilean consumer stocks with international
activities.    SACI Falabella  (FALAB CC) rose 1.2 percent to 4,509 pesos,
its second day of gains after a seven-day losing streak. The
Chilean retailer and the country’s largest company by market
value is gaining as it had been “unjustly punished” recently,
and the company has “strong” fundamentals, Felipe Gacitua, a
trader at Santiago-based brokerage firm IM Trust, said in a
telephone interview today. Falabella fell 10.1 percent between
Feb. 15 and Feb. 23.    Salfacorp SA  (SALFACOR CC) increased 5.3 percent to 1,525
pesos, the biggest rise in seven weeks. The Chilean builder led
gains among members of the IPSA index as global equity markets
rose, boosted by higher-than-forecast  consumer confidence  in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
