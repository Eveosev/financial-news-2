  China ’s stock-index futures rose on
speculation surging metal and oil prices will bolster the
earnings outlook for commodity producers and Middle East turmoil
may push the government to delay its tightening measures.  Zijin Mining Group Co., the biggest gold producer, may gain
after bullion futures extended the longest rally in six months.
Jiangxi Copper Co., the largest maker of the metal, may rise
after metal futures rebounded and the company said its annual  tax rate  will drop. China Vanke Co. may climb after saying it’s
“confident” sales will exceed 100 billion yuan in 2011.  Futures on the CSI 300 Index expiring in March, the most
active contract, added 0.2 percent to 3,200.80 as of 9:15 a.m.
local time. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 16, or 0.6
percent, to 2,878.60 yesterday. The  CSI 300 Index  climbed 0.5
percent to 3,190.94.  The Shanghai gauge has dropped 0.7 percent this week, the
most in five weeks, paring the year’s advance of 2.5 percent.
The People’s Bank of China has boosted banks’ reserve
requirement ratio eight times since the start of 2010, while
raising  interest rates  three times. The inflation rate rose to
4.9 percent in January, slowing from a 28-month high of 5.1
percent in November, according to the statistics bureau.  The February inflation rate may ease to 4.8 percent because
of slowing rises in food prices, according to Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co.  Producers prices may rise 6.7 percent this month, driven by
oil and commodity prices, Li Huiyong and Meng Xiangjuan,
analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo, wrote in a report today.  Gold Prices  Gold futures rose, extending the longest rally in six
months, as mounting turmoil in  Libya  spurred demand for an
investment haven. Gold futures for April delivery gained $1.80
to settle at $1,415.80 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Oil rose as much as 38 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $97.66 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s world was shrinking
yesterday as a close adviser abandoned him, opponents
consolidated their control of the country’s oil-rich
east, and  Switzerland  froze some of his assets.  China may slow the pace of tightening “significantly” in
coming months as policy makers are likely to need time to access
the impact of the “intensive and aggressive tightening” measures
introduced the past five months, Daiwa Securities Capital
Markets Co. said in a report.  The political turmoil in some African countries and
increased uncertainty about the global economy should make China
“more cautious” about implementing further tightening measures,
according to the report by Mingchun Sun, analyst at Daiwa.  Extending Gains  China’s stocks may extend this year’s gains as money supply
growth approaches a level that will force the government to ease
its “tightening campaign,” according to China International
Capital Corp.  M1 growth, which averaged 17 percent for the past 16 years,
rebounded each time it neared 10 percent such as in 1998, 2002,
2005 and 2008, CICC said. The rate slowed to 13.6 percent last
month, compared with a 15-year high of 39 percent in January
2010.  “Whenever M1 growth approached 10 percent, money supply
growth started to rebound, and together with it the A- and H-
shares in  Shanghai  and  Hong Kong ,” Hao Hong, a global equity
strategist at CICC, said in a report this week. “Once the
tightening campaign shows signs of tapering, banks are likely to
rebound further.”  The benchmark stocks gauge is now valued at 13.5 times
estimated earnings, compared with the record low multiple of
11.9 set in January 2006, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Jiangxi Copper’s annual tax rate will drop for three years
after it was recognized as a “high-tech enterprise” by the
provincial government, the company said in a statement to the
Shanghai stock exchange yesterday.  Copper rebounded from a one-month low on signs that the U.S.
economic recovery is accelerating, while demand climbed in China,
the world’s largest metal consumer. Copper futures for May
delivery gained 5.2 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $4.3435 a
pound at 1:23 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  --Irene Shen. Editors: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
