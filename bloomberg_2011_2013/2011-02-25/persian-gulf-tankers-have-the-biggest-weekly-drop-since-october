Earnings from shipping Middle East
crude oil to  Asia , the busiest route for supertankers, had their
biggest weekly drop since October.  Daily returns from the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
voyage were 68 percent lower this week at $13,950, according to
the London-based  Baltic Exchange . Thatâ€™s the biggest drop since
a 74 percent slide in the week to Oct. 8. Earnings fell 26
percent today.  Very large crude carrier rates on the benchmark route fell
1.2 percent to 58.97 Worldscale points today, according to the
Baltic Exchange. The points are a percentage of a nominal rate,
or flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates
for every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, are
revised annually by the Worldscale Association in  London  to
reflect changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  Daily returns from suezmax tankers that haul 1 million-
barrel cargoes, half as much as very large crude carriers, rose
16 percent to $20,748. Returns from aframaxes that carry 650,000
barrels jumped 32 percent to $21,599, the highest level since
Dec. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
