(Corrects description of inflows in first paragraph in
story published Feb. 18.)  Russia-focused equity funds had
inflows while major emerging markets had outflows for a fifth
consecutive week, UralSib Financial Corp. said, citing EPFR
Global data.  Funds investing in Russian shares received $169 million in
the week ended Feb. 16 compared with $267 million the week
before, UralSib said. Chinese holdings had net redemptions of
$295 million, while $252 million and $154 million was taken from
Brazil and Indian funds, respectively. Turkey funds had outflows
of $40 million.    Russia  is still the only positive in a sinking asset
class,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib, wrote in an
e-mailed note.  The benchmark Micex Index has declined 0.3 percent so far
in 2011, beating the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 2.9 percent
retreat.  “Russia funds have taken more in six weeks than the
previous six months” with $1.8 billion attracted so far this
year, compared with $1.3 billion for the second half of last
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
