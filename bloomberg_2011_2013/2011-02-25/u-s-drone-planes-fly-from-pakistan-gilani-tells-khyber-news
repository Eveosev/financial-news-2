  Pakistan  allows the U.S. to fly
drone aircraft from its soil that are used for surveillance of
al-Qaeda and Taliban militants, Khyber News TV  reported , citing
an interview with Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani .  It doesn’t permit the Central Intelligence Agency to launch
attacks using the unmanned planes based at Pakistan airfields,
the channel reported, adding the interview took place yesterday.  Missile strikes by U.S. drones in the weakly governed
northwestern tribal region bordering  Afghanistan  have been a
source of tension between the two allies as Pakistan claims
these attacks breach its sovereignty and kill civilians.  The U.S. has launched 227 missile strikes on al-Qaeda, the
Taliban and allied groups in Pakistan’s ethnic Pashtun and semi-
autonomous tribal territories since 2004, according to a
 database maintained  by the Long War Journal, a Washington-based
website that monitors the conflicts in Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Iraq.  The CIA has relied on Predator and Reaper drones made by
San Diego-based  General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.   The drones are mounted with laser-guided Hellfire missiles
and smaller ordnance that target groups using the tribal area as
a safe haven while planning attacks on Americans in Afghanistan
and elsewhere.  Pakistan has asked the U.S. to transfer drone technology to
the South Asian nation to enable it to better fight militants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
