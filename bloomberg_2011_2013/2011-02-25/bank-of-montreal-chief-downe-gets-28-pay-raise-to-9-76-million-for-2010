Bank of Montreal,  Canada ’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, awarded Chief Executive Officer
William Downe C$9.54 million ($9.76 million) in total
compensation for 2010, a 28 percent increase from a year
earlier.  Downe, 58, was awarded C$1.04 million in salary, a C$2.85
million bonus and C$5.65 million in shares and stock options for
the year ended Oct. 31, the Toronto-based bank said today in a
filing. That compares with the C$7.45 million Downe received for
2009. The figures exclude pension costs and other compensation.  Bank of Montreal is the third of Canada’s six biggest banks
to disclose 2010 compensation for its top executives. Downe was
awarded the pay raise after the lender increased profit by 57
percent last year to C$2.81 billion, and pursued U.S. expansion.    Bank of Montreal  awarded Thomas Milroy, its top investment
banker, C$7 million as head of BMO Capital Markets, less than
the C$7.5 million he earned in 2009.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, the second-biggest bank, said Feb.
23 it increased CEO Edmund Clark’s compensation by 8.7 percent
to C$11.3 million. Royal Bank of Canada said Feb. 7 that it
awarded CEO Gordon Nixon C$11 million in compensation, a 5.8
percent increase.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
