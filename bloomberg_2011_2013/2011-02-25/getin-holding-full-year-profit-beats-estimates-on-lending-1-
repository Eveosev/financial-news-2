  Getin Holding SA , the Polish
financial-services company controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, said 2010 profit rose as higher revenue on loans more
than offset an increase in provisions.  Profit advanced to 421.1 million zloty ($146.3 million)
from 276 million zloty, the Warsaw-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 320.7 million-zloty
mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, climbed 30
percent to 1.27 billion zloty. Fees surged 46 percent to 556.4
million zloty. Provisions for bad loans surged 27 percent to
1.06 billion zloty.  “The exceptional net fees and commissions performance begs
a question about its sustainability, but on the other hand
another quarter of declining provisions is a sign of a
continuation of a positive trend,” Maciej Baranski, an analyst
at Bank Zachodni WBK SA, said in a note to investors.  Polish banks boosted their combined net income by 41
percent to 11.7 billion zloty last year, according to the
Financial Markets Commission. Earnings growth may continue as
the  International Monetary Fund  forecasts economic expansion of
3.7 percent this year, compared with 3.8 percent in 2010.  Earnings Outlook  Getin may increase net income by more than 10 percent this
year to a record, Chief Executive Officer Radoslaw Boniecki told
reporters in Warsaw today. The company’s fourth-quarter net
income was 150 million zloty. Provisions fell 9.2 percent to 223
million zloty, helping the bank cut the ratio of provisions to
total loans to 2.9 percent at the end of 2010 from 3 percent a
year earlier, Boniecki said.  Getin won’t pay a dividend from 2010 profit, it reiterated
today. The shares jumped 2.8 percent to 12.92 zloty, the highest
in almost two weeks, valuing the company at 9.22 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
