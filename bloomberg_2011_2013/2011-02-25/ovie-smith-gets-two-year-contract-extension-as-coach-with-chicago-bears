The  Chicago Bears  signed coach Lovie Smith to a two-year contract extension after he led the team to
a division title and conference championship appearance last
season.  Smith’s contract now runs through the 2013 National
Football League season, the Bears said on their  website .
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “I haven’t really talked a lot about it because I’ve felt
wanted every day I’ve been here,” Smith said at the NFL’s
scouting combine in Indianapolis, according to Chicagobears.com.
“My contract was expiring. So to me this is just a natural
progression that we’ve gone through. But yes, it is good to get
it over with and know that I have a few more years added on.”  Smith led Chicago to the National Football Conference
championship game in January following an 11-5 regular season
that included a division title, the Bears’ third in his seven
years as coach.  Chicago  lost the NFC title game 21-14 to the
Green Bay Packers, who went on to win the Super Bowl.  The Bears reached the Super Bowl during the 2006 campaign
after a 13-3 regular season, falling to the Indianapolis Colts
29-17.  The 52-year-old Smith has a 66-52 record with the Bears,
including a 3-3 mark in the playoffs. He was an assistant coach
for the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  and  St. Louis Rams  before taking
the Chicago job before the 2004 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
