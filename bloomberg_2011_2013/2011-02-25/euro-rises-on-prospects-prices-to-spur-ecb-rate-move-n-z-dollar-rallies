The euro strengthened to a three-
week high against the dollar on speculation European Central
Bank officials will signal they are contemplating raising  interest rates  to combat inflation.  The shared currency headed for its longest run of monthly
gains versus the dollar since November 2009 before a report
today that economists said will show German consumer prices rose
the most in two years. New Zealand’s dollar rose after  Standard
& Poor’s  said the earthquake in Christchurch would have no
immediate effect on the nation’s credit rating.  “The ECB is moving to a more hawkish stance, and that’s
supporting the euro,” said  Kenneth Broux , senior market
economist at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets in London. “The ECB
looks like it’s going in the direction where it wants to reduce
its liquidity provision.” The 17-nation unit may climb to $1.41
in the next two to three months, he said.  The euro climbed to $1.3838, the strongest since Feb. 2,
before trading at $1.3807 as of 8:51 a.m. in  London . It has
gained 0.8 percent this week. The single currency advanced
0.1 percent to 113.10 yen.  The dollar traded at 81.97 yen, from 81.89 yen yesterday,
when it dropped to 81.63, the weakest since Feb. 4.  Germany’s European Union-harmonized consumer prices
increased 2.1 percent in February from a year earlier, the most
since October 2008, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists before publication of today’s report.  ECB Speakers  European interest rates can only rise in the future, ECB
Governing Council member and outgoing Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  said yesterday in Frankfurt. The ECB’s Vice President  Vitor Constancio  speaks today in  New York  and Governing Council
member  Mario Draghi  gives a speech tomorrow in Verona,  Italy .  “The market’s focus is shifting to inflation, and it’s not
all about risk-aversion any longer,” said  Kazuyuki Kato , Tokyo-
based treasury department manager at Mizuho Trust. “Inflation
concern continues to boost rate-increase expectations in the
market. European currencies have been strong.”  Futures show traders are adding to bets for higher
borrowing costs. The implied yield on three-month Euribor
futures for December rose four basis points to 1.98 percent
today from 1.90 percent a week earlier. It was at 1.32 percent
at the beginning of January. The ECB, which next meets on March
3, has kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent since May 2009.  Euro Forecasts  Morgan Stanley raised its forecasts for the euro, citing
increased rhetoric from the ECB about the need for tighter
monetary policy to combat inflation.  The  U.S. bank  increased its March 31 target for the single
currency to $1.32 from $1.25, and boosted its year-end forecast
to $1.24 from $1.20, according to the note. The company raised
its end-of-March prediction for the euro to 111 yen from 108
yen, and its year-end target to 115 yen from 112.  The yen and Swiss franc strengthened this week as violence
in Libya spurred demand for safer assets. Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , who has lost control of much of his country’s oil-rich
east, appealed on state television to citizens to end violence
as his forces stepped up a crackdown on opponents. The nation
holds Africa’s largest crude-oil reserves.  The yen has risen 1.5 percent this week against the dollar,
the biggest gain this year. The franc has advanced 1.8 percent
against the dollar since Feb. 18. The franc climbed to a record
92.28 centimes per dollar today before trading at 92.45.  U.K. Pound  Crude for April delivery climbed to $103.41 per barrel in
New York yesterday, the most since September 2008, on concern
supplies will be disrupted. Oil pared gains to $97.23 a barrel
on assurances by the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and the  International
Energy Agency  that they can compensate for any disruption in
Libya.  The pound declined for a sixth day against the common
currency, depreciating as much as 0.3 percent to 85.77 pence per
euro, the weakest since Jan. 31. Sterling was little changed at
$1.6132, down 0.7 percent since Feb. 18.    New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened against all of its major
counterparts after S&P said the nation’s credit ratings were not
“immediately affected” by the deadliest earthquake in 80
years.  The statement “helped the kiwi lift a little,” said Alex Sinton, a senior dealer at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Auckland.
“There’s a short-covering rally with probably more to go.”
Short-covering is where investors end a bet that an asset will
decline.  The so-called kiwi rose 0.3 percent to 74.99 U.S. cents,
and advanced 0.4 percent to 61.43 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
