Gold may rise in  London , extending
the fourth consecutive weekly advance, as unrest in  Libya  spurs
demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  Gold is up 1 percent this week, heading for the longest
weekly streak since October. Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
reinforced his defense of the capital of Tripoli with tanks as
opponents consolidated control of the country’s oil-rich east.  “As protests in Libya intensify, we expect gold and silver
to be underpinned by flight-to-safety demand,”  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said today in a report.  Immediate-delivery bullion added 25 cents to $1,403.13 an
ounce by 1:11 p.m. in London, bringing the gain this month to
5.3 percent, the most since August. Gold for April delivery
dropped $12.60, or 0.9 percent, to $1,403.20 on the Comex in  New
York .  Bullion fell to $1,405 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,411.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Sixteen of 20
traders, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or 80
percent, said the metal will rise next week.  Gold held in exchange-traded products fell 5.29 metric tons
yesterday to 2,010.1 tons, the lowest level since June 4, data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. Holdings reached a
record 2,114.6 tons in December. Silver ETP assets advanced
26.21 tons to 14,739.66 tons, the highest level since Jan. 20,
data from four providers show.  Silver for immediate delivery gained 1.6 percent to
$32.6525 an ounce. It climbed on Feb. 22 to $34.3187, the
highest price since March 1980, the year the metal reached a
record $50.35 in New York.  Palladium rose 1.2 percent to $784.13 an ounce. It touched
a 10-year high of $862.25 on Feb. 21. Platinum was 0.5 percent
higher at $1,790.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
