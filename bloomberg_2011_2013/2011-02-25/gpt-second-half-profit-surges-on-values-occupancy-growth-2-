  GPT Group ,  Australia ’s second-
biggest diversified property trust by market capitalization,
said second-half profit more than quadrupled after the value of
assets rebounded and occupancies of its properties rose.  Net income for the six months to Dec. 31 was A$562.1
million ($567 million), compared with A$124.9 million a year
earlier, the Sydney-based company said today. Full-year profit
swung to A$707.3 million from a A$1.07 billion loss a year ago,
it said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  GPT has taken steps to manage its capital better and
sharpen its focus on Australian commercial property. It has sold
down investments in two unlisted funds, obtained longer-dated
debt, and exited assets, including its U.S. senior housing
business earlier this month.  “Our focus is entirely on delivering higher returns to our
investors,” Managing Director Michael Cameron told reporters
after the company’s results. “That may actually mean selling
some assets as opposed to buying.”  Rival Stockland quit part of its stake in GPT in October,
saying it saw “little prospect of acquiring assets” following
the company’s restructuring efforts.  The shares rose 2.3 percent to A$3.11 at 1:15 p.m. in
Sydney. While they’ve risen 7.2 percent from a year ago, they
still lag the company’s net tangible assets, which more than
quadrupled from a year ago to A$3.60 a share as of Dec. 31.  Closing the gap  “They’ve been quietly going about getting their house in
order, and trying to get the gap between their share price and
their net tangible assets narrowed,” Winston Sammut, managing
director of Maxim Asset Management, said before the results were
released. “They’ve made all the right moves over the last 12 to
18 months, and I expect to see a continuation of that.”  GPT reported a 9 percent increase in operating profit for
the year to A$410 million. The company said it will pay a
dividend of 16.3 Australian cents a share for the year, and
expects to see earnings per share growth matching the  consumer
price index  plus 1 percent.  It has reduced debt costs by 80 basis points this year, and
has measures in place to cut them by a further 50 basis points
in 2011, Cameron said. Should it need further funds, GPT is more
likely to raise them from the domestic  bond market  rather than
bank loans, he said.  The company, which has a A$3.3 billion pipeline of
development projects, has expressed interest in some of the
Australian shopping centers that rival  Centro Properties Group 
has put up for sale, Cameron said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
