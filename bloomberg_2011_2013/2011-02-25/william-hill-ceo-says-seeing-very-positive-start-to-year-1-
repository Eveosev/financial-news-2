  William Hill Plc , a U.K. bookmaker
with about 2,350 shops, is seeing a “very positive” start to
the year with customers increasing the average size of their
bets, according to Chief Executive Officer Ralph Topping.  It’s not yet clear if the nine percent rise in net revenue
in the first eight weeks of 2011 is a long-term reversal of last
year’s decline in bet size, Topping said on a conference call
today.  “It would be foolish to say it will go on improving,”
Topping said. “It’s too early to call the first swallow.”  William Hill and rivals such as  Ladbrokes Plc  are focusing
on growing their online business, which is more profitable than
town-center shops. The London-based bookmaker estimates
Internet-based sales, which accounted for almost 25 percent of
revenue last year, will make up half its revenue by about 2015.  Net income more than doubled in 2010 to 129.7 million
pounds ($208.6 million), or 18.4 pence a share, from 61.1
million pounds, or 9.4 pence, the previous year. Profit rose
after a 66 percent drop in exceptional items to 26 million
pounds, William Hill said in a statement. Revenue rose 7.4
percent to 1.07 billion pounds boosted by the  World Cup  and a 24
percent surge in online sales.  “The results are at the top end of expectations and
current trading is strong,” Investec Plc analyst Paul Leyland,
who has a “buy” recommendation on the shares, said in a note
to clients. “This demonstrates continued operational momentum,
underlying resilience and a widening performance gap with
Ladbrokes.”  William Hill shares rose 10.4 pence, or 5.7 percent, to
193.9 pence at 1:23 p.m. in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
