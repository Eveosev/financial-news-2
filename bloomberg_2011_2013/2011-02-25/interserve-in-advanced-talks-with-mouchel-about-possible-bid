  Interserve Plc , which maintains the
British Army’s training grounds, said it is in advanced
discussions with U.K.  Mouchel Group Plc  about a possible cash-
and-share tender offer.  Acquiring Mouchel will allow the enlarged company to better
compete in international markets and “provide a much stronger
platform from which to target the rapidly growing market for
fully integrated outsourcing services,” The Berkshire, southern
England-based builder and maintenance provider said.  “If made, the proposal would be highly attractive to
Mouchel shareholders,” the company said in a statement today.  Interserve is banking that its heritage in services will
sway Mouchel management that rebuffed the advances of builder  Costain Group Plc . The company refinanced debt after slumping
into a loss and faced investor pressure to engage with Costain,
which raised its bid twice to about 172 million pounds ($278
million). Earnings deteriorated after cuts to public spending.  The deal will require Interserve to arrange financing that
will likely take a couple of weeks, Mouchel said in a statement
yesterday, announcing that talks with an unidentified buyer were
advancing.  Interserve may include a “mix and match” option as part
of the offer, allowing Mouchel shareholders to elect for more
cash or more equity,” the company said. Any offer is subject to
due diligence and the “unanimous recommendation” by Mouchel’s
board, it added.  Mouchel’s three largest shareholders are Schroders,
Prudential Plc and M&G Investments, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
