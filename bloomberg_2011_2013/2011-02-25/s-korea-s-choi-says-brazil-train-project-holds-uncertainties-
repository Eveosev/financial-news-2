Choi Kyong Lim,  South Korea ’s
ambassador to Brazil, comments on the prospects of a South
Korean consortium winning a 33 billion reais ($19.8 billion)
project to build and operate a high-speed train in  Brazil .  The Brazilian government said on Nov. 26 it will delay the
auction for the project from Dec. 16 to April 29 to allow the
most companies possible to participate. Choi spoke to reporters
today in  Seoul .  On private participation:  “For private companies taking part in this project, quite
a lot of uncertainties exist since they would have to make a
very large amount of investment in the first place and recoup
that money by operating that project themselves.”  On South Korean companies taking part:  “The consortium of South Korean companies has the
technology to do this project. The key thing is whether they
have the capability to operate the project and enough capital.
That hasn’t been too easy.”  “At this point, we can neither be optimistic nor
pessimistic about winning the project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
