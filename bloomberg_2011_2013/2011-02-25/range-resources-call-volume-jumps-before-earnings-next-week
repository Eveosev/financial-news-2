  Range Resources Corp . call-option
trades surged to an almost seven-month high before the natural-
gas producer with assets in the U.S. Southwest and Appalachia
reports earnings next week.  More than 28,000 calls to buy the stock traded today,
almost 10 times the four-week average and eight times the number
of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were the June $70
calls, which accounted for more than one-third of all call
volume.  Fort Worth , Texas-based Range Resources gained 4.2
percent to $54.28, the highest price since October 2009.  Range Resources advanced 6.4 percent in the past year,
compared with a 38 percent increase for a gauge of energy
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Analysts forecast
it will report fourth-quarter profit of 13 cents a share
excluding some items, according to the average of 33 estimates
from a Bloomberg survey. The company is scheduled to report
earnings on Feb. 28. Range Resources beat third-quarter
estimates by 32 percent in October.  Range Resources’s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 41.61 from 40.75 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
