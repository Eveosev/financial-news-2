  Iluka Resources Ltd ., the world’s
biggest zircon producer, swung to a profit in the second half,
boosted by higher demand and prices.  Net income in the six months ended Dec. 31 was A$42.7
million ($43.1 million), Perth-based Iluka said today in a
statement. That compared with a loss of A$52.8 million a year
earlier. Second-half earnings were expected to be A$27.4 million,
according to the mean of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales in the fourth quarter rose 27 percent after the
company raised output from new mines. Iluka increased its zircon
price by about 30 percent last year to $1,000 a ton, it said
today. Prices have gained a further 20 percent this year, it
said.  “In 2010, customer demand for zircon exceeded Iluka’s
current supply capacity,” Managing Director David Robb said in
the statement.  The company declared a final dividend of eight cents a
share.  Iluka shares gained 7.8 percent to A$10.66 at the 4:10 p.m.
close on the Australian stock exchange. It has gained 17 percent
this year. The stock has 12 “buy”, one “hold” and three
“sell” ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
