Slovak Telekom AS, a unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG , said profit fell 17 percent in 2010 as
declining prices led to a drop in revenue.  Consolidated net income dropped to 120.9 million euros
($167 million) from 145.5 million euros in 2009, the Bratislava-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Revenue fell
4.1 percent to 934.3 million euros.  A nascent economic recovery in Slovakia still hasnâ€™t
created jobs, pushing telecommunication prices lower, and the
fall in revenue was prompted by the financial health of Slovak
clients, the company said.  Revenue from the wireless division, T-Mobile Slovensko,
dropped 10 percent to 499 million euros, while the number of
clients rose 1.5 percent to 2.41 million. Sales at the fixed-
line unit rose 3.5 percent to 464.3 million euros driven by
broadband services, the company said.  Slovak Telekom is 51 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom and
49 percent by the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
