When Denver’s  Stapleton  neighborhood
development opened in 2001 on a 4,700-acre site with retail
stores and a quarter of the land dedicated to parks, families
lined up before dawn for a chance at a lottery for the lots.  Stapleton and projects like it paid off for Denver over the
past decade and helped reverse an exodus to the suburbs.  Colorado ’s most-populous city grew 6.9 percent to 600,158
residents between 2005 and 2010, after falling to 561,323 from
564,411 between 2001 and 2005, 2010 Census figures released this
week show.  Sherry Kagan, a mother of two young children, said the
allure of the urban development remains. In 2009, she and her
husband bid on one of the 4,000 single-family houses in
Stapleton, drawn by the large number of children playing in the
complex.  “I took one look and said, ‘This is where we want to
live,’” said Kagan, a transplant from southern Illinois.  New housing at Stapleton and another development at the
former Lowry Air Force base “brought in a lot of young families
to Denver,” said Colorado state demographer Elizabeth Garner
who lives at Stapleton. “Prior to that, Denver tended to have
an out-migration where families tended to move out to the
suburbs.”  Douglas County  Another area Kagan considered when she moved from  Illinois 
was  Douglas County , south of Denver, which was the 10th fastest-
growing county in the U.S. between 2000 and 2009. In the second
half of the last decade, growth in Douglas slowed, according to
census figures.  The county’s population grew to 246,058 from 197,344
between 2001 and 2005, with annual gains as high as 9.4 percent.
By 2009, the rate of growth had declined to 2.5 percent,
according to census data.  Even with the slowdown, Douglas County posted the biggest
population gain in the state over the past decade, adding
109,699 residents, a 62.4 percent increase. Denver is both a
city and a county.  “Douglas is booming,” Garner said. “It might have been
slower during the second half of the decade, but it still has
had an incredible amount of growth.”  Tech Boom  Douglas touts itself as a place to live between the
population centers of Colorado Springs and Denver. Its fastest-
growing municipality, Castle Rock, expanded by 138.5 percent
over the past decade to 48,231 residents.  The county began to boom in the late 1990s, along with
information-technology businesses, by offering a mix of luxury
homes and affordable housing close to the Denver Tech Center, a
business and economic hub in southeast Denver, said Richard Wobbekind, an economist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.  Among the corporations with operations in Douglas County
are  Dish Network Corp ., the second-biggest U.S. satellite-
television provider;  Sprint Nextel Corp .; Liberty Media Corp.;
and Western Union Co.  Most of the  population growth  since 2000 in Douglas County
occurred in the white, non-Hispanic category, which increased
54.3 percent to 243,297, census data show. The trend applied to
the rest of Colorado as well, with the Hispanic population
accounting for 303,000 of the state’s population gain of 728,000
between 2000 and 2010. Colorado’s overall population grew by
16.9 percent to 5,029,196 in the past decade.  Hispanic Population  The state’s Hispanic population grew 41.2 percent to more
than 1 million people and now accounts for 20.7 percent of the
total, up from 17.1 percent in 2000. Non-Hispanic whites grew
9.9 percent to 3.5 million and made up 70 percent of the
population in 2010, down from 74.5 percent in 2000.  Denver County was displaced by El Paso County as the
state’s largest, data released Feb. 23 show. El Paso, the home
of  Colorado Springs , grew 20.4 percent over the decade, rising
from 516,929 to 622,263 people. Denver County grew 8.2 percent,
rising from 554,636 to 600,158.  Denver was one of the few counties in the state to see an
increase of white residents, from 51.9 percent of the total
population in 2000 to 52.2 percent in 2010.    William Frey , a senior fellow and demographer at the
 Brookings Institution  in  Washington , said the census data showed
a jump of 7,000 people younger than 18 in Denver, including
2,150 who are non-Hispanic whites. Whites may be staying in
Denver as they begin families rather than moving to the suburbs,
as they have in the past, he said.  Future Success  “This took place at a time when most of the suburban
counties were showing a decline in white people under 18,” Frey
said. “Denver epitomizes the kind of cities that are likely to
be successful in the future. It is attractive to young people,
it has a connection to high tech, it is growing and it is a
high-amenity area.”  Developments like Stapleton, now home to 12,000 people, are
among the main reasons. Since the first residents stood in line
to get their lottery numbers a decade ago, the community has
grown at a pace that two new public elementary schools have been
built and a third is under construction. Stapleton is also home
to the Denver School of Science and Technology, a college prep
school for grades 6-12.  “Once they got here, all hell broke loose,” said Tom
Gleason, vice president of communications at Forest City
Stapleton, the project’s developer. “The number of children
here surprised everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
