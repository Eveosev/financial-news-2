Colombian policy makers unexpectedly
raised their benchmark interest rate today for the first time in
ten meetings as they seek to slow accelerating domestic demand.  The seven-member board, led by bank chief Jose Dario Uribe,
increased the overnight rate by a quarter point to 3.25 percent,
surprising 21 of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The board,
in a change of tone, last month said it may raise if growth
accelerates, or inflation expectations deviate from the bank’s
target. The peso extended declines after the bank said it will
extend its daily dollar purchases. Yields fell.  The $231 billion economy may have expanded 4 percent in
2010 and quicken to 4.5 percent growth in 2011, Uribe said
today, as spending to repair damage from the heaviest rains in
three decades stokes demand and fuels inflation. Over the last
four months, traders have pushed up yields on Colombian bonds as
prices and inflation expectations rose. Policy makers today also
said “problems in the world economy cannot be ignored.”  “They just knew they were near the point at which they
needed to start normalizing and thought ‘why wait?’” Jimena Zuniga, a Latin America economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in  New York , said in comments sent by e-mail.  The bank “also does not seem to strive for preparing the
market for its moves (as attested by various surprise cuts
towards the end of its easing cycle in 2009 and 2010) and so it
probably did not give too much thought to the fact it was
surprising the market,” Zuniga said.  Food, Consumer Prices  Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent year on year in January,
the highest since June 2009 and nearly twice as fast as March
2010’s five-decade low of 1.84 percent. The bank targets annual
inflation of 2 percent to 4 percent.  The annual inflation rate will be 3.61 percent at year-end,
according to 42 economists in February’s  monthly central bank
survey . Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the bank
raised in part to help moderate inflation expectations.  After falling in three of the four months through October,
prices rose 0.91 percent in January, a 32-month high. Food
prices rose 1.61 percent in January from December --nearly twice
the overall monthly rate -- and 1.65 percent in December from
November, the fastest pace since June 2008.  From a year earlier, food prices rose 4.81 percent last
month. In January 2010, food prices fell 0.54 percent from a
year earlier.  A two-week trucker strike, which ended Feb. 18, also pushed
food prices up this month, Agriculture Ministry said.  “Colombia has a supply-driven food inflation problem, this
combined with their comment about the world economy, which also
appears related to food issues, led to prompt action,”  Rupert Stebbings , head of brokerage Celfin Colombia SAS, said in
comments sent by e-mail.  Yields, Peso Fall  After today’s decision, the yield on Colombia’s benchmark
11 percent peso bonds due July 2020 fell 4.5 basis points, or
0.045 percentage point, to 8.295 percent at 3:57 p.m. New York
time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price
rose 0.316 centavo to 117.095 centavos per peso.  Before today, yields had jumped 133 basis points, or 1.33
percentage points in the past four months to 8.34 percent, the
biggest increase over such a time period since 2008.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 1,907.15 per U.S. dollar.
It slid 1.6 percent this week, its biggest decline since the
period ended Dec. 17.  ‘Future Financial Imbalances’  The bank today also noted concern about rising prices for
the country’s housing and the correlation between extended
periods of historically low  interest rates  and “significant
acceleration in the growth of credit.”  Total gross lending rose 16.8 percent to 175.9 trillion
pesos ($92.6 billion) in December from a year earlier, according
to a report last month by  the financial regulator .  “The need to protect against the risk of future financial
imbalances that may adversely affect growth, output and
inflation, suggest that the benchmark interest rate should not
be kept very low for an unduly long period,” policy makers said
today.  The current interest rate will “continue supporting
economic growth and employment and contribute to its
sustainability while maintaining inflation within the long-term
target range,” policy makers said in their statement.  The bank, which had paused over nine meetings to keep the
overnight rate at a record-low 3 percent, last raised borrowing
costs in July 2008, when it pushed the benchmark up a quarter
point to 10 percent.  Rains, which subsided for a few weeks at the beginning of
this year, are due to begin again March during the usual rainy
season in  Colombia .  “There’s no magic number for the neutral rate, but we
think they’ll take it as high as 5 percent this year,” said
Zuniga.  Purchases, ‘Responsible Decision’  The central bank today also said that it will extend the
March 15 deadline for its purchases of a minimum of $20 million
a day until at least June 17 in a bid to ease gains in the
currency.  Echeverry, president of the bank’s board, said in an
interview Feb. 14 he would “ try to provide the central bank
with the room to maneuver that allows it, if necessary, to keep
intervening.”  The peso has weakened 5.3 percent to 1,898.75 per  U.S.
dollar  yesterday since the central bank began buying daily in
the  spot market  on Sept. 15. The program was extended in October
until “at least” March 15.  Uribe has repeatedly defended the bank’s dollar purchase
program and said the steps taken to weaken the peso have been
effective.  Barclay’s expects the currency to trade within a range of
1,800 and 1,900 per dollar this year.  The economy, driven by consumer demand and private
investment, attracted about $6.5 billion in foreign direct
investment through the third quarter of 2010, on top of $7.2
billion in 2009 and a record $10.6 billion in 2008, according to
the central bank.  Retail sales surged 12.4 percent in December from a year
earlier, while industrial output picked up 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
