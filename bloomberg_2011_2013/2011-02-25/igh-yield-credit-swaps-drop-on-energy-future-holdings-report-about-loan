The cost to protect against a
default by high-yield, high-risk companies in the U.S. and  Canada  rose after a report that Energy Future Holdings Corp. is
rejecting an assertion by hedge fund Aurelius Capital Management
LP that it’s in default on a $24 billion loan.  The price of the Markit CDX North America High-Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence in creditworthiness declines,
dropped to 103.83 percent of face value from as high as 104.25
percent earlier today, according to index administrator Markit
Group Ltd. The decline all but erased the benchmark index’s
biggest increase in six days. Energy Future is one of 100
companies in the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
