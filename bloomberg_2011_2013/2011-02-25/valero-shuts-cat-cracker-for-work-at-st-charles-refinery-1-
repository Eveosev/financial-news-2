  Valero Energy Corp . shut a
millisecond cat cracker at its St. Charles refinery in Louisiana
for planned work that is expected to last 56 days.  The 90,000-barrel-a-day unit is being converted into a
traditional fluid catalytic cracker, Bill Day, a company
spokesman based in San Antonio, said in an e-mail. An alkylation
unit will also be shut during the work, Valero said Jan. 26.  The refinery has a capacity of 250,000 barrels a day,
