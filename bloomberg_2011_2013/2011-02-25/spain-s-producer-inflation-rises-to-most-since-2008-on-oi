  Spain ’s producer prices climbed the
most in more than two years in January, adding to evidence of
accelerating inflation as European Central Bank policy makers
signal they may increase  interest rates .  Prices of goods leaving Spain’s factories, mines and
refineries rose 6.8 percent from a year earlier, the most since
September 2008, compared with 5.3 percent in December, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today. From the
previous month, prices gained 2.4 percent after increasing 0.9
percent in December.  Policy makers led by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet are
voicing concern that higher inflation may become entrenched, and
ECB Governing Council member Yves Mersch said on Feb. 21 that
officials may toughen their language on inflation next week. The
price of crude oil rose to $98.4 today, driven higher by
violence in  Libya .  The Governing Council meets on March 3 in Frankfurt. So
far, Trichet has said risks to the inflation outlook are
“broadly balanced,” though they “could move to the upside.”  The Spanish economy emerged from an almost two-year
recession in the first half of 2010, before contracting again in
the third quarter as austerity measures undermined the recovery.
Consumer inflation in Spain, at 3 percent in January, is one
percentage point higher than in  Germany , where the economy
expanded a record 3.6 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
