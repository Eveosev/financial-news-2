Come Friday night, the baroque pop
of Beach House will echo through Webster Hall. Victoria
Legrand’s dusky, idiosyncratic voice soars over bandmate Alex
Scally’s harmonic layers of sound to enrapturing effect.  Touring one of 2010s most celebrated releases, “Teen
Dream,” (not to be confused with Katy Perry’s cloying paean to
skin-tight jeans, “Teenage Dream”), Beach House cast a spell
so haunting you’ll leave the show in a shimmering daze.  Webster Hall is at 125 E. 11th St. Information: +1-212-353-
1600;  http://event.websterhall.com .  Post-gig, hit Black and White for cheap drinks, blase
bearded bartenders and an always solid selection of music.  It’s dark, woody and the inhabitants won’t mind if you take
over a booth for an impromptu game of spin the bottle.  86 E. 10th St. Information: +1-212-253-0246.  Saturday  For a taste of spring, visit the tropical Butterfly
Conservatory. Get up close as they bask, flutter and court.  Watch them feed on nectar through a proboscis that can
reach one and a half times body length. Zero in on the tiny
scales that cover their wings, imparting spectacular Day-Glo
hues of blue, green and red.  There are swallowtails, longwings, whites and sulphurs, and
if you’re still, one or two might even perch on you.  Through May 30 at the  American Museum of Natural History ,
Central Park West at 79th St. Information: +1-212-769-5100;

ravioli in brown butter with prosciutto or Roman-style gnocchi
with wild mushrooms.  Or just have some wine, cheese and biscotti.  475 Columbus Ave. at 83rd St. Information: +1-212-362-5454.  Saturday Matinee    South Park ’s” Trey Parker and Matt Stone have joined
with “Avenue Q” co-creator Robert Lopez to produce “The Book
of Mormon,” a cheery send-up of sanctimony and gullibility.  Two eager young missionaries head to  Uganda  to spread the
gospel according to Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon
religion, and find there’s nothing at all in their tool kit to
deal with famine, poverty and the AIDS epidemic. Music, dance,
cussing and jokes ensue.  In previews at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre, 230 W. 49th St.,
opening March 24. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

the lives and fantasies of the characters in “Arcadia.”  Tom Stoppard’s dazzling fever dream of a play is set on a
lush English estate. It time-travels between 1809, when a
brilliant girl is discovering her intellectual genius and the
stirrings of love, and the present, where competing academics
are trying to sort out what happened there, often to hilarious
effect.  Billy Crudup starred in the 1995 Broadway premiere of
“Arcadia” and returns for the revival, along with yet another
Streep daughter, in this case, Grace Gummer, in a cast that also
includes Margaret Colin, Raul Esparza and Byron Jennings.  In previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, 243 W. 47th
St., opening March 17. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

and caviar at  Firebird .  365 W. 46th St. Information: +1-212-586-0244.  Sunday  The erotic, glow-in-the-dark polyurethane sculptures, both
amusing and menacing, pour off the walls in the darkened room.  This is “Phantom,” (1971) by Lynda Benglis, part of her
first U.S. retrospective now at the New Museum. Fifty works
showcase her restless, boundary-busting career.  They include -- of course!! -- her famous 1974 Artforum ad
skewering the macho art world in which Benglis wears nothing but
rhinestone-studded sunglasses while holding a dildo.  Runs through June 19 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery.
Information: +1-212-219-1222;  http://www.newmuseum.org .  Recover at  Freemans  with a pear gimlet and the hot
artichoke dip.  Freeman Alley off Rivington St. Information: +1-212-420-
0012.  Sunday Night  Ahmad Jamal, whose pianism helped move be-bop into the
modern jazz era, appears at the Rose Theater, with bassist James
Cammack plus drummers Manolo Badrena and Joey Baron.  Then saxophonist Lee Konitz, known for cool jazz, plays
everything from hard-driving be-bop to avant-garde.  Jazz at  Lincoln Center  is on Broadway at 60th St. in the
Time Warner Center. Information: +1-212-258-9800;
