Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS,  Turkey ’s state-owned pipeline company which is known as Botas,
won’t raise natural gas prices until after elections this year,
 Haberturk  said, without citing where it got the information.  A government decree exempted Ankara-based Botas in December
from the so-called cost-based automated pricing mechanism, a
system that benchmarks local fuel prices with international
market quotations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
