Sugar may climb next week on bets
that global demand will continue to outpace supplies.  Seven of 12 traders, analysts, and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in  New York  will advance,
while five said it will fall. Before today, the commodity
dropped 2.1 percent this week to 27.83 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S.  Six of 11 survey respondents said refined sugar on London’s
NYSE Liffe exchange will rise, and four said it will fall. One
was neutral.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener will narrow,
according to five of 11 people surveyed. Four said it will
widen, and two expect it to be little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
