  Chariot Oil & Gas Ltd ., a U.K. oil
explorer focused on  Africa , rose in  London  after increasing its
estimate of resources off  Namibia .  The shares climbed 4.6 percent to close at 241 pence.
They’ve risen almost seven-fold in the past 12 months.  The explorer reported an increase of 700 million barrels of
prospective resources in its northern license to 2.63 billion
barrels after additional technical studies.  “Chariot’s ongoing interpretation of its extensive
proprietary 3D data continues to yield significant results,”
Ambrian Partners Ltd. said in a note. “The clear positive
impact of this work is the incremental increase of prospective
resources that may be present within its offshore license
areas.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
