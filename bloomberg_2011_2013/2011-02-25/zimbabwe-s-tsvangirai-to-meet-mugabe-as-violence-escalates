Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said he plans to meet President Robert Mugabe today
amid mounting violence in the southern African nation.  The meeting aims to “settle pressing matters,”
Tsvangirai, who heads the Movement for Democratic Change, said
in an e-mailed statement from the capital, Harare. “The meeting
will take place at a time when state-sponsored violence is
rocking the country.”  The MDC leader said Mugabe, through his  Zimbabwe  African
National Union-Patriotic Front party, was giving orders to the
police, the army, intelligence agents and “Zanu-PF vigilantes”
who have been implicated in violence against the MDC in recent
weeks.  Mugabe and Tsvangirai formed a coalition government two
years ago after disputed elections the year before that were
characterized by widespread violence. Under the power-sharing
accord, Zimbabwe is supposed to hold a referendum on a new
constitution before staging elections. Mugabe intends to abandon
talks over a constitution and call a vote in June, three members
of his party’s decision-making body said last month.  Tsvangirai didn’t say at what time today’s meeting would
take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
