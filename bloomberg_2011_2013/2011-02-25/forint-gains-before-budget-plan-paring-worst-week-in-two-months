The forint gained for a second day,
trimming its biggest weekly drop in two months, before  Hungary ’s
government announces measures to cut state spending.  The forint strengthened 0.4 percent to 272.69 per euro by
5:11 p.m. in Budapest, paring the currency’s five-day loss to 1
percent, the worst weekly performance since Dec. 24. The yield
on  government bonds  maturing in 2020 fell 13 basis points to
7.446 percent, down from 7.501 percent at the end of last week.
The benchmark BUX Index of shares rose 2.3 percent to 23,046.76.  Hungary’s government, which has the biggest debt burden
among the European Union’s eastern members, said it will present
plans to cut spending next week. The reform plan will be
unveiled on March 1, state-run MTI news service reported
yesterday, citing  Peter Szijjarto , spokesman for Prime Minister  Viktor Orban .  “March 1 is going to be D-Day for the forint,”
strategists at Commerzbank AG including Lutz Karpowitz in  Frankfurt  wrote in a research report today. “Market confidence,
and thus the effect on the forint, depends on the ability of
these reform measures to convince.”  The government’s fiscal measures will focus on spending and
“will be well-received by the market,” which may strengthen
the forint next week, analysts at BNP Paribas SA including
Elisabeth Gruie in  London  wrote in a report to clients today.  Hungary sold 62.5 billion forint ($316 million) of bonds,
17.5 billion forint more than planned, at an auction yesterday,
after getting 192.6 billion forint in bids. The sale included 10
billion forint of notes due in 2028, the longest-dated debt of
any auction since 2006.  “The bond auction went very well yesterday with
substantial demand for the 18-year paper too,” the BNP Paribas
analysts wrote. “That indicates that investors remain bullish
ahead of the March 1 presentation of the fiscal package.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
