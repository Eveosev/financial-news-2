European stocks rose, paring this
week’s drop on the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as earnings
at companies from Volkswagen AG to Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA
reassured investors that the global economic recovery is intact.  Volkswagen surged 6.2 percent as the maker of Beetle cars
said increased sales in  China  drove a sevenfold surge in profit
last year. Saint-Gobain rallied 5.5 percent after its chief

this year.  Telecom Italia SpA  gained 5.2 percent after Italy’s
largest phone company forecast that its dividend will increase

government protests has triggered the biggest weekly gain in  oil

Middle East and North Africa have unseated Egypt’s  Hosni Mubarak 
and threaten to do the same to Qaddafi.  European Stocks Rally  National benchmark indexes climbed in 16 of the 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 Index rallied 1.5

months, compared with an initial estimate of a 0.5 percent drop.  Even after this week’s tumble, the Stoxx 600 has still

improving global economy and as corporate profits beat analysts’
estimates. About fifty-seven percent of the 228 companies in the
gauge that have reported results since Jan. 10 posted per-share
earnings that topped the average analyst projection, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Volkswagen, Saint-Gobain  Volkswagen surged 6.2 percent to 119.40 euros as  Europe ’s

Executive Officer Pierre-Andre de Chalendar said net income at

“significantly” increase in 2011. He also said that energy and
raw material costs will “probably” rise in 2011 more than they
did in 2010.  Telecom Italia advanced 5.2 percent to 1.10 euros after the
company said 2010 profit doubled, boosted by the consolidation

year will increase 3 percent to 13.7 billion euros.    Suedzucker AG , the world’s largest sugar refiner, rallied
