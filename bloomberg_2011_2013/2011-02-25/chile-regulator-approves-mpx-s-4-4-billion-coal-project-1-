Chile’s environment regulator
approved  MPX Energia SA ’s $4.4 billion coal-fired power station
project in northern  Chile  as the South American country seeks to
overcome power shortages.  MPX, controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , plans to build
the largest power station in Chile, the company said in a
statement filed to the regulator today.  The power station, Castilla, will be built on the Pacific
Coast 700 kilometers (435 miles) north of Santiago and provide
2,100 megawatts of energy to Chile’s central power grid. Chile’s
government earlier this year lowered grid voltages to avoid
rationing as a drought sapped the country’s hydroelectric power
generation capacity.  “Chile needs energy to grow and Castilla will be, without
doubt, a structural development for the country in the next
decade,” MPX said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
