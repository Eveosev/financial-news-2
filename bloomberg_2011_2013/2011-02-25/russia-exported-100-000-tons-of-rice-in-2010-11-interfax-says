Russia exported 100,000 metric tons
of rice in the 2010-11 marketing season, Interfax reported,
citing Dmitry Rylko, general director of the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies.  The country “is becoming a large rice exporter,” the news
agency today cited Rylko as saying. Russia’s rice crop rose to
1.1 million tons in 2010 from 995,500 tons in 2009 even as the
country suffered its worst drought in at least half a century,
according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
