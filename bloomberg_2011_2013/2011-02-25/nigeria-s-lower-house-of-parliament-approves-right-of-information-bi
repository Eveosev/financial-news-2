Nigeria’s House of Representatives
passed a bill yesterday that gives citizens the right to obtain
access to government information and records, according to an
official record of proceedings the legislature released today.  The Right of Information bill protects government officials
who disclose information and provides jail terms of as much as
three years for those who alter, falsify, destroy or
intentionally misrepresent information in their custody. The
Senate must pass the legislation before it will become law.  The legislation was introduced in  parliament  11 years ago
when the continent’s top oil producer and most populous nation
returned to civilian rule.  “This is intended to increase the availability of public
records and information to the citizens of the country in order
to participate more effectively in making administration of laws
and policies, and to promote accountability of public affairs,”
Aliyu Wadada, chairman of the House Committee on Information and
National Orientation, told reporters in parliament in Abuja, the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
