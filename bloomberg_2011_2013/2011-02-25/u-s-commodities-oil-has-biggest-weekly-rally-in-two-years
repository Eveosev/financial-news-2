Crude oil rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain in two years, on concern that the turmoil in  Libya 
will spread to Middle East petroleum producers. Grains jumped,
driving a measure of raw materials up to a record.  Yesterday, oil surged to a 29-month high amid estimates
that Libya’s crude output was cut by as much as two-thirds. The
price dropped below $100 a barrel after Saudi Arabia, the U.S.
and the  International Energy Agency  said they can compensate for
any Libyan supply disruption. Today, a report showed the  U.S.
economy  expanded less than forecast in the fourth quarter.  “We may move a lot higher on concern over how the Libyan
situation will develop over the weekend,” said  Phil Flynn , a
vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “The
reassurances from  Saudi Arabia , the IEA and even the White House
helped calm fears yesterday, but that might not be enough.”  In other markets, corn and soybeans surged the most in six
weeks and wheat had the biggest gain since early December on
bets that increasing export demand for U.S. crops will tighten
global supplies. Rice also climbed. The UBS Bloomberg Constant
Maturity Commodity Index gained 1.9 percent, the most since Dec.
1, to 1,748.7. Earlier, the gauge reached a record 1,751.77.  Oil futures for April delivery climbed 60 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $97.88 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Yesterday, the commodity reached $103.41, the highest intraday
price since Sept. 29, 2008.  This week, oil jumped 14 percent, the most since late
February 2009. The price has climbed 25 percent in the past 12
months.  Corn, Soybeans  Corn futures for May delivery jumped 25.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to close at $7.22 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Jan. 12. Earlier, the most-active
contract surged by the exchange limit of 30 cents.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 45.75 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $13.75 a bushel, the largest gain since Jan. 12.
Earlier, the price jumped by the limit of 70 cents.  Wheat futures for May delivery climbed 28.75 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $8.1125 a bushel, the biggest advance since Dec. 3.  U.S. exporters reported the biggest week of corn sales
since the marketing year began Sept. 1, and wheat sales in the
week ended Feb. 17 were 67 percent higher than the prior four-
week average, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.
Shippers sold 165,000 metric tons of soybeans to  China  for
delivery after Sept. 1, the agency reported.  “Export sales were strong for corn and wheat last week,
and China buying more soybeans overnight is a positive
indication of increasing demand,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .
“Domestic livestock and ethanol producers also increased
purchases.”  Rice  Rice, the staple food for half the world, rose the most
allowed by the CBOT as countries boosted inventories to cap food
inflation that contributed to protests across North Africa and
the Middle East.    Bangladesh ,  South Asia ’s biggest buyer, said it’s seeking
supplies from  India  as part of more regular grain purchases to
bolster  food security .  “When we go for international tenders and prices suddenly
rise, private suppliers sometimes fail to fulfill their
commitments,” Muhammad Abdur Razzaque, the Bangladeshi food
minister, said yesterday. “They don’t supply us and put us in
trouble. It has happened.”  Rice futures for May delivery rose by the exchange limit of
50 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $14.31 per 100 pounds, ending a
four-session slid.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
