Oil refiners in China, the world’s
biggest energy consumer, cut processing rates in the two weeks
ended yesterday as they started to shut plants for seasonal
maintenance, data from Oilchem.net show.  Refiners including PetroChina Co. and  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp ., known as Sinopec, operated at an average 84.5
percent of capacity, down 3.4 percentage points from two weeks
earlier, Oilchem.net said in a survey today. PetroChina’s West
Pacific Petrochemical Corp. shut its 200,000 barrel-a-day Dalian
plant for maintenance, according to the Shandong-based website.  Processing rates may decrease further in March as more
refineries, including Sinopec’s Jinling and Jingmen plants and
PetroChina’s Dagang facility, close for maintenance, Oilchem.net
said. The three refineries may shut more than 10 million metric
tons a year, or 200,000 barrels a day, in processing capacity,
according to Oilchem.net.  The fortnightly survey covered 23 major refineries with a
total annual capacity of 281 million metric tons, or about 5.6
million barrels a day.  In the two weeks ended yesterday, refineries in eastern  China  were running at 86 percent of capacity. Plants in the
south were operating at 91 percent of capacity, while refineries
in the northwest were running at 67 percent and plants in the
northeast at 89 percent. Those in the north were operating at 91
percent, according to Oilchem.net.  To contact the reporter on this story:
