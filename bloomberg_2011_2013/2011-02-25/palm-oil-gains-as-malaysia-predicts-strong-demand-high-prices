  Palm oil  rebounded from its lowest
level in three months after  Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest
producer, predicted “strong demand” and higher prices for the
vegetable oil this year.  The May-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.2 percent
to 3,496 ringgit ($1,146) a metric ton today on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, before ending the morning session at 3,480
ringgit. Futures yesterday fell to their lowest closing price
since Nov. 30 and are set for the second weekly decline.  Palm oil prices may average 3,652.50 ringgit this year amid
“strong demand,” researchers Ramli Abdullah and Ayat K. Rahman
at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said in a report to be presented
at an event in  Kuala Lumpur  later today. The commodity averaged
2,715 ringgit in 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  Demand for food is growing, Malaysian Plantation Industries
and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok, said today. “I do
expect the price for this year to be on the upper side of 3,000
ringgit, we hope,” he told reporters.  Still, Malaysia’s palm oil exports declined 8.2 percent in
the first 25 days of February to 973,441 tons from a month ago,
independent market surveyor Intertek said today.  “Demand for palm oil may stay subdued in the near term as
buyers like  India  have ample domestic supplies,” said Prasoon
Mathur, an analyst at Religare Commodities Ltd. in  New Delhi .
“Soybean harvests in Brazil and  Argentina  will put more
pressure on palm oil prices.”  Oilseeds, corn, wheat and cotton have slumped this week on
speculation that the unrest in Libya and the Middle East may
continue, reducing demand for commodities. Palm has slumped 5.5
percent this week.  Output Rebound  Malaysia’s output may be 17.6 million tons, compared with
17 million in 2010, Yusof Basiron, chief executive officer of
the  Malaysian Palm Oil Council , said in an interview Feb. 23.
That would equal 2009’s production, data from the board show.  May-delivery soybeans gained 0.2 percent to $13.3175 a
bushel at 12:55 p.m.  Singapore  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  Soybean oil  climbed as much as 0.9 percent to 55.77 cents
per pound in  Chicago  and traded at 55.74 cents.  September-delivery palm oil on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange jumped as much as 1.6 percent to 9,324 yuan ($1,418) a
ton. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed as much
as 1.5 percent to 10,030 yuan a ton.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, advanced as much as 0.7
percent to $1,129.25 a ton at 12:56 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporterS on this story:
