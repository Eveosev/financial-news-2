  Angola  delayed construction of its
Sonaref oil refinery in Lobito to review the cost of the
project, according to an official at Sonangol EP.  Project proposals are to be re-submitted to the Cabinet for
approval of the new budget, Anabela Fonseca, an administrator at
the state-owned company, said today in Luanda.  The new refinery is planned to have capacity to process
200,000 barrels of oil a day, almost five times as much as
Angola’s only other refinery.  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said in December
it’s open to finding partners to help build the refinery.  South
Africa ’s PetroSA Ltd. was working out details of a joint
venture,  Jacob Zuma , the country’s president, said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
