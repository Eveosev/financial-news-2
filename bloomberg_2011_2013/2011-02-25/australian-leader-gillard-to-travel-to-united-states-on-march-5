Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  will travel to the United States on March 5 to discuss
regional security, the nation’s presence in Afghanistan and the
global economic recovery.  In her first trip to the U.S. as leader, Gillard will meet
President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner , according to a statement
from her office. Gillard will also meet United Nations Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon to press for Australia gaining a non-
permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2013-14, it said.  Gillard’s Labor government lost its majority in the August
2007 election and must rely on support from four non-party
lawmakers to pass legislation. The Aug. 21 poll was the closet
election in 70 years.  The government faces opposition to plans to introduce a
carbon price ahead of emissions trading, tax mining companies
like  BHP Billiton Ltd ., the world’s biggest, build a national
high-speed wireless network and manage water in the nation’s
biggest river system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
