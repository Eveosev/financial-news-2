Copper futures rose the most in 12
weeks on bets that demand for the metal used in wires and
plumbing will remain robust.  Confidence among U.S. consumers increased more than
forecast in February to the highest in three years, a report
showed today. Copper slid 4.5 percent in the two sessions ended
Feb. 23 as escalating violence in  Libya  drove  oil prices  to a
29-month high, damping the outlook for the economy and commodity
use.  “Optimism returned,” boosted by consumer sentiment, Alex Heath, the head of industrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of
Canada Europe Ltd. in  London , said in a report. “Chatter turned
once more to expectation that demand in China will pick up in
the second quarter as construction activity increases after the
long winter.”  Copper futures for May delivery advanced 11.15 cents, or
2.6 percent, to close at $4.455 pound at 1:28 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Dec. 1. The price was down 0.9 percent this week.  On Feb. 23, copper’s 14-day relative-strength index fell
below 39, the lowest since June. A reading of 30 signals a
potential rebound, according to chart analysts.  Copper has climbed 39 percent in the past year as mining
companies struggled to keep pace with rising consumption.
Imports of the refined metal by  China , the world’s largest user,
jumped 24 percent in January from a year earlier.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months jumped $258, or 2.7 percent, to $9,760 a metric ton
($4.43 a pound), the biggest gain since Nov. 18.  Aluminum, tin, zinc, lead and nickel also gained in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
