  Ghana ’s  Ministry of Energy  will
complete a bill this year mandating that local companies provide
as much as 90 percent of the work in some areas of petroleum
services within a decade of a project’s initiation, spokesman
Edward Bawa said.  The draft legislation will also require that Ghanaians hold
at least a 5 percent equity stake in oil and gas service
contractors, Bawa said in a phone interview from the capital,
Accra, today. An advisory committee working under the country’s
proposed oil industry regulator will be charged with evaluating
projects to ensure they comply with the regulations, he said.  “For the inception of every project we should have a plan
for local content,” Bawa said.  Production began at Ghana’s offshore Jubilee field on Dec.
15. Output is expected to rise to 120,000 barrels a day later
this year from about 50,000 barrels at the moment, according to  Tullow Oil Plc , the field’s operator.  The so-called ‘local content’ bill is one of three major
pieces of oil legislation the West African nation’s parliament
will consider this year.  The legislative body is nearing completion of an oil
revenue law that would create a sovereign wealth fund and allow
Ghana to borrow against future government oil revenue.  A third bill, establishing an industry regulator
independent of the country’s state-owned oil company was
submitted to parliament for consideration in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
