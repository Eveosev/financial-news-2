  National Semiconductor Corp . call-
options volume surged to a eight-month high with most of the
trading concentrated in contracts with a strike price 6.3
percent above yesterday’s close.  More than 14,000 calls to buy the stock traded as of 1:15
p.m. in New York, 26 times the four-week average and 26 times
the number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts were the
April $16 calls, which accounted for more than one-third of all
call volume and more than tripled to 63 cents. The  Santa Clara ,
California-based chipmaker jumped 4.7 percent to $15.76. The
stock hasn’t closed above $16 since October 2008.  The maker of analog chips that control power in electronic
devices advanced 8.2 percent in the past year, compared with a
22 percent increase for the information technology companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. National Semiconductor next
month will report profit of 24 cents a share excluding some
items, according to the average of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  National Semiconductor’s implied volatility, the key gauge
of option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days
jumped to 37.32 from 32.23 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
