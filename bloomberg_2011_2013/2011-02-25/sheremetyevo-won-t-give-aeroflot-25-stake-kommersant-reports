OAO Aeroflot,  Russia ’s largest
airline, is locked in a dispute with the main operator of its
Moscow hub, Sheremetyevo Airport, which refuses to give it a 25
percent stake in the airport, Kommersant reported, citing an
unnamed person familiar with the matter.  Aeroflot, which operates a new terminal at Sheremetyevo,
may get less than the 25 percent share once the assets of the
airport are merged, the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing a
person with knowledge of the talks between the two companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
