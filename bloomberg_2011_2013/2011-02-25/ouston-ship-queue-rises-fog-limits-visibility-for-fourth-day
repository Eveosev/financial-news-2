Houston Ship Channel pilots delayed
boarding 87 waiting inbound vessels for a fourth day as fog
limited visibility at the largest U.S. petroleum port, according
to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service.  Some ships left Houston during a respite overnight, leaving
six ships waiting to depart, Levi Campbell, a watch supervisor
for the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service, said today in a
phone interview from Houston.  The fog has slowed traffic since Feb. 22. A dense fog
advisory is in effect until this morning, with visibility as low
as a quarter mile (half a kilometer), the  National Weather
Service  said in a  statement  at 4:04 a.m. local time. Fog may
dissipate as a cold front passes today, according to the
statement.  Tankers use the channel connecting the  Gulf of Mexico  to
the Port of Houston to deliver crude oil to refineries in
Houston,  Texas City , Baytown and surrounding cities.  “You need three to five days of sustained fog in the ship
channel before people are going to be really worried,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said Feb.
22.  Twenty-two vessels were waiting to enter the ports of
Galveston and Texas City, also inside Galveston Bay and serviced
by different pilots, Campbell said. Ten ships were waiting to
leave.  PADD 3, the Energy Department’s designation for the Gulf
Coast region, holds about half of U.S. refining capacity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
