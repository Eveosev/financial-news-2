German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  called for a travel ban on Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s regime and an asset freeze targeting the ruling
family, saying rising violence made sanctions “unavoidable.”  Westerwelle said he’ll call for another emergency meeting
of the  United Nations   Security Council  to consider the measures.
The minister also called the European Union’s inability to agree
on sanctions “too hesitant” and urged more action.  “Sanctions are unavoidable considering this extraordinary
violation of human rights, the extraordinary use of violence,”
Westerwelle said in an interview today on  Deutschlandfunk radio .  Qaddafi clung to power in Libya as spreading violence
threatened to plunge the country into civil war. The U.S. said
it was discussing measures against the regime, which reinforced
its defense of the capital of Tripoli with tanks as opponents
consolidated control of the country’s oil-rich east.  Westerwelle stopped short of calling for economic
sanctions, saying that a halt to gas and oil supplies would hurt
the Libyan population as it seeks to overthrow the regime.  The UN Security Council on Feb. 22 condemned the Libyan
regime’s use of violence against protesters, though stopped
short of taking punitive measures against Qaddafi’s regime.  Germany  is one of the 15 members of the Security Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
