Colombian policy makers will
probably keep their benchmark interest rate at a record low
while suggesting that the longest pause in a decade may end next
month as they seek to slow accelerating domestic demand.  The seven-member board, led by bank chief Jose Dario Uribe,
will probably keep the overnight rate at 3 percent today,
according to 21 of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, while
two analysts expect a quarter-point increase. The board, in a
change of tone, last month said it may raise the rate if growth
accelerates, or inflation expectations deviate from the bank’s
target of 2 percent to 4 percent.  The $231 billion economy may have expanded 4 percent in
2010 and quicken to 4.5 percent growth in 2011, Uribe said Feb.
4, as spending to repair damage from the heaviest rains in three
decades stokes demand and fuels inflation. While traders have
pushed up yields on Colombia bonds, Uribe on Jan. 31 said
inflation expectations were “overreacting” on seasonal price
increases.  “Uribe has conveyed the notion that much of the increase
in inflation has to do with supply shocks and that it would be
wrong to overreact to these shocks,” said  Jimena Zuniga , a
Latin America economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in  New York .
“There’s not a high probability of hiking.”  Supply Shock  Since pulling out of its first recession in a decade in the
fourth quarter of 2009, the government steadily pushed up 2010
economic growth forecasts to as high as 4.5 percent before
paring their estimates as damage from the La Nina weather
pattern hampered production.  A two-week trucker strike, which ended Feb. 18, also pushed
food prices up this month, according to the Agriculture
Ministry.  Consumer prices will probably rise 3.61 percent this year,
according to 42 economists in February’s  monthly central bank
survey . Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in January from a year
ago, nearly twice as fast as March 2010’s five-decade low of
1.84 percent. After falling in three of the four months through
October, prices rose 0.91 percent in January.  After the central bank’s Jan. 31 meeting, Uribe said that
the central bank’s technical team sees the annual inflation rate
ending 2011 around 3 percent.  Policy Balance  In the  minutes  of last month’s board meeting, the bank drew
up the arguments for raising the rate and for holding it steady.  Other than increased inflation expectations and higher
internal demand, the bank noted “high asset prices, and the
accelerated build-up in lending,” as reasons to increase the
lending rate.  Yields on the government’s fixed-rate peso bonds due in
July 2020 jumped 133 basis points, or 1.33 percentage points,
the past four months to 8.34 percent, the biggest increase over
such a time period since 2008.  On the other hand, low core inflation levels and price
stability for non-tradable goods, the “temporary nature” of
food price increases, and the “unstable situation with respect
to the sovereign debt of several European countries” were
provided as some of the factors in favor of holding the rate at
3 percent.  The bank, which has paused since a quarter-point cut in
April 2010 took the overnight rate to 3 percent, last raised
borrowing costs in July 2008, when it pushed the benchmark up a
quarter point to 10 percent.  ‘Room to Maneuver’  Rains, which subsided for a few weeks at the beginning of
this year, are due to begin again March during the usual rainy
season in  Colombia .  “The bank will soon begin to normalize policy -- we think
next month -- to slowly bring the policy rate up. There’s no
magic number for the neutral rate, but we think they’ll take it
as high as 5 percent this year,” Zuniga said.  The central bank also may also indicate if it will extend
the March 15 deadline for its purchases of a minimum of $20
million a day in a bid to ease gains in the currency.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry, president of the
bank’s board, said in an interview Feb. 14 he would “ try to
provide the central bank with the room to maneuver that allows
it, if necessary, to keep intervening.”  The peso has weakened 5.3 percent to 1,898.75 per U.S.
dollar yesterday since the central bank began buying daily in
the  spot market  on Sept. 15. The program was extended in October
until “at least” March 15.  Demand, Credit  Uribe has repeatedly defended the bank’s dollar purchase
program and said the steps taken to weaken the peso have been
effective.  Barclay’s expects the currency to trade within a range of
1,800 and 1,900 per dollar this year.  The economy, driven by consumer demand and private
investment, attracted about $6.5 billion in foreign direct
investment through the third quarter of 2010, on top of $7.2
billion in 2009 and a record $10.6 billion in 2008, according to
the central bank.  Total gross lending rose 16.8 percent to 175.9 trillion
pesos ($92.6 billion) in December from a year earlier, according
to a report last month by  the financial regulator .  Retail sales surged 12.4 percent in December from a year
earlier, while industrial output picked up 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
