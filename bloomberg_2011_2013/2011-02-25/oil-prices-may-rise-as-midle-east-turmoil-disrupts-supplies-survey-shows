  Oil prices  may rise from the highest
levels in 29 months next week as violent clashes in  Libya  and
tensions in other parts of the Middle East disrupt crude
shipments from the region, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Twenty-three of 40 analysts, or 58 percent, forecast crude
oil will climb through March 4. Nine respondents, or 23 percent,
predicted prices will decline and eight estimated little change.
Last week, 44 percent said futures would increase.  Crude in New York rose above $100 a barrel this week for
the first time since October 2008 as a Barclays Capital report
estimated Libya’s uprising reduced supplies from  Africa ’s third-
biggest oil-producing country by as much 1 million barrels a
day. The unrest follows the toppling of rulers by popular
movements in Egypt and  Tunisia .  “Oil will rise in what is the biggest threat to global oil
supply since the Persian Gulf War,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Countries in the Middle East and North Africa were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil production and held 61
percent of proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which
publishes its BP Statistical Review of World Energy each June.  The crude oil contract for April delivery rose $8.17, or
9.1 percent, to $97.88 a barrel this week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices for futures closest to expiration
increased 14 percent this week in New York, the biggest gain
since the five days ended Feb. 27, 2009. Futures are up 25
percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
