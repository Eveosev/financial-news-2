  Pakistan  stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index down by the most since October 2009, on concern
a political party’s opposition to higher fuel prices will curb
energy company earnings and boost a  budget deficit .  Oil & Gas Development Co., Pakistan’s biggest energy
explorer, fell 3.9 percent to 151.90 rupees at 3:36 p.m. local
time, on course for its lowest level since Nov. 3. The  Muttahida
Qaumi Movement , a party in the ruling coalition, won’t support
any government move to increase gasoline prices as that would
increase the burden on consumers, the party said an statement
yesterday. The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index plunged 3.6
percent to 11,126.25, the most since Oct. 19, 2009.  “The government seems to be in a fix because they will be
criticized by the opposition and allied parties if they increase
the price of fuel and even if they don’t,” said Khaldoon bin Latif, head of international equities at AKD Securities Ltd.    Pakistan Petroleum Ltd ., the nation’s second-biggest fuels
explorer, sank 4.8 percent to 190.5 rupees, the lowest since Nov.
4.  Pakistan Oilfields Ltd ., the nation’s third-biggest fuels
explorer, tumbled 5 percent to 277.09 rupees, its lowest level
since Dec. 7.  Pakistan hasn’t raised gasoline prices since October as the
government of Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  struggles to
control inflation above 14 percent and pacify coalition partners
that have threatened to quit the government if fuel becomes more
expensive. Keeping prices unchanged, the government lost 13.5
billion rupees ($160 million) in duty revenue from December to
February, according to ministry of finance estimates.  The government is scheduled to review domestic gasoline
prices on Feb. 28.  Oil headed for its biggest weekly gain since 2009 on
concern the turmoil which has cut  Libya ’s output may spread to
other parts of the Middle East and speculation the U.S. economic
recovery will boost fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
