The Philippine peso had its biggest
weekly decline this year as rising  oil prices  caused by an
uprising in Libya stoked concern import costs will increase.  The  Philippines  is “watching closely” the situation in
the Middle East and its impact on crude, Economic Planning
Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said today. The commodity reached a
29-month high of $103.41 a barrel yesterday, before paring gains
on assurances by the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and the International
Energy Agency that they can compensate for any disruption. The
Southeast Asian nation imports almost all of the oil it uses.  “Oil prices rising to record levels spooked financial
markets,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in
Manila. “Markets will remain relatively cautious.”  The peso dropped 0.8 percent this week to 43.708 per dollar
at the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to prices from inter-
dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. It was the biggest five-day
decline since the week ended Dec. 17. The currency rose 0.2
percent today.  More than 1.7 million Filipinos are in the Middle East and
26,000 of them are in Libya, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary
Esteban Conejos said on Feb. 23.  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 increased
12.5 basis points this week and 2.5 basis points today to 6.25
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
