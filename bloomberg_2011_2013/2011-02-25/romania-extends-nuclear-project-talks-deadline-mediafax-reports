The Romanian government extended
until the end of the year the deadline for talks with potential
investors in two planned nuclear reactors,  Mediafax  reported
today, citing Economy Minister Ion Ariton.  New investors are being sought for the 4 billion-euro ($5.5
billion) Black Sea coast project after  GDF Suez  SA, RWE AG and
Iberdrola SA withdrew their support, according to the Bucharest-
based news service.  Romania can continue the construction of the reactors with
state-owned companies such as hydro-power generator
Hidrolectrica SA or power-grid operator  Transelectrica SA  if it
doesnâ€™t find other international investors, Ariton said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
