Italian Prime MinisterMario Monti
called on  Germany  to “reflect deeply but quickly” on steps to
stabilize the European economy such as enabling direct euro-area
recapitalizations of troubled banks or setting up a European-
finance bank backstop system.  “Countries that are at the core of the system and which
have had the huge merit of instilling the culture of stability
to the EU in the first place, most notably Germany, should
really reflect deeply but quickly on these aspects,” Monti said
by video link to an EU conference in Brussels today. “ Europe 
should really accelerate the efforts, as the European Commission
is doing, in order to limit the contagion.”  Monti blamed Italy’s rising borrowing costs on Europe’s
failure to quell the crisis and warned of a backlash in  Italy 
against his budget-cutting policies.  “We are achieving the consequence that month after month
the uninformed as well as the highly informed public opinion in
this country are turning against the European recommendations
for discipline and structural reforms,” Monti said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
