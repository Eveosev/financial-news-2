time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials decreased
0.7 percent to 1,438.5646.  CRUDE OIL  Oil capped the biggest monthly drop in more than three
years on speculation that slowing U.S. growth and Europe’s debt

4. Prices dropped 15 percent this month, the most since December

to concerns that Europe’s debt crisis will damp raw-material
demand.  Copper futures for July delivery slid 0.7 percent to settle
at $3.3655 a pound on the Comex in New York, after touching
$3.3415, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Dec.
