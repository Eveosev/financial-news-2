Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps
commander visited three islands in the  Persian Gulf  of which
both his country and the United Arab Emirates claim ownership,
the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported.  Commander-in-chief Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari
visited Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, along with
Admiral Ali Fadavi, the Guards’ navy commander, IRNA said,
citing a statement by the elite force that didn’t provide
details of the trip.  Iranian president  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  traveled to Abu Musa
last month. The visit revived the territorial dispute and drew
condemnation from the Gulf Cooperation Council, which supports
the U.A.E.’s claim of sovereignty over the three Persian Gulf
islands controlled by Iran.  To contact the reporters on this story:
