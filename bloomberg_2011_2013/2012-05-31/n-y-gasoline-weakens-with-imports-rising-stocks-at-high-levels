New York  gasoline weakened as a
government report showed imports increased to the highest level
in three months and inventories on the East Coast stayed above
average.  Imports of the motor fuel to the region rose 231,000
barrels a day, or 43 percent, to 764,000 barrels last week,
according to the Energy Department. Stocks of reformulated
gasoline are the second-highest on the East Coast in at least a
decade for  this time of year , the data showed.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor slipped 0.25 cent versus futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:50 a.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 4.09 cents to
$2.8323 a gallon.  The differential has held or weakened since May 16 amid
realized and potential outages in the Atlantic basin.  Irving Oil Corp. shut a hydrocracker May 29 at the Saint
John refinery in  New Brunswick , Hillary Stevenson, manager of
data integrity at Genscape Inc., an energy information provider,
said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s largest oil and natural gas producer,
was refused a general exemption from a public workers strike in
the country, threatening output at the nation’s largest refinery
and possibly offshore production.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane Gulf Coast
gasoline versus futures widened 0.62 cent to 11.5 cents a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
