Motiva Enterprises LLC had to adjust
its strategy for the $10 billion expansion of the  Port Arthur ,
 Texas , refinery because of a boom in U.S. oil production, Bob Pease, the company’s chief executive officer, said.  Pease, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. CEO Khalid Al-Falih and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  CEO  Peter Voser  were all in Port Arthur today to
show off the expanded plant, which more than doubled capacity to
600,000 barrels a day.  When the company started the project in 2007, U.S. fuel
demand was increasing while production was decreasing. An
economic downturn and increased production from U.S. shale
fields reversed those trends.  Pease said the expanded plant can run a wide range of
crudes so that it can use whatever oil can be processed most
profitably. The expansion included a 75,000-barrel-a-day
hydrocracker that can quickly shift from making gasoline to
diesel, depending on which fuel is most valuable at the moment.  “The world has changed dramatically in five years, but we
built the right plant for it,” he said.  Early testing indicates that the plant will probably be
able to run above its capacity of 600,000 barrels a day, Pease
said. Motiva would need a new permit from the state to expand
output, he said.  Joint Venture  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of units
of Shell and Saudi Arabian Oil Co., also known as  Saudi Aramco .  Formed in 1998, Motiva has two refineries in south
 Louisiana  in addition to the Port Arthur plant. The three
refineries now have a combined capacity of 1.1 million barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There will probably be synergies among the three
facilities, Pease said. Port Arthur won’t be able to produce all
the heavy residual oil it needs to run its coker at full
capacity, he said. The Convent, Louisiana, refinery doesn’t have
a coker, so it could send leftover residual  fuel oil  to Port
Arthur to be converted into more valuable lighter products.  The Port Arthur refinery has available land for further
expansion, Pease said.  “There’s room for it,” he said. “It’s not in our
immediate plans, but I don’t think our owners would rule out
anything.”  Pease spent his early career in various technical refinery
positions. He moved on to leadership roles and was president of
Shell Trading Co. before becoming Houston-based Motiva’s chief
executive in November 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
