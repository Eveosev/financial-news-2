Tanzania’s annual inflation rate may
drop to below 10 percent before December because of falling food
prices, central bank Governor Benno Ndulu said in an interview.  “We could achieve single-digit inflation faster than
December,” Ndulu said today from Arusha, Tanzania, where he is
attending the African Development Bank annual meeting. “Food
makes up 65 percent on the measure of Tanzania’s inflation.”  The  International Monetary Fund  said that inflation in the
East African nation may slow to below 9 percent this year, after
the rate peaked at 19.8 percent in December because of food and
energy prices. The rate fell for a fourth straight month to 18.7
percent in April, the national bureau of statistics said May 15.  Tanzania plans to get a  credit rating  and sell its first
Eurobond in 12 months, central bank Governor Benno Ndulu said
today. The east African nation has hired Citigroup Inc. as an
adviser, Ndulu said. Citigroup has told them they should issue
at least $500 million in the first sale, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
