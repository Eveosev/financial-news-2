President  Barack Obama  discussed the
situation in Europe with the leaders of the three largest euro-
area economies to prepare for a Group of 20 meeting on the
global economy in June.  Obama, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , French President
Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti talked
about “developments in Europe” in a videoconference, the White
House said in a statement late yesterday. “Leaders agreed to
continue to consult closely as they prepare to meet at the G-20
summit in Mexico next month.”  The call yesterday followed up on talks at the Group of
Eight summit this month and a European Union summit last week,
according to the White House. The euro area’s debt crisis was
the main economic topic at both meetings, with Obama prodding
Merkel at the G-8 talks in Camp David,  Maryland , to move ahead
on measures to balance her budget-austerity drive with measures
to spur growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
