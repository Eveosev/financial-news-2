A Greek opinion poll before June 17
elections showed  New Democracy , the largest pro-bailout party,
leading Syriza, which calls for the cancellation of the
country’s bailout terms.  Of 1,128 people surveyed by Marc SA for Athens-based Alpha
TV, 26 percent said they’d vote for New Democracy, 24.3 percent
for Syriza and 12.5 percent for the Pasok party, which also
supports the bailout program.  Stripping out undecided and invalid votes, New Democracy
would get 28.8 percent to have 127 lawmakers in the 300-seat
parliament. Pasok would secure 37 seats, the poll showed,
meaning the two parties could join to form a majority in the
chamber. Syriza would get 72 seats, according to the poll.  Eighty-five percent of people polled said they want  Greece 
to stay in the euro area, compared with 11 percent who said it
should return to the drachma. When asked if they thought the
possibility of Greece leaving the euro area exists, 56 percent
said no and 39 percent yes.  The margin of error for the poll, conducted from May 29 and
May 31, was between 2.5 percentage points and 2.6 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
