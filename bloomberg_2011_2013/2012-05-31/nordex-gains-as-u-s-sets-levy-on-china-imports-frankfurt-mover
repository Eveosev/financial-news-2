Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, rose the most in almost a week in Frankfurt trading on
speculation a U.S. decision to impose duties on wind-tower
imports from  China  will benefit the company.  Nordex climbed as much as 5.3 percent, the biggest jump
since May 25, after the U.S. Commerce Department set duties of
as much as 26 percent on Chinese products. The stock traded up
4.6 percent at 3.21 euros as of 12:37 p.m. Frankfurt time.  The U.S. decision “is the only possible reason for the
share-price increase,” said Heinz Steffen, an analyst at
Fairesearch GmbH in Kronberg, Germany.  The U.S. released preliminary results yesterday of a probe
into a claim by the Wind Tower Trade Coalition that its members
are harmed by subsidies on Chinese products. The new duties may
be a boon to European rivals such as Nordex,  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS)  and  Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , which face shrinking profit
margins as Chinese production exacerbates a supply glut.  While Hamburg-based Nordex generates most of its sales in
Europe, the company last year benefited from wind-energy
investment in the U.S., where it won a contract from BayWa AG to
supply a 30-megawatt project in  Texas  in December.  Growth of turbine installations in the U.S., the second-
biggest market after China, may tail off next year with the
possible loss of a tax credit, the Global Wind Energy Council
said last month.  “The U.S. needs to prolong or set up new incentives or the
growth in the U.S. will collapse,” Steffen said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
