Croatia’s economy contracted 1.3
percent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago as
capital investments declined and  Europe ’s debt crisis lowered
demand for exports.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.4 percent in the previous
quarter from a year earlier, the  statistics office  in Zagreb
said today in a preliminary estimate.  “The contraction was softened by a temporary rise in
personal consumption in the first quarter, as citizens prepared
for a VAT increase to 25 percent from 23 percent from March 1,”
Zdeslav Santic, chief economist at  Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d. ,
said before the data report. “Lower exports, an investment
drought and a fall in personal consumption will continue to
negatively affect economy.”  The Adriatic Sea nation, which is set to become the
European Union’s 28th member in July 2013, is struggling to
recover from a two-year recession. The government plans to boost
competition and domestic demand to limit the effects of Europe’s
debt crisis and allow the economy to grow 0.8 percent this year,
Finance Minister Slavko Linic said on Jan. 31. Central bank
Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said on May 10 the economy will
contract 1 percent this year as personal consumption and
investment decrease.  The government in January proposed 4 billion kuna ($700
million) in budget cuts to narrow the deficit to 3.8 percent of
GDP from 5.5 percent in 2011. It also said it will lower
expenditures in the public sector and reduce subsidies for state
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
