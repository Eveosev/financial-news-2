Cheyenne Woods, the 21-year-old niece
of  Tiger Woods , qualified for the U.S. Women’s Open.  She earned a spot in the field for the July 5-8 tournament
at the Blackwolf Run course in Kohler, Wisconsin, by finishing
yesterday’s 36-hole qualifier at Carolina Trace Country Club in
Sanford, North Carolina, at 2-over-par 146.  Cheyenne Woods, who will make her professional debut at
next week’s LPGA Championship, tied for first with Katherine
Perry of Cary, North Carolina.  Cheyenne Woods is the daughter of Tiger Woods’s half-
brother, Earl Woods Jr. Her uncle, a three-time winner of the
men’s  U.S. Open , shot a 2-under 70 yesterday in the first round
of the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
