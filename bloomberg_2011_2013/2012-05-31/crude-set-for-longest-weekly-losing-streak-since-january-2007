Oil traded near the lowest close in
seven months, heading for its longest weekly losing streak in
five and a half years, after a Chinese manufacturing index
missed estimates, adding to speculation demand will falter.  Futures were little changed after sliding as much as 0.7
percent. China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.4 in May,
below the median estimate of 52 in a Bloomberg News survey of 27
economists. U.S.  jobless claims  rose while the country’s crude
stockpiles increased to a 22-year high last week, reports showed
yesterday.  Fitch Ratings  downgraded the credit of eight Spanish
regions and Saudi Arabian oil output advanced to the highest
level since 1989.  “It’s very much doom and gloom out there,” said  Gordon Kwan , the head of regional energy research at Mirae Asset
Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong , who forecasts New York crude will
fall to $85 and London-traded Brent to $100 a barrel in “the
short term.” “You’re talking about PMI on the edge of falling
below 50, which could mean a shrinking economy in  China .”  Oil for July delivery fell as much as 63 cents to $85.90 a
barrel and was at $86.40 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time. The contract
yesterday slid 1.5 percent to $86.53, the lowest close since
Oct. 20. Prices are 13 percent lower this year and down 4.9
percent this week for a fifth weekly drop, the longest losing
streak since January 2007.  Brent oil for July settlement was at $101.91 a barrel, up 4
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate
was at $15.52, from $15.34 yesterday.  ‘Declining Confidence’  China’s PMI expanded at a slower pace for the first time in
six months, the country’s statistics bureau and logistics
federation said in a statement today in Beijing. It’s the
weakest since December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “One of the main channels that the problems in  Europe  have
manifested throughout the world’s economy is the impact of
declining confidence in both consumers and business,” Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said
in a telephone interview today. “There are concerns about
China, too, and that is being driven by the impact of what’s
happening in Europe on their export sector.”  Oil output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries rose to the highest level since 2008 in May as  Saudi
Arabia  pumped crude at the fastest pace in at least 23 years, a
Bloomberg survey showed. OPEC production gained 20,000 barrels
to an average 31.595 million barrels a day in May from a revised
31.575 million in April, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts.  Oil Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories climbed  2.2 million barrels  to 384.7
million last week, the highest level since July 1990, figures
from the Energy Department showed. They were forecast to rise 1
million barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies dropped  833,000 barrels  to 200.2 million
barrels, Energy Department data showed. They were projected to
slip 1 million barrels, according to the survey. Distillate
stockpiles, a category that includes heating oil and diesel,
fell 1.7 million barrels compared with an estimate that
inventories would remain unchanged.  First-time claims for unemployment insurance payments
increased by 10,000 to 383,000 in the week ended May 26, Labor
Department data showed yesterday.  Non-farm Payrolls  U.S. companies added 133,000 new jobs in May, up from an
April figure of 113,000 that was revised lower, according to
data from ADP Employer Services. That was less than a forecast
of 150,000 by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hiring last month expanded by 150,000 jobs, according to a
survey of analysts before a Labor Department report of non-farm
payrolls today.  “This month’s miss by the cognoscenti, plus last month’s
revision is a concern given the high correlation to the non-farm
payroll report,”  Stephen Schork , President of the Schork Group
Inc., said in a note today.  In Europe, Fitch lowered the ratings of Andalusia,
Asturias, the Basque country, Cantabria,  Madrid  and Murcia as
well as the  Canary Islands  and Catalonia, which are now one
level above junk status. All regions have a negative outlook,
the rating company said yesterday.  Price Outlook  Oil may decline next week on concern that the euro-zone
debt crisis will spread, slowing economic growth and curbing
fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Seventeen of 33 analysts and traders, or 52 percent,
forecast oil will drop through June 8. Nine respondents, or 27
percent, predicted an increase and seven estimated prices will
be little changed. Last week, 54 percent of surveyed analysts
expected a decrease.  Oil in  New York  has technical support along its lower
Bollinger Band, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures
yesterday halted their decline near that indicator, which is
around $84.28 a barrel today, a price last traded in October.
