Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , which today unveiled
a near-final test version of its Windows 8 software, said its
goal is to have machines with the operating system on store
shelves in time for the year-end holiday season.  If all goes well, the Redmond, Washington-based company
will be able to put the finishing touches on the product in time
to meet a goal of holiday delivery for personal computers with
the software, Windows President Steven Sinofsky wrote in a blog
 post  on Microsoft’s website.  The updated Windows software will be the first to run on
chips based on  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) ’s technology and the first
designed for touch-screen control. Both changes are aimed at
capturing a portion of the tablet market, which is dominated by
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Demand for tablets has been siphoning off
customers from Windows-based PCs and curbing Microsoft’s
influence among consumers.  Based on feedback from this latest test version, Microsoft
will move forward toward a milestone called release to
manufacturing, at which point computer makers will start putting
the software on their devices. Microsoft aims to enter that
final phase in about two months, Sinofsky said.  Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $29.19 at the close
in  New York . The shares have gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
