The governors’ committee of the
African Development Bank agreed to reopen the bank’s
headquarters in Ivory Coast, according to a statement on the
website of the Ivorian presidency.  The bank’s president,  Donald Kaberuka , told Ivory Coast
leader  Alassane Ouattara  that “nothing stands in the way of a
return” to Abidjan, according to the statement on the website
published yesterday. The AfDB will return in a few months,
Ouattara said today at the bank’s annual meeting in Arusha,
Tanzania.  The AfDB moved its staff to Tunisia following a 2002
uprising by exiled soldiers that split Ivory Coast between a
government-held south and a rebel-controlled north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
