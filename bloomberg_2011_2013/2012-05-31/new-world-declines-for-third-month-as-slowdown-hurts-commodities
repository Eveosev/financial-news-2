New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, headed for a third monthly drop
and the lowest in almost three years as an economic slowdown
from China to  Europe  hurt demand for commodities.  The stock retreated 0.3 percent to 96.69 koruna as of 12:52
p.m. in Prague. A close at that level would be the lowest since
July 2009 and would mark a 24 percent slump in May, the biggest
since August 2011.  Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives have fallen 6.1 percent
this month to $101 a metric ton today, after reaching the lowest
since October 2010 at $99 on May 23. Oil headed for the biggest
monthly drop in more than three years in  New York  on speculation
Europe’s worsening debt crisis will reduce fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
