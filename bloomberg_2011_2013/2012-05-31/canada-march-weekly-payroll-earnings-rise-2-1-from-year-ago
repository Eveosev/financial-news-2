Canadian average  weekly earnings  of
non-farm payroll employees rose 2.1 percent in March from a year
earlier, while payrolls grew and average hours worked slipped
for the fifth month in a row, government figures showed.  Earnings rose 0.8 percent on a monthly basis to C$888.34,
($864.56)  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The average
hours worked in March fell to 32.9 from 33 a year earlier, the
fifth such decline in a row.  The 12-month wage increase exceeded the Bank of Canada’s 2
percent inflation target. Statistics Canada’s consumer price
 index  advanced 1.9 percent in March.  The number of payroll employees rose by 48,900 in March to
15.08 million, or by 0.3 percent, Statistics Canada said.
Payrolls were 1.5 percent greater than a year earlier.  The agency’s main  employment report , the labor force survey
of households, reported a job gain of 82,300 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
