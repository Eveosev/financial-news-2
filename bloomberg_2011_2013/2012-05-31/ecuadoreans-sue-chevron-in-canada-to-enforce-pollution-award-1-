Ecuadoreans sued  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  in
 Canada  seeking to seize company assets there to enforce an
$18 billion damage award they won in a lawsuit in  Ecuador  over
pollution from oil operations in the Amazon basin.  Chevron refuses to pay the damages and has no assets in
Ecuador, lawyers for the Amazon residents said in documents
filed today in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto.  Chevron Canada Ltd. “is a necessary party to this action
in order to achieve equity and fairness,” Alan Lenczner, an
attorney for the Ecuadoreans, said in the filing, which seeks
appointment of a receiver to seize shares and assets.  The company’s assets in Canada include the country’s
largest offshore drilling project and new investments in oils
sands in the province of Alberta, Lenczner said in an e-mailed
statement.  Chevron said it would fight any attempt to enforce the
judgment. “The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud,
and it is illegitimate,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement. “The company does not believe that the Ecuador
judgment is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of
law.”  The case is Yaiguaje v. Chevron, CV-12-454778, Ontario
Superior Court (Toronto).  To contact the reporter on this story:
