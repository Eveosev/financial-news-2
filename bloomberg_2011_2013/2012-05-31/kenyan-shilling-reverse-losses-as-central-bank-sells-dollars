Kenya ’s shilling reversed two days of
losses as the central bank was said to sell dollars in the
market.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.6 percent to 85.35 per dollar and was trading 1.5
percent stronger at 85.45 by 12:52 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold an unspecified amount of
dollars in the money market today, Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. The central bank declined to comment when
contacted.  The shilling has weakened 3 percent this month, the biggest
monthly decline since a 7 percent retreat in September. Kenya’s
trade deficit widened in March as fuel imports rose to the
highest in seven months, the  Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 
said yesterday on its website. The gap increased 22 percent from
a year earlier to 80.3 billion shillings ($938 million).  The central bank has offered 5 billion shillings today for
seven-day  repurchase agreements , an official who declined to be
identified in line with policy, said in a phone interview.  Ugandan shilling gained as much as 0.2 percent to 2,482.5
per dollar while Tanzania’s shilling appreciated by 0.1 percent
to 1,589 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
