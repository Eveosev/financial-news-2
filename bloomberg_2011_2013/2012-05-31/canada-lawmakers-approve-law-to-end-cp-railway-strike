Canadian lawmakers have approved
legislation to end a strike by workers at  Canadian Pacific
Railway Ltd. (CP) , clearing the way for service to resume tomorrow.  The bill was passed today by the countryâ€™s Senate and
received royal assent at about 6:30 p.m. in Ottawa, the final
step required for the law to take effect.  CP and its workers must resume service no later than 12
hours after royal assent, according to the legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
