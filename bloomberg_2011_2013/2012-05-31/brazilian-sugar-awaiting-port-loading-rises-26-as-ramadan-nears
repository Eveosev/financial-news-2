The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, rose 26
percent over the past week as Muslim nations stepped up
purchases before the fasting month of Ramadan.  Sugar amounting to 1.61 million metric tons was to be
loaded on vessels at the country’s main ports as of yesterday,
according to shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.
That compares with 1.28 million tons a week earlier.  Muslim
countries  usually stock sugar before Ramadan, which starts in
July this year.  About 38 percent of all the sweetener waiting to be loaded,
or 618,452 tons, will be exported to Muslim nations, the
Williams figures showed. Destinations include Indonesia, which
has the biggest global Muslim population, as well as  Saudi
Arabia  and Iran, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
