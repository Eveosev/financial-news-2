U.S. stocks reversed losses as a
Greek opinion poll showed support for the largest pro-bailout
party and a report indicated the  International Monetary Fund  has
started discussing contingency plans for a rescue of Spain.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,309.66 at 12:49 p.m. in  New York , trimming an earlier drop of
1.1 percent. The index is down 6.3 percent in May, poised for
its worst month since September. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  erased a decline of as much as 103 points.  A Greek opinion poll before June 17 elections showed  New
Democracy , the largest pro-bailout party, leading Syriza, which
calls for the cancellation of the country’s bailout terms. Of
1,128 people surveyed by Marc SA for Athens-based Alpha TV, 26
percent said they’d vote for New Democracy, 24.3 percent for
Syriza and 12.5 percent for the Pasok party, which also supports
the bailout program.  The Wall Street Journal reported on its website that the
European department of the IMF has started discussing
contingency plans for a rescue loan to  Spain  in the event that
the country can’t find enough money to bail out the Bankia
group.  The IMF is not preparing financial aid for Spain, nor has
the country asked for a loan, a spokesman for the fund said.  “There’s been no request for financial assistance from
Spain and the IMF is not making plans for financial assistance
to Spain,” Gerry Rice, the IMF’s director of external
relations, told reporters in Washington today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
