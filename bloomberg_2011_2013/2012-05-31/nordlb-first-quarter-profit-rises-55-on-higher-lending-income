Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale,
the world’s fifth-largest shipping lender, said first-quarter
profit increased 55 percent after lending income jumped.  Net income rose to 118 million euros ($147 million) from 76
million euros in the year-earlier period, the Hanover, Germany-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Net interest
income, the difference between what the bank makes from lending
and pays on deposits, climbed 28 percent to 494 million euros.  NordLB, which managed to steer through the global financial
crisis without a bailout, reiterated that full-year profit will
probably be lower than in 2011 as an economic slowdown increases
loan losses. Profit will be “respectable,” the bank said.  “In view of the continuing uncertainty in the markets and
in particular the national debt crisis in the  euro zone , which
is far from over, we look cautiously towards the future,” Chief
Executive Officer Gunter Dunkel said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
