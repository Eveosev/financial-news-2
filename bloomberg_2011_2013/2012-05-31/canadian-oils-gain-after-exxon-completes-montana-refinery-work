Canadian oils gained a day after
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said it completed maintenance work at its
Montana refinery.  Pam Malek, a Billings, Montana-based spokeswoman for Exxon,
declined to say yesterday when the maintenance began. The
refinery buys crude from suppliers in Wyoming and  Alberta ,
according to a  brochure  for the refinery.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed 75 cents to $19.50 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude’s discount
narrowed 25 cents to $4 below the U.S. benchmark.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $7.50 a barrel.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude grades were mixed. Light Louisiana
Sweet’s  premium  to WTI lost 5 cents to $11.85 a barrel. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 5 cents to $14.75 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium was unchanged at $10. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium rose $1.50 to $10.10. Poseidon’s premium
narrowed 5 cents to $8.85.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
added 20 cents to $11.20 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
