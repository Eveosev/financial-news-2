The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission should avoid overreach in implementing the Dodd-Frank
Act to ensure U.S. banks remain competitive against overseas
rivals, said  Scott O’Malia , a Republican CFTC member.  “The commission should ensure that its registrants and
registered entities remain competitive in global financial
markets,” O’Malia said today in a speech prepared for a
MarkitSERV conference in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
