(Corrects to remove price in first paragraph of story
published May 29.)  Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the Danish
biotechnology company, may build multiple factories in Brazil to
produce enzymes for processing sugar-cane residue into biofuels.  Novozymes will spend the next nine months evaluating
potential locations, Sebastian Soderberg, the Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based company’s global head of cellulosic business and
development and commercial relations, said today in an interview
in  Sao Paulo . The company may decide not to build any.  The company agreed May 23 to supply enzymes for GraalBio
Investimentos SA’s ethanol plants in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
