The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose in the
final minutes of trading, trimming the gauge’s biggest monthly
decline since 2009, as merger and acquisition activity pushed
InterContinental Hotels Group Plc and  Logica Plc (LOG)  higher.  InterContinental rallied 6.1 percent after funds managed by
activist investor  Nelson Peltz  bought a stake in the hotelier.
Logica Plc soared 69 percent after Canada’s CGI Group Inc.
agreed to buy the company for 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 billion).
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  led mining shares lower amid concern about the
strength of the U.S. economy.  The benchmark FTSE 100 advanced 0.2 percent to 5,306.95 at
the close in London, trimming its monthly drop to 7.5 percent.
The FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.2 percent today. Ireland’s
ISEQ Index lost 0.9 percent as the country voted on the European
Union’s fiscal pact.  “We saw yet another volatile session,” said  Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at Capital Spreads in London.
“This has been a recurring story for indices in the past few
weeks that have been unable to sustain any strength due to the
ongoing confusion in the euro zone.”  Stocks erased an earlier rally after data showed the number
of Americans applying for  unemployment-insurance payments  rose
last week to the most in a month. A separate report from the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. showed its
 barometer of business activity  in the world’s largest economy
dropped to 52.7 in May from 56.2 in April. Readings greater than
50 signal growth.  The FTSE 100 has  fallen 11 percent  from its 2012 high on
March 16 as Greece failed to form a government and Spain’s
borrowing costs surged. The gauge fell 1.7 percent yesterday as
the cost of insuring against a Spanish sovereign-debt default
rose to a record.  InterContinental Shares Surge  InterContintental (IHG)  jumped 6.1 percent to 1,526 pence after
the world’s largest provider of hotel rooms said Trian Fund
Management LP owns 4.27 percent of the company’s shares.  Peltz, the billionaire chief executive officer of Trian and
the largest investor in food-chain  Wendy’s Co. (WEN) , pushes companies
to adopt strategies that increase their share prices. Trian had
about $3.4 billion in assets under management as of Feb. 1,
according to a March filing.  Logica, Sage Rise  Logica soared 69 percent to 110.9 pence, its biggest rally
since 1989, after  CGI agreed to buy  the computer-services
provider at a premium of almost 60 percent to yesterday’s
closing share price. Logica’s investors will receive 105 pence
in cash per share from CGI Holdings Europe Ltd., a subsidiary of
Montreal-based CGI.  Sage Group Plc (SGE)  the U.K.’s largest software maker, rose 2.4
percent to 256.5 pence.  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  led housebuilders higher,
jumping 3.8 percent to 1,248 pence as Deutsche Bank AG raised
its recommendation for the shares to buy from hold and a measure
of  house prices in the U.K.  increased in May.  Taylor Wimpey Plc 
gained 1.5 percent to 42.65 pence and Barratt Developments Plc
rose 1.1 percent to 119.9 pence.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  climbed 1.8 percent to 340.5 pence after
UBS AG raised its recommendation for the crude producer to buy
from neutral.  Mining companies declined with base metal prices on the
London Metal Exchange. Xstrata fell 1.8 percent to 922.5 pence
and Kazakhmys lost 2.2 percent to 665 pence. Antofagasta dropped
1.5 percent to 1,002 pence.  ITV Plc (ITV)  dropped 5.7 percent to 72.9 pence after Liberum
Capital said  television advertising  may be weaker in July and
August than estimated, citing reports that some advertisers have
canceled campaigns.  “The TV advertising market could be down 10 percent plus
in July,” analysts wrote in a report to clients. Even so, the
broker reaffirmed its buy recommendation for the shares.  Admiral, Thomas Cook  Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the  U.K.’s second-biggest private auto
insurer , dropped 7.2 percent to 1,039 pence after an antitrust
regulator said it plans to refer the motor-insurance market to
the  Competition Commission  after finding that insurers compete
in a “dysfunctional way,” pushing up premiums by 225 million
pounds a year.  The Office of Fair Trading said it has reasonable grounds
to suspect that parts of the private motor-insurance market
“prevent, restrict or distort competition.”  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG)  sank 7.4 percent to 18.75 pence after
the company’s  first-half adjusted pretax loss  widened to 328.3
million pounds from 232.9 million pounds a year earlier. The
shares fell even as the company said that bookings have
improved.  In Ireland, polls indicated that the country will approve
the EU’s fiscal pact in a referendum today.  The Irish will cast their votes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Opinion polls show supporters of the Fiscal Stability Treaty
leading by about 18 percentage points.  The volume of shares changing hands on the FTSE 100 was 44
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
