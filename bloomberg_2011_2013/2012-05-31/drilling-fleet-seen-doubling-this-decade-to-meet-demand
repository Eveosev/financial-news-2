Energy producers will need to
increase capital spending and double the fleet of drill rigs to
meet energy demand this decade, according to consultant Rystad
Energy AS.  Spending on oil and gas exploration and production will
rise 50 percent in the next five years as fuel consumption grows
with the global economy, Jarand Rystad, managing partner at the
consultant, said at the Marine Money Norway Ship & Offshore
Finance Forum in Oslo today. The fleet of floating drilling rigs
will need to double to 500 units by 2020, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
