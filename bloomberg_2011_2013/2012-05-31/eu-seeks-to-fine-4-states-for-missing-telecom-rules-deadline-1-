Poland ,  Belgium ,  Slovenia  and
 Portugal  may face daily fines for missing a deadline to
introduce telecommunications rules, the European Commission
said.  Regulators today asked the EU’s Court of Justice to impose
daily penalties, including more than 112,000 euros ($139,000) on
Poland, for not drafting rules to open up phone and Internet
markets before a May 2011 deadline.  While the Netherlands was also included on an EU  statement 
listing countries facing court action, EU spokesman Ryan Heath
said the Dutch government promised to send the EU details of its
new telecommunications legislation which would avoid an EU
lawsuit.  “The Dutch government gave their commitment” to EU
Telecommunications Commissioner Neelie Kroes “last night that
their legislation would be fully notified by tomorrow,” Heath
said in an e-mailed statement.  Regulatory authorities in the EU’s 27 member nations last
year had to introduce new requirements that included privacy
rules and measures to allow customers to switch mobile operators
within a day. The Brussels-based commission’s request for fines
shows it “is serious about creating a single market in
telecoms,” Heath said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
