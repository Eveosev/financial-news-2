Economic growth  in  Uganda  will slow
to an estimated 3.2 percent in the 12 months through June after
services and the industrial sectors fell, Chris Mukiza, the
director of macroeconomic statistics at the Uganda Bureau of
Statistics said.  Economic expansion this financial year may cool from 6.7
percent a year earlier, Mukiza told reporters today in Kampala,
the capital.  The projected growth is the slowest in more than a decade
for East Africaâ€™s third-biggest economy, Keith Muhakanizi, the
deputy secretary to the Treasury at the Kampala-based  Finance
Ministry  said today by phone. Donors, including the U.S., Japan,
Denmark, Sweden, U.K., the European Union, finance at least 30
percent of the national budget, according to the ministry.  The industrial sector may grow by 1.1 percent compared with
7.9 percent last financial year, and growth in services may slow
to 3.1 percent from 8.4 percent a year earlier, Mukiza said.  The projected growth this financial year compares with the
Mar. 22 forecast of 4.25 percent by the  International Monetary
Fund , and the 5 percent by the finance ministry last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
