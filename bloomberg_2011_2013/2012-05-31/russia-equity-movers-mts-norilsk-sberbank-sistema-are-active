percent monthly decline.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MTSS RX) gained 1.1 percent to

with AFK Sistema, according to an e-mailed report from  Troika

shareholder in the miner, signaled the company may cancel some
of its undistributed shares held offshore by the end of this
year.  OAO Rostelecom (RTKM RX) dropped 5.7 percent to 106.33
rubles. Russia’s dominant fixed-line operator fell as the MSCI
Russia weighting cut goes into effect on May 31.  OAO Sberbank (SBER RX) declined 0.9 percent to 81.76
rubles. Russia’s largest lender rose earlier after VTB Capital
confirmed its buy recommendation for the stock, citing
“strong” first-quarter earnings.  AFK Sistema (AFKS RX) dropped 0.8 percent to 23.991 rubles.
Russian billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s holding company
climbed as much as 3.3 percent earlier after the company said it
plans to buy back $300 million of shares and as first-quarter
profit tripled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
