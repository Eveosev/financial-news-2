Georgia ’s first-quarter foreign
direct investment grew as much as 33 percent from a year
earlier, a “good sign” that FDI flows will exceed $1 billion
in 2012, said Prime Minister Nika Gilauri.  The European Fund for Southeast Europe is willing to
provide as much as $40 million for micro-financing and small-
business loans in the Black Sea nation after previously
contributing $70 million, Gilauri said today in an interview in
the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. The  EFSE  is a public-private
partnership supported by European governments, private investors
and international financial institutions.  Georgia’s debt relative to economic output is at 28 percent
and falling, Gilauri said. The $14.4 billion economy grew a
preliminary 7 percent in 2011, according to the statistics
office. Gross domestic product rose 8.8 percent from a year
earlier in the fourth quarter.  The former Soviet republic received nearly $1 billion in
foreign investment last year, Gilauri said. The government has
targeted and failed to reach the $1 billion threshold in each of
the last two years as it recovered from a five-day war with
neighboring  Russia  in August 2008 over the breakaway Georgian
region of  South Ossetia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
