HSBC Holdings Plc, until yesterday
the most bullish forecaster for the euro, cut its year-end
prediction for the 17-nation currency against the dollar, citing
the pace of deterioration in the region’s debt crisis.  The bank forecasts the euro will strengthen about 9 percent
to $1.35 by the end of 2012, strategists led by  David Bloom ,
London-based global head of currency strategy said in a report.
HSBC previously said the currency would climb to $1.44, the most
highest among 57 financial companies’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  HSBC, which is the fifth-largest currency trader according
to an annual survey by  Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) ,
still predicts the euro will appreciate against the greenback
this year, anticipating  Greece  will stay in the currency union.  “We also believe that European policymakers will adopt
additional measures to shore up the rest of the periphery,” the
report released today said. “The market will become more
fixated with the weak state of U.S. government finances as we
approach the  U.S. presidential election  later this year. This
will encourage a reassessment of the dollar’s value.”  The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.2385 at 2:53 p.m.
London time, rebounding from $1.2358, the least since July 2010.  It will strengthen to $1.28 by year-end, according to the
average estimate in the Bloomberg survey taken before HSBC cut
its forecast. The predictions range from $1.10 to $1.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
