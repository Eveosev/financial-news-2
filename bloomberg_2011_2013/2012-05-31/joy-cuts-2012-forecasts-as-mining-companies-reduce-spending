Joy Global Inc. (JOY) , the maker of P&H and
Joy mining equipment, cut forecasts for full-year earnings and
revenue as mining companies ease capital expenditure amid
concern over the slowdown in  China . The shares fell.  Profit will be $7.15 to $7.45 a share on sales of $5.5
billion to $5.7 billion for the fiscal year through October, the
Milwaukee-based company said today in a statement. In February,
Joy had  projected  earnings of $7.40 to $7.80 on revenue of $5.6
billion to $5.8 billion. The average of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg were for per-share profit of $7.65 and
sales of $5.72 billion.  “Joy’s performance was solid, but cyclicality is
overwhelming a good operating story,”  Joel Levington , managing
director of corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management
Inc. in  New York , said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“With cyclicality, I mean the combination of low natural-gas
prices and a slowing China, which is dragging coal demand
down.”  Commodity prices have declined 16 percent from this year’s
high in February, according to the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 raw materials.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, said May 15 that it will fall short of
its $80 billion capital-expenditure target over the next five
years as it sees commodity prices declining.  Net Income Rises  Net income in the quarter, which ended April 27, rose 32
percent to $213.6 million, or $2 a share, from $162 million, or
$1.52, a year earlier.  Profit excluding a loss from discontinued operations was
$2.04 a share, beating the $1.96 average of 18 analysts’
estimates. Sales increased 45 percent to $1.54 billion,
exceeding the $1.44 billion average of 14 estimates.  “Even though there is upside to the current market
conditions, the continuing uncertainty will keep mining
companies cautious,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Sutherlin
said in the statement. “International mining houses are
shifting their focus away from the next round of greenfield
plants to finishing the projects already under way and to
pursuing smaller brownfield expansions that have lower risk and
quicker returns.”  Joy dropped 5.1 percent to $55.86 at the close in New York.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s biggest maker of mining equipment,
fell 2.8 percent to $87.62.  Orders Decline  Joy’s equipment orders declined 62 percent in the fiscal
second quarter from a year earlier primarily due to a weak U.S.
coal market, the company said in the statement today.  “Joy management’s tempered near-term outlook on lower U.S.
coal production and some expected delays in international
projects coming online are likely to pressure shares of
Caterpillar this morning -- although U.S. coal is a much smaller
part of Caterpillar’s overall business,”  Stephen Volkmann , a
New York-based analyst for Jefferies & Co., said in a report
today. He has a hold rating on Joy and a buy rating on
Caterpillar.  Joy’s second-quarter bookings fell 19 percent to $1.23
billion. Bookings for Joy’s mining equipment dropped 34 percent
to $1.01 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
