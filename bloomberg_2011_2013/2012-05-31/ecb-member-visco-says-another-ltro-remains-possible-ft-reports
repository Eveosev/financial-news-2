Ignazio Visco, a member of the
European Central Bank governing council, said that while the
central bank has not ruled out a third longer-term refinancing
operation, it is not necessary at present, the Financial Times
reported.  Visco, also the governor of the Bank of Italy, said there
shouldn’t be “any doubt” the bank can act if “price stability
is at risk,” according to the FT, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
