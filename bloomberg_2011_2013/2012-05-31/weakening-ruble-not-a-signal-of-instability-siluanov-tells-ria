The weakening of the ruble
corresponds with the monetary policy of  Russia ’s  central bank ,
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told RIA Novosti.  “The ruble exchange rate, which has significantly dropped
today, remains inside the limits set by the Central Bank,”
Siluanov said. “It’s wrong to talk about instability, risks and
a worsening outlook.”  The ruble lost 2.2 percent to 33.48 per dollar by the close
in Moscow, extending its monthly drop to 12 percent, the most of
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg and sharpest
drop since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
