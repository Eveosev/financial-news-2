Conditions in the shipping industry
may deteriorate as  Europe ’s economy slows and amid tensions in
the  Persian Gulf , Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Uncertainty about the depth and duration of the recession
in the euro area and resurfacing of geopolitical tensions in the
Persian Gulf pose further downside risks to the industry,”
Marco Vetulli, senior credit officer, said in an e-mailed report
today.  The industry’s outlook is negative for the next 12 to 18
months, according to the note. Ship oversupply is greatest among
vessels hauling raw materials and crude oil, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
