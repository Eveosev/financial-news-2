Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  had the biggest
improvement in quality perception by U.S. consumers among
mainstream auto brands in the past year, closing in on top-
ranked  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , according to an annual survey by data
provider ALG Inc.  Toyota’s perceived quality score climbed 6.4 points to 80.1
and the company’s  Lexus  was the No. 1 luxury brand,  Santa
Barbara , California-based ALG said in its Spring 2012 Perceived
Quality Study. Scores for  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s  Chevrolet , GMC
and Buick brands deteriorated the most among the mainstream
brands included in the study.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and Kia Motors Corp. had
the biggest improvements over the past five years, ALG said.
Perceived quality is one of the metrics that ALG considers in
publishing a benchmark guidebook used by the industry to set
residual values, or projected resale values that determine
buyers’ monthly lease payments.  “For Toyota, a thirty-year history of good will has helped
close the gap” to Honda that stemmed from record recalls in
2010, according to the study.  GM’s Chevrolet slipped 1.6 points to 55.4, GMC dropped 1.3
to 54.8 and Buick declined 1.1 to 57.8, with all three brands
scoring below the mainstream brand industry average of 59.1,
according to ALG.  “This is a troubling trend, suggesting that GM’s new
generation of products, which has refreshed much of its lineup,
has not sustained the upward momentum it had been building,”
according to the report, which doesn’t list an author.  Ford, Hyundai-Kia  Ford scored 70.5 in the most recent study, with 62.3 for
Hyundai and 52.4 for  Kia. (000270)   Chrysler Group LLC’s Fiat, Dodge and Chrysler namesake
brands were three of the five worst brands in the study despite
being three of the six most-improved from a year ago, according
to the report.  “While Chrysler Group brands remain among the lowest rated
in our report, they show upward momentum,” ALG said. Chrysler
Group is majority owned by  Fiat SpA. (F)   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) ’s Subaru brand had a score of
71.1, behind Toyota and Honda.  The perceived quality study uses a survey of 3,000 to 4,000
U.S. consumers to gauge brand perception, ALG said in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
