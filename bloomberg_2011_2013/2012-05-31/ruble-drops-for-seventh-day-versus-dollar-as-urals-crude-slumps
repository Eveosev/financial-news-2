Russia ’s central bank is boosting
interventions to support the ruble, according to VTB Capital, as
Europe’s worsening debt crisis drives the currency to its
weakest level in three years.  The ruble lost 2.2 percent to 33.48 per dollar by the close
in Moscow, extending its monthly drop to 12 percent, the most of
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg and sharpest
drop since January 2009. The currency tumbled 2.1 percent to
37.0543 against the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket,
which Bank Rossii uses to limit swings that erode exporters’
competitiveness.  Russia’s central bank boosted its daily foreign currency
sales to as much as $200 million today after the ruble
depreciated beyond 36.5 against the basket, according to VTB.
Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, extended its worst
monthly fall since 2008 amid concern  Greece  will exit the euro
and  Spain ’s finances will deteriorate further.  “They’re selling less than the market anticipated,”
Dmitry Sinitsyn, head of foreign exchange in Moscow at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said by e-mail. The size of interventions are a
“surprise for ruble lovers,” he said.  Bank Rossii drained more than $200 billion of its
international reserves managing a 35 percent devaluation of the
ruble in the six months through January 2009 after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. hobbled commodity prices.  ‘Abstaining’  Russia’s international currency and gold reserves dropped
by $1.1 billion in the week ended May 25 to $513.2 billion, the
lowest level in two months, central bank data showed today.  “The absence of official rhetoric on the foreign-exchange
moves gives the impression the central bank is abstaining from
the market, and actually encourages this move” in the ruble,
Andrey Volkov, head of foreign exchange and money markets at ZAO
Natexis Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “We need to see them.
The  Europe  problem still persists.”  The ruble extended declines after first-time claims for
U.S. jobless benefits grew by 10,000 to 383,000 last week,
topping the median estimate of 370,000 in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. A separate U.S. report showed the economy expanded
at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down from a
2.2 percent prior estimate, and growth in personal consumption
trailed forecasts.  ‘End in Tears’  Russia’s ruble-denominated Eurobond due 2018 fell for a
second day, lifting the yield six basis points to 7.344 percent,
the highest since Jan. 13. The country’s $3.5 billion of notes
due July 2018 fell, increasing the yield by one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.861 percent.  In the first quarter Bank Rossii bought larger amounts of
dollars daily to weaken the ruble as it appreciated than it is
selling now to strengthen the currency, Credit Suisse’s Sinitsyn
said.  The ruble’s sharp depreciation this month may be followed
by a correction over the next two to three weeks of as much as
3.7 percent to 32.3 per dollar, according to Peter Neimyshev,
head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Bank in Moscow.  “We look at  oil prices , and strongly believe that the $99
to $100 level for Brent should hold,” he said by e-mail.  Brent
crude  traded down 1.9 percent at $101.50 in  London .  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 34.079 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.4998 per
dollar yesterday.  “A hard ruble policy could end in tears,” Tim Ash, head
of emerging-markets research at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
in London, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “They are
looking at their peers, and allowing the ruble to go with the
flow, to take some heat out of the system. The central bank is
worried about the global story and mindful of their experience
from 2008 and 2009.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
