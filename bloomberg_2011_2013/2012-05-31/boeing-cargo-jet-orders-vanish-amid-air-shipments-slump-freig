Boeing Co. (BA)  posted its best year on
record for jet-freighter orders in 2011, with 79 planes valued
at $19.5 billion. A repeat performance looks out of the
question.  The world’s largest maker of cargo aircraft hadn’t logged a
new freighter deal in 2012 through May 29, a dry spell that
matches the worst start to a year for such purchases since 2009.
Boeing’s tally in the same period in 2011 was 13 cargo planes
whose catalog prices totaled $3.75 billion.  Freighter demand is wilting along with global air shipments
as  China ’s economy cools and  Europe ’s debt crisis deepens. Those
pressures on cargo carriers are erasing any chance for Chicago-
based Boeing to approach 2011’s freighter deals, said Ken Herbert, a Wedbush Securities analyst in  San Francisco .  “I’m not expecting a very good year,” Herbert said in an
interview. “Freight traffic is still bouncing along the bottom
and slow to come back.”  International air-cargo shipments fell 2.5 percent
worldwide through April, even as industrywide capacity grew 1.8
percent, the International Air Transport Association trade group
said yesterday. Europe’s cargo traffic slid 4.6 percent, while
the Asia-Pacific region declined 4.4 percent.  “It certainly hasn’t helped sales any of our freighter
airplanes,” Tom Crabtree, regional director of cargo marketing
for Boeing, said in an interview. “Most certainly it’s in the
mind of a lot of our customers and how they map out their near-
term expansion plans.”  Boeing’s Market  Cargo-only aircraft handle about 60 percent of global air-
freight shipments, while passenger planes fly the rest in their
bellies, Crabtree said. Boeing has about 90 percent of the
market for new freighters, dominating Airbus SAS, the world’s
biggest commercial-plane maker.  While airlines typically get discounts, retail prices for
the wide-body models that Boeing sells as freighters still can
triple those of the single-aisle 737 passenger jets that made up
the bulk of the planemaker’s 921 gross orders in 2011. Boeing
has cargo variants for three models: twin-engine 767s and 777s,
and the four-engine 747-8, whose $333.5 million  list price  makes
it the company’s costliest offering.  After  beating  the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index in 2011, Boeing has lagged behind both U.S.
stock benchmarks this year. The  shares dropped  5.4 percent in
2012 through yesterday, closing at $69.39. Wedbush’s Herbert
rates the shares as outperform.  Second-Half Rebound?  Air-freight traffic is projected to increase in the second
half of the year, and the rebound may be enough to end 2012 with
volumes little changed or up slightly from 2011, Boeing’s
Crabtree said. IATA cited “some cargo improvement” in April in
yesterday’s traffic report.  “It is possible to identify the start of a growth trend in
cargo for some parts of the world,” IATA Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Tyler  said in the report. “But economic
uncertainty in Europe makes it very difficult to be optimistic
in the near to medium-term.”  Deliveries of the 747-8 freighter, the largest variant of
Boeing’s iconic, hump-backed jumbo jet, began in October. Orders
for the plane totaled 70 dating to November 2005, and 16 had
been delivered through May 29, according to Bob Saling, a
company spokesman.  Two months after Cargolux Airlines International SA took
the first 747-8, Boeing won an order for 27 freighters from
 FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the world’s biggest cargo airline. That
deal, for 767-300F cargo jets, buoyed Boeing by helping keep
that model’s production line busy as the company prepares to
build a U.S. Air Force tanker based on the plane.  FedEx Volumes  Cargo shipments were already softening. FedEx, which also
ordered six 777 freighters last year, said daily package volume
in its express unit dropped 4 percent in the U.S. and 1 percent
for international priority packages for the quarter ended Feb.
29, partly because of technology companies reducing shipments as
they pared inventory and a recession in the euro region.  Lease rates are falling as carriers pare growth plans, said
George Dimitroff, an analyst with London-based consultant Ascend
Worldwide Ltd. Monthly leases on factory-built 747-400
freighters, which predate the 747-8, have dropped as much as 15
percent in the past six months, to a range of $640,000 to
$855,000, he said. Prices vary depending on a plane’s age.  Resale values for the older 747 freighter have declined as
much as 9 percent in the same period, to a range of $44 million
to $98 million. Earlier models are losing value faster as
companies embrace newer, more-efficient planes, Dimitroff said.  Freighter Deliveries  Customers took 16 new Boeing freighters in the first four
months of 2012, after receiving 85 during the previous three
years, according to the company’s website.  “There’s a lot of brand-new freight aircraft being
delivered into the market,” Dimitroff said in an interview.
“There was a lot of 747-8 and 777 freighters that had been
ordered a good four or five years ago when times were better
that are being delivered into the market now.”  In a weak freight market, air-cargo operators also may opt
to pay less upfront by acquiring a used  passenger jet  and then
having it gutted and modified to fly freight, said Aengus Kelly,
CEO of Schiphol, Netherlands-based lessor  AerCap Holdings NV. (AER)   “It’s a lot cheaper to convert those older platforms into
freighters than buying a $130 million or $160 million new
airplane,” Kelly said in an interview. “At the moment, the
economics probably favor conversion rather than ordering for the
most part.”  ‘One Hand’  And even those deals have been few and far between in 2012,
Ascend’s Dimitroff said.  “You can literally count them on the fingers of one hand
the ones that have happened so far this year,” he said.  Boeing does some of that refit work itself. It leads the
industry in conversions of 747-400 passenger jets to cargo
planes, with 49 since the program began in 2005, said Saling,
the spokesman.  The planemaker’s backlog of new orders will cushion the
blow from any falloff in 2012 freighter purchases, according to
 Howard Rubel , an analyst with Jefferies & Co. in  New York  who
recommends buying the stock. Boeing has 166 unfilled orders for
the cargo versions of the 777, 747 and 767, according to the
 company’s website .  Freight shipments closely track the global economy and will
eventually recover, Rubel said in an interview. Orders can also
come in clumps, he said, such as the FedEx purchase at the end
of 2011.  “Over time, there will be more orders as the fleets grow
or as planes wear out,” Rubel said. “We’re not in a perfect
world, but there are no cliffs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
