The  High Court  of Sierra Leone ruled
that two iron ore lease agreements between Red Rock Mining (SL)
Ltd. and local authorities of Tunkia Chiefdom in Kenema district
are not legal, said Banks Kamara, the court’s deputy master and
registrar.  Documents from December 2010 and February 2011 are not
authentic, Kamara said by phone from Freetown, the capital,
today, citing Justice Deen Tarawallie’s May 28 ruling.  The Bagla Hills, where the leases are located are part of
the Gola forest, which was declared a national park in December,
said Aiah Joseph Tholie, Kenema district agriculture officer, by
phone from the city today.  Sable Mining Africa Ltd. (SBLM)  acquired an 80 percent stake in
Red Rock Mining in April 2011. A call made to Sable Mining
Africa’s office in  London  was referred to a spokeswoman who said
by e-mail she would look into the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
