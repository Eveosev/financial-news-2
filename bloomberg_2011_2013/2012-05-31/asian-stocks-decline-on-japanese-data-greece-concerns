Asian  stocks  fell, with the benchmark
regional gauge headed to its biggest monthly drop since 2008, as
Europe’s debt crisis threatened to spread from Greece and
Japan’s factory output trailed estimates.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305)  fell 2 percent in  Tokyo .
Technology companies led declines, with Samsung Electronics Co.,
which gets a fifth of its sales from Europe, sliding 1.2 percent
in Seoul.  James Hardie  Industries SE, a seller of home siding,
retreated 0.8 percent in Sydney after U.S. home sales declined.
Cnooc Ltd., China’s leading offshore energy explorer, dropped
1.1 percent in Hong Kong as oil futures in New York entered a
 bear market .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.4 percent to 112.47 as
of 7:55 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five stocks falling for every
four that rose. The gauge, which earlier fell as much as 1.5
percent, is poised for a 10 percent drop in May, the steepest
monthly decline since October 2008, when global markets tumbled
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brother Holdings Inc.  “The market is genuinely worried about the potential
disorderly default and exit by  Greece  and what that means in
terms of contagion risks,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage
about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney.
“It will have to be a response by governments and the central
bank to stem the panic in the market.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday as China signaled slowing growth in the
world’s second-biggest economy and amid concern Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening. The decline compares with a 4.4 percent
gain by the  S&P 500  and a 1.6 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.6
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.5 times
for the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  ‘Market Weak’  “Asian shares tend to be sold off more in a risk-off
situation,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee about $6.6
billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Risk money
tends to go into Asia as investors try to capture high returns
from strong economic growth,” but when limits to growth become
evident, people sell, he said. “The market is weak on Greece
exit concerns, and signs of slowdown in the U.S. and China.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.1 percent as the
yen extended gains, reaching a three-month high against the
dollar and a four-month high against the euro. A stronger
Japanese currency cuts the competitiveness of the nation’s
exporters abroad.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.4 percent and
South Korea’s Kospi Index slid 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index fell 0.3 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite
Index slid 0.5 percent.  India Growth Slows  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, dropped 0.8
percent after  India’s economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the three
months ended March from a year earlier, the weakest pace in at
least eight years.  Japan’s  industrial production  rose 0.2 percent in March
from February, the Trade Ministry said in Tokyo today. The
median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a 0.5 percent increase.  Hitachi Construction declined 2 percent to 1,512 yen in
Tokyo.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , another construction machinery maker, slid
2.6 percent to 1,878 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent today. The guage
fell 1.4 percent in New York yesterday after a report showed the
number of contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell in
April by the most in a year.  James Hardie, which counts the U.S. as its biggest market,
declined 0.8 percent to A$7.42.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s
biggest carmaker by market value, slid 1.1 percent to 3,040 yen
in Tokyo.  European Turmoil  Stocks dropped as an opinion poll showed most Greeks want
to see the terms of a financial rescue revised, stoking fears
the nation may default and be forced to exit the euro.
Separately, the  European Central Bank  denied it has rejected a
plan floated by the Spanish government to recapitalize Bankia
group.  Samsung Electronics retreated 1.2 percent to 1,211,000 won,
while  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which counts Europe as its top
market, declined 4.9 percent to 77 yen in Tokyo.  Resources stocks dropped on falling commodity prices. Oil
futures in New York yesterday closed 20 percent below their peak
this year, the common definition of a bear market. The London
Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial commodities
including copper and aluminum slid 1.9 percent yesterday.  Cnooc slid 1.1 percent to HK$14.04 in  Hong Kong , while PT
Aneka Persero Tambang Tbk, an Indonesian mining company, tumbled
12 percent to 1,150 rupiah in Jakarta ahead of its removal from
the MSCI Indonesia Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
