Anadolu Efes Biracalik & Malt Sanayii
AS (AEFES) , the Middle East’s biggest brewer, rose for a second day,
paring a monthly retreat, after saying it was looking to expand
in ex-Soviet and Eastern European markets.  The shares gained 2.2 percent to 23.50 liras at 12:15 p.m.,
heading for the highest level in more than a week, trimming its
decline in May to 5.3 percent on a closing basis.  The brewer is looking for acquisition opportunities in ex-
Soviet and Eastern European markets after it bought  SABMiller
Plc. (SAB) ’s Russian and Ukrainian business in exchange for a 24
percent stake in a $1.9 billion deal last year, Alejandro Jimenez, Anadolu Efes president for beer operations, said in an
interview at the company’s head office in Istanbul yesterday.  Anadolu Efes is also planning either to build a new brewery
in  Turkey  or to expand one of the five existing facilities in
the next three years, Jimenez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
