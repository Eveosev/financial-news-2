England batsman  Kevin Pietersen  will
focus on Test match cricket after retiring from shorter forms of
the international game.  He won’t play any more one-day internationals or Twenty20
games for the national team, the England and Wales Cricket Board
said today in a release. He wanted to pull out of 50-over ODIs
and carry on with Twenty20s but ECB contracts don’t allow that.  “With the intensity of the international schedule and the
increasing demands on my body, approaching 32, I think it is the
right time to step aside and let the next generation of players
come through to gain experience for the ICC  World Cup  in
2015,” Pietersen said in the statement. “For the record, were
the selection criteria not in place, I would have readily
played for  England  in the upcoming ICC World Twenty20.”  Pietersen has played 127 one-day internationals and 36
international Twenty20 matches for England, the board said.  He has scored 4,184 runs at an average of 42 in ODIs and
averages 38 in international Twenty20 cricket.  England is currently 2-0 up in a three-Test series with the
West Indies. The third match starts June 7 at Edgbaston,
Birmingham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
