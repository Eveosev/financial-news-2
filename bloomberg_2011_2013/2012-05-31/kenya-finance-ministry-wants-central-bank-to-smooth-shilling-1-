Kenya ’s  Finance Ministry  is
encouraging the central bank to intervene whenever necessary to
smooth volatility in the country’s exchange rate, Permanent
Secretary  Joseph Kinyua  said.  “The central bank should be able to support genuine dollar
demand from the market to ensure the variation does not affect
the normal market situation,” Kinyua said.  East Africa’s biggest economy will receive $240 million
next week, part of a syndicated loan agreed on earlier this
month, which will help support the currency, Kinyua said in an
interview today in Nairobi, the capital.  The shilling has weakened 3 percent this month, the biggest
monthly decline since a 7 percent retreat in September. Kenya’s
trade deficit widened in March as fuel imports rose to the
highest in seven months, the  Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 
said yesterday on its website. The gap increased 22 percent from
a year earlier to 80.3 billion shillings ($938 million).  The pressure on the shilling has been caused by increased
imports to support infrastructure projects, and that should ease
soon, Kinyua said.  The shilling weakened as much as 1.1 percent today before
reversing its loss to close 0.6 percent stronger at 86.20 a
dollar in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
