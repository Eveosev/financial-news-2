Green Fuel (Pvt) Ltd., a closely held
Zimbabwean ethanol producer, has been ordered to restrict
pollutants released into the local water supply from a $600
million plant built without the consent of the Environmental
Management Agency, the  Chronicle  said.  Effluent from the 120,000 liter-a-day plant is affecting
livestock, the Bulawayo-based Chronicle said on its website,
citing Petronella Shoko, a director at the environment agency.
The facility was constructed under a Build, Operate and Transfer
agreement with the Agricultural and Rural Development Authority,
known as ARDA, the Chronicle said.  The plant in the Chisumbanje district isn’t producing fuel
currently because of weak demand for ethanol-blended gasoline,
the Chronicle said. No one responded immediately to three calls
to Green Fuel’s headquarters in Harare today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
