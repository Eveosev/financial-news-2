  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a U.S. maker of
 lithium-ion batteries  for electric cars, fell the most in more
than two weeks after saying it expects “significant” losses
and is pursuing options to raise cash.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , fell 11 percent to
$1.02 at the close in  New York , the most since May 14.  The company is replacing defective battery modules and
packs at a cost of $51.6 million and taking an inventory charge
of $15.2 million. It expects to incur “significant net losses
and negative operating cash flows over the next several
quarters,” it said yesterday in a filing.  The expected losses raise “substantial doubt on the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in
the filing, repeating a May 15 disclosure. The company is
talking to potential partners and evaluating other strategic
options.  This may make it difficult for A123 to attract customers if
auto manufacturers are concerned the company won’t be around to
honor warranties,  Theodore O’Neill , an analyst at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. in New York, said today in an interview. The
company’s financial condition may also deter potential backers.  “Can these guys raise money?” said O’Neill. “Sure, hope
springs eternal for some investors, but it will certainly be a
valuation that disappoints existing shareholders.”  A123’s shares have fallen 32 percent since it recalled on
March 26 batteries that made a Fisker Automotive Inc. car shut
down in a Consumer Reports test.  To contact the reporter on this story:
