Assets held by failed Icelandic
lender  Landsbanki Islands hf  rose by 77 billion kronur ($589
million) as of March 31 from the previous quarter, its winding
up committee said today in a statement on its website.  Most of the gain is due to the bank’s sale of Iceland Foods
Ltd., it said. The bank has paid 43 percent of all priority
claims and the committee estimates Landsbanki’s assets exceed
all such claims by 122 billion kronur,  it said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
