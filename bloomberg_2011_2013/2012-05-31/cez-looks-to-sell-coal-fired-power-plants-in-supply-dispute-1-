CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
electricity producer, is considering the sale of two ageing
coal-fired  power plants  because of a dispute over supplies in
advance of tougher emissions rules.  CEZ may sell the northern Pocerady and Chvaletice plants
after long-term supply contracts expire next year, according to
a statement today.  A legal dispute over the price of brown coal supplied to
the plants by Czech Coal Group has led the company to explore a
potential sale. Built in the 1970s, the plants require
investment in excess of 20 billion koruna ($969 million) each to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2016 when tougher
environmental requirements come into effect, CEZ has said.  Czech Coal and EP Holding, a local utility, have already
expressed an interest in the plants and CEZ is ready to review
other offers, spokesman Ladislav Kriz said today in an e-mailed
statement. Czech Coal would be the logical buyer of the Pocerady
plant, which is located 5 kilometers (3 miles) from its Vrsany
mine, said Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at Cyrrus AS brokerage.  “The value of the assets depends very much on the buyer,”
Hatlapatka said. “Czech Coal could afford to pay a higher price
for Pocerady because it could then supply it with its own coal.
It makes sense.”  The Pocerady plant operates five 200-megawatt units, while
Chvaletice has four 200-megawatt units, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
