HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Stuart Gulliver  said the euro region’s “stresses” are
similar to those suffered by Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia in
the 1990s as they pegged their currencies to the  U.S. dollar .  “Those economies suffered from an inappropriate,
inflexible peg, which created capital inflows that were
ultimately unsustainable,” Gulliver said in the text of a
speech at a Fung Global Institute conference in Hong Kong
released by the bank today. “The lessons of the Asian crisis,
of building up excessive leverage and inflexible exchange rates,
were not learned.”  About $4 trillion has been wiped off the value of global
stock markets this month amid the euro region’s debt crisis. The
European Commission yesterday challenged  Germany ’s remedies to
the financial crisis, calling for direct aid for troubled banks,
while an opinion poll showed most Greeks want to see the terms
of a financial rescue revised.  Four steps should be taken to ensure the euro region
remains intact, said Gulliver. These include, a Europe-wide
deposit insurance plan provided by the European Banking
Authority and a program to purchase bad assets in a manner
similar to the U.S.’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, led by the
European Financial Stability Facility. A plan toward fiscal
union and a euro bond to refinance weaker countries are also
needed, Gulliver said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
