Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the New York-based
advisory firm founded by Robert Greenhill, hired three managing
directors and opened a Stockholm office to expand in Europe.  Anthony Parsons, previously vice chairman of U.K. mergers
and acquisitions at Deutsche Bank AG, and Mats Bremberg, who was
head of Nordic investment banking at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , joined the
firm along with Luca Ferrari, previously head of M&A for
Northern Europe at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) , Greenhill said today
in a statement.  Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok said in April
he’s seeing a surge in recruiting and the firm may add at least
five senior bankers.  “Having expanded our North American team significantly
during the financial crisis, we believe now is the time for a
targeted expansion in our European business,” Bok said today in
the statement.  Parsons will be a senior member of Greenhill’s U.K.
advisory team, based in London. Bremberg, who will be based in
Stockholm, will help expand the firm’s business in the Nordic
region. Ferrari will be co-head of European corporate advisory,
based in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
