U.S. tax-exempt debt gained in most
maturities today while failing to keep pace with rallying
Treasuries amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening.  Ten-year Treasury yields fell to a record low, leaving
 interest rates  on similar-maturity municipals about 119 percent
of their federal counterparts. It’s the highest ratio since
October,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Top-rated 10-year munis yielded 1.88 percent at noon in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark 10-year
Treasury  yields  fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 1.58 percent at 12:30 p.m. New York time. The yield
reached as low as a record 1.5309 percent.  “This is the global flight to quality continuing,” said
Hardy Manges, head of municipal trading at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities in New York.  Interest rates on AAA tax-exempt debt due in 30 years are
also about  119 percent  of comparable-maturity federal bonds, the
highest since January.  Munis’ relative cheapness to Treasuries may increase demand
for tax-exempt debt from buyers of taxable securities, Manges
said.  “The cross over trade looks pretty attractive here,”
Manges said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
