OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) ,  Russia ’s dominant
fixed-line operator, sank the most in nine months as MSCI Inc.
cut the stock’s weighting in its Russia Index.  American depositary receipts of the Moscow-based
telecommunications company lost 11 percent, the most since Aug.
8, to $19.14 at the close of trading in  New York . Shares in
Moscow dropped 5.7 percent to 106.33 rubles, or the equivalent
of $3.19. One ADR equals six ordinary shares.  MSCI reduced its weighting in Rostelecom by 0.3 percent to
2.3 percent, according to an e-mailed copy of MSCI’s report on
May 15.  “A lot of funds use the MSCI as an index for Russia, so as
they’re changing their exposure, the stock is feeling the
impact,” John T. Connor, founder and portfolio manager of the
Third Millennium Russia Fund, which manages $20 million
including shares of Rostelecom, said by phone from  New Jersey .
“This is really a buying opportunity as nothing has actually
changed at Rostelecom.”  Rostelecom, Connor said, is focusing on additional services
such as video and social media. The company said on May 24 that
it will increase its ownership of Mosteleset, which operates
data and pay television networks in Moscow, to 100 percent after
buying a 26 percent stake for 1.8 billion rubles ($53.8
million).  The MSCI  Russia Index (MXRU)  fell 1.8 percent to 665.88 for a 9.6
percent slide this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
