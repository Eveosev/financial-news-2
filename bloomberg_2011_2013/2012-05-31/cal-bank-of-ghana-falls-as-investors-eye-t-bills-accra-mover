CAL Bank Ltd. (CAL) , a lender in Ghana,
dropped the most in three weeks as rising government Treasury
yields in the West African nation drove investors away from the
stock.  The shares declined 4.2 percent to 23 pesewas by 3 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, the biggest fall since May 9 and the lowest
level in two weeks.  “The shares suffered from the ongoing sell-off on the
market with investors leaving the market to invest in Treasury
bills,” Emmanuel Tsigbey, a stock trader at NewWorld Securities
Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today. “It is due to the fast pace
at which the Treasury bill yields are rising and these investors
are looking for quick cash.”  Ghana ’s  91-day T-bill rate , the benchmark for lenders, rose
to 19.36 percent at the last auction on May 24, the highest
since Jan. 15, 2010, as the central bank sought to absorb extra
cedis on the local market and bolster the local currency which
has dropped 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
