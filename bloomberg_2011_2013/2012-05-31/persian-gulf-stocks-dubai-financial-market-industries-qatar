the emirate, trimming this month’s loss to 9.8 percent. Qatar’s
QE Index fell 0.7 percent.  The following shares were active in the Persian Gulf
region. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Dubai Financial Market  (DFM) (DFM UH) retreated 1.6 percent to
94.5 fils, the lowest close since May 16, on bets second-quarter
profit at the only publicly traded Arab stock market may drop
after trading volumes slumped. The stock “is a proxy for the
market,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based analyst at Gulfmena
Investments Ltd. “Lower traded volume of the exchange means
that second-quarter earnings will be lower than the strong
first-quarter figures.”  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD)   declined 1.4 percent, the
most since May 14, to 136.9 riyals. Shares of the second-biggest
petrochemicals maker in the Middle East retreated 6.2 percent
this month as oil prices headed for the biggest monthly drop in
