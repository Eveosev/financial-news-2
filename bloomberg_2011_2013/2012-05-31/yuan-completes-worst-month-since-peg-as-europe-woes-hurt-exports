The  yuan  had its biggest monthly loss
since a peg ended in July 2005 as Chinese exports slumped amid a
worsening debt crisis in Europe.  Overseas sales  rose 4.9 percent in April from a year
earlier, the smallest gain since 2009, according to official
data on May 10. Shipments to the European Union fell 2.4
percent, with sales to  Italy  sliding 20 percent. Chinese
manufacturing may shrink for a seventh month in May, a
preliminary report by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed last week. The People’s Bank of  China  weakened its
 reference rate  for the yuan by 0.9 percent this month as
Europe’s woes bolstered demand for dollars.  “China’s export growth is likely to stay low for quite a
while with weak demand from  Europe ,” said Tommy Ong, senior
vice-president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong)
Ltd. “We could see officials have the intention to hold the
yuan stable as global financial conditions are unfavorable.”  The yuan declined 0.92 percent this month to close at
6.3690 per dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency dropped 0.18 percent today
and touched this year’s low of 6.3783. The central bank set a
daily reference rate, around which the yuan can fluctuate by as
much as 1 percent, of 6.3355 per dollar, the weakest level since
March 15.  Versus the euro, China’s currency is the strongest it’s
been in a decade. The yuan reached 7.8381 per euro today, the
highest since June 2002. The cost of protecting Spanish
 government bonds  with default swaps climbed to a record
yesterday and a Greek poll showed support for anti-austerity
parties ahead of elections next month that may determine
Greece’s future in the euro.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan against the
dollar, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options,
climbed 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 2.2
percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.16 percent
today to 6.3662 per dollar, extending this month’s loss to 1.04
percent. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards traded at 6.4306,
a 0.96 percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
