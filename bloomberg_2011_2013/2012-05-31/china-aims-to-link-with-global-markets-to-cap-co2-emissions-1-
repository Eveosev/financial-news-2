China  aims to link its domestic
carbon market with others around the world as it seeks to cut
emissions, a government official said.  The country can set a cap on emissions in some regions
without curbing economic development, Shu Wang, deputy director
of the Climate Change Department at the National Development and
Reform Commission, said today at the CarbonExpo conference in
Cologne,  Germany .  The NDRC, China’s policy making body, has asked officials
in two provinces and five cities with some of the country’s
greatest emissions to set up cap and trade programs by next year
as a possible start for a national system in 2015. The pilot
programs are part of China’s plan to reduce so-called carbon
intensity, or emissions per economic unit, by as much as 20
percent by 2015, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Emissions limits, which industries would be bound by, and the
participation of bankers are still being worked out, New Energy
said May 18.  “Banks, brokers and funds are very helpful for carbon
markets,” Wang said.  Regional cap and trade systems are scheduled to start in
Beijing, Tianjin,  Shanghai , Shenzhen, Guangdong, Hubei and
Chongqing. The Brazilian state of  Rio de Janeiro  may set up its
carbon-trading system in January, a government official said
yesterday in Cologne.  Australia  is scheduled to launch its
carbon price in July before moving to cap and trade in 2015. The
European Union has operated the world’s biggest emission-trading
market since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
