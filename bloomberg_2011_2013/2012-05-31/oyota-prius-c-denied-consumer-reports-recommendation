Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius c, its
cheapest hybrid vehicle, failed to receive a recommendation from
Consumer Reports magazine, which said the subcompact hatchback
offers a harsh and noisy ride.  The Prius c, which starts at $18,950, scored 53 out of 100,
one point below its main competitor, Honda Motor Co.’s Insight,
 Consumer Reports  said on its website. Still, the c offers
“excellent” fuel economy of 43 miles (69 kilometers) per
gallon and 37 mpg in the city, the best of any car tested,
according to the magazine.  “Its harsh ride, noisy engine and cabin, and slow
acceleration make it feel more like an econobox than a
sophisticated hybrid,” Consumer Reports said on its website.
“We can’t recommend the Prius c because it scores too low in
our tests. We do expect it to have very good reliability.”  Toyota cars are among the most frequently recommended by
the magazine published by Yonkers, New York-based Consumers
Union, a non-profit group. Carmakers seek favorable evaluations
from the magazine, which is seen as more objective because
accepts no advertising and buys every vehicle it tests.  Joichi Tachikawa, a spokesman for Toyota in  Tokyo , said he
couldn’t immediately comment on the  Consumer Reports  review.  Toyota started to sell the c, called the aqua in  Japan , in
the U.S. in March, with deliveries reaching 8,901 units during
its first 49 days on the market, according to the company’s
website. The subcompact is part of the four-model “family” of
Prius vehicles, which became the world’s third best-selling car
line in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
