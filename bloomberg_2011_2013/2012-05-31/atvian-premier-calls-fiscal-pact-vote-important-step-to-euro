Latvia ’s approval of the European
Union’s Fiscal Stability Treaty today is an important step as
the Baltic nation seeks to adopt the euro in 2014, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said.  “Without ratification of the fiscal compact, I think euro
zone accession could be complicated,” he said by phone from
Stralsund,  Germany , where he is attending a conference, after
the 100-member legislature voted 67-29 with one abstention to
approve the treaty in a second and final reading.  Latvia, along with neighboring Lithuania, may face a
“challenging” inflation outlook that could hamper their
convergence with the single currency, the  European Central Bank 
said in a report yesterday. With euro-area nations such as  Spain 
and Italy slipping into a recession after enacting austerity
measures to fight the debt crisis, Europe’s economy will fail to
grow this year with risks “tilted to the downside,” the
Brussels-based European Commission said on May 11.  “Of course we keep our eyes open on the developments in
the euro zone,” he said. “We see the situation is quite
complicated in  Greece  and worsening in Spain.”  Should the economic situation worsen in the euro area,
Latvia can put off its membership, according to Dombrovskis.  “There is always this possibility, but I hope we won’t
need to use this possibility and that the euro zone will work to
solve these problems,” Dombrovskis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
