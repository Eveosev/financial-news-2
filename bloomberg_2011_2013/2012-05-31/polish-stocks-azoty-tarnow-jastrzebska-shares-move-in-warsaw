Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  added 1.2
percent to 2,096.35, at the close in Warsaw. The gauge declined
6.4 percent in May, its fourth straight monthly fall.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Azoty Tarnow (ATT PW), Poland’s largest chemicals maker,
jumped 5.3 percent to 37.9 zloty, to an all-time high after OAO
Acron of Russia said it’s “open to dialogue” with Azoty
shareholders on its bid to buy a 66 percent stake in the
company. Acron plans to hold meetings with Azoty shareholders
next week and after that it will “make a decision” on whether
to increase the price.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW)  , the European
Union’s largest coking coal producer, declined 3 percent to 90
zloty, biggest drop in more than a month, after its shareholders
approved the management’s dividend proposal. Poland pushed
through higher dividend payouts from state-controlled power
utility PGE SA and insurer PZU SA at shareholders’ meetings
yesterday, raising extra cash to help cut the  budget deficit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
