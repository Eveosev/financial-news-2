U.K. stocks dropped for a second day
after a measure of U.S. business activity missed forecasts.  The FTSE 100 Index slid 0.4 percent to 5,277.39 at 3:55
p.m. in  London  after earlier rallying as much as 1 percent.  U.K. stocks declined after the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc. said today its  barometer of business
activity  decreased to 52.7 in May from 56.2 in April. Readings
greater than 50 still signal growth.  Economists had predicted that the purchasing managersâ€™
gauge would rise to 56.8, according to the  median of 55
estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey. Projections ranged from
53.7 to 60.7.  ITV Plc (ITV)  tumbled 7.2 percent to 71.7 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
