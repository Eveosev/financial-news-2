U.K. gasoline consumption rose in the
three months to March, the first quarterly increase since 2007,
as motorists bought the fuel on concern about a tanker driversâ€™
strike, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said.  Deliveries of gasoline for inland consumption in the U.K.
totaled 3.45 million metric tons in the first quarter, up 2.6
percent from a year earlier, DECC  said  in its monthly energy
report published today. That was the first year-on-year
quarterly gain since 2007, according to DECC.  The threat of a strike by tanker drivers, which was called
off earlier this month, also resulted in diesel demand rising in
the first quarter, DECC said. Consumption increased by 4.4
percent to 5.22 million tons in the three months to March,
compared with the first quarter of last year.  Warmer weather in the first quarter saw demand for heating
oil fall 17.9 percent, the data show. Deliveries were 950,000
tons, down from 1.16 million tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
