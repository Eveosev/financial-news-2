Brazilian unit of  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , rose 1.2 percent to
77.10 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , after erasing a loss of
as much as 2.3 percent.  Brazil â€™s government is raising taxes on beverages including
beer, soda, bottled water and juice. Prices of cold beverages
could increase as much as 2.85 percent when the increase takes
effect in October, Taxation Undersecretary Sandro Serpa told
reporters today in Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
