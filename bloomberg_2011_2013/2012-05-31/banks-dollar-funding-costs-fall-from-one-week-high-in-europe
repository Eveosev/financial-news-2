The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars is heading for its first monthly increase since
November, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 52 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12 p.m. in
London from minus 51 yesterday and minus 45 on April 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-month basis swap widened to as much as minus
162.5 on Nov. 30 before the  European Central Bank  bolstered
banks with more than one trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of cheap
loans through its longer-term refinancing operations.  The one-year basis swap widened for the second month,
reaching 65 basis points below Euribor from minus 52 on April
30. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Short-term bank funding rates exceeded longer-term costs in
the market for borrowing and lending European  government bonds ,
the so-called repo market. The difference between the one-day
euro repurchase agreement and three-month repo rates was little
changed at 3.7 basis points, near the  widest  in three months,
European Banking Federation data show.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- was 32 basis points from 31 yesterday. An increase
signals banks are more reluctant to lend.  The Euribor/OIS spread was 39.5 basis points from 39
yesterday.  ECB Deposits  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, placing 770 billion euros from 760 billion euros
the day before.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for loans
over that period in euros, fell to 0.668 percent from 0.671
percent the day before, while one-week Euribor was unchanged at
0.317 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.467 percent. The three-
month dollar FRA/OIS spread was 44.5 basis points from 44
yesterday.  Three-month Euribor USD, a gauge of dollar funding costs
from the Brussels-based EBF, rose to 0.930 percent from 0.922
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
