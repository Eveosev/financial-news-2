Peru ’s sol had its steepest monthly
decline since October 2008 on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may
hurt global growth and damp exports from the third-largest
copper producer.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7075 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.7050 yesterday, taking its decline since
April 30 to 2.7 percent, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. That’s the steepest monthly fall since October 2008,  data 
from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The Andean country’s central bank sold $277 million in the
spot market today after the sol touched 2.7110, its weakest
level since Nov. 29. Copper, Peru’s top export, fell as signs of
slowing growth in the U.S. and  China  added to concern the euro-
zone crisis will damp demand for raw materials.  “Growth in China is decelerating and you have an
increasingly uncertain outlook in the U.S.” said Marjorie Hernandez, a currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  New
York . “Peru is extremely dependent on metals. The Chinese
growth story weighs heavily on countries that depend so much on
one product.”  First-time claims for unemployment insurance payments in
the U.S. increased by 10,000 to 383,000 in the week ended May
26, Labor Department data showed today. A Chinese government
purchasing managers’ index for May due tomorrow may decline to
52 from 53.3 a month earlier, according to the median estimate
of 27 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.33 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.28 centimo to 116.41 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
