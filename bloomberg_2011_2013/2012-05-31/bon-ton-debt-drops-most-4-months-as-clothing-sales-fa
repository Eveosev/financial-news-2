Bon-Ton Stores Inc. (BONT) ’s bonds climbed
to the highest price in more than two weeks after the retailer
reported that sales rose this month.  Bon-Ton’s $464 million of 10.25 percent notes due March
2014 jumped 4.5 cents on the dollar to 71 cents to yield 33
percent at 9:28 a.m. in  New York , the highest since May 15,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Comparable store sales
rose 1.5 percent in the four weeks that ended May 26, the York,
Pennsylvania-based retailer said today in a statement.  Bon-Ton, which has department stores in the U.S. Northeast
and Midwest, is seeking to lure new customers with trendier
apparel as it tries to make enough money to pay off or refinance
some of its debts before the 2014 notes come due. In January,
the chain appointed Brendan Hoffman, the former head of Lord &
Taylor LLC, as chief executive officer.  “Compelling new offerings and refinements in our marketing
efforts yielded positive results,” Hoffman said in the
statement.  Total sales increased 1.2 percent to $183.1 million for the
period, from $181 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. Bon-Ton also said today that it had $423 million of
excess borrowing capacity under its credit facility, up from
$400 million at the end of April, according to a May 3
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
