The lira rebounded from its weakest
in 4 1/2 months, paring a monthly loss, after  Turkey ’s April
trade deficit beat analysts’ estimates, signaling Turkey’s
 current-account deficit  may fall from last year’s record high.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8470 per dollar
at 12:24 p.m. in Istanbul, recouping part of yesterday’s 1.3
percent decline that pushed the lira to the lowest since Jan. 13
and trimming its monthly retreat to 4.8 percent.  The trade deficit narrowed more than expected to $6.6
billion in April, contracting for a sixth month. The gap
declined from $9.1 billion a year earlier, the statistics office
in Ankara said on its website today. The median estimate of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was $7.1 billion.
Turkey’s current-account deficit, the world’s second-biggest
last year after the U.S. at $77 billion, ballooned last year.
The shortfall will probably shrink to 8.8 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 10 percent in 2011, according to
the  International Monetary Fund .  “Once again a good print surprising positively with strong
exports performance,”  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist for Europe,
the  Middle East  and  Africa  at  Morgan Stanley & Co . in London,
said in an e-mailed note. “This will translate into a better
than expected  current-account deficit  print as well.”  Turkey’s exports rose 6.8 percent to $12.7 billion in
April, while imports fell 8 percent to $19.3 billion, the
statistics office said.  Repo Auction  The central bank refrained from lending at its lowest
funding rate for the first time this week, offering to lend 4
billion liras today at its one-week repurchase agreements daily
auction. The Ankara-based bank varies the policy rate daily
between 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent within the so-called
interest rate corridor which was introduced in October to defend
the currency and curtail inflation.  Turkey’s inflation at 11.1 percent is at the highest level
in 3 1/2 years and Governor Erdem Basci has forecast a fall to
6.5 percent by the end of this year.  The  yield  on two-year debt fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 9.40 percent, paring the rise this month to
8 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
