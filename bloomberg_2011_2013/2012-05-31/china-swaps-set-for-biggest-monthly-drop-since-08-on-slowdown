China ’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
are poised for their biggest monthly decline since 2008 on
concern that a deepening European crisis will weaken an
expansion in the world’s second-largest economy.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said growth faces increasing downward
pressure, the Hunan Daily reported yesterday, citing his speech
in the southern Chinese province on May 25. Policy easing,
including faster project approvals and central bank guidance for
borrowing, may amount to additional credit of as much as 600
billion yuan ($94 billion), Deutsche Bank AG wrote in note
yesterday.  “The yuan interest-rate swaps are lower on the back of the
heightened European crisis and also uncertainty over China’s
growth,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale
SA in  Hong Kong . “Overall  market sentiment  is very fragile and
it will need significant positive news to turn it around.”  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, slid 10 basis points to 2.465 percent
at 9:31 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate fell 79 basis points this month, the most
since November 2008.  Exports increased 4.9 percent in April from a year earlier,
the slowest pace in three months, while imports rose 0.3
percent, the customs bureau said on May 10. Industrial output
increased 9.3 percent, the smallest gain since May 2009, a
government report showed the following day. New-home prices in
the eastern city of Wenzhou fell 12 percent, while prices in
Beijing and Shanghai dropped 1 percent, according to official
figures.  PBOC Operations  The People’s Bank of China will sell 30 billion  yuan  of 91-
day repurchase agreements today, according to traders at primary
dealers required to bid at the auctions. The monetary authority
withdrew 78 billion yuan using open-market operations last week
and 64 billion yuan in the five days ended May 18, following
this month’s cut of lenders’ reserve requirements.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, decreased 24 basis points,
or 0.24 percentage point, to 2.10 percent in Shanghai, according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The rate slumped 167 basis points this month and touched
2 percent on May 24, the lowest level since April, 2011.  The yield on 3.51 percent government bonds due February
2022 declined four basis points today and 20 basis points this
month to 3.34 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
