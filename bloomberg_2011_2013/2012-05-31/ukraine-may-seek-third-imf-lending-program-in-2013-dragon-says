Ukraine will probably wait to start
talks with the  International Monetary Fund  on a new bailout loan
until next year, investment bank Dragon Capital said.  Ukraine needs to refinance foreign-currency debt
redemptions of about $7.7 billion, including $5.5 billion to the
Washington-based lender,  Olena Bilan , chief economist at Dragon
Capital in Kiev, said today in an e-mailed note.  “As the political landscape after October parliamentary
elections should be more conducive to meeting IMF demands, we
expect the authorities to negotiate a new lending program with
the fund in early 2013,” she said in the note.  The IMF approved a $15.6 billion loan to Ukraine in July
2010, the second in two years, after the country’s economy
plunged almost 15 percent in 2009. The loan, frozen last March
after the government failed to raise natural gas price for
households ahead of the general elections, ends this year.  Ukraine’s  gross domestic product  will probably grow 2.2
percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2013, compared with 5.2
percent in 2011, Bilan said. The current-account deficit may
narrow to 5.5 percent of GDP next year, compared with 6 percent
expected for 2012, according to the note.  “Despite a lower fiscal gap, rising foreign-currency debt
repayments will keep government funding needs high at an
estimated $12.4 billion, or 6.3 percent of GDP,” she wrote. The
government will probably cut the  budget deficit  to 2 percent of
GDP in 2013 from 3 percent this year, according to Bilan.  The hryvnia will remain stable near 8 per dollar for the
rest on 2012 and 2013 “in our base case scenario,” Bilan said.
Should there be an “adverse global demand shock,” the central
bank may allow the currency to weaken to as low as 10 per
dollar, she added.  -- Editors: Alan Crosby, Balazs Penz  To contact the reporter on this story:
