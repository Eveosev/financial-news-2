China  will be able to “cope” if
 Greece  leaves the euro region and no large-scale stimulus is
needed for the economy, a researcher for the nation’s top
economic planning body said.  “Assuming a Greek exit would lead to a financial and
economic crisis as damaging as the collapse of  Lehman Brothers ,
China would be able to cope,” the official Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday, citing Zhang Yansheng, secretary-general of
the Academic Committee of the National Development and Reform
Commission.  Europe is China’s biggest export market, making up about 18
percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according to Shenyin
& Wanguo Securities Co.  Zhang, who provides policy advice to the NDRC, said in an
interview with Xinhua that China’s huge domestic market and a
relatively closed financial system will shield its economy from
external shocks.  Chinese exporters relying on sales to  Europe  may suffer for
about five months if Greece exits the euro, similar to what
happened during the global financial crisis that started in
2008, he said. Zhang said there is a “very low” possibility
Greece will leave the single currency bloc.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
