Sterling Resources Plc (SLG)  of Canada said
its Romanian unit contracted Grup Servicii Petroliere SA to
start drilling two off-shore wells in the Black Sea.  Sterling’s Midia Resources SRL in a joint venture with
Petro Ventures Europe BV and Gas Plus International BV plan to
use GSP’s “Jupiter” jack-up rig to start drilling the two
back-to-back wells “in mid to late September,” the Calgary-
based company said in a statement today.  The three companies said last October they plan to invest
$500 million to $1 billion in Black Sea oil exploration in
Romania in the following period.  Following the discovery of gas by  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM)  and  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP)  in a well at about 35 kilometers (21.7 miles)
southeast of the Midia  Black-Sea  block, “three exciting
prospects have been identified and evaluated,” Sterling said.
“The Anca, Maria and Nadia prospects are believed to be in
similar formations to the Petrom well discovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
