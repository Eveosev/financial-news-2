Billionaire  Eike Batista , Brazil’s
richest man, hired Banco Bradesco BBI SA to sell a stake in his
AUX gold business after dropping for now plans for an initial
public offering, a person familiar with the matter said.  EBX Group Co., Batista’s Rio de Janeiro-based holding
company, decided a stake sale to investors would be more
profitable than an IPO because of market conditions, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private. An EBX official said the firm hired Bradesco for
“a potential financial transaction,” adding in a statement
that it wouldn’t rule out an IPO if market conditions allow.  “Sovereign wealth funds are interested in investing in
real assets” such us gold, Batista, whose investments range
from  iron ore  to coal, told reporters on Feb. 15. AUX paid
C$1.08 billion ($1.08 billion) last year to acquire Ventana Gold
Corp.  An official at Bradesco BBI, the investment-banking arm of
Osasco-based  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , declined to comment and asked
not to be identified in keeping with company policy.  Batista, 55, said last year he would list AUX in Bogota,
London and Sao Paulo as soon as this month. AUX is worth $5
billion, he said in October, and has 7.2 million ounces of  gold
reserves  after the acquisition of Vancouver-based Ventana in
March 2011. AUX’s La Bodega mine, located 400 kilometers (248
miles) northeast of Bogota, also has copper and silver deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
