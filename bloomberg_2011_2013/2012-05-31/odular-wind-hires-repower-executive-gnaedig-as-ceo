Modular Wind Energy Inc., a
California-based maker of wind-turbine blades, hired a Repower
Systems SE executive as its chief executive officer.  Gregor Gnaedig is taking control of Modular as it moves
from research and development into commercialization,  Huntington
Beach , California-based Modular Wind said today in a statement.
He was previously chief operating officer at the Hamburg-based
turbine maker owned by India’s  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)   Modular said its structural design lets it make blades that
are longer and lighter than conventional ones. Its first
commercial products are scheduled to be installed in the U.S.
and Europe this year.  Gnaedig is replacing Modular’s co-founder Myles Baker, who
is becoming chief technical officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
