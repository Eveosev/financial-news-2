A Moscow court ordered the detention
of two participants in a protest against President  Vladimir Putin  while investigators probe them on charges that carry a
maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Businessman Maxim Luzyanin and Andrei Barabanov, an
unemployed man, are suspected of taking part in mass
disturbances and using violence against police officers, the
Investigative Committee said in a  statement  on its website.
Moscow’s  Basmannyi  district court late yesterday ordered the two
men to be detained until July 6, a court spokeswoman Ekaterina
Korotova said by phone today.  An 18-year-old woman was placed under house arrest after a
May 29 court order for “violent activity” at the same rally.
Police detained hundreds of demonstrators after the May 6
violence, a day before Putin was inaugurated for his third term
in the Kremlin. Dozens of protesters and about 30 officers were
injured, according to estimates from both sides.  The Investigative Committee has opened several inquiries
into the May 6 events, including one related to “organizing and
participating in violent mass disturbances,” which carries a
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
