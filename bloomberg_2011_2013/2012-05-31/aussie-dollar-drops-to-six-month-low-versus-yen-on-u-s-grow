Australia ’s dollar fell to a six-
month low against the yen as investors sought safety amid
slowing U.S. economic growth.  New Zealand ’s dollar fell to the weakest in five months
against the Japanese currency before a report that may show the
nation’s terms of trade fell for a third quarter. The so-called
kiwi declined against the dollar as stocks and commodities fell.  The Aussie fell 0.7 percent to 76.23 at 5 p.m. in  New York 
yesterday. It rose 0.3 percent to 97.32 U.S. cents after earlier
reaching 96.74 U.S. cents, the weakest since Nov. 25. New
Zealand’s currency fell 0.9 percent against the yen to 59.03 and
gained 0.1 percent versus the dollar to 75.37 U.S. cents.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 1.9 percent annual
pace in the first quarter, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, signaling a stagnating recovery in the world’s largest
economy. The number of Americans applying for unemployment
insurance payments rose last week to a one-month high.  The MSCI World  Index (MXWO)  of stocks slumped 0.3 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials declined 1.2

quarter as the cost of imports outpace exports. The index

to the median estimate of a Bloomberg News survey. It declined
1.4 percent in the previous period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
