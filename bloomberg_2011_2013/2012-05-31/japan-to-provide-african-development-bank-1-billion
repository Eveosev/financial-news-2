Japan will provide $1 billion to the
 African Development Bank  over five years for it to lend to
businesses on the continent.  The loan is the second Japan is giving the bank under the
so-called Enhanced Private Sector Assistance accord, having
provided the same amount in 2005, the lender said in a statement
handed to reporters today in the northern Tanzanian city of
Arusha, where it is holding its annual meeting.  “In  Africa , we understand that private sector-led growth
has been progressing well in various sectors in addition to
mineral resources,” Akihiko Tanaka, president of the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency, said in the statement.  The bank’s private-sector lending operations have expanded
almost tenfold since the first loan was granted, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
