Ethiopia faces more hunger after late
rains caused crop damage in the south, the United Nations said.  The harvest is “below normal to near total failure,” the
UN’s World Food Programme and the Famine Early Warning System
Network said in a joint statement e-mailed today. About 3.2
million Ethiopians are in need of food assistance, the
government and donors said in January.  “In Ethiopia a deterioration of the food security
situation should be expected over the coming five months,”
Judith Schuler, a spokeswoman for the World Food Programme, said
by phone today. The number of people in need will be assessed in
June, she said  To contact the reporter on this story:  William Davison  in  Addis
