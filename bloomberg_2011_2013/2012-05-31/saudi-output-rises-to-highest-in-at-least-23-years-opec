Oil output by the  Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries  rose in May to the highest level
since 2008 as  Saudi Arabia  pumped crude at the fastest pace in
at least 23 years, a Bloomberg survey showed.  OPEC production gained 20,000 barrels to an average 31.595
million barrels a day in May from a revised 31.575 million in
April, according to the survey of  oil companies , producers and
analysts. Output increased to the highest level since October
2008. The April total was revised 170,000 barrels a day higher.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, bolstered output by
80,000 barrels to 9.9 million barrels a day this month, the
highest level since at least January 1989, based on monthly data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said on May 13 in
Adelaide,  Australia , that he wanted to see the Brent crude
contract drop to $100 a barrel. Brent oil for July settlement
decreased $1.60, or 1.6 percent, to $101.87 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest
close since Oct. 4.  “The Saudis are making it abundantly clear that they will
keep the market well supplied,” said  Michael Lynch , president
of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “They wanted to see prices fall, and that’s
finally taking place.”  Libyan Rebound  Libyan output  rose 50,000 barrels to 1.4 million this
month, the highest level since January 2011, the survey showed.
Production in the country tumbled to 45,000 barrels a day in
August from 1.585 million that January, the last month before an
uprising that overthrew the government of  Muammar Qaddafi 
disrupted output.  Nigerian production  climbed 40,000 barrels a day to 2.18
million this month, the third-biggest increase in OPEC, the
report showed.  Output in  Iran , the group’s second-biggest producer,
declined 50,000 barrels a day to 3.225 million, the lowest level
since June 1992.  Iraqi production  decreased 45,000 barrels to 2.94 million a
day this month. Output in April surged to the highest level
since October 2001. The country’s output had been depressed
since the U.S.-led invasion of the country in March 2003. Iraq
had the second-biggest production decline this month.  OPEC decided at a Dec. 14 meeting in Vienna to increase its
production ceiling to 30 million barrels a day, the first change
in three years. The new target is for all members, including
 Iraq , which had previously been exempt from monthly goals. OPEC
will review quotas at its next meeting, scheduled for June 14.  “The members obviously have no particular interest in the
group’s quotas,” Lynch said. “The meeting next month should be
very straightforward and uneventful.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
