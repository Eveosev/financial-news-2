Hog futures surged the most in 16
months on signs of increasing demand for U.S. pork. Cattle
prices also rose.  In the wholesale market, the price of  pork  headed for the
biggest monthly gain since July, while  loins  yesterday rose the
most in more than a week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. That rally indicates high meat sales for the Memorial Day
holiday weekend, which ended May 28, said Doug Houghton, an
analyst at Brock Associates.  “The loin-price increase would seem to indicate good
grilling demand,” Houghton said in a telephone interview from
 Milwaukee .  Hog futures for July settlement rose by the exchange limit
of 3 cents, or 3.4 percent, to settle at 91 cents a pound at 1
p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the highest for a most-
active contract since April 13. The gain was the largest since
Jan. 26, 2011.  This month, the commodity increased 5.9 percent, matching
the monthly gain in September. Today’s rally was the biggest
among the 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index.  Cattle futures for August delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
$1.189 a pound in Chicago. In May, the commodity climbed 4.2
percent, the most since January.  At midday, wholesale  beef  advanced 0.4 percent to $1.9777 a
pound, the highest since March 6, government data show. The
price has climbed 11 percent in the past 12 months.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement increased 0.5
percent to $1.568 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
