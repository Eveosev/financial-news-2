The head of  Greece ’s biggest industry
group said the country’s June 17 elections will determine
whether the country is ready and willing to make changes that
will ensure its place in  Europe  and the euro.  Political parties are to blame for the crisis that has led
to two international rescues, Dimitris Daskalopoulos, president
of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, said in a speech in
Athens today, according to an e-mailed transcript. They remain
unable to set out a realistic plan that will lead the country
out of the crisis, he said.  “In practice all of them are against the bailout, even the
parties that signed the two memoranda,” Daskalopoulos said.
“The entire political system today is promising to renegotiate
the terms of the aid extended to us by our partners. But they
aren’t presenting a complete and realistic plan to negotiate and
they are silent on the issue of structural changes.”  Daskalopoulos said the dilemma at the elections wasn’t
about choosing between the euro or the drachma, or of being in
Europe or outside it.  “The people and main political parties have answered these
questions already,” he said. “What’s left to be answered is if
Greek society truly wants to change and if there are political
and social actors able to realise this leap of change.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
