Middle-distillate supplies in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, dropped to the lowest level in five months, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles of gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene fell
for a second week, dropping 1.1 million barrels, or 11 percent,
to 8.73 million barrels in the seven days to May 30, the
ministry’s data showed. That was the lowest since Dec. 21.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, rose 1.46 million
barrels, or 7.7 percent, to 20.36 million barrels. That’s the
most since the week ended April 11.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were little changed at 8.75 million barrels from
8.74 million a week earlier, which was the lowest since
September, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
