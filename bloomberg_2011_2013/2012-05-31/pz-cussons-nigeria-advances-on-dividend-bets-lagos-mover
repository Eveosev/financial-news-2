PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (PZ) , a consumer
products manufacturer, climbed to the highest level in more than
six weeks as investors bet the company will declare a dividend
for the full year that ends today.  The stock rose 3.5 percent to 23.85 naira at the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest since April 16.  “Today is the last day of the company’s financial year, so
investors are taking position on the stock in anticipation of
dividend and bonus declaration,” Raheem Mohammed, chief
operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said by phone from
Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
