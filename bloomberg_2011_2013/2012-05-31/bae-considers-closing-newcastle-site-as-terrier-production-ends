BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense contractor, said it’s negotiating 620 jobcuts across the
U.K. as it prepares to close a site in northern  England  when
production of an armored vehicle runs out.  The Newcastle upon Tyne site, where the company makes
combat vehicles, armored engineering vehicles and personnel
carriers, is scheduled to close at the end of 2013. Some 330
jobs would go at the facility, with an additional 280 losses at
a munitions business, according to London-based BAE.  “The Newcastle proposal follows a business review which
concluded that there was no prospect of new U.K. armored vehicle
manufacturing work once production of the Terrier engineering
vehicle at the Tyneside factory ceases at the end of next
year,” BAE said in the release.  BAE has been reducing employment in the U.K. as governments
cut spending. The Newcastle site was a hub for tank production
for close to a century after Britain introduced the world’s
first tank at the Battle of the Somme during World War I. BAE
spokeswoman Kate Watcham commented by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
