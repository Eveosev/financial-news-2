Electricite de France SA ,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, plans to start work in 2013 at the
three wind projects awarded in a South African auction to boost
alternative energy sources.  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA, the company’s clean energy unit,
is also seeking to get loans for the wind farms next year with
commissioning due in 2014, the company said today in a
statement.  It was selected as the preferred bidder on the projects by
the South African government in a second bidding round for
renewable energy.  The nation approved 19 wind, solar and hydropower proposals
on May 21.  South Africa  is expanding capacity after state-run
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which produces most of its power from
coal, suffered shortages in 2008.  EDF Energies Nouvelles will build the 20.6-megawatt Chaba
farm, the 23.3-megawatt Waainek project and 59.8-megawatt
Grassridge facility in the Eastern Cape province. They will use
turbines made by Vestas Wind Systems A/S, according to the e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
