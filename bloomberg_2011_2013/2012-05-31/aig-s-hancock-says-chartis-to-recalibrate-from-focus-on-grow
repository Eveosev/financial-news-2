American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out insurer, is altering its strategy after focusing
too much on expansion, said Peter Hancock, chief executive
officer of Chartis, the company’s property-casualty unit.  “It’s a business that I’d say has been managed to growth
over the last 30 years,” Hancock said of Chartis today at a
conference sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York,
the city where AIG is based. “That’s given us an edge but I
think that at some point we oversaturated certain markets and so
my direction to the team is very much to recalibrate our
objectives from volume to value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
