Jamie Moyer was designated for
assignment by the  Colorado Rockies , possibly ending the record-
setting 49-year-old pitcher’s Major League Baseball career.  Moyer, who was invited to the Rockies’ spring training
after missing the 2011 season following elbow surgery, made the
starting rotation and went 2-5 with a 5.70 earned run average
before being designated yesterday, which gives Colorado 10 days
to trade or release him.  He said at a news conference that he didn’t know what the
future held for him.  “I’m going to go home tonight,” the left-handed Moyer
said. “That’s my future plan.”  Moyer, who turns 50 on Nov. 18, this season became the
oldest pitcher in major-league history to record a win. In his
last victory on May 16, a 6-1 win over the  Arizona  Diamondbacks,
he pitched 6 1/3 innings, allowing one earned run on six hits
while striking out five.  He lost his next two games, allowing a combined 13 earned
runs, and said it was his command of pitches more than velocity
that led to his exit. He also said he still believed he can
pitch effectively in the major leagues.  “If you talk to any pitcher, consistency is the most
important thing,” Moyer said. “I haven’t been that at this
point but I believe that I can find that.”  This was Moyer’s 25th season in the major leagues, having
played from 1996 to 2006 with the  Seattle Mariners . He was
traded to the  Philadelphia Phillies  in August 2006 and played
there until 2010 before injuring his elbow in July. He underwent
Tommy John surgery, a reconstructive elbow procedure named for
the former pitcher, and skipped the entire 2011 campaign.  Having also spent time with the  Chicago Cubs , Texas Rangers,
St. Louis Cardinals,  Baltimore Orioles  and  Boston Red Sox , Moyer
has a  269-209 record  and a 4.25 ERA over 4,074 innings pitched.
He made one All-Star Game appearance, in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
