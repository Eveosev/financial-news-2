(Corrects Partner performance in seventh paragraph.)  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  and  Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI) ,  Israel ’s two biggest banks, said first-quarter
profit fell more than 20 percent as they took more provisions
for bad debt amid slower economic growth in the country.  Bank Leumi’s profit declined 22 percent to 431 million
shekels ($111 million), while Hapoalim’s net income dropped 26
percent to 659 million shekels, the Tel Aviv-based lenders said
in regulatory filings today. Hapoalim’s profit beat two
analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg  of 604 million shekels
and 519 million shekels. Leumi’s net income met one estimate and
missed another,  the data  show.  Banks in Israel are taking precautions as economic growth
slows, the stock market drops and as some of the country’s
biggest borrowers seek debt forgiveness from bondholders.
Hapoalim said provisions soared to 303 million shekels in the
first quarter from 14 million shekels in the year-earlier
period. Leumi, which reported declines in profit in  all but one 
of the last six quarters, said provisions for bad debt reached
225 million shekels in the three-month period.  “I expect to see higher provisions in the coming months
due to the slowdown in the economy,” Adi Scop, a banking
analyst and the head of sales at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd., said by phone today.  Slower Growth  Economic growth in Israel will probably slow to 2.9 percent
this year from 4.8 percent in 2011, according to the average of
three economists compiled by Bloomberg in April.  Leumi’s  shares  rose 2 percent at 12:10 p.m. in Tel Aviv
today, trimming their drop this year to 9.3 percent. Hapoalim
gained 1.6 percent.  Leumi attributed the decline in profit to higher
provisions, lower income from commissions and a net provision of
59 million shekels linked to a drop in the share value of
 Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) , in which it holds a stake. Partner’s
 shares  fell 15 percent in the first quarter and are down 49
percent this year.  Net interest income at Leumi rose 0.6 percent to 1.82
billion shekels, while Hapoalim’s was little changed at 1.96
million shekels compared with 1.97 million shekels a year
earlier, the banks reported.  ‘Favorable Buffer’  The  Bank of Israel  in March set a minimum core capital
ratio of 9 percent for all banks in the country, to be
implemented by Jan. 1, 2015, and a minimum ratio of 10 percent
for the two largest banks, to be implemented by Jan. 1, 2017.
Leumi said its core capital ratio rose to 8.3 percent at the end
of March, from 8.1 percent in December, while Hapoalim’s climbed
to 8.2 percent from 7.9 percent over the same period.  The capital ratio at  First International Bank of Israel
Ltd. , the country’s fifth-largest bank by assets, rose to 8.8
percent, a “favorable buffer that is particularly important in
these times of economic uncertainty,” Chief Executive Officer
Smadar Barber-Tsadik said in a statement today. The bank posted
a 22 percent decline in first-quarter profit to 142 million
shekels.  First-quarter profit at  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the
country’s third-largest bank, fell 11 percent 247 million
shekels as net interest income declined 3.1 percent and
provisions rose 9.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
