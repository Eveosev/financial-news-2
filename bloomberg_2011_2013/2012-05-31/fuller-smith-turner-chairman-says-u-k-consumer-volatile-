Fuller Smith & Turner (FSTA)  chairman
 Michael Turner  says the U.K. consumer environment is getting
“more volatile by the day” and it is more unpredictable than
he has ever seen it.  “It is much more volatile than I have ever seen it,”
Turner said in a phone interview today. “It is getting more
volatile by the day. We’ve noticed it for nine months. It is
only the past year or so that the squeeze has actually been on.
I should think it is going to be jolly tough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
