Jamie Dimon ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s
chairman and chief executive officer, will testify next month at
a Senate committee hearing on his bank’s $2 billion trading loss
and will be asked to appear at a similar House hearing.  Dimon plans to appear June 13 before the Senate Banking
Committee, led by Senator  Tim Johnson , a South Dakota Democrat,
a committee spokesman said. He will also be asked to give
testimony on June 19 before the House Financial Services
Committee, a person familiar with the plans said.  “Jamie Dimon has accepted Chairman Johnson’s request to
testify before the Senate Banking Committee,” Sean Oblack, the
panel’s spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Dimon is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators to
explain the losses and the strategy behind them. In a May 10
conference call, Dimon called the  credit derivatives  trades
linked to the losses “flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.”  Johnson decided to push back the initial date for the
Senate hearing from June 7 to accommodate the schedules of both
parties, Oblack said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
