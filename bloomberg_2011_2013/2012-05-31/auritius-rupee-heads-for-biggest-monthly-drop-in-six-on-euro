Mauritius’s rupee weakened for a
fourth day against the dollar, extending its worst monthly
performance since November, as a slump in the euro threatens the
Indian Ocean island nation’s exports and tourism.  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 29.90 a dollar by
10:45 a.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, widening its monthly
decline to 2.9 percent. A close at this level will be the lowest
since Jan. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro fell to the lowest in almost two years against the
dollar yesterday as  Spain  struggled to rescued troubled banks,
adding to signs the region’s debt crisis is spreading.  Europe 
bought 61 percent of Mauritian manufactured goods in the three
months through March, Statistics Mauritius said on May 29.
Arrivals from Europe declined 3.3 percent in the four months to
April to 221,719, it said.  “The major threat for the country is the declining euro,
not the strong dollar,” Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at the
city-based Axys Capital Management Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “We have a major mismatch” with the euro as
the main foreign currency income and the dollar for imports,
Nuthay said.  Countries from  India  to  Brazil  are intervening on the
foreign exchange market to curb declines in their currencies and
rein in inflation. Mauritius’s inflation, at 3.8 percent, is at
its lowest since October 2010, according to Bank of Mauritius
data.  “Inflation is tamed,” Nuthay said. “It’s nothing to
worry about. Commodities prices are falling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
