Chinese stocks traded in  New York 
headed for their  biggest monthly loss  since September after the
slowest economic growth in two years eroded earnings for LDK
Solar Co. and  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)   Solar companies, which have reported losses for at least
three consecutive quarters, led declines on the  Bloomberg China-
US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S.
The gauge fell 0.7 percent to 90.28 in New York, extending its
slump last month to 13 percent, the most since September.
Dangdang sank 38 percent in May as its first-quarter loss and
sales outlook missed estimates.  Companies on the Bloomberg China-US measure that reported
first-quarter earnings this year  posted  an average 32 percent
drop in net income following a 48 percent gain in the first
three months of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While  China’s economy  is forecast to slow down for a sixth
quarter, the official Xinhua News Agency said in May 29 that the
government has no plans for new stimulus measures on the scale
unleashed during the global credit crisis of 2008.  “China’s slower growth has added concern to people who are
afraid of investing in Chinese stocks,” Harry Edelson, general
partner of Edelson Technology Partners in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New
Jersey , said by phone yesterday. “The dip in China’s growth
pace is affecting company earnings. The government needs to put
more money into the economy to help businesses.”  China ETF Gains  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.6 percent to $33.49,
trimming its decline last month to 12 percent. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of mainland stocks fell 0.5 percent yesterday to
2,372.23, ending the month down 1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index of U.S. shares retreated 0.2 percent to 1,310.33,
extending its loss for the month to 6.3 percent, the most since
September.  A government purchasing managers’ index for May due today
may decline to 52 from 53.3 a month earlier, according to the
median estimate of 27 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Fifty is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  LDK, the world’s second-largest maker of wafers, may report
this month a net loss of $104 million for the first quarter,
from a loss of $588.7 million in the previous three months, the
average  forecast  of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg shows.
The company, based in Xinyu of China’s Jiangxi province, started
to lose money  since  the second quarter of 2011.  LDK’s American depositary receipts slid 3.7 percent to
$1.81, deepening its monthly slump to 43 percent, the most among
the four solar companies in the Bloomberg gauge.  Suntech, Trina  Suntech Power Holdings Co., the biggest solar-panel maker,
said May 23 its first-quarter loss was 74 cents for each of its
ADR, which was worse than the 49-cent average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the fourth-largest maker,
reported on the same day a 42-cent loss for each ADR in the
three months this year, trailing forecasts of 27 cents.  Net loss of 29 cents per share at  Yingli Green Energy
Holding Co. (YGE) , the sixth-largest silicon-based solar module
producer, was worse than analysts’ average forecast of 22 cents.  Suntech, based in Wuxi of China’s eastern Jiangsu province,
dropped 5.7 percent yesterday to $1.65. Its ADRs lost 35 percent
in May, the worst performance in eight months. Yingli Green sank
4.8 percent yesterday and 29 percent last month to $2.61. Trina
rallied 4.4 percent yesterday to $6.15, cutting its decline in
May to 15 percent.  The People’s Bank of  China  has cut reserve-requirement
ratios for lenders three times since November and has kept
benchmark  interest rates  on hold since July after lifting them
to the highest level since 2008.  Slowdown  China’s economy will expand 7.9 percent this quarter,
according to a Bloomberg News survey May 14-15. That would be
the sixth quarterly deceleration after an 8.1 percent pace in
the first three months of this year.  Stock prices indicate there is a more significant slowdown
than many people were expecting, said Edmund Harriss, who
manages a $150 million China equity fund at Guinness Atkinson
Asset Management in  London  yesterday.  “The government policy has been very cautious,” Harriss
said. “I expect a steady stream of pro-growth policies from
China over the next few months rather than a big spending
package,” Harriss said, adding he expects an interest-rate cut
this year.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) , which operates casinos in
Macau, the only place in China where they are legal, fell 3.1
percent to a three-month low of $11.75 in New York. The ADRs,
which slumped 24 percent last month, traded 4.9 percent below
its Hong Kong stock yesterday, the steepest discount in two
weeks.  Dangdang Forecast  E-Commerce, China’s biggest online book retailer, climbed 1
percent to $4.98 yesterday, reducing its loss last month to 38
percent, its biggest monthly slump since June 2011.  Beijing-based Dangdang said May 17 sales for the second
quarter will be around 1.19 billion  yuan  ($188 million),
trailing the median forecast of 1.27 billion among eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Its earnings loss of 20 cents
for the first quarter compared with the median forecast of 22
cents in a Bloomberg survey.  The yuan declined 0.92 percent in May against the dollar to
close at 6.3690 per dollar yesterday, its biggest monthly loss
since a peg ended in July 2005, as Chinese exports slumped amid
a worsening debt crisis in  Europe . Overseas sales rose 4.9
percent in April from a year earlier, the smallest gain since
2009, according to official data on May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
