Brazil ’s April budget  surplus  before
interest payments fell from a year earlier, as the central
government saved less amid a faltering economic recovery.  Federal and local governments, including state companies,
had a  primary surplus  in April of 14.2 billion reais ($7
billion), down from 18.1 billion reais a year earlier, the
central bank said today in a report distributed in Brasilia.
Analysts expected a surplus of 16.3 billion reais, according to
the median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
April number was up from 10.4 billion in March.  President Dilma Rousseff’s government targets a primary
surplus of 139.8 billion reais this year, or 3.1 percent of
gross domestic product. The government has cut taxes and boosted
lending to the state development bank in an effort to spur an
economy that is recovering more slowly than expected from last
year’s third-quarter contraction, said central bank President
Alexandre Tombini.  Yesterday Brazil cut its benchmark  interest rate  to a
record low 8.5 percent and signaled it will lower borrowing
costs further as a fragile world economy contains inflation
risks. Analysts lowered for a third consecutive week their
growth forecast for this year and now expect the world’s biggest
emerging market after  China  to grow 2.99 percent, according to a
central bank survey published May 28.  The government faces pressure to accelerate spending on
public works projects, such as stadiums and airports, to help
prepare the country for the 2014 soccer  World Cup  and the 2016
 Olympic Games .  After interest payments, the budget had a deficit of 3
billion reais in March.  Net debt  fell to 35.7 percent of gross
domestic product from 36.6 percent in March, the central bank
said.  The yield on  interest rate  future contracts maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.88 percent at 10:59
a.m. local time. The real weakened 0.5 percent to 2.0258 per
 U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
