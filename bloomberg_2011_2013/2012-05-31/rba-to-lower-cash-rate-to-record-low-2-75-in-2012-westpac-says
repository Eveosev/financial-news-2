The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will
lower its overnight cash rate target to a record low this year
as Europe’s escalating debt crisis damages global growth,
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  chief economist  Bill Evans  predicted.  The RBA will reduce the benchmark by a quarter percentage
point at its June 5 meeting and follow that with cuts in July
and August and a final move in the fourth quarter to 2.75
percent, Evans said in a research report today. He previously
saw 3.25 percent as the low point in the easing cycle that
included quarter-point reductions in November and December and a
half-point reduction May 1.  “These two extra cuts are based on our assessment that the
global environment -- read  Europe  -- has deteriorated even
further,” Evans, who correctly picked the degree of easing in
the past eight months, wrote in the report. “In turn this
deterioration is expected to have a more severe impact on
confidence in Australia than had earlier been expected.”  Traders are pricing in more than 1 percentage point of
central bank easing by August, according to swaps data compiled
by Bloomberg. That would take the RBA’s key rate below the
record-low Australian benchmark borrowing cost of 2.89 percent
set in January 1960.  The RBA dropped the cash-rate target to 3 percent in April
2009, the lowest since it started setting the benchmark in 1990,
as policy makers around the world responded to the crisis
precipitated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
