The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
rebounded from its lowest in a week, climbing 0.5 percent to
33,142.61 by the close in Johannesburg. The measure has declined
3.7 percent this month, its biggest monthly drop since
September.  The following were among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up about 8 percent of the index, declined to a nine-month
low, dropping 1.2 percent to 257.80 rand. Copper futures fell to
a five-month low as signs of slowing in the U.S. economy added
to concerns that Europe’s debt crisis will damp raw-material
demand.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest resources
company, retreated 1 percent to 221.50 rand.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. (EPS)   slid to the lowest on
record, slumping 18 percent to 1.85 rand. The producer of the
metal in South Africa said it stopped funding for the
development of its Mareesburg open pit mine and Kennedy’s Vale
processing plant as prices fell and costs rose.  The Foschini Group Ltd. (TFG)  , a South African clothing
retailer, gained 1.1 percent to 119.02 rand, the biggest
increase in more than a week. The 12-month price estimate for
the stock was raised to 131.65 rand, from 123.78 rand, by
Macquarie Research equity analyst Stephen Carrott.  Grindrod Ltd. (GND)   fell 2 percent to 14.39 rand, a
fifth day of declines, its longest losing streak since December.
Tony Stewart resigned with immediate effect as an executive
director and chief executive of Grindrod’s trading unit.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR)  , Africa’s third-largest
producer of the metal, rose 5 percent to 84.51 rand, the highest
in almost two months, after agreeing to a new deal with Pan
African Resources Plc for the sale of its Evander mine.  SacOil Holding Ltd. (SCL)  , an African oil and natural-
gas explorer, declined to the lowest in almost seven months,
sliding 8.5 percent to 43 cents. The company reported a loss of
13.35 cents per share for the year through February, from a loss
of 6.62 cents a year earlier.  Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  , Africa’s biggest fixed-
line telephone operator, slumped to the lowest in more than
eight years, falling 4.9 percent to 22.91 rand. The company was
excluded from the MSCI South Africa Index at the close of trade
today, while  Assore Ltd. (ASR) , a mining holding company, and clothing
and furniture retailer  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC)  were included in the
stocks gauge.  Assore jumped 2.3 percent to 280 rand, while Mr Price
