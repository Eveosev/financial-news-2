Iran  canceled a $2 billion deal with
a Chinese contractor to construct a dam in the Persian Gulf
country and ceded the project to its Revolutionary Guard Corps,
 Mehr  reported, citing Energy Minister Majid Namjou.  Iran’s Central Bank and a governmental committee rejected
an offer from China’s  Sinohydro Group Ltd. (601669)  to build the
Bakhtiari dam in southwestern Iran, Namjou was cited as saying
by the state-run news agency. The project was handed to Khatam
al-Anbiya, the Guards’ engineering arm, it said.  The 315 meter high dam will have a reservoir capacity of
4.8 billion cubic meters of water, enough for a 1,500 megawatt
hydroelectric power station, Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
