Anze Kopitar slipped a shot past
sprawling goalie  Martin Brodeur  in overtime to give the  Los
Angeles Kings  a 2-1 victory against the  New Jersey Devils  in the
opening game of the Stanley Cup Final.  Kopitar took a pass from Justin Williams just inside the
Devils’ zone and skated in alone on Brodeur. He faked a shot to
get Brodeur to the ice, and then scored eight minutes, 13
seconds into the extra period.  “I wanted to make sure I went to the middle,” Kopitar
told reporters. “I don’t know if he heard me or not, but I
yelled for the puck and he chipped it. It was perfect, right on
my tape. It happened pretty quick and I was able to finish it
off.”  The Kings, who have won all nine of their road games in
this year’s playoffs, will have a chance to extend that National
Hockey League record in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series on
June 2 at the Prudential Center in  Newark , New Jersey.  Colin Fraser gave the Kings a 1-0 lead midway through the
first period. New Jersey’s Anton Volchenkov tied the game with
less than two minutes remaining in the second period.  “It was probably the worst game in the playoffs for us,”
Devils leading scorer  Ilya Kovalchuk  said. “Maybe we were a
little too nervous before the game started, but it’s all excuses.
We’ve got to make sure we know what we didn’t do right and be a
different team next game.”  Jonathan Quick made 16 saves for Los Angeles. Brodeur had
23 saves for the Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
