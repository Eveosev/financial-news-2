Lesotho’s Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili offered to resign yesterday after his party failed to
secure a majority in a parliamentary election.  King Letsi III declined to accept Mosisili’s resignation,
ordering him to remain in his position until a new prime
minister is sworn in, Monyane Moleleki, deputy leader of
Mosisili’s Democratic Congress, told reporters in Maseru, the
capital.  The DC, which won 48 of the 120 National Assembly seats in
the May 26 election, is in talks with opposition parties about
forming a ruling alliance, Moleleki said. Under the 1993
constitution, the king appoints the leader of the political
party that commands the majority of seats in the National
Assembly as prime minister.  Lesotho exports mohair, clothing and diamonds from  Gem
Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD) ’s Letseng mine and sells water to  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
