Standard Bank  Group Ltd. is not
planning an immediate buyback of shares, Erik Larsen, the bank’s
spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg
today.  Standard Bank directors “intend to repurchase shares
either by the company or one of its subsidiaries,” Chairman
Fred Phaswana said earlier today at the lender’s annual general
meeting. Shareholders voted to approve the bank’s share-
repurchase proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
