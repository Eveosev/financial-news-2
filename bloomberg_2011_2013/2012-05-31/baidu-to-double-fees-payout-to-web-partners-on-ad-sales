Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , the operator of China’s
biggest Internet search engine, expects the fees it shares with
website partners will double to 2 billion  yuan  ($314 million)
this year as Internet advertising sales jump.  Websites that were part of the “Baidu Union” network
received 1 billion yuan in 2011, Baidu said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The company is holding a four-day
conference for its partners that started yesterday.  The 600,000 external websites belonging to the “Baidu
Union” network help boost users and advertising sales for the
Beijing-based company, which overcame competition from  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  to dominate China’s search-engine market. Chief Executive
Officer Robin Li is also relying on outside software developers
to widen the range of services it offers.  “The revenue sharing figure is in line with my
expectation, and shows advertising sales growth is holding up
for Baidu,” said Dundas Deng, who rates Baidu buy at Guotai
Junan Securities in Shenzhen. He estimates Baidu’s online ad
sales will increase more than 60 percent this year.  Baidu fell 1 percent to $116.95 at 12:18 p.m. in  New York 
trading, and has gained 0.4 percent this year.  Baidu shares some of its online ad sales with “Baidu
Union” member websites that install the company’s search-engine
software, according to its website. The company also works with
some partners in its Internet  display advertising business , it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
