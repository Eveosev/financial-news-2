InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) , the
world’s largest provider of hotel rooms, said funds managed by
activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP own
4.27 percent of the company’s shares, according to a statement
today. The stock rose the most since Sept. 14.  Peltz, the billionaire Trian chief executive officer, is
the largest investor in food-chain  Wendy’s Co. (WEN)  and is known for
pushing companies to increase their share prices.  InterContinental is benefiting from rising demand in
 emerging markets  such as the greater China region, which
accounts for about 13 percent of group revenue. About 30 percent
of its global expansion pipeline over the next three to five
years is centered on the region.  Trian had about $3.4 billion in assets under management as
of Feb. 1, according to a March filing. The fund took a 7.3
percent stake in Ingersoll-Rand Plc earlier this month and met
with the industrial group’s management about ways to boost the
company’s underperforming stock, including restructuring
businesses.  InterContinental’s first-quarter pretax profit rose 13
percent to $106 million, the Denham, England-based company said
May 9. Revenue increased to $409 million from $396 million. A
bid by Marriott International Inc. for the group would be
compelling, research firm Numis Corporation Plc said May 29.  InterContinental Hotels  climbed as much as 5.6 percent in
London trading. The shares were up 5.5 percent at 1,517 pence as
of 8:19 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
