The Russia-led Eurasian Economic
Community anti-crisis fund will disburse the third portion of
its $3 billion bailout loan to  Belarus , Russian President
 Vladimir Putin  said after talks with  Alexander Lukashenko  at the
Belarus president’s residence near Minsk today.  Belarus received two tranches of the loan totaling $1.2
billion last year. The former Soviet republic pledged to raise
at least $7.5 billion from asset sales over three years as one
of the conditions for receiving the loan.  Putin didn’t specify the amount of money being disbursed,
although Interfax reported May 17 that Belarus expected $440
million, citing Belarus Finance Minister  Andrei Kharkovets .
Putin said that negotiations have started about the fourth
portion.  Russia and Belarus also reached an agreement to begin
financing the construction of a nuclear power plant in Belarus,
Putin said.  Russia will give Belarus $200 million for the first stage
of construction, Interfax reported, citing  Sergei Kiriyenko ,
chief executive officer of Rosatom Corp.  Russia and Belarus plan to oppose sanctions and
intervention in their internal affairs together, Putin and
Lukashenko said in a statement.  Putin and Lukashenko will oppose sanctions against the
United State of Russia and Belarus, an economic alliance between
the two states, as well as the United Economic Space, an
economic alliance between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
