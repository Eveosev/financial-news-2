Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX)  will extend its
slide if the gauge closes below its 200-day moving average,
pushing the benchmark measure as much as 17 percent below its
most recent high, according to  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE)   The DAX might slide another 5.4 percent, extending its  12
percent drop since March 16 , after breaking the support level.
That would lead the benchmark to fall toward its next support, a
 Fibonacci retracement level  of 5,942.85, said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, a senior equity analyst who helps manage about $107
billion at Danske Bank’s asset manager Danske Capital.  The DAX has stayed above its  200-day moving average  since
January. Even so, the 30-stock gauge has fallen from the middle
of March, moving in a “downward trend channel” as both peaks
and troughs trended lower, the analyst said.  “We’re at a key junction, where stocks will either break
out of the trend channel or go lower,” Skovgaard Andersen said.
“We’re buying as we’re still above the 50 percent Fibonacci
level and the 200-day moving average, but we have the exit
strategy ready in case these levels break to sell either the
stock or hedge the market risk,” he said.  German stocks have retreated as concern mounted that  Greece 
will elect a government that refuses to carry out austerity
measures, triggering the country’s withdrawal from the single
currency. The DAX plunged 1.8 percent to 6,280.8 yesterday, its
biggest decline in a week.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
