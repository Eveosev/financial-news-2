Atlas Iron Ltd. (AGO) , Australia’s fastest-
growing iron ore producer, is open to talks with  Fortescue (FMG) 
Metals Group Ltd. to build a railroad in the Pilbara region that
will allow exports to meet demand in Asia.  Atlas welcomes a third partner as long as Atlas has room to
haul its own iron ore, David Flanagan, executive chairman of the
Perth-based company, said today after a conference in Melbourne.
Fortescue, Australia’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, said May
3 it’s open to talks with the smaller rival to co-operate on the
development.  Iron ore producers including Fortescue and Atlas are
boosting output and expanding ports and railway networks to meet
growing demand in China, the biggest consumer of the steelmaking
raw material. Fortescue, doubling its main line to  Port Hedland 
as part of an $8.4 billion  expansion  to almost triple output,
may benefit from swapping rail and port capacity with Atlas,
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in an April 27 report.  Macquarie estimates the Atlas railway project may cost $1.5
billion. Atlas, which is seeking to boost annual shipments to 46
million metric tons by 2017 from 6 million tons, tied up with  QR
National Ltd. (QRN)  to study building the line to Port Hedland, the
gateway to Asia from the ore-rich region in northwestern
Australia.  Fortescue declined as much as 5.4 percent to A$4.57 and
traded at A$4.68 as of 12:58 p.m. in Sydney, while Atlas fell
0.5 percent to A$2.12. The benchmark index fell 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
