The euro fell against the yen to the
weakest level in more than 11 years as investors sought the
relative safety of the Japanese currency and pushed German bond
yields to record lows amid a deepening of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Dollar Index climbed to a 21-month high after Chinese
manufacturing grew less than forecast last month and before a
report that U.S. payrolls probably picked up from the weakest
pace in six months. The 17-nation currency slid to the lowest in
almost two years against the dollar after euro-area unemployment
surged to the highest on record.  “We’ve definitely seen an intensification of the euro-zone
crisis,” said  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at  Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  in London. “What you’ve seen is people
saying where were the true safe havens are, and coming to the
conclusion that ultimately there really were only two, Japan or
the U.S.” Derrick said they have $1.17 targeted against the
euro.  The euro tumbled 0.6 percent to 96.32 yen at 8:02 a.m.  New
York  time after reaching 96.17 yen, the weakest since Nov. 30,
2000. The shared currency fell 0.3 percent to $1.2323 after
depreciating to $1.2312, the least since July 1, 2010. The U.S.
currency was 0.2 percent lower at 78.19 yen.  Yields on German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year bonds dropped
to records today, as did those on 10-year Treasuries and British
gilts.  Germany Pushed  The 17-nation currency posted its ninth daily decline
against the yen, the longest losing streak since March 2000,
after a report showed unemployment in the euro area reached 11
percent in April and March, the highest since the data series
started in 1995.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  and ECB President  Mario Draghi  pushed Germany to give up its opposition to direct euro-
area aid for struggling banks.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, gained as much as 0.4 percent to 83.39, the
highest level since August 2010.  China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to
50.4, it’s the weakest reading since December, last month from
53.3 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics federation
said in a statement today in Beijing.  Dollar Advance  The dollar’s advance was limited before a report economists
said will show hiring in the U.S. picked up in May. Payrolls
climbed by 150,000 workers following a 115,000 April increase,
according to the median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate  held at a three-year low
of 8.1 percent, a separate survey showed.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for Group-of-10
nations, which measures how much reports are missing or beating
the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys, slid to minus 37
today, the least since September.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  may be poised for further gains after it
breached the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its
decline from a high of 88.708 on June 7, 2010, to a low of
72.696 on May 4, 2011, according to BNP Paribas SA. “The  U.S.
dollar  remains supreme,” the bank said in a report today.  The gauge surpassed the retracement level of 82.591 on May
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Decisive Action’  The U.S. currency has advanced 3.7 percent this year, the
best performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has
climbed 1.8 percent and the euro declined 2 percent.  The yen earlier fell after  Japan ’s Finance Minister  Jun
Azumi  pledged to take “decisive” action if excessive gains in
the currency persist.  Azumi’s comments fueled speculation officials are preparing
to intervene in  currency markets .  “We will continue to carefully monitor currency market
moves with more caution,” Azumi told reporters in  Tokyo  today.
“If these excessive moves continue, I think I must take
decisive action” on the yen, he said.  The last time Japan intervened in the currency market to
stem the yen’s appreciation was on Nov. 4. Japanese officials
sold at least 14.3 trillion yen last year to stem currency
strength that is forcing exporters to cut labor costs as they
lose customers to their overseas rivals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
