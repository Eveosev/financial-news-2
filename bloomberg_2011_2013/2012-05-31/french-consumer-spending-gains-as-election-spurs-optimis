French  consumer spending  climbed more
than economists forecast in April as the prospect of a change in
government improved household confidence in the euro area’s
second-largest economy.  Spending rose 0.6 percent from March, when it declined a
revised 2.6 percent, the national statistics office Insee in
Paris said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists forecast a
gain of 0.3 percent the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. In the year, spending advanced 0.4 percent.  Francois Hollande won presidential elections this month,
promising more  government spending  and a shift in the taxation
to the wealthiest households. Still, with unemployment climbing
and Hollande vowing to meet deficit reduction targets, domestic
demand may do little to boost economic growth, economists said.  “Consumers are being pressured by growing unemployment and
the tightening in public spending,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy,
chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in  London . “We expect a
weak second quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
