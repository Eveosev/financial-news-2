Gold futures fell in  New York ,
capping the longest monthly slump since 2000, as  Europe ’s
worsening debt crisis and signs of a U.S. economic slowdown
crimped demand for the precious metal.  Higher borrowing costs in  Spain  are putting pressure on
Mariano Rajoy’s five month-old government to join Greece,
Portugal and Ireland in seeking a rescue that would be the
European Union’s biggest. First-time claims for U.S. jobless
benefits rose by 10,000 to 383,000 last week, the Labor
Department reported today. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of
24 raw materials fell as much as 1.5 percent and was headed for
its biggest monthly drop since the recession in October 2008.  “Gold is behaving like a classic commodity and declining
along with the pack,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s like the dead man walking.”  Gold futures for August delivery retreated 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,564.20 an ounce at 2 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The precious metal retreated 6 percent this month, the biggest
drop this year as the dollar rallied 5.4 percent. Holdings in
the bullion-backed exchange-traded products are set for a  third 
monthly decline, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Investors don’t have the same strategic approach to gold
as before,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG, said in a report
today. “Much of the exposure to gold has been on an intra-day
bias of late. The market is too highly correlated with risk for
many participants’ liking.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$27.757 an ounce on the Comex, extending the month’s loss to 11
percent. The metal’s third monthly loss is the longest slump
since 2008.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery jumped 1.2 percent to $1,417.60 an ounce, helping
narrow the month’s loss to 9.8 percent. Palladium futures for
September delivery rose 1.2 percent to $613.90 an ounce. Still,
prices fell 10 percent in May, the biggest monthly drop since
September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
