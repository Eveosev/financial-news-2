Brazil ’s industrial output
unexpectedly contracted for a second straight month in April
even as the government steps up measures to boost economic
growth.  Output fell 0.2 percent in April after dropping 0.5 percent
in March, the national statistics agency said today in Rio de
Janeiro. Analysts expected output to remain unchanged from the
previous month, according to median forecast from 48 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Output declined 2.9 percent from a year
ago.  The central bank reduced yesterday the  benchmark interest
rate  to a record low 8.5 percent in an attempt to revive growth
that is recovering slower than the government initially
anticipated. Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said that the recent
weakening of the real, the worst performing major currency this
year, will help protect local manufacturers from foreign
competition.  The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.0092  U.S. dollar  at
9:08 a.m. local time and is down 7.1 percent since the start of
year.  Last week the government eased reserve requirements to free
as much as 18 billion reais for lenders to grant automobile
loans. Mantega also cut taxes to reduce car prices by as much as
10 percent and trimmed a levy on  consumer goods .  Analyst lowered for a third consecutive week their growth
forecast for this year and now expect the world’s biggest
emerging market after China to grow 2.99 percent, according to a
central bank survey published May 28.  Factory output in April fell in 13 of 27 sectors, led by a
3.7 percent drop in the  food industry . Production of capital
goods, a barometer of investment, rose 1.9 percent.  The yield on  interest rate  futures contracts maturing in
January 2013 declined 10 basis points, or 0.10 percent, to 7.87
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
