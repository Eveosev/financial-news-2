Crude-oil options volatility rose to
the highest level since January as underlying futures fell,
capping the biggest monthly loss since December 2008, on concern
that U.S. and European economic growth is slowing.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 31.94 percent at 3:15 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 29.98 percent yesterday.  “We’re at substantially lower prices here and breaking out
of the lower end of the range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “No one is
ready to be long oil. We’ve got the potential to get down to $80
now.”  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.29, or 1.5 percent, to
settle at $86.53 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement
since Oct. 20. Prices fell 17 percent this month and have lost
21 percent since their year-to-date high settlement of $109.77
on Feb. 24.  Futures slipped after U.S. jobless claims rose and the U.S.
grew more slowing in the first quarter than previously
estimated, raising concern fuel demand would decline.  Fitch
Ratings  downgraded eight Spanish regions’ credit, increasing
speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading.  Most-Active  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
