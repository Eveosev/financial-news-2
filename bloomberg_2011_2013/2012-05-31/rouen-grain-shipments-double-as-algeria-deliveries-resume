Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more than doubled
in the most recent week as wheat deliveries to  Algeria  resumed.  Total export cargoes jumped to 112,966 metric tons between
May 24 and May 30 from 50,172 a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. That included 105,866
tons of soft wheat, up from 41,350 tons the previous week.  Algeria was the biggest destination with 52,050 tons of
soft wheat, after taking no grain the previous week. Cuba was a
client for 24,955 tons of soft wheat, after none was shipped to
the island nation in the previous two weeks.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
