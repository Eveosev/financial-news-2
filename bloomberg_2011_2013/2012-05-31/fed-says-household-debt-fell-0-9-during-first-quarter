Household debt in the U.S. fell 0.9
percent during the first quarter as a decline in real-estate
borrowing outpaced an increase in  student loans , according to a
Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey.  Consumer indebtedness shrank by $100 billion from the end
of December to $11.44 trillion on March 31, according to a
quarterly report on household debt and credit released today by
the  district bank . Mortgages balances fell by $81 billion and
home-equity lines of credit declined $15 billion.  Student-loan borrowing, the biggest piece of consumer debt
aside from home loans, climbed 3.4 percent to $904 billion,
according to the New York Fed. Since household debt peaked in
the third quarter of 2008, student-loan indebtedness has
increased by $293 billion while other types of borrowing have
dropped a combined $1.53 trillion, the report said.  “Student loan debt continues to grow even as consumers
reduce mortgage debt and credit card balances,” Donghoon Lee,
senior economist at the  New York  Fed, said in a statement. “It
remains the only form of consumer debt to substantially increase
since the peak of household debt in late 2008.”  Credit-card balances were $679 billion, or 21.6 percent
lower than their peak of $866 billion in the fourth quarter of
2008, the New York Fed said. Auto loan originations rose 2.1
percent to $72 billion in the first quarter and are 43.6 percent
above the bottom reached in the first quarter of 2009, the
survey showed.  Delinquency rates continued to decline in the first
quarter, with 9.3 percent of outstanding borrowings “in some
stage of delinquency” compared with 9.8 percent at the end of
2011, according to the report. There were 371,000 new
bankruptcies during the first three months of the year, 14.3
percent less than the comparable period in 2011.  The New York Fed said the report is based on data compiled
by the bank’s Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative
random sample from Equifax Inc. credit-report data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
