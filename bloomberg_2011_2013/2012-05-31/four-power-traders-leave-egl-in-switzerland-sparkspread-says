EGL AG lost four European power
traders, SparkSpread said, without saying where it got the
information.  Alvaro Bermudez, Norbert Gisler, Irina Radzikhovskaya and
Jason Thorogood were all continental cross-border power traders
at the Swiss energy trading company, the news website said.  The traders transferred from Axpo AGâ€™s office in Baden
 Switzerland , SparkSpread said. Axpo concluded a merger with EGL
last September, the company said on its website.  Jolanda van de Graaf, a spokeswoman at Axpo, confirmed that
the traders had left the company when reached by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
