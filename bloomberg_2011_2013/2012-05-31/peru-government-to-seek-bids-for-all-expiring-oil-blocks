Peru  will seek bids on all oil and
natural-gas blocks whose contracts are scheduled to expire, a
government official said today.  State oil company  Petroleos del Peru SA  will take as much
as a 49 percent stake in 7 blocks currently operated by  Maple
Energy Plc (MPLE) ,  Interoil Exploration and Production ASA , China
National Petroleum Corp., and Pluspetrol SA, which may bid on
the areas when their contracts expire, said Aurelio Ochoa,
president of state oil contracting agency Perupetro.  “The company that offers the highest investment figure
will win the bidding as there will be no automatic contract
renewal,” Ochoa told reporters in  Lima . “We need to turn
around the decline in crude oil output.”  Crude oil production dropped 20 percent over the past
decade to 69,399 barrels per day through April as aging
oilfields deplete. Peru has lined up $16 billion in energy
investment over the next 10 years in a bid to double oil and gas
output, according to the Energy Ministry.  Philex Mining Corp. (PX) ’s Pitkin Petroleum Plc unit will be
permitted to continue oil exploration on Peru’s north coast even
after an investigation showed its 314,132-hectare (775,906-acre)
concession overlaps the $222 million Olmos irrigation project,
as the company is only exploring in 0.3 percent of its
concession area, Ochoa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
