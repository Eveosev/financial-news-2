Grace Financial Group LLC, a  Long
Island , New York-based broker-dealer serving  hedge funds  and
investment advisers, asked a judge to order a  Penson Worldwide
Inc. (PNSN)  unit to continue to service trades under an agreement
between the companies.  Grace Financial, based in Southampton, filed papers today
in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking an
injunction preventing Penson Financial Services Inc. from
terminating the agreement or changing any of the services it
provides, as it disclosed May 25 it would do, according to
Grace.  Penson Financial shouldn’t be allowed to stop settling and
clearing trades and acting as a custodian for securities traded
on local markets outside the U.S., Grace said. An interruption
of the service would result in customers who invest to leave for
other firms, it said.  “More than that, petitioner will be irreparably injured
due to an inability to attract new customers to this now
nonexistent business,” lawyers for Grace said in the court
papers. “The loss of an entire business line is not readily
compensable in money damages.”  Amanda McCutcheon, a spokeswoman for Penson Financial
Services, the unit of Dallas-based Penson Worldwide, didn’t
immediately respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking
comment on today’s filing.  The case is Grace Financial Group LLC v. Penson Financial
Services Inc., 651872/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
