Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s
second-biggest airline, has backed out of a deal to buy  Finnair (FIA1S) 
Oyj’s catering operations after it froze new investments as part
of a savings program.  The sale to Lufthansa’s catering unit LSG Sky Chefs, which
was announced in March and expected to be completed by the end
of June, wasn’t approved by the German carrier’s supervisory
board, Vantaa, Finland-based Finnair said in a statement.  “This is naturally a disappointment both to LSG Sky Chefs
and to us as we had worked hard to make the cooperation work for
the benefit of both parties,” Anssi Komulainen, Finnair’s head
of  customer service , said in the statement.  Lufthansa, which is targeting 1.5 billion euros ($1.86
billion) in cost savings through 2014, said yesterday it may cut
as many as 1,000 jobs at LSG Sky Chefs, the world’s biggest
inflight caterer. The unit has 29,000 employees and supplies 300
airlines globally.  Finnair’s catering business, which the company said in its
annual report was the most profitable aviation services unit,
had revenue of 80 million euros in 2011, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
