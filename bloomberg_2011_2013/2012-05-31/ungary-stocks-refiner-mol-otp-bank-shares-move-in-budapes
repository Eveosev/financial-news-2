The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index rose 0.8
percent to 16,099.82 by the end of trading in Budapest after
closing at the lowest level since October yesterday. That brings
the gauge’s monthly drop to 12 percent.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, rebounded
from the lowest close in more than seven months as a technical
indicator signaled the company’s slump was overdone. The stock
added 1.4 percent to 15,000 forint. Mol’s 3.9 percent plunge
yesterday pushed its 14-day relative strength index to 25, below
the 30 level that indicates to some analysts a stock is
oversold.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , fell to 3,338 forint from
yesterday’s close of 3,460 forint as the stock began trading
without the right to a dividend today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
