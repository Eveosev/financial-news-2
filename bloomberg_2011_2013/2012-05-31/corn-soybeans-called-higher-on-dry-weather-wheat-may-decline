What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT because of dry weather in the past weeks in parts of
the U.S. Midwest, including Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest
growers,  Dave Marshall , a farm-marketing adviser at Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open little changed to 1 cent a bushel
higher in Chicago on the lack of rain in the past week in the
U.S., Marshall said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
steady to 0.1 cent higher, and soybean-meal futures may open
little changed to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel lower on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as the harvest progresses in the U.S. Plains, boosting
supplies, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
