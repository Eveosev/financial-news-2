Debt from educational loans in the
U.S. rose 3.4 percent to $904 billion in the first quarter,
according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  Outstanding student debt increased from $874 billion three
months earlier, the New York Fed said today in a report. The
total includes loans that are backed by the U.S. government as
well as private borrowing by students and their parents.  Student-loan debt surpassed credit-card debt in the second
quarter of 2010. In the year ended March 31, outstanding student
debt rose by $64 billion from a year earlier, while all other
forms of  household debt  fell a combined $383 billion, according
to the report.  “Student loan debt continues to grow even as consumers
reduce mortgage debt and credit card balances,” Donghoon Lee,
senior economist at the New York Fed, said in a statement
accompanying the report. “It remains the only form of consumer
debt to substantially increase since the peak of household debt
in late 2008.”  Ninety-day delinquency rates for  student loans  increased to
8.69 percent from 6.13 percent in the first quarter of 2003,
higher than that of mortgages, auto loans and home equity lines
of credit, the New York Fed said.  The loan totals are based on figures from a nationally
representative random sample of people provided by the  Equifax
Inc. (EFX)  credit bureau.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in March
that the debt level reached the $1 trillion mark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
