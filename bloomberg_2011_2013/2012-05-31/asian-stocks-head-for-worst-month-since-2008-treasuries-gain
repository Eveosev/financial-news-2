Treasury note yields fell to record
lows, while U.S. stocks capped the worst monthly drop since
September, amid concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis and a slowdown
in American economic growth. Oil extended the biggest monthly
decline since 2008.  The  10-year note’s rate  decreased as much as nine basis
points to an all-time low of 1.53 percent and rates on five-year
and seven-year U.S. debt also dropped to records. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index closed down 0.2 percent, paring a plunge of as
much as 1.1 percent following a report that the International
Monetary Fund was discussing potential plans to help Spain. Oil
lost 1.5 percent to $86.53 a barrel and sank 17 percent this
month. The euro was little changed near a two-year low of less
than $1.24. German 30-year yields fell to a record 1.74 percent
and slid below Japanese rates for the first time.  Treasuries rallied this month while global stock markets
lost more than  $4 trillion  amid concern Greece will exit the
euro and  Spain ’s finances will deteriorate further, while U.S.
economic data trailed forecasts. First-time claims for U.S.
jobless benefits unexpectedly increased and a separate report
today showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate
in the first quarter, down from a 2.2 percent prior estimate.  “One of the questions that I’ve been getting is ’is this
all about Europe?’” Ira Jersey, director of U.S. rates strategy
at Credit Suisse Securities USA, told Bloomberg Television.
“It’s not now. It’s about global growth, including U.S. growth,
and that’s clearly one of the reasons you’re seeing the rally
today” in Treasuries, he said.  Rates Slide  Seven-year note  yields pared losses after sliding to a
record for a second day, trading down four basis points at 1.02
percent after dropping as low as 0.98 percent. The rate on 30-
year bonds fell as low as 2.58 percent, the lowest since
December 2008.  “If you look at the global marketplace, we are the
supermarket of safety,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-income
 money manager  who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money
Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts . “We’re talking about
an elevated level of fear. This is mainly driven by growing
uncertainty in Europe. People are saying ’I can buy the Treasury
and I know my money will be returned to me.’”  Losses in the  S&P 500  today were  led by  commodity and
technology companies. The same groups led the slump in May,
along with financial companies, with each group tumbling more
than 7.8 percent in the month. The S&P 500 lost 6.3 percent in
May, trimming its year-to-date gain to 4.2 percent.  Market Leaders  Caterpillar Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Intel Corp . lost at
least 1 percent to lead the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  down
26.41 points to 12,393.45. The Dow fell 6.2 percent in the month
and is up 1.4 percent in 2012.  Joy Global Inc. sank 5.4 percent as the mining equipment
company cut forecasts. Facebook Inc. rallied 5 percent, paring
its plunge since it went public on May 18 to 22 percent. Talbots
Inc. surged 89 percent as it agreed to be bought by Sycamore
Partners.  Stocks tumbled in morning trading after initial jobless
claims grew by 10,000 to 383,000 last week, topping the median
estimate of 370,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Companies added 133,000 workers in May, according to figures
from ADP Employer Services, trailing the median economist
forecast for a 150,000 advance, the same as estimated for
tomorrow’s monthly government jobs report.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer decreased to 52.7, the lowest since
September 2009, and below the median economist estimate of 56.8.  Losses Pared  U.S. equities  pared losses  in mid-day trading after the
slide briefly dragged the S&P 500 below 1,300, a technical level
watched by traders as a potential area of support.  The S&P 500 recovered further as the Wall Street Journal
reported that the  International Monetary Fund  is discussing
contingency plans to aid Spain in the event the country can’t
afford to bail out Bankia group. The IMF is not preparing
financial aid for Spain, nor has the country asked for a loan, a
spokesman for the fund said.  “There’s been no request for financial assistance from
Spain and the IMF is not making plans for financial assistance
to Spain,” Gerry Rice, the IMF’s director of external
relations, told reporters in  Washington  today.  Equities also pared losses as a Greek poll showed  New
Democracy , the largest pro-bailout party, taking a lead over
anti-bailout party Syriza.  Sell in May  This month’s slide in stocks echoed losses in the previous
two years when declines of as much as 19 percent began after
April peaks. For the third straight year, concern Europe’s debt
crisis will curb the global economic recovery is driving stocks
down, with investors speculating  Greece  may leave the euro and
Spanish banks will need a bailout.  The S&P 500 may rebound almost 3 percent in June based on
the average size of moves following past May declines of 4
percent or more, Bespoke Investment Group said.  The benchmark gauge has fallen 4 percent or more in May on
15 occasions since 1928, followed by an average June increase of
2.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bespoke. The index
rose in June 60 percent of the time following such moves, the
data show.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.4 percent today to
extend its  May drop  to 6.8 percent, the biggest monthly decline
since August. ABB Ltd. fell 2.9 percent after the head of the
company’s low-voltage subsidiary said demand from  China  and
 Italy  was lackluster. Holcim Ltd. tracked European construction
stocks lower on concern that  China’s economy  is slowing. Logica
Plc surged 69 percent after CGI Group Inc. agreed to buy the
computer-services provider for 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6
billion).  German Rates  The yield on the  German 10-year bund  decreased seven basis
points to a record 1.20 percent, with the two-year rate holding
near zero. Greece’s 10-year yield jumped 70 basis points to
30.83 percent, rising for the third straight day. Spain’s 10-
year yield decreased 10 basis points to 6.56 percent after
yesterday reaching a record high above benchmark German bunds.  Soybeans, coffee, wheat gasoline and oil led losses in 19
of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index, which sank 1.2
percent to the lowest level since October. The dollar
strengthened against 13 of 16 major peers, while the euro
retreated against eight and advanced against eight.  Asian Markets  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index slid 0.3 percent today and fell
10 percent in May, its biggest monthly loss since October 2008.
The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1.1 percent as  Japan ’s
factory output gained 0.2 percent in April from the previous
month, missing the median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg for a 0.5 percent increase.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index slipped 0.1 percent today
and slumped 12 percent this month, its worst May performance
since a 14 percent slide in May 1998.  The BSE India Sensitive Index declined 0.6 percent after
government data showed the economy grew 6.5 percent in the year
ended March 31, less than the 6.7 percent projection in a
Bloomberg survey. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent.
Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite index tumbled 2.2 percent, the
most among Asian benchmark indexes. The BUX Index surged 2.2
percent in Budapest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
