The Philippine peso had its biggest
monthly loss since September as  Europe ’s debt crisis dimmed the
allure of higher-yielding assets.  The currency fell for a second day even as government data
showed today the nation’s economy expanded 6.4 percent in the
three months through March, almost twice as much as it did in
the quarter earlier. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
lost 2.7 percent this month after inconclusive elections in
 Greece  prompted speculation the nation might exit the euro.  “When it comes to the foreign-exchange market, global risk
sentiment is the overriding determinant,” said  Vishnu Varathan ,
a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The
peso isn’t going to swim against the tide. To a large extent, an
improvement in first-quarter numbers was expected.”  The peso weakened 2.9 percent this month and was little
changed today at 43.495 per dollar in  Manila , according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, increased 325 basis
points this month and 15 basis points today to 7.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due
March 2032 increased 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point,
to 6.05 percent this month, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services. It was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
