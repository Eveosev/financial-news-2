Russian equities traded in New York
headed for their third straight monthly decline, the biggest
stretch of losses in three years, as a tumble in  Brent crude 
sent  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  and  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY)  lower.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most traded
Russian companies in New York sank 2.7 percent to 82.65
yesterday, extending its retreat for a third month, the longest
string of declines since February 2009. Lukoil,  Russia ’s largest
non-state oil producer, fell from a two-week high while Gazprom
Neft, the oil arm of Russia’s biggest company by value, slipped
the most in a week. Futures on the dollar-denominated  RTS index (RTSI$) 
gained 0.1 percent.  Brent crude, which underpins Russia’s Urals crude blend,
settled below $104 for the first time this year, and has
retreated 14 percent this month as concern about the  European
debt crisis  deepened. Russia, the world’s biggest energy
exporter, obtained almost 50 percent of budget revenue from oil
and gas sales last year. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said
yesterday that the government can increase taxes on its oil and
gas producers.  “The price of oil has gone straight down and there’s been
real disappointment in the government’s decisions,”  Bruce Bower , a partner at Moscow-based hedge fund Verno Capital, which
manages more than $200 million in Russia, said by phone
yesterday. “Russia continues to be seen by international
investors as an oil play.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, lost 3 percent to $24.15. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the index
futures, fell for the second time in three days, retreating 1.3
percent to 45.07 points.  Oil Sinks  Crude traded in New York tumbled to a seven-month low,
falling 3.2 percent to $87.82 a barrel, the lowest settlement
since Oct. 21. The decline followed speculation that U.S. crude
stockpiles had climbed to the highest level since 1990 while
economic confidence in the  euro area  dropped to its lowest since
2009, according to a European Commission report.  Brent oil for July settlement sank 3 percent to $103.47 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. In
earlier trading, the contract touched $102.85, the lowest level
since Dec. 19.  China ’s state-run Xinhua News Agency said the government
has no plans to introduce stimulus measures to support growth on
a scale similar to measures enacted during the global credit
crisis in 2008.  “With Spain and  Greece  in the crosshairs, oil lower, and
to a lesser extent China slowing, the conditions have not been
favorable for Russian stocks,” Nelson Saiers, who oversees $639
million at Alphabet Management LLC as chief investment officer
of the New York-based hedge fund, said in a telephone interview.  Lukoil, Gazprom Neft  Concerns over a deepening crisis in Europe dragged the MSCI
 Asia  Pacific Index down by 1.3 percent today as of 11:10 a.m.
Hong Kong time.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum
producer, dropped 1.5 percent to HK$4.59 in Hong Kong trading.  Lukoil dropped 2.3 percent to $52.25 after  shares  fell 1.4
percent on the Micex to 1,705.20 rubles, or $52.02. Gazprom Neft
slipped 2.3 percent to $20.11 while  shares  in Moscow dropped 1.1
percent to 131.20 rubles, or the equivalent of $3.99. One ADR
equals five ordinary shares.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest coal producer for steelmakers,
retreated 4.8 percent to $5.5 in New York. Europe and Asia
 accounted  for 34 percent of the Moscow-based mining company’s
2011 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mechel
 shares  in Moscow tumbled 4.7 percent to 182.40 rubles, or the
equivalent of $5.55.  The RTS Index in Moscow declined 2.4 percent, the most in a
week, to 1,275.16 while the 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index lost 1.4
percent to 1,308.30.  Best Performers  Yandex NV (YNDX) , the operator of Russia’s most popular Internet
search engine, declined 3 percent in New York to $20.42. Russian
lawmakers introduced a bill yesterday that would add television
and radio channels as well as websites to the list of the
country’s strategic state assets, according to a  statement  on
the parliament’s website.  The Netherlands-based Yandex has gained 3.7 percent in
2012, making it the second-best performer this year on the
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index after  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,
the country’s largest mobile-phone operator. MTS, as the company
is known, has advanced 15 percent in New York.  “Russia’s consumer-focused companies have done much better
this year than energy producers,” Bower added. “There’s been a
differentiation in the market whereby domestic names have
benefited from a relatively healthy economy.”  Verno Capital increased its stake this year in MTS and OAO
Magnit, Russia’s biggest food retailer, Bower said.  Russia’s gross domestic product expanded 3.7 percent in
April compared with a year earlier as the  trade surplus  widened
to $21.1 billion, the  Economy Ministry  said on May 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
