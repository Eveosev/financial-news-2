Yuan  deposits in Hong Kong dropped
for a fifth straight month to the lowest level since May as
expectations of currency appreciation receded.  Savings denominated in the Chinese currency fell 1.95
billion yuan ($306 million) in April to 552.4 billion yuan,
according to a Hong Kong Monetary Authority  statement  posted on
its website today. The holdings stood at a record 627.3 billion
yuan at the end of November.  The yuan weakened 0.92 percent this month versus the dollar,
its biggest decline since a dollar peg ended in July 2005, as
Chinese exports slumped amid a worsening debt crisis in  Europe .
Analysts forecast a 2012 gain of 1.8 percent now, a percentage
point less than at the start of the year, based on the median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys.  “Expectations for yuan appreciation have declined,” said
Nathan Chow, a Hong Kong-based economist at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong )
Ltd. “With yuan trade settlement being more like a two-way
street now, there’s less yuan staying behind in Hong Kong
through this channel.”  Hong Kong’s banks handled 177 billion yuan of trades
settled in the Chinese currency in April, a 36 percent decline
from 277.3 billion yuan in March, according to HKMA.  Conversion Quota  Residents in Hong Kong are subject to a daily conversion
quota of 20,000 yuan, which bankers are hoping the authority
will relax in order to boost the supply of the currency in the
city. David Wong, deputy chief executive officer of  Bank of
China  (Hong Kong) Holdings Ltd., said on May 18 that the quota
should be reviewed and the city should consider allowing non-
residents to open yuan accounts.  The currency declined 0.18 percent today to close at 6.3690
per dollar in  Shanghai , according to the  China  Foreign Exchange
Trade System. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, twelve-month non-
deliverable yuan forwards traded at 6.4305, a 1 percent discount
to the onshore  exchange rate , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  average yield  on Dim Sum bonds climbed 46 basis
points, or 0.46 percentage point, to 5.6 percent in May, Bank of
China data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
