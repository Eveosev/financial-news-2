News Corp. (NWSA)  confirmed it’s considering
transforming one of its cable channels into a national sports
network, challenging  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN.  The company’s Speed cable channel, which focuses on Nascar
auto racing, could become a more general-interest sports
network, Fox Networks Chief Operating Officer David Haslingden
said today at an investor conference in  New York . Speed is
available in more than 80 million homes in  North America ,
according to its website.  “There’s a lot of optionality with Speed, and it could be
turned into a broader sports network,” he said. “We haven’t
decided yet whether we’ll do that, but it’s a great option we
have.”  News Corp. was taking steps to start a national U.S. sports
network on cable TV, people with knowledge of the situation said
in March. Fox would be able to pair the channel with its 20
regional networks, which broadcast professional and collegiate
athletics to local U.S. markets.  Pay-TV companies such as Comcast Corp. and  DirecTV (DTV)  pay more
for sports networks than any other type of channel on basic
cable packages, according to research firm SNL Kagan. ESPN will
command $5.06 per subscriber per month this year, the most of
any cable channel, SNL Kagan estimates.  News Corp., based in New York, fell 1 percent to $19.20 in
New York at the close. The  shares  have gained 7.6 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
