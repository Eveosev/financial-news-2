Companies in the U.S. added fewer
workers than forecast in May, a reminder the job market will
take time to strengthen, a private report based on payrolls
showed.  The 133,000 increase in employment followed a revised
113,000 gain the prior month that was smaller than initially
estimated, Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services said
today. The median estimate of 39 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a May advance of 150,000.  Businesses may be wary of adding workers until they see
more evidence of a pickup in  consumer spending , while  Europe 
struggles with recession. A Labor Department report due tomorrow
may show that private payrolls rose by 160,000 in May, and
unemployment held at 8.1 percent, economists projected.  “Businesses are adding workers at a pace that is not very
impressive,” said  David Sloan , a senior economist at 4Cast Inc.
in New York, who projected a gain of 135,000 for the ADP report.
“The  unemployment rate  is not going to fall rapidly. The
numbers are consistent with an economy that is growing
modestly.”  The number of American applying for unemployment insurance
payment rose to a five-week high, a sign progress in reducing
joblessness may be stalling.  First-time claims  for jobless
benefits increased by 10,000 to 383,000 last week, Labor
Department figures showed today.  Stock Futures  Stock-index futures pared gains after the figures. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,309 at 8:50 a.m. in  New York 
after gaining as much as 0.6 percent. The yield on the benchmark
10-year note declined to 1.59 percent from 1.62 percent late
yesterday.  The economy expanded more slowly in the first quarter than
previously estimated, reflecting smaller gains in inventories
and bigger government cutbacks revised Commerce Department
figures showed today. Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.9
percent annual rate from January through March, down from a 2.2
percent prior estimate.  Economists’ ADP estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged
from 85,000 to 225,000 after a previously reported April gain of
119,000.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in April, when it understated the increase in jobs by
11,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overstated the employment gain by 113,000.  Manufacturing, Construction  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
builders, added 1,000 workers in May, today’s figures showed.
Employment in construction declined by 1,000, while factories
lost 2,000 jobs.  Service providers added 132,000 workers.  Companies employing more than 499 workers took on 9,000
workers. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees,
added 57,000 and small companies increased payrolls by 67,000,
ADP said.  The Labor Department’s report tomorrow may show overall
hiring, which includes government jobs, climbed 150,000 in May
after rising 115,000 in April, according to the Bloomberg survey
median.  The ADP report is based on data from businesses with more
than 21 million workers on payrolls. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC
in  St. Louis  produces the data with ADP.  United Technologies  Some companies are paring their workforce.  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit said on May 24 that it
is cutting 300 salaried jobs, including 200 in its home state of
 Connecticut .  The maker of engines for business and commercial airplanes
“continuously assesses staffing levels to ensure they are in
line with current business and economic conditions,” Bryan
Kidder, a Pratt & Whitney spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. “These decisions are necessary to carefully manage
our cost structure while continuing to invest in our future.”  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C.
Dudley said he would favor additional easing if the labor market
falters or risks to growth were to rise substantially.  “If the economy were to slow so that we were no longer
making material progress toward full employment, the downside
risks to growth were to increase sharply, or if deflation risks
were to climb materially, then the benefits of further
accommodation would increase in my estimation and this could
tilt the balance toward additional easing,” Dudley said in a
May 24 speech in New York.  His comments reinforced the view expressed at the April
meeting of the central bank, when several policy makers said a
loss of growth momentum or increased risks to their outlook
could warrant additional action, according to minutes of the
gathering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
