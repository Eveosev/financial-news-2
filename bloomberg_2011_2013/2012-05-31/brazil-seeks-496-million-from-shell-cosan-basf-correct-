(Corrects headline to say Brazil seeks $496 million from
Shell, Cosan, BASF.)  Brazilian prosecutors asked a court
to order  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Cosan SA Industria &
Comercio’s joint venture Raizen and  BASF SE (BAS)  to pay 1 billion
reais ($496 million) in compensation for workers who were
allegedly sickened from work at a pesticide plant, according to
a statement from the Labor Prosecutor’s office.  Prosecutors say the plant’s conditions caused severe health
problems to workers employed at the facility in Paulinia,
Brazil, from 1977 to 2002. The workers came into contact with
substances such as aldrin, endrin and dieldrin, which can cause
cancer and other diseases, according to the statement.  The prosecutors asked the court to order the companies to
pay for medical care for a larger number of workers and their
family members. Prosecutors seek to increase the number of
people receiving health benefits to 1,142 from 786.  Calls to Raizen and BASF’s press offices in Brazil seeking
comment after regular working hours weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
