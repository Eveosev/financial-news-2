The global incidence of cancer may
rise more than 75 percent by 2030, led by  developing countries ,
according to  research  published today in the Lancet journal.  The number of people with cancer in 2030 may rise to 22.2
million, or 0.3 percent of the global population, from 12.7
million in 2008, according to research led by Freddie Bray of
the  International Agency for Research on Cancer  in Lyon,  France .
The projection is based on the  United Nations ’s population
forecast, the IARC’s database tracking cancer incidence in 184
countries and expected increases in the rates of colorectal,
female breast, prostate and, in high-income countries,  lung
cancer  in women.  While improving  living standards  in lower-income countries
may lead to a decrease in infection-related cancers such as
cervical and stomach cancer, that may be offset by a surge in
the types of cancer associated with smoking, obesity and diet
which currently affect mainly richer countries. Poor countries,
as measured by the UN’s Human Development Index, may see a
doubling in the incidence of cancer to 490,000 in 2030 from
2008, according to the study.  “This study underscores the diversity of cancer as a
worldwide occurrence and the extent to which the disease
patterns differ from country to country,” the authors said in
the article. Targeted interventions are needed to “effectively
control the prevalence of lifestyle factors including tobacco
avoidance and cessation of smoking, a reduction in alcohol
consumption and obesity, and the promotion of increased levels
of physical activity.”  The richest countries currently bear much of the cancer
burden, with almost 40 percent of the global incidence occurring
in these countries, while having only 15 percent of the world’s
population. The most commonly diagnosed cancers in these areas
are colorectal, lung, female breast, prostate and stomach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
