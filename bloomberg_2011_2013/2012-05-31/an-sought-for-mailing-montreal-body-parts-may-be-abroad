The Canadian suspected of
dismembering a body and mailing a foot to Conservative Party
headquarters may have fled the country, local police said.  Canadian police sent out a nationwide warrant for Luka
Rocco Magnotta’s arrest yesterday and Interpol has since  listed 
him as a wanted person.  “We hope the photo that has been distributed will help
us” find the suspect, Ian Lafreniere, a Montreal  police 
department spokesman, said at a press conference broadcast on
 Quebec ’s RDI network.  Canadian police suspect the 29-year-old cut up a man and
mailed a foot to the Ottawa headquarters of the governing
Conservatives. They also found a hand at a postal depot in the
capital city.  Montreal police said yesterday that some body parts haven’t
been accounted for and the victim hadn’t been identified through
genetic testing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
