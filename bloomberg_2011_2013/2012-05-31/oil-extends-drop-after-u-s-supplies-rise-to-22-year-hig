Crude oil futures extended losses
after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles increased to a
22-year high.  Inventories of crude oil rose 2.21 million barrels to 384.7
million, a 10th consecutive weekly increase, the department
said. Supplies were forecast to grow 1 million barrels.  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.40, or 1.6 percent, to
$86.42 a barrel at 11:06 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil traded at $86.63 a barrel before release of the
inventory report at 11 a.m.  The Energy Department published the supply report a day
later than usual this week because of the Memorial Day holiday
on May 28.  Oil also fell on speculation that slowing U.S. economic
growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis will reduce fuel demand. More
Americans applied for  jobless  benefits last week, ADP said
companies added fewer positions than expected in May and the
economy expanded less than estimated.  The credit rating of eight Spanish regions was cut by  Fitch
Ratings , bolstering concern  Spain  may be the next victim of
Europe’s debt crisis.  “The unemployment number, the ADP report and the GDP data
all combine to create a negative picture for all the markets,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “Watching Europe go
off the rails again this month has been damaging to both
confidence and demand.”  U.S. Economy  First-time claims for jobless benefits increased by 10,000
to 383,000 in the week ended May 26 from a revised 373,000 the
prior week, the  Labor Department  said today.  Figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer
Services showed payrolls increased by 133,000 this month
following a revised 113,000 gain in April. The median estimate
of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a May advance
of 150,000.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.9 percent annual rate
from January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, revised Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
