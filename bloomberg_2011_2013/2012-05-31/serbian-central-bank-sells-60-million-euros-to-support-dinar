Serbia ’s central bank sold euros
today to prop up the dinar as the currency extended declines to
a record low against the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 60 million
euros ($74.2 million) “to smooth the dinar’s intraday swings,”
the bank said on its website, without giving any further
details.  The dinar touched a record low of 117.7998 to the euro at
3:58 p.m. in Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The National Bank of Serbia has sold a total of 1.18
billion euros this year so far to support the dinar, which has
been under pressure from expansive fiscal policies and widening
budget and current account deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
