Asian currencies had the biggest
monthly loss since September as  China’s economy  slowed and a
banking crisis in  Spain  curbed appetite for emerging-market
assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index lost 2.7 percent
since April 30 as global funds pulled $7.8 billion from South
Korean, Taiwanese and Indonesian stocks, exchange data show.
India’s rupee led losses, reaching a record low today as the
government said the economy grew 5.3 percent last quarter, the
smallest gain in nine years. Indonesia’s rupiah fell to the
weakest level since November 2009 while  China ’s yuan and
Malaysia’s ringgit both touched their lowest levels this year.  “The Europe problem is not going away anytime soon given
the extent of demand for safe-haven assets,” said Roy Teo, a
currency strategist in  Singapore  at ABN Amro Private Bank.
“There’s added pressure for policy reaction given the market
capitulation.”  The rupee fell 6.3 percent this month to 56.29 per dollar
as of 2:18 p.m. in Mumbai and touched an all-time low of 56.3875
on May 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit
declined 4.6 percent to 3.1725 and the won fell 4.3 percent to
1,180.33. The rupiah fell 2.2 percent to 9,400 after reaching as
low as 9.643 today.  Global stocks slumped yesterday after Italy failed to meet
its maximum target at a debt sale, costs to protect Spanish
 government bonds  with default swaps climbed to an all-time high
and a Greek poll showed support for anti-austerity parties
before an election on June 17.  Credit Downgrades  Foreign funds pulled $4.9 billion from emerging stock
markets this month through May 23, according to EPFR Global.
South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares fell for a third month as
the euro sank to a two-year low.  “Won moves will follow the euro and stock-market declines
on Europe’s debt crisis,” said Cho Hyun Seok, a Seoul-based
currency trader at Standard Chartered Bank Korea. “We’re not
seeing much selling of dollars by South Korean exporters even
though it’s the end of the month.”  The Asia Dollar Index reached 113.78 today, the lowest
level since September 2010. Its 60-day volatility rose to 2.86
percent from a two-year low of 2.68 percent on May 7.  Fitch
Ratings  cut Greece’s creditworthiness earlier this month, while
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded 16 Spanish banks and 26
Italian lenders.  The  yuan  lost 0.9 percent in May to 6.3690 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System,
its worst month since a peg to the dollar was scrapped in July
2005. The central bank fixed the daily  reference rate  at 6.3355
today, or 0.9 percent lower than on April 30.  Asian Intervention  An official report tomorrow may show growth in Chinese
manufacturing slowed in May based on a survey of purchasing
managers, according to a Bloomberg News survey. A similar gauge
published by HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics on May 24
suggested it contracted for a seventh month.  Asian central banks are joining global emerging-market
counterparts in intervening in  currency markets  to curb losses
that threaten to stoke inflation.  Bank Indonesia  said on May 29
it will start offering dollar term deposits in two weeks to
stabilize the rupiah while the  Reserve Bank  of India has sold a
net $20.1 billion from its reserves in the seven months through
March to arrest the rupee’s slide.  ‘A Careful Balance’  Brazil auctioned currency swaps for four straight days last
week to support the real after it fell to a three-year low,
while  South Korea , India and Russia are also acting to curb
exchange-rate losses.  “Inflation is still an issue for a number of emerging-
market countries,” said Callum Henderson, global head of
currency research at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “At
the same time, growth is an increasing concern for those
countries vulnerable to the European debt crisis. Policy makers
have to try and strike a very careful balance.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht fell 3.5 percent this month to
31.86 per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar weakened 2.1 percent to
NT$29.86, the Philippine peso dropped 2.9 percent to 43.495 and
Vietnam’s dong was stable at 20,868 from a month ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
