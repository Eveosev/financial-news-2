U.S.  imports  of Nigerian crude
slumped to the lowest level in more than 15 years in March,
according to Energy Department data.  Africa’s largest oil producer shipped 337,000 barrels a day
of crude to the U.S., the least since December 1996, according
to the data released yesterday. That compares with an average of
768,000 barrels a day for 2011.  Imports of Nigerian crude to the East Coast, an area known
as PADD1, dropped to 1.745 million barrels, down 44 percent from
February, the data showed. Shipments to the Gulf Coast, known as
PADD3, rose 31 percent to 8.693 million barrels, the data show.
That’s 46 percent less than a year earlier.  Rising production from the Eagle Ford shale formation in
 Texas  may further damp demand for Nigeria’s crude, according to
Zug, Switzerland-based research group Petromatrix GmbH.  “Those volumes will become increasingly at risk in the
second half of the year as more Eagle Ford makes it way to the
U.S. Gulf,” Petromatrix Managing Director  Olivier Jakob  said in
an e-mailed report today.  Output from Eagle Ford will reach 500,000 barrels a day
this year and may rise to 1 million barrels in the next few
years,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse
said in an interview May 3. That compares with an average
production of 60,000 barrels a day in 2011, according to data
from the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the  energy
industry  in the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
