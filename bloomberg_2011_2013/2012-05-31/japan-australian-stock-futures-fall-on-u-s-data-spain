Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
fell after U.S. economic data missed estimates ahead of an
employment report today and as  Spain  denied it is in talks about
a bailout as its bond yields near a level that prompted rescues
in other nations.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets 38 percent of its
sales in the U.S. and Europe, fell 1.2 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest
construction machinery maker that depends on China for 14
percent of its revenue, slid 1.8 percent before the release of
China’s manufacturing data today. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
Australia’s biggest mining company and oil producer, lost 1.1
percent after metal and oil prices dropped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring this
month closed at 8,485 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,530 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,480 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
declined 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “The U.S. payroll report is going to be important
obviously on the day, but the big issue is how Europe is going
to play out,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “Spanish bond yields
are about 6.5 percent and that tells you something that can’t be
ignored. While Spanish yields are that high, you have to have a
fairly cautious attitude toward adding risk to your portfolio
right now.”  U.S. Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent
today. The index fell 0.2 percent in New York yesterday, when
data showed the U.S. economy grew more slowly in the first
quarter than previously estimated and business activity expanded
in May at the slowest pace since September 2009. The number of
Americans applying for  unemployment benefits  rose. A Labor
Department report due today is projected to show nonfarm
payrolls gained by 150,000 workers in May while the unemployment
rate held at 8.1 percent.  The International Monetary Fund said it is not preparing
financial aid for Spain and the country denied it is in talks
about a bailout. The nation’s 10-year debt yields were 6.56
percent, near the 7 percent level that prompted bailouts in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 10 percent in May, the
biggest monthly loss since October 2009, while the S&P 500 fell
6.3 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 6.8 percent.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.5 times
estimated earnings on average through yesterday, compared with
12.5 times for the S&P 500 and 9.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. fell 0.7 percent to 90.28 in New
York yesterday.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 0.7
percent. Crude for July delivery declined $1.29 to $86.53 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
