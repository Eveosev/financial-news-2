Norwich City said Paul Lambert
offered to quit as manager but the English Premier League club
has not accepted his resignation.  Lambert may join  Aston Villa , who fired  Alex McLeish 
earlier this month, the Daily Telegraph reported today.  City said on its website that “discussions with another
club are taking place,” without identifying the team.  After joining Norwich in England’s third tier in 2009,
Lambert led the club to two straight promotions and a 12th-place
finish in the Premier League season that’s just ended.   “Whatever happens, we want to place on record our sincere
gratitude for everything Paul has done for the club over the
last three fantastic seasons,” Norwich said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
