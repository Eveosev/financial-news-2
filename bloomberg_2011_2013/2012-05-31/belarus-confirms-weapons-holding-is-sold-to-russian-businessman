Belarus confirmed that a Russian
businessman bought Beltech Holding, the company managing a group
of Belarusian arms producers and traders.  “It was the holding’s managing company that was sold,”
Roman Golovchenko, a first deputy chairman of the State Military
Industrial Committee, said today at a parliamentary hearing in
the capital, Minsk.  Beltechexport, the holding’s export unit, hasn’t been sold,
Golovchenko said. Vladimir Peftiev, head of the weapons
exporter, fully ceded his stake in the holding’s managing
company to Dmitry Gurinovich, Interfax reported yesterday. The
European Union last year froze the assets of Peftiev and three
companies controlled by him while also barring the businessman
from entering the 27-nation bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
