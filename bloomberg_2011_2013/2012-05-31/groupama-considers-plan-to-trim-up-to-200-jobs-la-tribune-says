Groupama SA is considering a plan to
eliminate 150 to 200 jobs through voluntary departures, La
Tribune reported, citing unidentified people at the company.  The cuts, which may start in July, would amount to as much
as 12 percent of the workforce of the Paris-based insurer, the
newspaper said. The terms and duration of the program have yet
to be decided and discussions with labor unions are expected to
begin next month, according to the newspaper.  A separate effort to reduce jobs through voluntary
departures at Gan Assurances, a unit of Groupama, is also
planned, La Tribune reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
