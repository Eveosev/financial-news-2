Greek caretaker Prime Minister
Panagiotis Pikrammenos called on the country’s private sector to
show confidence in the country in “this most difficult
situation.”  “As distinguished parameters of the country’s economic
life, act as a force of stability and responsibility,”
Pikrammenos said in a speech in  Athens  today at a meeting of the
Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, according to an e-mailed
transcript. “Keep your deposits and investments in the country;
show trust in the course of the Greek economy’s recovery. We
all, in the long term, will come out winners.”  Pikrammenos said  Greece  had taken steps towards economic
reform despite the difficult situation and that the debt crisis
was testing the very idea of a European Union.  “It is imperative that the euro area take brave steps
towards real economic union, pairing as a first step fiscal
stability with growth,” he said. “It is clear that within this
crisis Greece is turning a page in its history. How we will
respond to the crisis today, we Greeks and our European
partners, will affect future generations of Greeks and
Europeans.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
