Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  declined to
the lowest in more than eight years as investors sold shares
before the company’s exclusion from the MSCI South Africa Index
tomorrow.  Shares in Africa’s biggest fixed-line operator dropped as
much as 6.6 percent and closed 4.9 percent lower, the biggest
decline since Sept. 29, at 22.91 rand in Johannesburg, the
lowest since October 2003.  Telkom will be removed from the  South Africa index  at the
close of trading today,  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  said on May 15.  Assore Ltd. (ASR) , a
mining holding company, and  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC)  will be added to
the stocks gauge. Shares in Assore jumped 2.3 percent, taking
gains for the month to 5.7 percent. Mr Price added 3.2 percent
to the highest close in more than two weeks.  Telkom’s 21 percent slide this year meant the company’s
market value probably made it too small to be included in the
index, Rhynhardt Roodt, an analyst at Cape Town-based Investec
Asset Management, which manages more than $90 billion, said by
phone. Telkom is valued at 11.9 billion rand ($1.4 billion) and
has the smallest weight on the  MSCI South Africa (MXZA)  Index at 0.28
percent.  “Mainstream foreign investors do tend to focus on those
shares that are in the major indices,” Roodt said. “They
attract more investor interest, so more money flows that way and
it has a positive effect on the rating of the company.”  Stephen Gunnion in Johannesburg at +27-11-286-1936 or
