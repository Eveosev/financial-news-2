Finland’s financial regulator should
be allowed to limit mortgage lending and decide on additional
capital buffers for banks to prevent asset price bubbles,
according to a  report .  The Financial Supervisory Authority should be able to
enforce loan-to-value ratios, according to a report by a working
group set by the  Finance Ministry  on Jan. 20. The group is
scheduled to give a final assessment of the required regulatory
measures by the end of the year.  The Helsinki-based watchdog recommends banks lend at most
90 percent of the property’s value. The regulator lacks the
power to enforce the recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
