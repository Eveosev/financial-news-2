Grain plantings in Poland, the
European Union’s third-largest producer behind France and
 Germany , rose by 2.7 percent this year to about 7.6 million
hectares (18.8 million acres), the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  said today.  In its spring estimate of crop conditions, the office said
rapeseed plantings had decreased 26 percent from a year
earlier to about 600,000 hectares, according to a survey carried
out in the first 10 days of May. Sugar beet plantings were
unchanged from a year earlier at about 203,500 hectares.  The winter wheat crop was graded 3.2 on the office’s five-
point scale, in which 3 is an “adequate” rating and 4 is
“good.” That compares with a 3.5 grade last year. The
statistics office rated this year’s rapeseed crop at 3.1, up
from 2.9 a year ago.  Winter kill totaled 24.6 percent of all grain plantings,
32.4 percent of winter wheat and 32.2 percent of rapeseed, the
statistics office said. As a result, the sown area for winter
grain fell 21.2 percent, while spring grain plantings jumped
39.8 percent to more than 4 million hectares, the office
estimated.  Poland ’s grain crop may fall below 25 million metric tons
this year from 26.6 million tons in 2011 due to damage to the
winter wheat crop, the Warsaw-based Institute for Agricultural
Economics and Food Economy said in a report published on May 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
