Lawmakers in  Panama  approved the
government’s plan to create the country’s first sovereign wealth
fund with revenue from an expanded Panama Canal to help buffer
 Latin America ’s fastest-growing economy in a downturn.  Lawmakers voted 41-19 today to approve the creation of the
fund, which would take effect after the canal’s $5.25 billion
expansion is completed in 2014. With at least $300 million to
start, the government estimates savings will grow by about $1.5
billion per year from taxes on the canal, Finance Minister Frank De Lima told lawmakers before voting took place.  Panama joins countries including Chile and Trinidad &
Tobago in managing wealth funds from surplus revenue, usually
from commodity exports. Panama’s fund will allow it to improve
control of canal resources and cover future debts, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in an April  report .  The fund would only be tapped during a recession or
following natural disasters,  De Lima  said.  Panama’s fund was approved over objections from opposition
lawmakers, who warned that President Ricardo Martinelli will
increase spending because the  legislation  also raises the debt
ceiling in 2012 from 2.0 to 2.9 percent of gross domestic
product.  Panama’s $33 billion economy grew 10.6 percent last year,
the most in Latin America, and will reach 10 percent again this
year, De Lima said. Revenue from the 80 kilometer (50-mile)
waterway was $3 billion last year and that’s expected to double
by 2025, according to Panama’s canal authority.  The canal expansion, started in 2007, will accommodate
larger vessels carrying about 12,600 containers and may generate
cargo growth of about 5 percent a year when completed, the
authority said. Currently, ships loading fewer than 5,000 20-
foot boxes can use the waterway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
