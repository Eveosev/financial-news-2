Azerbaijan has held talks with
European banks including  BNP Paribas (BNP) ,  Societe Generale (GLE) ,
UniCredit and  Credit Agricole (ACA)  to obtain funding for a $17
billion refinery and petrochemicals complex, an official said.  The banks expressed interest in the project that will be
built near the capital city of Baku, Tofiq Qahramanov, vice
president of the State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, said
today by phone.  Of the total amount, 30 percent to 40 percent will be
provided by the state and the rest by foreign lenders, he said.  Construction of the oil and gas refineries will start in
the middle of 2013. It will process 10 billion cubic meters of
natural gas and 10 million metric tons of oil a year, Qahramanov
said. The refinery, which will be commissioned in 2017, may use
Russian and Kazakh oil as well as Azeri crude, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
