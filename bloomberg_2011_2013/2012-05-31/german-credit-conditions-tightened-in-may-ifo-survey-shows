German credit conditions tightened in
May after easing for four straight months, the Ifo research
institute said, citing a survey.  The share of companies that consider banksâ€™ credit policies
to be restrictive increased to 19.6 percent in May, a 0.1
percent rise from a month earlier, Munich-based Ifo said in a e-
mailed statement today.  Still, credit conditions remain very favorable and the
German economy continues to have access to cheap credit, Ifo
said.  The research institute surveyed about 4,000 companies for
its monthly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
