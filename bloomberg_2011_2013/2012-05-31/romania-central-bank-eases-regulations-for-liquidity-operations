Romania ’s  central bank  eased
regulations for the way it provides liquidity to commercial
banks, giving lenders a chance to tap more money in exchange for
state treasuries.  Policy makers raised the number of different state debt
issues a bank can use as collateral to get liquidity from the
central bank to five from three, including for weekly repurchase
operations, according to a document published on the regulator’s
website. The new rules came into force yesterday.  Some of the 41 banks operating on the Romanian market,
mostly owned by western European lenders, started relying more
on the funding provided by the central bank as a worsening of
the European sovereign-debt crisis trims funding from parents.  Banca Nationala a Romaniei lent the biggest amount of
short-term liquidity in more than two years on May 28. Eight
banks borrowed about 8 billion lei ($2.2 billion) at the weekly
repurchase operation, regularly used until May 21 by only four
banks, data published on Bloomberg show.  Austrian lenders control about 39 percent of the market,
followed by Greek banks with 15.5 percent and French lenders
with more than 10 percent, according to the central bank.  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s Banca Comerciala Romana SA is the country’s
largest lender by assets, followed by  BRD-Groupe Societe
Generale SA. (BRD)   -- With assistance from Irina Savu in Bucharest. Editor: James
