Canadian natural gas rose as
increased use of the fuel for power generation helped trim a
surplus in U.S. stockpiles.  July gas in  Alberta  climbed 2.5 percent after the U.S.
Energy Department said gas in storage rose 71 billion cubic feet
last week to 2.815 trillion. Inventories are 35 percent above
the five-year average, compared with 61 percent March 30,
department  data  showed today.  “Power generation spiked last week,” said Gordy Elliott,
a risk-management specialist with INTL FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis
Park , Minnesota. “It consumed a lot of natural gas that would
normally go to inventories.”  Alberta gas for July delivery gained 4.75 cents to C$1.98 a
gigajoule ($1.82 per million British thermal units) as of 3:15
p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system. NGX gas,
which rose 14 percent in May, has declined 31 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 0.4 cent to settle at $2.422 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
12.77 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.3432 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas declined 3.6 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.1618 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices slipped 2.63 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.2655.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 146 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.23 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.66 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 891 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.73 billion cubic feet today, or 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
