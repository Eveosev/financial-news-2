The 15-year prison sentence given to
an American who hijacked a jetliner to Cuba in 1968 was thrown
out on appeal.  Luis Armando Pena Soltren pleaded guilty in 2010 to his
part in the hijacking, which was organized by a group of Puerto
Rican nationalists. A federal appeals court in  New York  today
ruled that his sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in 2011, was illegal because it barred the
possibility of parole.  At the time of the hijacking, defendants convicted under
U.S. law were eligible to be released on parole before the
expiration of their sentences. Parole was eliminated in an
overhaul of federal sentencing rules that took effect in 1987.
The appeals court today threw out the sentence and sent the case
back to Hellerstein for resentencing.  Pena Soltren, then 25, was one of three men who forced the
pilots of Pan American Airways Flight 281, scheduled to fly from
New York to  Puerto Rico , to land in Havana, the court said. He
returned to the U.S. in 2009.  The case is U.S. v. Cruz, 11-256,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for
the Second Circuit ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
