Fernando Torres  scored his first
international goal for nearly a year as  Spain  continued
preparations to defend its European Championship soccer title by
beating South Korea 4-1.  In other tuneup games for Euro 2012 teams last night, the
Netherlands rebounded from a loss to Bulgaria with a 2-0 win
against Slovakia and Sweden defeated Iceland 3-2. The 16-nation
tournament in Poland and Ukraine starts June 8.  Torres gave Spain the lead in Bern, Switzerland, with his
first goal for the national team since scoring against the U.S.
on June 4. Kim Do-Heon made it 1-1 before  Xabi Alonso  put Spain
ahead with a 52nd-minute penalty kick. Goals by Santi Cazorla
and Alvaro Negredo completed the victory.  The result put Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas on the
winning team for a world record 95th time in an international
match, according to Infostrada Sports. Spain next hosts  China  in
Seville on June 3 before opening its championship defense
against Italy in Gdansk, Poland, a week later.  The Netherlands responded to a 2-1 home loss to Bulgaria on
May 26 by beating Slovakia in Rotterdam. Visiting defender
Kornel Salata scored an own goal in the eighth minute and Rafael Van der Vaart added the second with 15 minutes left.  The Dutch host Northern Ireland in two days before opening
their Euro 2012 campaign June 9 against Denmark in Kharkiv,
Ukraine.  Sweden, which opens against the co-host in Kiev on June 11,
went 2-0 up against Iceland in the first 15 minutes in
Gothenburg with goals by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ola Toivonen.  Kolbeinn Sigthorsson pulled one back for Iceland in the
first half before  Sweden ’s Christian Wilhelmsson extended the
home team’s lead to 3-1 and Hallgrimur Jonasson closed the
scoring. Sweden faces  Serbia  on June 5 in its final tuneup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
