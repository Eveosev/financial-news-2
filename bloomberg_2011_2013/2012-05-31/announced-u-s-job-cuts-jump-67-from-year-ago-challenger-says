Job cuts announced in the U.S. jumped
in May by the most in eight months, led by computer companies.  Planned firings  surged 67 percent from May 2011 to 61,887,
according to figures released today by Chicago-based Challenger,
Gray & Christmas Inc. It marked the fourth year-over-year
increase so far in 2012.  Employers have announced 245,540 reductions since Jan. 1,
20 percent more than a year earlier, the report said.  Hewlett-
Packard Co. (HPQ)  accounted for almost half the announcements this
month, making the computer industry the top job-cutter of the
year. Firings may also occur in the  food industry  as Hostess
Brands Inc. restructures following its filing for  bankruptcy
protection , the report said.  “While consumers and businesses are spending more on
technology, the spending appears to favor a handful of
companies,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of
Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “Those that
are struggling to keep up with the rapidly changing trends and
consumer tastes are shuffling workers to new projects or laying
them off, altogether.”  Compared with April, job-cut announcements were up 53
percent. Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal
effects, economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes
rather than monthly numbers.  The computer industry led firings with 27,754 planned cuts
in May, followed by 5,419 in transportation and 4,424 in
financial businesses.  States Losing Jobs  California led all states with 31,679 announced job cuts
last month, followed by  Georgia  with 2,807. Maryland had 2,685
reductions and  Texas  had 2,460 firings.  Employers announced plans to take on 7,722 workers in May,
fewer than the 11,794 the prior month and led by additions in
the automobile industry, the report said.  Job creation  in the world’s largest economy picked up last
month, the Labor Department may report tomorrow. Payrolls
climbed by about 150,000 workers after a 115,000 increase in
April, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate  probably held at a
three-year low of 8.1 percent.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose job are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
