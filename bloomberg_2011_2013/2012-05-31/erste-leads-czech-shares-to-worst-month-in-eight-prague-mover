Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of  Austria  led
Czech shares toward their biggest monthly drop since September
as rising borrowing costs in Italy and Spain fueled concern the
debt crisis in the euro region is not contained, hurting riskier
assets in emerging markets.  The stock dropped 1.3 percent to 365 koruna by 12:12 p.m.
in Prague, extending May losses to 15 percent. The  PX (PX)  index of
14 companies, where Erste has an 18 percent weighting, dropped
0.3 percent today and 6.8 percent since the end of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
