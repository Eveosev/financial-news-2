Two Americans traveling in the  Sinai
Peninsula  were kidnapped by Bedouins demanding the release of a
member of their tribe, an Interior Ministry official said.  The two were abducted today in the vicinity of Taba, a
resort town on the border with  Israel , the Interior Ministry
official said, declining to be identified by name because he
isn’t authorized to speak publicly. He said the Bedouins were
members of the Tarabeen tribe and were calling for the release
of a fellow tribesman who had been taken into custody by the
authorities.  The kidnapped Americans were tourists, state-run Nile News
reported.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was not
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
