The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 2.6 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
70 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 25 to 2.814 trillion
cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for July delivery fell 0.4 cent to $2.414 per
million British thermal units at 10:21 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
