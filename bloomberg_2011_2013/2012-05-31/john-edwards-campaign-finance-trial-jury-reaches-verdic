The jury in the federal campaign
finance trial of former U.S. presidential candidate  John Edwards 
reached a verdict on one of six counts after almost two weeks of
deliberations in Greensboro, North Carolina.  The U.S. judge ordered the panel to continue deliberations
on the remaining charges without disclosing its decision on the
one count. On that charge, the government alleged that in 2008
Edwards knowingly accepted more money from campaign donor Rachel “Bunny” Mellon than was allowed by law.  Edwards, a Democrat, was indicted in June following a two-
year investigation. He is charged with illegally using almost
$1 million in campaign contributions from Mellon and  Fred Baron ,
a now-deceased trial attorney, to conceal his extramarital
affair with Rielle Hunter. A former U.S. senator from  North
Carolina , vice presidential candidate in 2004 and presidential
contender in 2008, he faces as long as five years in prison if
convicted on any of the six counts.  “It’s not surprising that they are splitting on the
verdict, because the case is about splitting hairs on whether
the money was being used to fool a wife or to fool the election
committee,” said Roy Futterman, a jury consultant with DOAR
Litigation Consulting. “It’s hard to judge intent. Jurors may
decide either way depending on how they see Edwards as a man.”  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of North Carolina (Greensboro).  To contact the reporters on this story:
