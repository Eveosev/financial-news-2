OAO  Norilsk Nickel  rose to the
highest in more than a week after  Vladimir Potanin , a
shareholder in the miner, signaled the company may cancel some
of its undistributed stock held offshore by the end of this
year.  Norilsk, the world’s largest producer of nickel and
palladium, rose 1.2 percent to 4,924 rubles, the highest close
since May 22, paring its monthly loss to 5.3 percent.  Norilsk may hold an investor meeting to vote on canceling
as much as 10 percent of its treasury shares, Potanin, who holds
a 28 percent in the company, told reporters in Moscow today.  “This is a good sign that the shares are likely to be
canceled so they won’t be pressuring the market,” Valentina Bogomolova, an analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
