Kardan NV (KRNV)  gained the most in more
than a month after the investor in real estate and financial
services completed the sale of a stake in Russia’s Sovcombank
ICB JSC.  The Amsterdam-based company’s  stock  jumped 5.8 percent, the
most since April 22, to 2.484 shekels at the close in  Tel Aviv .
It surged as much as 8.7 percent earlier in the day.  The TBIF Financial Services BV banking and lending
subsidiary has sold 50 percent stake in the Russian bank for 122
million euros ($151 million), Kardan said yesterday after
markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
