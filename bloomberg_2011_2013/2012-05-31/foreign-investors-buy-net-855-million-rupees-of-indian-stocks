Overseas  investors  bought a net  855
million rupees  ($15.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
raising their investment in the equities this year to 424.9
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 22 billion rupees of shares and sold 21.1
billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India  said on
its  website  today. Foreign funds sold a net 2.08 billion rupees
of bonds, paring their inflow into debt this year to 191.8
billion rupees, the data  show .  They’ve sold a net 3.47 billion rupees of shares this month
and 11.1 billion rupees of shares last month after being net
buyers in each of the first three months of 2012. They put 421
billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.869 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.399 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  the
best performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-
ever outflow in 2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52
percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
