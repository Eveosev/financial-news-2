The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
with the Asia and Australia indexes set for their biggest
monthly gains since September, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index jumped 7 basis points to
205 basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is poised for its highest close
since Nov. 29 and a monthly increase of 50 basis points,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 8 basis points to 203 as of 8:46
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show. The index is
headed for its highest close since Jan. 16 and a gain of 38
basis points since April 30, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index added 4 basis points to 197
as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark reached 217.3 basis points on May 18, the highest
since Oct. 5, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
