Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second-largest
insurer, is seeing improving money inflows at its Axa Investment
Managers fund division, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Denis Duverne said.  “We should be positive in the first half,” Duverne said
today at a media seminar near Bordeaux, France of the unit’s
money flows.  AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) , another Axa fund-
management division, may not see positive net inflows until the
fourth quarter as it trims the portion of business linked to
equities, he said.  Axa Investment Managers, based in Paris, had 2.7 billion
euros ($3.5 billion) of net outflows in the first quarter, hurt
by a voluntary exit from unprofitable employee-shareholding
plans and continued outflows at its U.S.-based business Axa
Rosenberg, Axa said on May 11. AllianceBernstein, based in New
York, also had 2.7 billion euros of outflows in the first three
months of 2012, the insurer said May 11.  Separately, Axa plans to re-apply for a license to start
insurance operations in  Taiwan , Duverne said. Taiwan’s regulator
rejected Axa’s application this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
