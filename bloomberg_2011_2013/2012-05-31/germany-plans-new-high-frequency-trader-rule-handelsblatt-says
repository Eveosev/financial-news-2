Germany ’s government will propose
that all high-frequency traders, including those trading for
their own account, will be classified as financial services and
securities services firms and therefore must be registered with
Germany’s financial regulator Bafin, Handelsblatt reported.  High-frequency traders must also inform the regulator of
their algorithmic trades and strategies, the newspaper said
today, citing an almost completed draft bill from the finance
ministry. The new regulation is designed to strengthen market
stability by preventing stresses to the system from high order
intakes and market overreactions stemming from algorithmic
trading systems as well as prohibit malpractices, the German
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
