Vietnam ’s two-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield down by the most in more than two weeks, on
speculation slowing growth will prompt more interest-rate cuts.
The dong was steady.  Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on May 21 that
the economy is showing signs of a slowdown. The country reduced
borrowing costs for a third month in May. Gross domestic product
increased 4 percent in the first quarter, the least since 2009,
official data show.  “We expect another 200-300 basis points of rate cuts over
the next six to nine months as growth risks take precedence over
inflation concerns,”  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. wrote in a research note
yesterday.  The  yield  on the two-year bonds fell 21 basis points, or
0.21 percentage point, to 8.94 percent today, the most since May
15, according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the five-year notes dropped two basis
points to 9.61 percent. The yields on the two tenors decreased
1.81 percentage points and 1.04 percentage points this month.  The State Treasury sold 55 percent of the 2 trillion dong
($96 million) of two-year debt offered at an auction this week
but only 27 percent of the 3 trillion dong of five-year
securities, according to a statement on the stock exchange’s
website.  “Banks may be preferring  government bonds  with shorter
terms,” said Ha Thi Quynh Trang, a Hanoi-based fixed-income
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam. “The
economy may not be stable in the next few years.”  The dong was little changed today and this month at 20,868
per dollar as of 4:20 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
