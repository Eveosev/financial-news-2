Matt Kemp  is back on the disabled
list after playing two games for the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and
said he expects to be out for a month.  The All-Star outfielder re-aggravated his strained left
hamstring two days ago in his second game back from the injury.
Kemp, 27, said he felt a jab in his hamstring as he approached
third base while trying to score from first on a double by Andre Ethier in a 6-3 loss to the  Milwaukee Brewers .  “It’s hurting pretty good right now,” Kemp told reporters
after the game. “It feels worse than the first time.”  After coming off the field, Kemp grabbed a bat in the
Dodgers’ dugout, snapped it over his knee in frustration and
then threw down the pieces before heading to the clubhouse
accompanied by team trainers.  “This is the first time I’ve ever had a hamstring problem
and I know they’re tricky, they can come back,” Kemp said. “I
have to take it slow and let it heal. It felt good, it really
did. I thought I was 100 percent, but it’s still lingering.”  Kemp is hitting .355 with 12 home runs and 28 runs batted
in over 36 games for the Dodgers this season.  Kemp originally went on the DL with the injury on May 14,
ending his streak of 399 consecutive Major League Baseball games
played. He missed the minimum 15 days and returned to the
Dodgers’ lineup after a two-game rehabilitation stint in the
minors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
