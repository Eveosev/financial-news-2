Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said a projected increase in  U.S.
government debt  during the next decade would complicate policy
makers’ efforts to hold inflation within their 2 percent goal.  “Those projections are alarming, and if they come to pass,
they could pose significant challenges for monetary policy,”
Lacker said in an essay in the Richmond Fed’s 2011 annual report
posted online. “Our country could hit what economists call the
fiscal limit,” where the government could be forced to default
or encourage the central bank to allow an acceleration of
inflation.  “Even more disturbing, inflation still could break loose”
if the public expected that the Fed would allow prices to rise,
Lacker said. Currently, investors retain confidence in U.S.
Treasury debt, which is a “bright sign,” he said.  Worries about fiscal policy haven’t set back federal
borrowing. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.58 percent at 12:42 p.m.
in  New York  amid concern the  European debt crisis  is worsening.  To contact the reporters on this story:
