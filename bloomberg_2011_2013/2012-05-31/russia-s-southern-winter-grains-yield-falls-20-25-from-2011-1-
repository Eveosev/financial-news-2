Russia ’s southern winter grain yields
are expected to drop 20 to 25 percent from last year because of
dryness earlier in May, said Anna Strashnaya, head of the
agriculture forecasts department of Russia’s weather service.  Yields in some areas of the eastern part of the Russian
south may be 30 percent lower than last year, Strashnaya said by
phone in Moscow today.  Wheat dropped 1.1 percent to $6.4675 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade by 6:42 p.m. Moscow time.  Dry weather until May 25 weakened winter wheat and barley,
drying the top of grain ears in the eastern part of the Southern
and North-Caucasus federal districts, Strashnaya said. Heavy
rains last week only improved the crop condition in the western
part of the territories, she said.  The Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts accounted
for about 35 percent of Russia’s total grain crops after they
harvested about 32.6 million metric tons of cereals last year,
according to state statistics data.  The Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, known as
Ikar, expects the winter wheat yields to drop as low as 4.4 tons
a hectare (2.47 acres) in Krasnodar, 2.2 tons a hectare in
Rostov and 2.5 tons a hectare in Stavropol this year, Oleg
Sukhanov, head of market analysis for the group, said by phone
today.  That compares with last year’s average yields of 5.5 tons a
hectare in Krasnodar, 2.9 tons a hectare in Rostov and 3.9 tons
a hectare in Stavropol, he said. The three regions were Russia’s
top grain-growing areas by crop size last year, according to
state statistics.  June’s weather is expected to be normal for grains across
Russia, Strashnaya said. In the next 10 days, temperatures will
be “slightly above norm” in the south, helping reduce overly
wet field conditions in Krasnodar and Stavropol regions, where
showers exceeded the soil moisture norm last week, she said.
Rains across southern regions will continue through June 2 and
are expected to start weakening from June 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
