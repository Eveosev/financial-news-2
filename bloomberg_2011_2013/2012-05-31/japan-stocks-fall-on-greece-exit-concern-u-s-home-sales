Japan   stocks  fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping its biggest monthly drop in two years,
as concern mounted on Greece’s possible exit from the euro and
as the yen extended gains, dimming the outlook for exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
revenue in  Europe , fell 3.5 percent.  Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co. (6305)  dropped 2 percent on a report Japan’s industrial
output rose less than expected.  Kansai Electric  Power Co.,
Japan’s second-biggest electricity provider, gained 3.2 percent
on a report that government may approve the restart of two of
the company’s nuclear reactors next week.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.1 percent to 8,542.73 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in  Tokyo , capping a 10.3 percent decline this
month, the biggest monthly decline since May 2010. Trading
volume was 32 percent above the 30-day average. The broader
Topix index slid 0.6 percent to 719.49, sliding 0.4 percent on
the week for a nine-week loss, the longest such streak since
September 1975.  “We just don’t know what will happen with  Greece  as
different polls are coming out one after another, showing mixed
signals,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist at
Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees about $63.5
billion. “Overseas factors and the rising yen are causing a
sell-off.”  The Topix  has fallen  18 percent since this year’s high on
March 27 as voter opposition to austerity measures in Europe
raised concern the debt crisis is worsening and as growth in
China slowed. The gauge is nearing a 20 percent drop from this
year’s peak, which to investors signals the beginning of a  bear
market . The declines have cut the value of shares on the Topix
to 0.84 times book value, the lowest since March 2009.  U.S. Housing Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge lost 1.4 percent in New York yesterday after a
report showed the number of contracts to buy previously owned
U.S. homes fell in April by the most in a year.  Stocks also fell as an opinion poll showed most Greeks want
to negotiate the terms of a financial rescue, stoking fears the
nation may default and be forced to exit the euro. The nation is
scheduled to have another election on June 17 after an
inconclusive ballot this month. Separately, the  European Central
Bank  denied it has rejected a plan by the Spanish government to
recapitalize the struggling Bankia group.  “The market is genuinely worried about the potential
disorderly default and exit by Greece and what that means in
terms of contagion risks,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage
about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney.
“It will have to be a response by governments and the central
bank to stem the panic in the market.”  Yen Rises  Shares of major Japanese exporters also fell as the yen
reached a three-month high against the dollar and a four-month
high against the euro. A stronger Japanese currency cuts the
competitiveness of the exporters abroad.  Canon lost 3.5 percent to 3,150 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
Asia’s biggest carmaker by market value, fell 1.1 percent to
3,040 yen.  Short selling of Japanese stocks surged as investors hedged
against the financial fallout should Greece be forced out of the
euro. Short selling accounted for 32 percent of the total value
of shares traded yesterday in Japan, the most since June 3,
according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A short position is a bet
that an asset will fall.  Machinery makers declined after a government report today
showed Japan’s industrial production rose 0.2 percent in April,
missing a 0.5 percent increase forecast by economists.  Hitachi Construction fell 2 percent to 1,512 yen.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction machinery maker, dropped 2.6
percent to 1,878 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of
factory robots, declined 1.4 percent to 13,520 yen.  Nuclear Restart Weighed  Kansai Electric gained 3.2 percent to 1,134 yen after a
report that the government may next week approve restarting two
reactors at the utility’s Ohi nuclear plant, according to the
Nikkei newspaper, which didn’t cite a source for the information.
The nation’s nuclear power stations have all been shut following
the Fukushima disaster last year.  Chubu Electric Power Co. gained 6.4 percent to 1,198 yen,
while Shikoku Electric Power Co. added 5.8 percent to 1,840 yen.  Among other stocks that fell,  Pasona Group Inc. (2168) , a provider
of placement and staffing services, slumped 11 percent to 55,100
yen after reporting a preliminary loss of 50 million yen
($634,437) after writing down assets. It had earlier forecast
650 million yen in profit. The stock declined the most on the
1,674-member Topix.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 6.7 percent to 26.27,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.5 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
