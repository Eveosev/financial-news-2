OAO TMK (TMKS) ,  Russia ’s largest producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, expects sales to
exceed $7 billion in 2012 and may consider acquisitions.  TMK may look at buying small- and medium-sized assets,
deals which won’t increase its debt burden, the company’s press
office said, citing remarks made by Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Vladimir Shmatovich today on a conference call.  TMK’s 2011 sales rose 21 percent to $6.75 billion, it said
March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
