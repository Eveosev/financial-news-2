Egypt ’s ruling military council vowed
to continue its oversight of security in the country even after
the expiration of the state of emergency that has been in effect
for around three decades, the state-run Ahram Gate website
reported.  The pledge came as the state of emergency was set to expire
today, unless it is renewed. In its statement, the military
council said its vow comes “as a result of its national and
historic duty,” Ahram Gate reported.  Terminating the state of emergency would mark the practical
end of one of Mubarak’s most reviled legacies - the
implementation of a law that gave authorities sweeping powers to
limit freedom of expression and to detain individuals for months
without due process.  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi on Jan. 24 said the
state of emergency would be partially lifted the following day,
except for crimes of “thuggery.”  The legislation under which the measures were implemented
was reintroduced in 1981 after the assassination of President
 Anwar Sadat .  To contact the reporters on this story:
