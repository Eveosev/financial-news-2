Business activity in the U.S.
expanded in May at the slowest pace in more than two years as
orders and production cooled.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its  barometer  decreased to 52.7, the lowest since September
2009, from 56.2 in April. Readings greater than 50 signal
growth. Economists projected the purchasing managers’ gauge
would rise to 56.8, according to the  median  of 55 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  While demand for automobiles continues to fuel factory
output, the debt crisis in Europe and a slowdown in  China  may
cause some businesses to cut back on spending and hiring. Stocks
fell, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index toward its biggest
monthly decline since September.  “When you’re in a fragile economy and the world around you
is showing severe stress fractures, it’s going to impact us,”
said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist for  RBC Capital Markets 
in  New York , the top-ranked forecaster for the Chicago index.
“You’re seeing those headwinds flow fully through the  U.S.
economy .”  Projections in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 53.7 to
60.7.  Economists watch the Chicago index and regional
manufacturing reports for an early reading on the national
outlook. The group says its membership includes both
manufacturers and service providers with operations in the U.S.
and abroad, making the gauge a measure of total growth.  Growth Slows  Other reports today showed the economy grew more slowly in
the first quarter than previously estimated, more Americans than
projected filed claims for jobless benefits last week, consumer
sentiment climbed to a four-week high and companies added fewer
workers than forecast in May.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.9 percent annual rate
from January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, according to revised data Commerce Department. The
report also showed corporate profits rose at the slowest pace in
more than three years and smaller wage gains at the end of 2011.  First-time  applications  for unemployment insurance payments
increased by 10,000 to 383,000 in the week ended May 26 from a
revised 373,000 the prior week, the Labor Department reported.
They exceeded the median estimate of 370,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  Payroll Estimate  Figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer
Services showed payrolls increased by 133,000 this month
following a revised 113,000 gain in April. The median estimate
of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a May advance
of 150,000.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 39.3 in
the week ended May 27 from minus 42 in the prior period. The
reading was little changed from this year’s average of minus
38.9. All three of its components -- the economy, personal
finances and buying plans -- advanced.  The  S&P 500 Index  dropped 0.7 percent to 1,303.57 at 10:08
a.m. in New York.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s national factory
 index , which will be reported tomorrow, probably slid to 53.8 in
May from 54.8 the prior month, according to the median
projection in a Bloomberg survey. As in the Chicago survey, a
reading greater than 50 signals expansion.  Production Stagnates  The Chicago group’s  production gauge  fell to 50, signaling
neither growth nor expansion, from 57.1. The index of  new orders 
dropped to 52.9, also the lowest since September 2009, from
57.4. The employment measure fell to 57 from 58.7 the prior
month.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest maker of construction and
mining equipment, said this month that global machinery retail
sales rose 12 percent in the three months through April compared
with the same period a year earlier.  Gains around the world offset a 13 percent drop in machine
retail sales in Latin America, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a securities filing today. Machine sales
increased 32 percent in  North America , 5 percent in the Asia-
Pacific region and 14 percent in Europe,  Africa  and the  Middle
East .  To contact the reporter on this story: Lorraine Woellert in
