Spanish champions Real Madrid will
face  Italy â€™s A.C. Milan in an August exhibition match in Yankee
Stadium, a meeting of the two most successful soccer teams in
European Cup history.  The match, which is part of the  World Football Challenge ,
will take place Aug. 8, the Yankees said in a news release.  Real Madrid has won the European championship nine times,
most recently in 2002, while A.C. Milan has been champion on
seven occasions, its last title coming in 2007.  It will be the second soccer match at the New York baseball
stadium, which opened in 2009. Chelsea, which won the  Champions
League  this month, will play Paris Saint-Germain on July 22.  Both Real  Madrid  and A.C. Milan played in the old Yankee
Stadium, across the street from the current venue. Real Madrid
beat the New York Generals of the National Professional Soccer
League in 1968. A.C. Milan won two matches, against
Panathinaikos and  Inter Milan , in 1969.  The World Football Challenge is taking place throughout
North America from July 18 to Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
