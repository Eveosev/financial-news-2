Indiaâ€™s government reported its
 budget deficit  in the year to March 31 was 5.76 percent of gross
domestic product, smaller than its earlier projection of 5.9
percent.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee aims to cut the shortfall
to 5.1 percent in the current year by capping subsidies on
products such as fuels and fertilizers. Revenue deficit was also
lower at 4.34 percent of GDP, compared with an earlier estimate
of 4.4 percent.  Some spending plans for the current fiscal year have been
reduced by 10 percent as part of austerity measures, the
government said separately today. The budget gap reached 13.1
percent of the annual target in April, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
