Frank Zappa ’s family trust can’t use
a trademark named after the late American rock star to prevent a
German music festival from using the title “ Zappanale ,” the
country’s top civil court ruled.  The trademark “ZAPPA,” which the U.S. based Zappa Family
Trust filed in  Europe  and cited in the case, lost its protection
because it wasn’t used within five years after registration, the
court said in  statement  on its website today. The trust’s domain
“www.zappa.com” is merely a website about Frank Zappa, whose
best-known works include album “Apostrophe (’),” and single
“Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow,” and didn’t constitute use of the
trademark, the judges said.  The music festival has used the Zappanale title since
1990, according to the Karlsruhe-based court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
