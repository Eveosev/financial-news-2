Pakistan’s rupee fell to a record on
a Wall Street Journal report, rebutted by the central bank, that
the nation may seek loans from the  International Monetary Fund 
to pay debts.  The South Asian country’s trade deficit could make it
difficult to meet more than $4 billion in loans coming due in
the fiscal year starting July, the newspaper reported on May 29,
citing  State Bank  of Pakistan Governor Yaseen Anwar. The
currency dropped as much as 1.3 percent, the most since 2009,
before the central bank issued a rebuttal, saying there is “no
risk in being able to make next year’s IMF payments from our
adequate reserves.”  The rupee slid 0.9 percent to 93.8350 per dollar as of 2:21
p.m. in Karachi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has dropped 4.1 percent this year as Pakistan tries to
mend a fractious relationship with its main aid provider, the
U.S., which scaled back funds over differences on how to stop
militant groups from operating in the country’s tribal areas.  “People went into a little panic on political developments
such as Pakistan-U.S. relations and payment to IMF,” said Malik Bostan, the Karachi-based president of the Forex Dealers
Association. “Many people are converting rupee into other
currencies to prevent exchange losses.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
