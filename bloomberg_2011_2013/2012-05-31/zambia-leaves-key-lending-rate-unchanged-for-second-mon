Zambia’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a second consecutive
month, forecasting that inflation in  Africa ’s largest copper
producer will remain below its target.  The  policy rate  was left at 9 percent, the central bank
said in a statement released in Lusaka, the capital, today. The
bank introduced the rate in March to help anchor inflation
expectations in the economy.  Inflation accelerated to 6.6 percent in May from 6.5
percent in the previous month, lower than the central bank’s
year-end target of 7 percent.  “The improved supply of maize, fish and fresh vegetables
on account of seasonal factors and the expected reduction in
meat prices following the ban of maize and wheat bran exports
will have a dampening effect on food inflation,” Deputy
Governor Bwalya Ng’andu told reporters in Lusaka.  Lower food prices will probably mitigate the effects of a
depreciating kwacha, Ng’andu said. Zambia’s currency has dropped
3.6 percent against the dollar this year, trading as low as
5,374 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
