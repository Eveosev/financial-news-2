Economist  Dennis Gartman  said he
recommends buying wheat contracts in Kansas City and  Chicago ,
and selling corn.  Wheat may rise relative to corn because of possible damage
to wheat crops in Ukraine and  Russia , after a cold snap in the
past winter and recent dry weather, he wrote today in his daily
Gartman Letter. Wheat futures touched an eight-month high on the
Chicago Board of Trade on May 21 before retreating, leaving the
most-active contract little changed this month. Kansas City
Board of Trade wheat gained about 1.6 percent in May, while corn
tumbled 12 percent on the outlook for rising supplies.  “In the past when the Ukraine and/or Russia had problems
with their crops, we’ve seen wheat properly trading several
dollars premium to corn,” Gartman wrote. “It should again, and
so we’ll buy one unit of hard red winter wheat in  Kansas City 
and one unit of soft red winter wheat in Chicago and sell an
equal bushel sum of corn against it.”  Russia is expected to be the world’s fourth largest wheat
exporter in the 2012-13 season, behind the U.S., Australia and
Canada, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  The agency estimated Russia’s wheat  crop  to be 56 million
metric tons, down 0.4 percent from a year earlier on May 10. The
USDA pegged the U.S. corn harvest, the world’s biggest, at a
record 14.79 billion bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
