Splunk Inc. (SPLK) , a maker of software that
helps businesses analyze web data, said fiscal first-quarter
sales jumped 80 percent in its first earnings report since
selling shares to the public.  Revenue in the period ended April 30 rose to $37.2 million
from $20.6 million a year earlier, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement. Splunk’s net loss widened to
$20.5 million, or 71 cents a share, from a loss of $2.25
million, or 12 cents, as the company bolstered investment to
take advantage of surging demand.  Splunk became the first of the so-called big data companies
to go public when it debuted six weeks ago. The company is
winning business from customers including  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , Bank of
America Corp. and Autodesk Inc., which are looking for new ways
to monitor and analyze the vast amounts of data being created by
Web services and mobile devices. To fund expansion, Splunk
increased spending on sales and marketing by 89 percent in the
quarter to $24.2 million.  Splunk shares were little changed after the report. They
had fallen 5.1 percent to $32.56 at the close in  New York . The
stock more than  doubled  in its debut on April 19 and has since
dropped 8.2 percent, giving Splunk a market value of $3.08
billion.  Sales Forecasts  The company forecast second-quarter sales of $38 million to
$40 million, up from $26 million  a year earlier . For the year
ending Jan. 31, Splunk expects revenue to jump at least 44
percent, to $174 million to $177 million, from the year-earlier
$121 million.  Splunk added more than 350 customers in the period,
bringing the total number of companies using its software to
more than 4,000. Clients that either signed on or upgraded their
accounts in the period include Internet service provider
CenturyLink Inc., online-storage startup Evernote Corp. and
 Stanford University .  The company, founded in 2004, is led by Godfrey Sullivan,
who joined as chief executive officer in 2008, and who
previously led Hyperion Solutions Corp.’s $3.3 billion sale to
Oracle Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
