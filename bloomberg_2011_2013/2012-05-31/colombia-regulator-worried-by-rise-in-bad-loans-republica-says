Colombia â€™s chief financial regulator
Gerardo Hernandez said he is worried by the pace at which
delinquent loans are rising in the South American country,
according to an interview published in  La Republica  newspaper.  Colombia moved to slow the pace of consumer credit growth
earlier this month by increasing provision requirements for
lenders that have seen a rise in bad loans. Consumer loans grew
22 percent in March, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
