Zambia shouldn’t set a producer price
for corn because farmers are discouraged from growing other
crops like soy and peanuts, the  World Bank  said.  The policy has “limited private-sector investments in the
agricultural sector and constrained much desired growth and job
creation,” Kundhavi Kadiresan, the lender’s country director
for Zambia, said in an e-mailed statement today from the
capital, Lusaka.  Zambia’s Food Reserve Agency said yesterday that it would
pay 1.3 million kwacha ($243) a metric ton for corn, according
to the state-controlled  Times of Zambia  newspaper.  The government of Zambia, southern Africa’s biggest corn
producer after  South Africa  and Malawi, is the largest buyer of
grain in the country, with the nation’s Food Reserve Agency
purchasing 1.8 million metric tons of the 3 million tons
produced last year, according to the Zambia Agricultural
Commodities Exchange Ltd.  “It is our hope that government will reconsider its policy
of setting prices for corn to allow prices to be determined by
prevailing market conditions,” Kadiresan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
