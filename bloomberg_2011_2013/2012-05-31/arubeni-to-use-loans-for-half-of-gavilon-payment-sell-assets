Marubeni Corp. (8002) , set to buy Gavilon
Group LLC for $3.6 billion, will raise loans to fund half the
purchase and sell assets to reduce debt,  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said.  The Japanese trading house will borrow about 140 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) and use 150 billion yen of cash to buy the
shares of the in Omaha, Nebraska-based U.S. grain merchandiser,
Tokyo-based Barclays analysts Kazuhisa Mori and Shogo Umeda said
today in a report after a conference call with Marubeni
executives yesterday. A Marubeni spokeswoman couldn’t be
immediately reached for comment on the report.  Marubeni, whose businesses span Chilean copper mining, oil
and textiles, will become the largest grain trader in the U.S.
after  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  following the deal, according
to a  presentation  from the call posted on Marubeni’s website
today. Marubeni will take on $2 billion of debt as part of the
acquisition, its biggest.  Marubeni is reviewing the assets that could be sold to cut
debt after the Gavilon purchase, JPMorgan analyst Akira Kishimoto said today in a report based on the Marubeni
conference call, which was closed to the media.  Gavilon’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are expected to reach $600 million in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2014, Kishimoto said in the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
