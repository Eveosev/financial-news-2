CEZ AS (CEZ)  headed for its steepest three-
day gain in almost six months as the biggest Czech utility moved
closer to the sale of two power plants that would resolve a
coal-supply dispute and help finance atomic reactors.  The stock climbed as much as 2.3 percent and traded up 0.9
percent to 744.5 koruna by 3:32 p.m. in  Prague , the second-best
performance in the 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index today. A close at
that level would be CEZ’s highest since May 2 and mark the
steepest three-day jump since Dec. 2.  CEZ may sell the Pocerady and Chvaletice coal-fired plants
next year, the state-run company said today in a statement,
after a legal row with Czech Coal Group over the price of brown
coal supplied to the facilities. Prague-based CEZ aims to choose
a supplier of two new reactors at its Temelin power station in
2013, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Benes said on May 10.  “The sale would be a logical outcome of a year-long row
with the coal supplier,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni
Banka AS in Prague, wrote in e-mailed comments. “CEZ is trying
to reduce other investments as the planned Temelin expansion is
a really large project. The company also has a long-term goal of
reducing the share of coal plants in its generation portfolio.”  Czech Coal, which owns the Vrsany mine located 5 kilometers
(3 miles) from the Pocerady plant, and EP Holding have expressed
interest in buying the plants, CEZ said in the statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
