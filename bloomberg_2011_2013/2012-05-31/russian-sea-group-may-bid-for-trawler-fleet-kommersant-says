OAO  Russian Sea Group (RSEA) , partly
controlled by billionaire  Gennady Timchenko , may bid for the
state-owned Arkhangelsk trawler fleet,  Kommersant  reported
today, citing people it did’t identify .  Russia may sell the fleet as soon as in August and hired
OAO Gazprombank to help with the deal, the newspaper said.
Russian Sea’s competitors, which include all large fishing
companies, are not happy with the way Gazprombank has organized
the sale, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
