TNK-BP billionaire  Mikhail Fridman 
said he and his partners want to swap their stake in the Russian
oil venture for  BP Plc (BP/)  shares,  Kommersant  reported today.  AAR, which represents Fridman and fellow billionaire
investors, sought to swap the stake in TNK-BP for BP or OAO
Rosneft shares last year, Kommersant said, citing an interview
with Fridman. The talks led to nothing, but if a deal to swap
the stakes for BP’s shares was renewed, it would take from 5 to
7 years, he said.  AAR intends to remain in the oil business, Fridman said.  Still TNK-BP may have the third partner in the future, as
AAR “is open for the offers”, he told the newspaper.  Fridman resigned as TNK-BP’s chief executive officer this
week because he’s a an interested party in the shareholder
battle, Kommersant reported.  His resignation has nothing to do with former First Deputy
Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  becoming Rosneft CEO or any potential
merger of TNK-BP with a state company, Fridman said.  TNK-BP is not able to borrow as its board is not
functioning and AAR thinks the market situation doesn’t favor
the payment of large dividends, Fridman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
