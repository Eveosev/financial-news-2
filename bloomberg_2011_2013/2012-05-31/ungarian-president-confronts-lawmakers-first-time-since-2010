Hungarian President Janos Ader
returned an amendment of the country’s media law to parliament
citing a procedural error, the first objection to legislation by
a head of state since 2010.  The law may not be valid because Parliament made one error
that it must correct, Ader said in a letter to lawmakers
published by state-run news service MTI. Changes to the media
law were otherwise “impeccable” in their content and form,
according to the letter.  Ader assumed the largely ceremonial post this month after
 Pal Schmitt  resigned because Semmelweis University stripped him
of his doctorate for plagiarizing parts of his thesis.  Schmitt, who like Ader was an ally of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , signed every piece of legislation the government sent
him. European Union concerns over some of those laws, including
a judicial overhaul authored by Ader that the bloc says
infringes on courts’ independence, blocked  Hungary ’s talks on an
International Monetary Fund-led loan.  The media law, which created a regulator led by appointees
of Orban’s Fidesz party, failed to meet press-freedom
commitments even after changes demanded by the EU last year,
according to Vienna-based Organization for Security and
Cooperation in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
