Egypt  will offer 4 billion Egyptian
pounds ($662 million) of treasury bills today before the verdict
in the trial of former President  Hosni Mubarak . The dollar bonds
advanced.  The North African country will sell six- and 12-month notes
valued at 1.5 billion pounds and 2.5 billion pounds,
respectively, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
yield on the  six-month securities  climbed to 15.296 percent at
last week’s auction, the highest level since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in 2006.  A Cairo court is due to issue Mubarak’s verdict June 2 on
charges of complicity in the deaths of protesters during the
uprising that ended his three-decades of rule last year.  Pressure on funding at local banks has been driving
 government borrowing  costs higher in the absence of foreign
investors, who have shunned the debt because of unrest. Foreign
holdings of T-bills fell 97 percent since the start of last year
to $1.6 billion in February, according to central bank data.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
fell one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 6.80
percent at 12:22 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate has dropped 11 basis points this month. The
Egyptian pound was little-changed at 6.0443 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
