U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said  Russia ’s stance on  Syria  is “propping up” the
regime of President Bashar al-Assad and urged the government in
Moscow to help prevent the conflict turning into a civil war.  “The Russians keep telling us they want to do anything
they can to avoid a civil war,” Clinton said today in
Copenhagen. “They are vociferous in their claim that they are
providing a stabilizing influence. I reject that. I think they
are propping up the regime at a time when we should be working
on a political transition.”  The U.S. faces the dilemma of whether to act in Syria
without the  United Nations , Clinton said. Tensions are rising
within the UN Security Council after the weekend’s Houla
massacre, the worst atrocity in the 15-month uprising against
Assad. Russia has blocked attempts to impose more economic
pressure on the regime in Syria.  U.S. Ambassador to the UN  Susan Rice  told reporters
yesterday that if the council can’t agree on more measures,
Western nations and others supporting the Syrian opposition may
emphasize actions outside the council’s authority.  According to UN estimates, the killings in Houla region,
western Syria, left 108 people dead including 49 children. Most
of the victims died in their homes and entire families were
executed by gunmen at close range, the UN Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights said yesterday, citing witnesses
and survivors. The killings amounted to an “appalling
massacre,” the UN said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
