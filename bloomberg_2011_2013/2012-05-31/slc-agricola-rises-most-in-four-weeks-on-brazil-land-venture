SLC Agricola SA (SLCE3)  rose the most in four
weeks after it signed a contract with Valiance Asset Management
Ltd. to create a joint venture to invest in Brazilian
agricultural land.  The farm company gained 2.1 percent to 18.64 reais at 11:40
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , after earlier rising as much as 5.2 percent
in the steepest intraday advance since May 4. The benchmark
 Bovespa index  dropped 0.7 percent.  Valiance will invest $239 million in the venture by 2014
and will hold a 49.4 percent stake, while SLC will own the
remainder, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
