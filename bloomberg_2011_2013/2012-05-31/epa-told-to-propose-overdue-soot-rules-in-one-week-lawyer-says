(Corrects attribution in headline of story published May
31.)  A federal judge gave the
Environmental Protection Agency one week to propose rules on
soot pollution, regulations that are more than six months
overdue, a party to a lawsuit on the standards said.  U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins of the  District of
Columbia  court today also ordered an agency official to appear
before him on June 11 to spell out plans for issuing the final
rules, Janice Nolen, assistant vice president for national
policy at the American Lung Association, said in an interview.
The Lung Association had sued the EPA for inaction.  The agency said it sent proposed rules to the White House
for review yesterday, a process that typically takes 60 days.
The EPA is reviewing the judge’s order, Alisha Johnson, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. A copy of the judge’s order
wasn’t immediately available from the court.  The EPA issued its last standards on so-called particulate
matter in 2006, and by law must review those standards every
five years, Nolen said.  Rhode Island , Connecticut,  Delaware ,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico,  Oregon , Vermont and
Washington are also part of the lawsuit against the EPA.  The case is American Lung Association v. U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, 12-cv-00243, in the U.S.
District Court of the District of Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
