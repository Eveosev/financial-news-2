(Corrects Ebitda margin in sixth paragraph.)  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which
controls the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates in
the fiscal fourth quarter as rising fuel prices boost sales.  Net income of 149.6 million reais ($74.2 million) in the
quarter ended March 31 was higher than an expected profit of 133
million reais excluding some items, the average of four analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit fell 69 percent from
480.9 million reais a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Cosan said
in a regulatory filing today.  Sales climbed 26 percent to 5.79 billion reais in the
quarter from a year earlier after fuel prices increased 7
percent on average, Cosan said. Gasoline, ethanol and diesel
represent about two-thirds of Cosan’s revenue.  Cosan jumped 3.2 percent to 29.98 reais at 10:52 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo , heading to the biggest gain since Sept. 14.  Shell is considering making a $550 million payment for the
joint venture with Cosan due in April 2013 earlier, Cosan Chief
Financial Officer Marcelo Martins said on a conference call
today.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, declined to 6.3 percent of sales, from
22 percent a year earlier, after sugar prices fell. The average
price of sugar sold by Cosan in the quarter dropped 19 percent
from a year earlier.  Cosan said it expects to process between 52 million and 55
million metric tons of sugar-cane in the year that started April
1. The company will produce as much as 4.2 million tons of sugar
and 2.1 billion liters (554 million gallons) of ethanol. It
expects to report sales of as much as 29 billion reais this
fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
