Mediobanca SpA may seek to oust
Assicurazioni Generali SpA Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto because he has resisted the investment bank’s
efforts to exert control over the Italian insurer, the Financial
Times reported, citing two people familiar with the situation.  Mediobanca Chief Executive Officer  Alberto Nagel  will push
for Perissinotto’s removal at a board meeting that will be held
as soon as June 2, the newspaper said. Mediobanca owns 13.5
percent of Generali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
