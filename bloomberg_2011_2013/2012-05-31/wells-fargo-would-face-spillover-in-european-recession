Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, would suffer some fallout from a renewed European
recession even though it has very few holdings there, Chief
Executive Officer  John Stumpf  said.  Direct exposure to the continent is “almost nil,” Stumpf
said at a  New York  investor conference today. Still, “there
will be some spillover” if  Europe ’s turmoil leads to another
contraction in the region’s economy because it’s such an
important trading partner, he said. Stumpf said the distress 
may make it easier for the bank to find acquisitions.  “We are still kicking a lot of tires,” said Stumpf, whose
bank ranks fourth by assets in the U.S.  Stumpf, 58, helped lead the bank to profitability in 13
straight quarters. Wells Fargo won the biggest market share ever
recorded in home lending during this year’s first three months -
- 34 percent, according to trade journal Inside Mortgage Finance
-- as competitors including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  retreated from
costs associated with faulty underwriting and foreclosures.  Wells Fargo’s share of mortgage lending rose from 30
percent in the preceding three months, according to Inside
Mortgage Finance. It was more than triple the share of the
closest competitor,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , with 11 percent. U.S.
Bancorp moved into third place from fifth, with 5.2 percent,
ahead of Bank of America, with 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
