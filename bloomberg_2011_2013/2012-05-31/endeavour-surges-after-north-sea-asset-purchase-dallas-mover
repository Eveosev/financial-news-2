Endeavour International Corp. (END)  rose 70
percent, the most ever, after adding to its stake in the Alba
oil field in the  North Sea .  Endeavour  surged  to $9.99 at the close in New York. The
Houston-based oil and natural-gas company completed the purchase
of a 23.43 percent working interest in Alba from  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
today. The acquisition brings its total stake to 25.68 percent,
Endeavor said in a statement.  The Alba stake is part of Endeavour’s $330 million purchase
of three U.K. oilfield stakes from ConocoPhillips announced on
Dec. 27. The company plans to close on the two other fields as
soon as possible, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Transier said in a phone interview today. Alba made up about 70
percent of the total purchase, he said.  Endeavour said May 2 that completing the Alba transfer was
delayed as it discussed future decommissioning costs with the
project’s partners. At the time, the company said it may not
have the cash or be able to finance certain repayments required
if the transaction didn’t close.  Alba produced 25,000 barrels a day last year, according to
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s website. Chevron owns 23.4 percent and operates
the field, which began producing oil in 1994. Total SA and
Statoil ASA also owns stakes in the field, according to their
websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
