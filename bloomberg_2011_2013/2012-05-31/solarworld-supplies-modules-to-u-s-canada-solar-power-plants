Solarworld AG (SWV) , Germanyâ€™s biggest
solar-panel maker, said it supplied four power-plant projects in
the U.S. and Canada in May.  Solarworld shipped modules assembled at its Hillsboro,
Oregon factory to solar projects in California,  New Jersey , West
Virginia and Ontario, the Bonn-based company said today in a
website statement.  They include a 11.6-megawatt plant for the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, a 6.1-megawatt unit at
Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and the 33-megawatt Stardale
solar farm in Ontario that was connected to the grid on May 16,
