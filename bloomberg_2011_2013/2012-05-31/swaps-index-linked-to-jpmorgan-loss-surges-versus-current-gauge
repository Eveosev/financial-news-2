The vintage credit-default swaps
index said to have contributed to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $2
billion trading loss is surging relative to the current index.  The 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, created in 2007, increased to 168.6 basis points at
4:30 p.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The difference with the current version of the five-year
index, the Series 18 expiring in June 2017, widened to 45.2
basis points, the biggest gap since August 23.  Traders are pushing the older gauge wider as they wager
it’s one of the bank’s positions contributing to the loss after
its chief investment office took flawed positions in  credit
derivatives , wagers that were “poorly monitored,” according to
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon . The index expiring
in December 2017 jumped 13 basis points to 139.75 on May 11, the
day after Dimon disclosed a $2 billion trading loss in synthetic
credit. It’s climbed from 111.7 on March 30.  Bloomberg News reported April 5 that London-based JPMorgan
trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial
health of corporations that were so large he was driving price
moves in the $10 trillion market. The unit responsible for the
loss was valuing some of its trades at prices that differed from
those of its investment bank, according to people familiar with
the matter.  Synthetic credit products are derivatives that generate
gains and losses tied to credit performance without the owner
buying or selling actual debt. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
