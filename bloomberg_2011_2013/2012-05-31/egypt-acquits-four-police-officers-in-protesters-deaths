An Egyptian court acquitted four
policemen who were accused of killing protesters during one of
the most violent days of the uprising that ousted former
President  Hosni Mubarak .  The ruling comes two days before a verdict is expected in
the criminal case against Mubarak, who faces charges including
complicity in the deaths of some of the 850 demonstrators who
died during the unrest.  The policemen, who included three senior officers, were
charged with killing three protesters and wounding seven others
outside the Cairo police station where they worked, the court
said in a faxed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
