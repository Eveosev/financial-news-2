UralChem Holding Plc, a Russian
fertilizer maker, said first-quarter profit doubled as its
acquisition of  OAO Perm Mineral Fertilizers  boosted output.  Net income rose to $352 million from $173 million a year
earlier, UralChem said in a report posted yesterday on its
 website . Sales climbed 19 percent to $673 million.  The company agreed to buy Perm Mineral Fertilizers in
December, acquiring a 51 percent stake from Sibur Group in a bid
to increase urea and ammonia production amid rising prices.  Net debt was $1.08 billion as of March 31, UralChem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
