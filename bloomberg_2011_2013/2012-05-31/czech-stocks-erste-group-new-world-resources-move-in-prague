The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
slid 1.3 percent to 865.6, the lowest in more than five months,
at the close in Prague. The benchmark lost 7.8 percent in May,
the most since September 2011.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  lost 1.7 percent
to 363.5 koruna, taking monthly losses to 15 percent. European
stocks tumbled after U.S. reports showed jobless claims rose
last week and the world’s largest economy grew more slowly in
the first quarter than estimated.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, fell 3.7 percent to 93.4 koruna, its lowest close
in almost three years and extending May losses to 26 percent.
