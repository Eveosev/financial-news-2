Daily rates for the largest commodity
carriers fell for a 10th session on fewer bookings to ship iron
ore cargoes.  Returns for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling the steel-
making ingredient, lost 4.8 percent to $5,036 a day, according
to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of freight
rates. That’s the 10th straight decline and the lowest rate
since March 29, the data show.  Capesize vessels lost 22 percent this month, according to
exchange data. The global dry-bulk fleet includes 1,432 of the
ships with a combined capacity of 263 million deadweight tons,
according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s biggest
shipbroker. That’s a record high and compares with 138.1 million
tons in August 2008.  “Overall activity remains muted,” Oslo-based RS Platou
Markets AS said in an e-mailed report today. “Capesize rates
continued their free fall yesterday and have declined 33 percent
in the past one week to $5,300 a day.”  Rates for Panamaxes, which carry about half as much as
Capesizes, slumped 4.9 percent to $7,348 a day, down 47 percent
this month, the exchange said. Earnings for Supramaxes declined
1.9 percent to $10,813, and Handysizes decreased 1.1 percent to
$9,344 a day.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a broader measure of raw-materials
shipping costs, fell for an eighth day, sliding 2.8 percent to
923 points. That’s the longest losing streak since Feb. 3,
exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
