Prosecutors in Moscow said a serial
killer stalked his victims in more than 10 regions stretching
from central  Russia  to Siberia in a crime spree the lasted more
than five years.  Sergei Martynov, arrested in 2010, will stand trial for at
least eight murders, mostly women and girls, at least one of
whom he raped, the Investigative Committee said in a statement
posted on its website.  Martynov spent 14 years in jail for murder and rape and
resumed killing after he was released in 2005, according to the
statement.  Alexander Pichushkin, known as the “chessboard killer”
was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 after being found guilty
of killing 48 people, most of whom he bludgeoned to death with a
hammer in a Moscow park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
