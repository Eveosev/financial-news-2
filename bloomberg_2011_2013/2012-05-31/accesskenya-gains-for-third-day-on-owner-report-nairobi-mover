AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS) , the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, gained
for a third day after Business Daily reported the founders of
the company had increased their shareholding.  The stock climbed 7.2 percent to 5.20 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the biggest gain since Jan. 4. The stock has
advanced 1 percent this year, compared with an 18 percent jump
for the NSE All Share Index.  AccessKenya’s founders have increased their total stake to
29.6 percent in December from 25.3 percent in October, Business
Daily reported May 24. The Somen family, including Managing
Director Jonathan Somen and Executive Director David Somen,
bought 8.9 million shares during the period, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing filings with the market regulator.  “There has been talk that the Somens have been buying
their shares; that is something that would cause a bit of
appetite for the stock because it could point to things
improving,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s markets regulator said it approved AccessKenya
Ltd.’s issue of one new bonus share for every 20 held. The
company plans to issue 10.4 million new shares in lieu of a
dividend, the  Capital Markets Authority  said May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
