Preferred shares of OAO
Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer, rose the
most in more than three months as the ruble extended its slide.  The securities advanced as much as 5.2 percent, the most
since Feb 24, before paring their gain to 0.2 percent at 15.984
rubles by the close in Moscow.  “Surgut holds a massive cash pile estimated at between $25
billion and $30 billion, mostly denominated in dollars, so they
are very sensitive to any changes in the ruble exchange rate,”
said Constantine Cherepanov, an analyst at UBS AG in Moscow.  The ruble has weakened 12 percent this month to 33.48
against the dollar, the biggest depreciation among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency slid 2.2
percent today to the weakest since April 2009.  Surgut’s preferred shares dividend payout ratio is a fixed
percent of net income, which will benefit from a weaker ruble,
Cherepanov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
