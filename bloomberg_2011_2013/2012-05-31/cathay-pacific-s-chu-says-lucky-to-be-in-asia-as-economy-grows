Ivan Chu, chief operating officer of
 Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , comments on China’s economic growth
and the airline’s performance. He spoke in Hong Kong today.  China’s industrial production expanded the least since 2009
in April, new  yuan  loans were the lowest this year and exports
growth missed estimates.  On the economy:  “The slowdown is in one month. It’s very clear that after
releasing the figures, the central government is planning to
take some actions. Growth in Asia Pacific is still the best in
the world. We are lucky to be here in Asia.”  On Cathay:  “In Southeast Asia and in Northeast Asia, we are doing
well in both passenger and cargo businesses, and have generated
growth. The Asian region will be a star in our business. It’s
not that good in long-haul business, particularly flights to
 Europe . For cargo, we are hoping there will be meaningful pre-
Christmas rush this year. Last year, we didn’t have that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
