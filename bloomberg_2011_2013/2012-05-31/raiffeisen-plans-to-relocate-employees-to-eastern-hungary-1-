Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern  Europe ’s third-biggest lender, is planning to relocate
staff to eastern Hungary.  The jobs are back office, spokesman Michael Palzer said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “This is a move of staff,
not a creation of new jobs.”  The bank’s Hungarian unit said earlier today in an
invitation to a press conference that it plans to hire “several
hundred” people in the eastern city of Nyiregyhaza, with
details due at 3 p.m.  The Hungarian banking sector was unprofitable in 2011 for
the first time in 13 years, after banks were hit by losses on
foreign-currency loans and by Europe’s highest bank levy.
Raiffeisen had a 355 million-euro loss in the country last year.
The Vienna-based lender cut 8 percent of jobs in  Hungary  in 2011
and said in March that it plans further reductions this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
