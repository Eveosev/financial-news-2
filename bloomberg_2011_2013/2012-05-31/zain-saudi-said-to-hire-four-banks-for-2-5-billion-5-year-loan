Mobile Telecommunications Co. of
Saudi Arabia , known as Zain Saudi, hired four banks for a five-
year $2.5 billion loan to refinance its Islamic facility that
matures in July, according to two bankers familiar with the
matter.  The company, 25 percent-owned by Mobile Telecommunications
Co. of  Kuwait , mandated  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) ,  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) ,  Arab
National Bank (ARNB)  and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  for the loan, the
bankers said, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private.  Zain Saudi will use the loan to refinance its existing $2.5
loan that matures on July 27, the bankers said.  A spokesman for Mobile Telecommunications Co. of Kuwait
wasn’t immediately available for comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  Investors approved a six-month extension of the loan until
July in January. Zain Saudi got the $2.5 billion Murabaha loan
from eight banks in August 2009 to finance the company’s network
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
