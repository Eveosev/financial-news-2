South African producer-price
 inflation  slowed to a one-year low in April, supporting the view
the central bank may keep  interest rates  unchanged.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines increased 6.6
percent compared with 7.2 percent in March, Pretoria-based
Statistics  South Africa  said on its website today. The  median
estimate  of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.9 percent.
Prices rose 0.3 percent in the month.  “It’s a reassuring number and it could also reassure the
Reserve Bank that its current rate is appropriate,” Thabi Leoka, the head of South African macroeconomic research at
Johannesburg-based  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , said in a phone
interview.  The Reserve Bank has kept its key  policy rate  unchanged for
18 months at 5.5 percent, the lowest level in more three
decades, to help support the economy’s recovery. Slower growth
in factory-gate prices may ease pressure on consumer inflation,
which accelerated to 6.1 percent in April.  The central bank’s target is to keep consumer-price
inflation within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent. The
inflation rate probably peaked in the first quarter at an
average of 6.1 percent and may drop into the target band after
June,  Reserve Bank  Governor Gill Marcus said on May 24.  The rand weakened 0.3 percent to 8.5034 a dollar at 12:24
p.m. in Johannesburg. The currency was at 8.4999 before the data
was released. The yield on the government bond due in 2021
gained 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.747
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
