India’s budget deficit in April was
13.1 percent of the fiscal-year goal as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  strives to narrow the widest shortfall among the
biggest  emerging markets .  The gap was 672 billion rupees ($12 billion), the
Controller General of Accounts said on its website today. It was
18.1 percent in April 2011.  Mukherjee in the annual budget in March outlined record
borrowing of 5.69 trillion rupees to fund a deficit he estimated
would be 5.1 percent of  gross domestic product  in the year that
began April 1. Subsidies have fanned spending even as slowing
growth has crimped tax revenue, with a report today showing GDP
rose 5.3 percent last quarter, the slowest pace in nine years.  The budget shortfall for the 12 months through March 31,
2012 was 5.1 trillion rupees compared with a target of 5.22
trillion rupees, the government said in a separate report
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
