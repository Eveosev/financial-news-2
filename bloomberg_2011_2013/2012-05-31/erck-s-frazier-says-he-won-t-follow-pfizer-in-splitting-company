Merck & Co. (MRK)  Chief Executive Officer
Ken Frazier said he doesn’t plan on breaking up the company by
splitting off businesses the way  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and Abbott
Laboratories are doing.  “My philosophy is fix what is broke, don’t do the fad of
the day,” Frazier said at the Sanford C. Bernstein conference
in New York today. “I remember a few years ago when people said
it would be the diversified companies that were going to get the
premium in the market.”  Pfizer in April said it will sell the company’s infant-
nutrition business to Nestle SA for about $11.9 billion, part of
CEO Ian Read’s plan to reduce the New York-based drugmaker’s
size. Abbott said it would split into a pharmaceuticals
manufacturer and a business focusing on medical devices, generic
medicines and nutritional drinks by year-end.  Merck’s consumer and animal units complement its
prescription drug business, Frazier said. He also said he
doesn’t see any large deals that would create value.  Merck, based in  Whitehouse Station ,  New Jersey , paid $49
billion in 2009 for Schering-Plough Corp., a deal that has taken
a lot of effort to integrate, said Frazier. He said he doesn’t
plan on doing another large deal and is instead focused on
smaller, targeted biotech acquisitions.  Merck’s animal health business had $3.3 billion in sale
last year and its consumer health unit, which sells over-the-
counter medicines, generated $1.8 billion in revenue. Merck gets
85 percent of its revenue from  prescription drugs  and vaccines.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
