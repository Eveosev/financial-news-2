Sweden ’s economy is strong and the
Riksbank should keep a cool head even as the European debt
crisis rages on, Deputy Governor Barbro Wickman-Parak said.  The  economy  “is rather strong, and primarily domestic
demand has been resistant and one can also say that service
exports are also increasing quite well,” Wickman-Parak told
reporters today after a speech in  Stockholm . “It’s quite good
to keep a cool head even when uncertain winds blow,” she said.  Sweden’s central bank last month kept its  key interest rate 
unchanged at 1.5 percent and predicted no cuts in the next year.
The economy grew more than expected last quarter and  consumer
confidence  unexpectedly improved for a third month in May.  Gross domestic product expanded an annual 1.5 percent in
first three months of the year and a quarterly 0.8 percent after
contracting for the first time since 2009 the previous quarter,
Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said yesterday.  Swedish employment has developed better than the central
bank predicted last month, while  exports of goods  and  industrial
production  have disappointed, Wickman-Parak said.  “We can’t include catastrophic scenarios, or near-
catastrophic scenarios, in our forecasts,” she said. “But we
can be clear about being prepared should that be the case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
