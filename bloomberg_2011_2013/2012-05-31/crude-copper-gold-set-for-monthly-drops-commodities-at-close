this year yesterday, is on course for a third monthly drop, the
longest period of decline since 2008.  BASE METALS  Copper may drop for a third day, heading for the biggest
monthly drop since September, on concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will worsen, curbing demand for the metal used in wires

ton, the lowest level since Dec. 29. The contract traded little

bushel and traded at $6.495, heading for a 0.8 percent decline
this month. Prices fell to as low as $6.4425 a bushel yesterday,
the lowest for a most-active contract since May 17, as rain in
the U.S. boosted crop prospects.  Palm oil  dropped for a second day, heading for the biggest
monthly loss in more than two years, on concern that Europe’s
escalating fiscal crisis may damp demand for commodities.  The August-delivery contract declined as much as 0.9
