Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and its Chinese
partners face hundreds of millions of euros in costs because of
problems with their direct shift gearbox system,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing people close to the company it didn’t identify.  The costs of at least 400 million euros ($496 million) are
related to Volkswagen’s warranty extension plan for cars built
in  China  using the so-called DSG system, the newspaper said.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
