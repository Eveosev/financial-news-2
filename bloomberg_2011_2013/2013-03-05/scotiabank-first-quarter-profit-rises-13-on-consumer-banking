Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada ’s third-
largest lender, said quarterly profit climbed 13 percent as its
ING Direct acquisition improved consumer-banking results. The
firm also increased its quarterly dividend.  Net income for the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31 rose
to C$1.63 billion ($1.58 billion), or C$1.25 a share, from
C$1.44 billion, or C$1.20, a year earlier, the Toronto-based
bank said today in a statement. Excluding one-time items,
Scotiabank earned C$1.27 a share, beating the C$1.25 average
 estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Domestic banking profit climbed 21 percent to C$574 million
after the lender purchased the Canadian operations of  ING Groep
NV (INGA)  for C$3.1 billion in November. Scotiabank joined Royal Bank
of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank in posting higher first-
quarter net income even as Canada’s economic growth began to
stagnate on record levels of household debt.  “Some pundits were calling for a slowdown, but we really
haven’t seen it yet,” said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research
at MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which
manages about C$4 billion in assets, including bank shares.
“Personal and commercial banking is still the bread-and-butter
for these banks.”  The lender raised its quarterly dividend 5.3 percent to 60
cents per share. Scotiabank was expected to boost the payout to
59 cents, according to Bloomberg Dividend Projections.  International Bank  Scotiabank gained 0.7 percent to close at C$61.32 in
Toronto. The shares have climbed 6.7 percent this year, compared
with the 4.8 percent advance of the 10-company  Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Banks Index. (STBANKX)   Profit from international banking increased 19 percent to
C$466 million, helped by Scotiabank’s acquisition last year of
Banco Colpatria in Colombia. The lender has operations in more
than 50 countries, including Mexico, Thailand and  Peru .  Profit from investment banking rose 28 percent to C$399
million from a year earlier, while the wealth-management unit
posted a 7.6 percent gain to C$310 million.  “It was a very solid quarter for BNS, reflecting solid
organic revenue growth across the operating segments augmented
by select acquisitions,” Brad Smith, an analyst with Stonecap
Securities Inc. in Toronto, wrote today in a note to clients.  Scotiabank was the last of Canada’s six largest banks by
assets to report first-quarter results. Royal Bank, the nation’s
largest, said profit rose 12 percent to C$2.07 billion.  Toronto-
Dominion (TD) , the second-biggest, reported profit climbed 21 percent
to C$1.79 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
