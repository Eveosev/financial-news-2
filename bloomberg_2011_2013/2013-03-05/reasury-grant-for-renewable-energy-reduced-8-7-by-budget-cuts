Grants to  renewable-energy 
developers under the U.S. Treasury Department’s 1603 program
have been reduced by 8.7 percent because of automatic cuts to
the  federal budget  that took effect March 1.  The reduction applies to awards approved after that date,
according to a letter posted on the Treasury Department’s
website yesterday. The lower rate will run through the end of
the fiscal year in September, when it may change.  The 1603 program offers cash grants of as much as 30
percent of development costs for renewable-energy projects that
began construction before the end of 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
