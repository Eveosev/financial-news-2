White House officials have agreed to
let the Senate intelligence committee see legal opinions
justifying the use of drone strikes against U.S. citizens,
according to Senator  Dianne Feinstein , the panel’s chairman.  The agreement “will pave the way for the confirmation of
 John Brennan  to be CIA director,” Feinstein, a California
Democrat, said in an e-mailed statement. The panel plans to vote
today on President Barack Obama’s nomination of Brennan, who is
now his counterterrorism adviser, to head the Central
Intelligence Agency.  Some Democrats, led by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, had
threatened to hold up the nomination until they could see
Justice Department opinions explaining the legal basis for
targeted strikes against U.S. citizens abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
