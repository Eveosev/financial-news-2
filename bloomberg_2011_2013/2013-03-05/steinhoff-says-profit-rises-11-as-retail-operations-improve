Steinhoff International Holdings
Ltd. (SHF) , a South African furniture maker dependent on Europe for
more than half its revenue, said six-month earnings rose 11
percent as the group gained market share.  Net income rose to 3.24 billion rand ($358 million) from
2.91 billion rand a year ago, the company said in a statement
today. Basic earnings per share increased to 173.9 cents from
165.5 cents a year earlier. Sales jumped 52 percent to 57.3
billion rand from 37.6 billion rand.  “The integrated retail business in Europe reported solid
results and increased market share in many of the territories
where the group operates,” the company said.  The stock  gained  as much as 2.6 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Jan. 31, and traded 1.8 percent higher
to 26.45 rand by 3:23 p.m. in Johannesburg.  “Our enlarged business in  Europe  is certainly producing
benefits and this, coupled with continued investments in
infrastructure, has helped to improve margins for the group,”
Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
