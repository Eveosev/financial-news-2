Spain may be able to begin to sell
its stake in the nationalized  Bankia (BKIA)  group as soon as 2014,
Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri said.  The government may reduce its holding in the lender “bit
by bit” in 2014 or 2015, Goirigolzarri said at an event in
Madrid today. Bankia is on course to be able to generate
 dividends  from 2014, he said.  Bankia SA, the listed company owned by Bankia group, posted
a record 19 billion-euro ($25 billion)  loss  last year as it
cleansed its balance sheet of soured real estate loans.
Goirigolzarri is targeting earnings of 1.2 billion euros in 2015
as he positions the group to return state aid.  “Our objective is to generate value so shareholders can
really make that value tangible,” Goirigolzarri said.  Goirigolzarri said that the sale of shares in Bankia SA in
2011 was an “error.” The group raised more than 3 billion
euros by listing Bankia at 3.75 euros a share. The shares now
trade at about 30 euro cents.  Bankia group is still waiting for  Spain ’s bank rescue fund
to announce the final terms of the exchange of hybrid debt
securities for shares in the last stage of the recapitalization.  The Spanish state wholly owns the parent company, which
gives it a 47 percent  stake  in the listed bank. That’s set to
rise to about 70 percent when the debt exchange is completed.  El Pais newspaper reported last week that Spain’s bank
rescue fund, known as Frob, and the Bank of Spain expect the
European Commission to fix a value for the shares of one cent.
Goirigolzarri said today he couldn’t comment on the final
exchange terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
