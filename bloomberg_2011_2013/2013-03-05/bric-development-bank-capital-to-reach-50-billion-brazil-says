Bric nations will create a
 development bank  funded with approximately $50 billion at their
March 26-27 summit in  South Africa , a Brazilian finance ministry
official said.  A contingency reserve fund will have lines of credit of
between $90 billion and $120 billion, Carlos Cozendey, the
finance ministryâ€™s secretary for international affairs, said in
an interview in Brasilia. The fund is designed to address
possible balance of payment difficulties between Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa.  Non-Bric countries may also join the bank, Cozendey said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
