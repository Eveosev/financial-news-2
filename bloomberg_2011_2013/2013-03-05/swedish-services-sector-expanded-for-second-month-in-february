Sweden’s  services  sector expanded
for a second month in February after the Nordic region’s largest
economy grew more than forecast in the fourth quarter, a survey
by  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  indicated.  An index based on responses from about 200  purchasing
managers  in the services sector was a seasonally adjusted 54.6
in February compared with a revised 52.6 the previous month,
Stockholm-based Swedbank, which compiles the index, said in a
 statement  today. A reading above 50 signals an expansion.  “New orders and employment made the biggest contribution
to that PMI services rose in the month of February,” Swedbank
said in the statement. “The sub-index for business volumes
continued to rise as the situation for orders improved while the
index for delivery times fell.”  Sweden’s  economy  grew an annual 1.4 percent in the fourth
quarter compared with analyst predictions of 1.1 percent. Growth
will accelerate to 1.1 percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014,
the government forecast on Dec. 21. Swedish manufacturing
expanded for the first time in seven months in February.  “We’re seeing a stabilization of the Swedish economy,”
Swedish Finance Minister  Anders Borg  said on March 1. “We’ve
had several signs of that.”  Swedish economic growth slowed to 0.8 percent last year
from 3.7 percent in 2011 because of falling demand for exports
from  Europe  where countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.
Exports account for about half of Swedish output.  PMI’s business volumes sub-index rose to 56.9 in February
from 55.9 in January, the order index increased to 57.2 from
54.1 and the employment index rose to 52.3 from 48.3. The
delivery time index decreased to 49.3 from 50.  Swedish annual services production grew 0.8 percent in
January and 0.5 percent compared with the previous month,
according to a separate statement from  Statistics Sweden  today.
Annual services production fell a revised 1.1 percent in
December and decreased a monthly 0.9 percent that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
