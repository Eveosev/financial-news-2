Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  said it filed patent-
infringement lawsuits today against generic-drug makers
including  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  to prevent them
from selling a low-cost version of the painkiller Celebrex until
December 2015.  Pfizer had won a ruling in 2008 that prevents Teva from
entering the market until May 2014. In that case, an appeals
court invalidated a patent that expires in December 2015. Pfizer
said today it had persuaded the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office 
to reissue that patent with changes.  Celebrex, also known by the active ingredient celecoxib,
generated $1.75 billion in U.S. sales last year, the company
said Jan. 29. Each day that Pfizer can delay generic competition
means about $5 million in revenue for the New York-based
company.  The reissued patent covers methods of treating
osteoarthritis with celecoxib. In addition to Petach Tikva,
Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic-drug maker,
Pfizer said it sued Mylan Inc.,  Actavis Inc. (ACT) ,  Lupin Ltd. (LPC)  and
Apotex Inc. in federal court in eastern  Virginia .  “Continued development of new medicines that enhance
patient lives is supported by protecting intellectual property
and innovation,” Pfizer General Counsel Amy Schulman said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
