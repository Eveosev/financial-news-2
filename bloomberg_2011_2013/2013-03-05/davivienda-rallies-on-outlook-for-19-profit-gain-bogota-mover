Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND) , Colombia’s
third-biggest bank, rose to a record as analysts projected it
will report this week a 19 percent increase in annual profit.  Shares climbed 0.5 percent to 26,140 pesos at 1:20 p.m. in
Bogota after reaching an intraday record high of 26,420 pesos.
The stock has returned 11 percent this year, the best
performance after Cemex Latam Holdings SA on the Colcap index,
which has declined 0.7 percent.  Davivienda will report a boost in 2012 profit from a year
earlier to 750 billion pesos ($414 million), according to the
 average estimate  of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
bank is due to publish  earnings  on March 8.  The bank’s profit “isn’t looking bad at all,” Juan Camilo Dominguez, an analyst at brokerage Correval SA, said in a
telephone interview. “There was a bit of fear over the
profitability of its Central American operations, and that fear
has been passing.”  Last year, Davivienda completed the $801 million
acquisition of HSBC Holdings Plc’s assets in Costa Rica, El
Salvador and  Honduras .  The bank agreed to buy Corredores Asociados SA, the Andean
nation’s biggest independent brokerage, for 120 billion pesos
plus an additional amount that will depend on the brokerage’s
profit, Davivienda Chief Executive Officer Efrain Forero said
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
