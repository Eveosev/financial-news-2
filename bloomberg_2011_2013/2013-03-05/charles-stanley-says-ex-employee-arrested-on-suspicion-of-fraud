Charles Stanley Group Plc (CAY) , a London-
based wealth manager and brokerage, said a former employee was
arrested on suspicion of fraud.  “This individual was responsible for defrauding clients
and non-clients,” Magnus Wheatley, a spokesman for the firm,
said in an e-mailed statement. “The conduct concerns
transactions undertaken by the individual almost entirely
outside of Charles Stanley’s systems and it is believed to have
affected only a small number of clients. We are aware that the
individual has now been arrested by the police.”  The firm reported the broker, who retired on Aug. 3, to the
police and Financial Services Authority and is now assisting
authorities with their inquiries, Wheatley said. He declined to
identify the former employee. While the amount of money involved
is still being assessed, the financial impact on the London-
based company is likely to be “minimal,” Wheatley said.  Charles Stanley , which oversees more than 16 billion pounds
($24 billion) for clients, said an internal review had concluded
that the firm’s processes and procedures weren’t at fault. The
investigation was previously reported by thewealthnet, a London-
based publication.  Charles Stanley  shares  have advanced 21 percent to 364
pence in London trading this year, valuing the company at 165
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
