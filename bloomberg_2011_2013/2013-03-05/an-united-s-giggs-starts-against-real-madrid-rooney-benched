Manchester United midfielder Ryan
Giggs will play his 1,000th game in the British soccer club’s
Champions League match tonight against Real  Madrid , with forward
Wayne Rooney starting on the bench.  Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo is returning to Old Trafford,
where he played for several seasons. The first match in Madrid
ended 1-1, and the winner over the two-match competition will
move to the quarterfinals. Giggs signed a contract extension
earlier this month and will return for a 23rd season.  Rooney hasn’t scored in his last six appearances for
United.  *t
