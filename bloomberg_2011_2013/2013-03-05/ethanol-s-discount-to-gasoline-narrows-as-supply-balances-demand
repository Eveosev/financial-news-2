Ethanol weakened against gasoline as
prices for the motor fuel gained on speculation seasonal
refinery maintenance will limit supply.  The spread, comparing front-month contracts, expanded 1.58
cents to 70.31 cents a gallon at 3:02 p.m.  New York  time.
Gasoline stockpiles in the U.S. probably fell 1 million barrels
last week, according to the median of 12 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  “It’s the time of year where you get some preparation
before the summer driving season,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 2.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.437 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
March futures contract, which expired today, increased 2.6 cents
to $2.43.  Gasoline futures for April delivery advanced 4.99 cents, or
1.6 percent, to settle at $3.1482 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Kitt said as the refineries return from maintenance ethanol
demand should increase.  “That’s more opportunities to blend ethanol,” he said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 88 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline supply in the week ended Feb. 22, down from about
90 percent the previous week and the lowest level since Jan. 25,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Production Decline  Companies have reduced ethanol  production  16 percent to
812,000 barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 22 from a record in
December 2011 as higher corn costs eroded profit, according to
the EIA, the Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Supply of the biofuel has fallen four consecutive weeks to
19.4 million barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 30, the data
show.  Corn for March delivery increased 9 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $7.32 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol and based on March
contracts, was minus 23 cents, compared with minus 23 cents
yesterday and minus 14 cents on Feb. 12. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Kitt said imports of the fuel from Brazil will probably
slow over the next month as the country starts its sugarcane
harvest.  Brazilian Price  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.42 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazil  is the largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S. and
the country uses sugarcane to make the fuel.  Ethanol  imports  averaged 32,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Feb. 22, the highest level since Jan. 18, EIA data show,
and compared to none a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.62 a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the U.S. Gulf, the additive climbed 3 cents to
$2.49, in New York the biofuel gained 0.5 cent to $2.55 and in
Chicago, the fuel jumped 3 cents to $2.43 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf weakened to 13
cents from 16 cents yesterday, while Chicago’s discount to New
York tightened to 12 cents from 14.5 cents.  Ethanol Mandate  U.S. refiners are required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year and 14.4 billion gallons next year.  Speculation about the likelihood of meeting the production
and consumption targets has raised the value of Renewable
Identification Numbers for corn-based ethanol to a record, Kitt
said.  RINs are used to help the Environmental Protection Agency
track whether refiners are meeting the federal biofuel-use
mandates and they can purchase the credits in lieu of physically
blending ethanol.  The value of  corn-ethanol based RINs  yesterday rose to a
record 73.5 cents from 62.5 on March 1, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian-made
ethanol, jumped to a record 79.5 cents from 72 cents on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
