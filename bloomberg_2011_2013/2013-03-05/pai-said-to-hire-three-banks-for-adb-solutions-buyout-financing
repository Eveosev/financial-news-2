Private-equity company PAI Partners
hired banks to arrange leveraged loans to back its buyout of
airfield lighting provider ADB Airfield Solutions, according to
three people with knowledge of the transaction.  Bank of Ireland, BNP Paribas SA and UniCredit SA will
arrange the senior debt which will be offered to a wider group
of lenders, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the matter is private. The loans may total more than 120
million euros ($157 million), one of the people said.  Rosanna Konarzewski, a London-based spokeswoman for PAI
Partners, declined to comment on the debt financing.  Brussels, Belgium-based ADB was acquired by Montagu Private
Equity LLP in a buyout supported by 73 million euros of loans.
ADB provides lighting to airports and was spun out of Siemens AG
in 2009.  The financing will include a term loan B portion, which may
pay interest at 475 basis points more than benchmarks, the
people said. The debt is about 4.5 times ADBâ€™s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, they said. A
basis point is 0.1 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
