Rupert Murdoch and his family,
facing a new rival in the U.K. pay-TV market as  Liberty Global
Inc. (LBTYA)  works on completing its  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  purchase,
supports the acquisition by its competitor, Liberty Global’s
chief executive officer said.  Mike Fries, head of the cable giant expanding in the U.K.,
said he has spoken with Rupert Murdoch and his son, James, and
that they are supportive of the transaction. The Murdochs
understand the competitive nature of business, Fries said today
at the Cable Congress in London.  Liberty Global, controlled by billionaire John Malone,
agreed to buy cable-television provider Virgin Media for $16
billion last month to challenge the Murdochs’  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  in Europe’s biggest pay-TV market.  Fries said Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty Global isn’t
planning to bid for sports rights against BSkyB. His company’s
merger with Virgin Media will be a “powerful combination,”
Fries said.  “Virgin media is a great asset, a great brand and it has a
confident management team,” Fries said. “The U.K. market has
gotten bad rap but we think it’s a good time to be in this
market.”  A spokeswoman for  News Corp. (NWSA) , the Murdoch-led company that
controls BSkyB, had no immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
