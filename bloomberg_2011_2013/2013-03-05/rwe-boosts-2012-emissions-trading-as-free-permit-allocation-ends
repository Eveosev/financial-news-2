RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
utility, boosted carbon trading by 65 percent in 2012 before the
European Union halted free allocations of emission allowances
this year.  RWE traded 1.06 billion metric tons of carbon permits in
2012, compared with 644 million tons the previous year, company
spokesman Michael Murphy on Essen said in an e-mail today.
Starting this year, west European power generators must buy all
of their emission permits until at least 2020, after getting
most of their allowances for free over the past five years.  “The shift from partial free allocation of allowances to
full auctioning for Western utilities is likely to mean
increased carbon trading activity for most power companies,”
said Itamar Orlandi, a carbon markets analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in  London . “We expect a further, although less
pronounced, increase of trading volumes over 2013.”  RWE emitted 197.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2012,
according to its  annual report  published today. That’s 11
percent more than in 2011 and the highest amount since 2007,
according to data from RWE’s previous annual reports.  The utility is unlikely to repeat last year’s jump in
carbon trading, according to Anett Urbaczka, a spokeswoman for
RWE in Essen. “2012 was an exception with regards to
emissions,” she said, without providing details.  Carbon Plunge  The EU started its emissions trading system in 2005 to help
meet greenhouse gas-reduction targets under the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol. The program auctions or allocates for free allowances
to factories and utilities, which must surrender enough permits
to cover their discharges of carbon dioxide or face fines.  Carbon prices have plunged 52 percent in the past year as
 Europe ’s weak economy damped industrial demand for permits.
December EU permits fell to a record 2.81 euros ($3.65) a ton on
Jan. 24, and were at 4.50 euros on ICE Futures Europe exchange
at 3:15 p.m. in London.  Declining power prices in Europe’s biggest economy,
combined with the slump in emission permits and weak demand for
coal worldwide has made dirtier coal-fired plants more
profitable to run relative to gas-powered facilities.  In Germany,  gas-fired plants  are making a loss of 17.87
euros a megawatt-hour based on power, gas and emissions prices
for next month. Coal plants are  earning  7.57 euros a megawatt-
hour as of 2:30 p.m. in Berlin.  RWE’s trading in gas last year dropped 46% to 4,393
terawatt-hours from 8,132 terawatt hours in 2011.  German year-ahead electricity , the European benchmark for
power pricing, has fallen 21 percent in the past year, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
