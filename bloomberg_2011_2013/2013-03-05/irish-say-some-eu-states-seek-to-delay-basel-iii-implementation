A group of European Union nations
are seeking to delay the bloc’s application of Basel bank
capital rules beyond the start of 2014 on concerns that they
need to more time to prepare, according to  a document  published
on the EU’s website.  Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, has
said that it is targeting a Jan. 1, 2014, start date for the
measures provided they can be published in the EU’s Official
Journal by July 1.  “A number of delegations maintain their reservations and
indicate that under any circumstances 12 months would be needed
between publication in the Official Journal and the date of
application/transposition,” according to the document, drawn up
by the Irish presidency, and dated March 2. The document does
not name the countries involved.  EU finance ministers are meeting today in Brussels to
debate a draft deal on the rules reached last week between
Ireland and lawmakers in the European Parliament. The measures,
known as Basel III, would more than triple the core capital
lenders must hold to protect themselves from losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
