Bracewell was ruled out of the series-opening cricket Test
against England starting tomorrow after cutting his foot while
cleaning up following a party at his home.  Bracewell, who’s taken 46 wickets in 15 Tests, was replaced
by Ian Butler in the squad for the match at University Oval in
Dunedin, New Zealand Cricket said today.  Bracewell, 22, said he cut his right foot on some glass
three days ago during a post-party cleanup at his home in
Napier. He apologized for his behavior and “any inconvenience
he has caused his teammates and members of the public,” New
Zealand Cricket said in an earlier statement.  The teams are scheduled to play a best-of-three contest,
with matches to follow in Wellington and Auckland. New Zealand,
which has lost eight of its past 11 elite five-day matches, last
won a Test series against  England  14 years ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
