Estonian industrial production rose
for a third month in January, fueled by growing demand for the
Baltic nation’s electronics and electricity exports.  Output rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with
a revised 6 percent increase in December and a revised 1.2
percent gain in November, the Tallinn-based statistics office
said today on its  website . Production rose 0.3 percent from in
the month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  “The increase in exports was mainly caused by the rapid
growth in sales of electronic products,” the statistics office
said. “Export sales of manufacturing production grew 14 percent
in January compared to the same month of the previous year;
domestic sales increased 6 percent.”  Industrial producers in the newest euro-area member are
benefiting from a recovering demand in neighboring Sweden and
 Finland . Improved export sales will probably help  Estonia ’s $22
billion economy grow 3 percent this year, the fastest pace in
the 17-member currency bloc, after 3.2 percent expansion last
year, according to European Commission estimates.  Manufacturing confidence, based on orders, production and
inventories, rose to 1.1 points in February, the highest level
in six months, with the best outlook for exports in eight
months, according to European Commission data released on Feb.
27.  January’s electronics output increased 29 percent from a
year earlier, up from a revised 18 percent advance in December,
the office said. Electricity, steam and hot-water supply grew 17
percent, compared with a 22 percent gain in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
