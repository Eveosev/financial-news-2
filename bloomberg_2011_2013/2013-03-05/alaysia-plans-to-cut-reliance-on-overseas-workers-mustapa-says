Malaysia  plans to reduce its
reliance on foreign workers by phasing out labor-intensive
industries and monitoring investments closely.  The government wants a “manageable” number of overseas
workers, Mustapa Mohamed, Malaysia’s trade and industry
minister, told reporters in Singapore today.  “We are moving up the value chain,” Mustapa said.
“Malaysia is not a place for purely labor-intensive
industries,” he said, adding that while the nation will
continue to need foreign workers in plantations, restaurants and
as domestic helpers, it will be “more selective” in evaluating
investment proposals from companies.  Malaysia joins neighboring Singapore in planning to reduce
its reliance on overseas workers to appease voters. Singapore
tightened curbs on foreign labor for a fourth straight year in
its budget last month amid public discontent over infrastructure
strains and record-high housing and transport costs after the
population jumped by more than 1.1 million since mid-2004.  Malaysia has about 3 million foreign workers, of whom
almost half are illegal, Mustapa said. The opposition has
proposed reducing the number of overseas laborers to 1 million,
he said.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak must dissolve
parliament by April 28 and hold elections within 60 days. The
ruling National Front will do “a bit better” in elections this
year than in 2008, Mustapa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
