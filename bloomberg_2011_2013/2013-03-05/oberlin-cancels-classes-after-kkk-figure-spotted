Oberlin College canceled classes for
a day of reflection after a person wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit
was seen near the campus’s Afrikan Heritage House.  The incident was one of several hate-related activities
that have taken place on campus recently, the Oberlin, Ohio-
based college said in a  statement  on its website. Oberlin
students spent yesterday in workshops on diversity and
sensitivity toward others.  “The strength of Oberlin comes from our belief that
diversity and openness enriches us all and enhances the
educational mission,” the school said in the statement.  The KKK figure was also spotted near the Edmonia Lewis
Center.  Mary Edmonia Lewis , a 19th Century black and American
Indian sculptor attended the school at a time when it was one of
the few U.S. Colleges to admit women and minorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
