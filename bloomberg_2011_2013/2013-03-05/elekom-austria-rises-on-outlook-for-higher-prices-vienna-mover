Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the Vienna-based
operator part-owned by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , rose for
a fifth day as Deutsche Bank AG said there’s room for price
increases in Austria and recommended that investors buy the
stock.  The shares  climbed  5.3 percent to 5.6 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close in Vienna, making them the best performers in the 25-
company  Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Services Index (BETELES) , which
was up 1.5 percent. More than 895,000 shares exchanged hands,
about 1.5 times the average daily volume over the past three
months.  “Doubling prices in the no-frill brand Bob last January
has worked,” Carola Bardelli, a Milan-based analyst at Deutsche
Bank, wrote in a note to clients. Bardelli expects Telekom
Austria’s main A1 brand to follow its rival, T-Mobile Austria,
which increased prices by a 15 percent on average over the
weekend, more than anticipated.  For years, four mobile telecommunication carriers have
battled over an Austrian population of about 8 million. Average
monthly revenue per user has declined from 36 euros in 2005 to
19 euros in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With
the takeover of Orange Austria by  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , the
number of mobile operators is shrinking to three from four.  Bardelli kept her price estimate unchanged at 6.8 euros and
raised her recommendation on the Telekom Austria stock to buy
from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
