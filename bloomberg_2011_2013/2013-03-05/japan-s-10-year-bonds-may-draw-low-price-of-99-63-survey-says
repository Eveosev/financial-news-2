Japan’s sale of 2.4 trillion yen
($25.7 billion) in 10-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 99.63, according to the median forecast of 12 traders
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.6 percent
bonds ranged from 99.53 to 99.66, according to the survey.  Three traders said 99.62; two each reported 99.63, 99.64
and 99.65; and one each reported 99.53, 99.58 and 99.66.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
