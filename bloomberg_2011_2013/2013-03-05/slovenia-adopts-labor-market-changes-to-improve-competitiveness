Slovenian lawmakers adopted changes
to the labor-market rules to increase competitiveness as the
country struggling with a recession.  Lawmakers voted unanimously to amend legislation that makes
it easier for employees to dismiss workers and ensure more long-
term contracts for job-seekers, according to a live broadcast by
public TV Slovenija today.  Slovenia is working to improve its competitiveness as the
euro region nation fights its second recession since 2009 amid a
deepening banking crisis and political uncertainty. Alenka Bratusek, the leader of the largest opposition group, replaced
Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  in a vote in parliament Feb. 27 and
seeks to forge a new coalition by mid-March.  “It’s a step forward, though the measures don’t really
seem revolutionary,” Andraz Grahek, director of Capital
Genetics in Ljubljana, said by phone. “The problem is that
nothing is being done to sort out the bank crisis.”  Jansa’s administration passed measures to recapitalize the
ailing banking industry with the creation of a so called bad
bank that is meant to clean up nonperforming loans from lenders
such as Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. in exchange for government-
guaranteed bonds of as much as 4 billion euros ($5.22 billion).
The plan may be scrapped or altered by Bratusek if she forms a
government.  The Adriatic nation’s  jobless rate  rose to 13 percent in
January, according to the statistics data, the highest level in
more than 13 years as companies, struggling with high debt
levels and a recession, seek to lower costs by firing workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
