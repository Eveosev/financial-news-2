With the worldwide fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s grounded due to battery fires, Air India Ltd. pilot Anjum Chabra turned to rap to lament his fate.  “Ain’t no flight for me here so ain’t no  Singapore , ain’t no casino for me so there’s no money no more,” he sang in a video he posted on YouTube. “What kind of pilot am I, who sits at home most of the time never gets to fly.”  Watch : The  Air India Rap video  on YouTube.  Warning : Contains strong language. His plight is shared by  Dreamliner  pilots across the industry since the planes were grounded on Jan. 16. Pilots, who spend weeks training for new aircraft, usually don’t fly more than one type of plane at the same time to reduce the risk of mistakes in different cockpits. With no end in sight for the planes to resume service, they are passing their time practicing in flight simulators and speaking to students.  “When you don’t know when the aircraft will be ready to fly again, you don’t want to cross that bridge of putting them on to another aircraft,” said  Peter Harbison , executive chairman at the Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. “There will be an array of issues in putting them on other planes.”  Experts are still investigating the cause of a lithium-ion battery fire on a Japan Airlines Co.-operated Dreamliner in  Boston  in January, and an emergency landing by a 787 plane flown by All Nippon Airways Co. later that month. The incidents led to their global grounding, the first time in 34 years that an entire airplane model has been pulled from service.  Permanent Solution  Boeing last month submitted a permanent solution for the battery problem to the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  to get the plane back in service. The proposal will require extensive testing even if approved before regulators end the plane’s grounding, the U.S.’s top aviation official said.  Dreamliner pilots at  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , the biggest operator of 787s, have been visiting school children to talk about their jobs since their planes have been grounded.  They went to Den-En Chofu University near  Tokyo  last month where they talked to 120 children, mostly six, seven and eight- year-olds. Pilots have also been taking training lessons and using the flight simulators in their free time, said Megumi Tezuka, an airline spokeswoman.  ANA, whose 17 787s make up about 7 percent of its fleet, has canceled  3,601 flights  through the end of May, affecting 167,820 passengers. It has about 200 pilots qualified to fly the Dreamliner, said Tezuka. The Tokyo-based carrier said in January the grounding of the fleet cut sales by 1.4 billion yen ($15 million) that month.  Huge Problem  All Nippon shares rose 1.1 percent to 193 yen in Tokyo trading today, extending the gains this year to 6.6 percent. Boeing climbed less than 0.1 percent to $78.71 at 10:33 a.m. in  New York .  JAL has 130 certified pilots who are observing flights on other planes and doing drills to maintain their skills, said Jian Yang, a spokesman with the carrier. The company, which has seven 787s in its fleet, isn’t training any new pilots, he said. Last month, the airline said the flight cancellations would cut sales by 1.1 billion yen in revenue through the end of March.  Air India pilot Chabra also complained about money in the song. An Air India spokesman confirmed Chabra was a pilot with the state-run company. He couldn’t be reached for comments.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  has about 125 pilots that have completed training for the planes, Christen David, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based carrier, said in an e-mail. Some of the carrier’s 787 pilots are able to return to the planes they were flying earlier if they were still “current” on those airplanes, said  Jay Pierce , chairman of the Continental chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.  No Spare Planes  It’s a “huge problem for the airlines that have already taken delivery of those aircraft,” said  International Air Transport Association ’s Chief Executive Officer  Tony Tyler . “Until the problem has been resolved we won’t see those aircraft operated.”  The airlines most likely don’t have enough spare planes for the 787 pilots to fly even if they were retrained for other models, said CAPA’s Harbison.  “The pilots are surplus to needs at the moment,” he said. “The gaps have been filled so they aren’t needed.”  Pilots spend two to three months learning to fly 787s, depending on what planes they flew beforehand, ANA’s Tezuka said. The airline isn’t considering having the pilots fly other aircraft as it expects the grounding won’t be long-term, she said.  Pay Cut  ANA pilots’ salaries are being cut by about 20 percent, compared with when they were flying, as they lose night time and long distance travel allowances, said Toshikazu Nagasawa, a director at the Air Line Pilots’ Association of  Japan , which has about 4,500 pilots as members. JAL pilots are losing about 30 percent, as they have a different payment structure, he said.  Last week, Japan’s transport ministry said that pilots who are required to take yearly flight tests on their airplanes will not lose their 787 licenses if they can’t be checked due to the grounding of the Dreamliner.  “We are doing all we can to help determine the cause of the problem,” Japanese Transport Minister Akihiro Ohta told reporters in Tokyo last week.  Even after the 787s resume service, Chabra’s return to the cockpit is not guaranteed.  India’s Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said in an interview he asked the airline’s chairman to take action against the pilot.
