 The zloty strengthened to a six-
week high on speculation that  Poland ’s policy makers may end a
series of interest-rate cuts at tomorrow’s meeting and after
better-than-forecast retail sales in the euro region.  The zloty strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to the
highest since Jan. 18 and traded at 4.1276 per euro, a 0.4
percent advance, at 5:39 p.m. in Warsaw. Yields on 10-year
government bonds rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to a nine-day high of 4.05 percent.  Poland’s Monetary Policy Council will deliver a quarter-
point cut in interest rates to 3.5 percent tomorrow, according
to 22 out of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The remaining
16 expect rates to stay unchanged after four quarter-point
reductions in as many months. Retail sales in the 17-nation
currency bloc gained 1.2 percent from a month earlier, beating a
median prediction for a 0.3 percent gain.  “We have seen good figures throughout the day plus the
market was positioning for tomorrow’s rate decision,” Karol Zaluski, chief foreign exchange dealer at  ING Bank Slaski SA (ING) ,
said in an e-mailed comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
