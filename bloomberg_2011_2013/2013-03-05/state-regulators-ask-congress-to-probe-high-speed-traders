Congress should bring greater
transparency to equity markets by investigating the roles of
high-frequency traders and broker-run trading venues known as
dark pools, a group of state securities regulators said today.  The  North American Securities Administrators Association ’s
 latest advocacy agenda  lists oversight of “opaque market
activities” among its top priorities for the new Congress. The
leaders of NASAA, whose members enforce state securities laws,
say high-frequency trading “appears to have potentially
dangerous implications for ordinary ‘mom and pop’ investors.”  NASAA president Heath Abshure, the Arkansas securities
commissioner, said a congressional oversight investigation
should examine whether the technological advantages of high-
frequency traders allow them to benefit at the expense of other
investors.  “The dark pools, the  hedge funds  and high-frequency
trading all undermine public confidence in our markets,”
Abshure said in an interview after the association announced its
agenda at a news conference in Washington. “We need to fix that
so that can’t happen.”  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Elisse B. Walter said during a speech on Feb. 19 that the agency is still
examining a body of “mixed evidence” as it tries to determine
whether high-frequency trading has been “a stimulative” or a
“deterrent to the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
