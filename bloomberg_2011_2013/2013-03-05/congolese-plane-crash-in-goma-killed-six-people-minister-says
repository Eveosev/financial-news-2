Six people died when an airplane
crashed in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo yesterday while
attempting to land during a rainstorm in the eastern city of
Goma, Transport Minister Justin Kalumba said.  The three passengers on the Compagnie Africaine d’Aviation
Fokker 50 survived, while six employees of the airline perished
when the plane landed in an empty plot a few minutes from the
airport, he said today by phone from Kinshasa, the capital.  “What’s certain is they didn’t send a distress signal so
they didn’t seem to have a technical problem,” Kalumba said.
Investigators from the ministry flew to Goma early today to
retrieve the plane’s black box, he said.  Congolese airlines, including CAA, are banned from flying
within  Europe . In November 2009, a CAA plane with the provincial
governor on board overshot the runway in Goma, injuring several
people. CAA flies to 34 destinations in Congo, according to its
website.  In April 2008, a Hewa Bora Airways plane crashed on takeoff
in Goma, killing 37 people on the ground and three on the plane.
Three years later, at least 83 people were killed when a Hewa
Bora aircraft crashed in the city of Kisangani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
