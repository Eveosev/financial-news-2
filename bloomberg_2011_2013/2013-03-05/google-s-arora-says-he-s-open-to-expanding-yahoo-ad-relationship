Google Inc. (GOOG) , which provides some
Internet advertising services to Web-portal Yahoo! Inc., is
interested in expanding the relationship, Google Senior Vice
President  Nikesh Arora  said.  The two companies signed an agreement in February for so-
called contextual ads, which use content on Web pages to show
related listings. The promotions are based on Google’s AdSense
and AdMob services.  Google, operator of the world’s most popular search engine,
could also possibly work with Yahoo on search-based advertising,
Arora said at a Deutsche Bank AG media and telecommunications
conference in Palm Beach, Florida.  An alliance between the two could affect Yahoo’s 10-year
search-ad deal with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Google in 2008 scrapped a
search partnership with Yahoo after the U.S. government
threatened to challenge the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
