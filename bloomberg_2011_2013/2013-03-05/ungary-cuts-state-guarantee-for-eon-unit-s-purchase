Hungary  cut its state guarantee for
the purchase of EON SE’s local natural-gas businesses, according
to a budget amendment lawmakers approved today.  The state will guarantee 80 percent of the price Magyar
Villamos Muvek Zrt., Hungary’s state-owned electricity company,
will pay for EON’s Hungarian gas trade and storage companies,
according to the  legislation , posted on Parliament’s website.  The guarantee is valid for as much as 256 billion forint
($1.12 billion), compared with the earlier pledge for as much as
875 million euros ($1.14 billion) plus an additional 90 billion
forint for inventories. MVM will also have to pay a monthly fee
of 0.12 percent of the 256 billion-forint guarantee, or 307
million forint, for the duration of the guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
