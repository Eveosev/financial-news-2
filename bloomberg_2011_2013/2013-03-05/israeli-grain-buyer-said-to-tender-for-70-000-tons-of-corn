 Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, is seeking 70,000 metric tons of corn,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the tender.  The company is seeking a 30,000-ton cargo and a 40,000-ton
shipment of corn on behalf of its customers for delivery between
April 10 and June 15, depending on the origin, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the tender hasnâ€™t been
publicly announced. The bids are due by March 7 for grain from
 Europe , the Black Sea region and  South America , they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
