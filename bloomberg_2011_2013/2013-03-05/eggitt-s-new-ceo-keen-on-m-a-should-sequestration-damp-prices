Meggitt Plc (MGGT) , the largest provider of
wheels and brakes for military aircraft, said it’s ready to make
purchases following any decline in the price of aerospace assets
that may result from looming U.S. cuts in the  defense budget .  Meggitt would be comfortable spending more than 500 million
pounds ($760 million) on a transaction, Stephen Young, the
Christchurch, England-based company’s incoming chief executive
officer, said today in a telephone interview.  “If we could find a suitable acquisition at the right price
then we would do that,” said Young, who is currently chief
financial officer. “There were some silly prices paid in 2012.”  Meggitt boosted pretax profit 12 percent to 362.8 million
pounds last year, spurred by record output at Airbus SAS and
 Boeing Co. (BA)  and the $685 million purchase of Pacific Scientific
Aerospace, a maker of generators and electric motors, in 2011.
Net debt fell 19 percent to 642.5 million pounds 2012, helping
to pave the way for future acquisitions.  Meggitt rose as much as 4.6 percent are was trading up 3.4
percent at 474.70 pence as of 10:36 a.m. in London. The stock
gained 24 percent this year for a value of 3.7 billion pounds.  “We would tend to buy capabilities and the product would go
on both civil and military aircraft,” said Young, who takes over
as CEO from Terry Twigger on May 1.  U.S. spending reductions effective March 1 will trim sales
by about 2 percent this year, Meggitt said. Excluding the impact
on defense markets of the across-the-board budget cuts, known as
sequestration, and any takeovers, the company envisages “mid-
single-digit” sales growth. Revenue rose 10 percent last year.  To deal with the military slowdown, Meggitt will shift
personnel to satisfy growing commercial demand, holding off on
hirings that its civil activities would otherwise warrant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
