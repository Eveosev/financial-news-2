Italy’s bonds advanced for the first
time in three days after European Union finance ministers opened
the way for looser budget policies that may support growth.  German 10-year bunds fell as euro-area retail sales
increased in January more than economists predicted, sapping
demand for the safest assets. Portugal’s 10-year yields dropped
to the least in more than a month after EU Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn , in Brussels for a meeting of the
bloc’s finance ministers, said the country and Ireland may get
more time to repay bailout loans. Global stocks and commodities
rallied on bets central banks will continue stimulus measures.  “There’s a more general risk-on sentiment today” driving
Italian yields lower, said  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income
strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in  London . “Bunds are weak as well.
It could be that this meeting is also having some impact,” she
said of the finance ministers’ gathering.  Italy’s 10-year yields fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 4.73 percent at 4:51 p.m. London time after
sliding 16 basis points, the steepest decline since Feb. 25. The
5.5 percent security maturing in November 2022 gained 1.155, or
11.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,302) face amount, to 106.325.  The EU is considering easier repayment terms for rescue
loans to Ireland and  Portugal  in a bid to ease their exit from
aid programs, Rehn said. The nations say they deserve
concessions similar to those granted to  Greece  last year.  Economic Strains  The yield on the Portuguese 4.95 percent securities due
October 2023 fell 23 basis points to 6.16 percent, after being
as low as 6.13 percent, the least since Feb. 1. Rates on Irish
debt due October 2020 fell seven basis points to 3.76 percent.
The yield has fallen from 4.43 percent on Dec. 31.  Volatility on  Sweden ’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Portugal, according to measures of
10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit-default swaps.  Economic strains in the euro area “may also justify in a
certain number of cases reviewing deadlines for the correction
of excessive deficits,” Rehn told reporters late yesterday.  Leaders “do not want to add austerity to recession,”
French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said. The euro-area
economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013, making for the first
annual back-to-back contraction since the currency’s
introduction in 1999, the European Commission said last month.  Spanish Bonds  Spanish 10-year bonds advanced for a fifth day, leaving the
yield six basis points lower at 5.04 percent.  The extra yield, or spread, that investors get for holding
 Spain ’s 10-year debt instead of bunds slipped nine basis points
to 359 basis points. The spread has narrowed from 412 basis
points on Feb. 26, which was the most since Dec. 12.  The gap may narrow to 250 basis points as swings in prices
ease, Carlos Egea, a strategist on Morgan Stanley’s peripheral
sovereign and bank trading desk, said at a Euromoney Bond
Investors Congress today in London, where he’s also based. It is
“hard to know” if that will take three, six or 12 months, he
said.  “It’s risk-on with regard to peripheral bond markets,”
Christian Eckert, head of European fixed income at Lazard Asset
Management, which oversees the equivalent of $9.7 billion, said
at the conference. Buying bonds of the so-called peripheral
nations is a “compelling” trade, Cosimo Marasciulo, head of
 government bonds  and currencies at Pioneer Investment Management
Ltd., added.  Retail Sales  German 10-year bund yields added three basis points to 1.45
percent, rising from as little as 1.39 percent yesterday, the
least since Jan. 2. Two-year note yields rose two basis points
to 0.06 percent.  Retail sales  in the 17-nation currency bloc gained 1.2
percent from December, when they slipped a revised 0.9 percent,
the EU’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The median
prediction of analysts in a  Bloomberg News survey  was for a 0.3
percent gain.  Belgium ’s 10-year bonds snapped five days of gains as the
country’s finance minister resigned, pushing the yield up by two
basis points to 2.30 percent. The nation sold 3.1 billion euros
of bills due in 105 and 161 days today.  Steven Vanackere quit after 15 months on the job, saying he
was the target of “unjustified insinuations and malicious
accusations” over his role in a transaction involving state-
owned Belfius Bank and a workers’ organization. He will be
succeeded by Koen Geens, a lawyer and director at BNP Paribas
Fortis SA, the Belgian Royal Palace said.  Italian bonds handed investors a loss of 1 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities returned 2.9 percent, while German
bunds fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
