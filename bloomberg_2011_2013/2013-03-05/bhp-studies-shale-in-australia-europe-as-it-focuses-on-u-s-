BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, is studying shale formations in
 Australia ,  Europe  and  South America  as it remains focused on
developing onshore assets in the U.S.  “We’re clearly going to be very studious in Australia and
we’re going to be very studious in Europe,” BHP Billiton
Petroleum Chief Executive Officer Michael Yeager said in an
interview at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston today.  In time, “You’ll see us start to take land positions and
you’ll start to see us possibly do some things” related to
those resources, Yeager said, though he emphasized that the
company is moving cautiously as it concentrates most of its
firepower on U.S. opportunities.  BHP has 45 rigs working in the onshore U.S., including 31
in the Eagle Ford, eight in the Permian Basin and six in the
Haynesville and Fayetteville gas areas, Yeager said. The
company’s U.S. work is focused on liquids output, though he said
BHP would like to do more with its natural gas fields if prices
rise.  “There is no big desire to go get more,” Yeager said.
“We got more than we can say grace over right now,” he said,
adding that BHP will remain “forward-thinking.”  BHP may look to sell its Liverpool Bay venture in the U.K.
as the project ages, and has been in touch with possible buyers,
Yeager said. The company isn’t looking to sell a big asset such
as its exploration and production properties in  Pakistan  at this
point, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
