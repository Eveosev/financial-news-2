California  gained a positive credit
outlook following a voter-backed tax boost, an improving economy
and previous budget cuts that helped to stabilize its finances
after years of shortfalls,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Fitch changed the state’s outlook to positive from stable
yesterday, ahead of California’s sale of $2.7 billion of bonds
beginning March 12. The move means the rating company may raise
the state’s score, currently A-, or seventh-highest.  The positive outlook followed a boost for California’s
credit rating by Standard & Poor’s on Jan. 31. S&P raised the
state’s grade one step to A, its sixth-highest level. It was the
first increase since 2006 and followed Governor  Jerry Brown ’s
budget proposal that he said would leave California with a
surplus for the first time in almost a decade. He persuaded
voters in November to temporarily lift income and sales taxes.  “All credit to the legislature and governor, who have
forsaken the tooth fairy for fiscal discipline and honest,
structurally sound budgets, and to the people for their wisdom”
in passing the tax measure in November, said  Tom Dresslar ,
spokesman for California Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
