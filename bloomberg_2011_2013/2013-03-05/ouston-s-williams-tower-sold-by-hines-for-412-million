An  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ)  unit purchased
Williams Tower in Houston for $412 million as office sales
increase in the city amid a boom in U.S. oil production.  Invesco Advisers Inc. bought the 64-story building and an
adjacent parking garage in Houston’s Galleria/West Loop area,
the seller, Hines Real Estate Investment Trust Inc., said today
in a regulatory filing. The Houston-based REIT purchased the 1.4
million-square-foot (130,000-square-meter) tower in 2008 for
$271.5 million, and its net proceeds on the March 1 sale were
$228.4 million after transaction costs, Hines said.  Office sales  in Houston increased 32 percent last year to
almost $3.89 billion as 104 properties changed hands, according
to data from Real Capital Analytics Inc. Deal volume in the
energy hub outpaced the 21 percent gain for total U.S. office
sales, the New York-based research firm said.  U.S. oil production last year grew by a record 766,000
barrels a day to 6.41 million barrels on average, the highest
level in 15 years, government data show. The 14 percent advance
was the biggest annual gain since the industry began
domestically in  Pennsylvania  in 1859, according to the
 Department of Energy .  Williams Tower is 95 percent leased, with tenants including
Rowan Cos., Quanta Services and Cadence Bancorp, Hines said
today in a separate statement. Designed by architects  Philip
Johnson  and John Burgee, the  tower  is covered in silver-colored
reflective glass and topped by a 7,000-watt revolving beacon.
Hines developed the building in 1983 and uses it as its
corporate headquarters.  The tower “has been a great investment that delivered
strong cash flows and a positive return to Hines REIT,” Chief
Executive Officer Charles Hazen said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
