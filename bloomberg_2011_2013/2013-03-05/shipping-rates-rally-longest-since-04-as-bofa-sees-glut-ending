Shipping rates for Panamax vessels
hauling grains rallied for the longest in more than eight years
and Bank of America Corp. said a fleet glut that decimated
earnings is diminishing.  Rates for the biggest vessels to navigate the Panama Canal
gained 2.1 percent to $8,637 a day, the 20th consecutive
increase, according to prices today from the  Baltic Exchange , a
London-based publisher of freight costs on more than 50 maritime
routes. That was the longest streak since a run of 21 advances
through Oct. 29, 2004.  Earnings for iron ore-carrying Capesize ships plunged 98
percent since rising to a record in 2008 after owners added the
most capacity in history, according to data from the exchange
and  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker. Fleet growth
peaked in 2011 while gains in coal and iron ore demand, along
with improving South American grain harvests, will help to boost
usage of vessels, Bank of America analysts led by  Francisco Blanch  in  New York , said in a report today.  “We see a major shift in the sector next year, as demand
growth once again outpaces fleet capacity additions and the
oversupply in the market begins to shrink,” the analysts wrote.
A more sustained rally will probably only happen in 2015 because
of the surplus, they said.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , the exchange’s widest gauge of
commodity freight costs, averaged 920 last year, its lowest
since 1986.  The measure today climbed 2.5 percent to 789, its highest
since Jan. 24, lifted by gains in all four of the main vessel
classes it tracks. Rates for Capesizes added 1.2 percent to
$4,262, the biggest gain in almost a month, ending 17 days of
declines.  Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller than Panamaxes, gained
2.1 percent to $8,554. Handysizes, the smallest ships in the
index, increased 2.6 percent to $6,956, the highest level for
the vessels since Jan. 29, figures from the bourse showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
