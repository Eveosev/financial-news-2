The euro rose for a second day
against the dollar after a report showed a gauge of
manufacturing and services in the 17-nation region contracted
less than economists forecast in February.  Europe’s shared currency appreciated versus most of its 16
major peers as Italian bonds rose after European finance
ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday said some nations may be
able to loosen targets for the reduction of their deficits.
Australia’s currency climbed for the first time in four days as
the  Reserve Bank  kept  interest rates  on hold and China said it
will boost fiscal spending by 10 percent this year.  The euro climbed 0.4 percent to $1.3072 as of 9:12 a.m.
London time. It was little changed at 121.72 yen, after earlier
dropping as much as 0.5 percent. Japan’s currency appreciated
0.4 percent to 93.12 per dollar. The so-called Aussie rallied
0.4 percent to $1.0241.  A  composite gauge  of euro-area services and manufacturing
output was 47.9 in February, versus 48.6 in January, London-
based Markit Economics said in a report today. Analysts had
forecast a drop to 47.3, according to the median in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
