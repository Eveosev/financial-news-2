China ’s plans to build
infrastructure and houses will increase demand for ships hauling
dry-bulk raw materials, according to Arctic Securities ASA.  The Oslo-based investment bank will probably raise its
estimates for demand growth because of announcements at the
National People’s Congress, analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said
in an e-mailed report today.  The world’s most populous country will build 100 port
berths, 80,000 kilometers (49,720 miles) of highways and 5,200
kilometers of railroads in 2013, the National Development and
Reform Commission said. The authority also said China will boost
supply of midsize and small houses, which Stavseth said is
important for steel demand.  “The data is staggering in size and clearly a positive in
supporting demand for steel and ultimately dry-bulk
commodities,” Stavseth said in the report. “We find China’s
comments today supportive of decent dry-bulk demand growth to
the extent that we will revisit and likely upgrade our demand
expectations in the next dry-bulk update.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
