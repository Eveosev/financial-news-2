OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, climbed the most in almost a month as Magyar Hirlap
reported the government may consider cutting banking taxes.  The shares rose 3.1 percent, the most since Feb. 8, to
4,803 forint by the close in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock
 index  strengthened 1.2 percent.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s Cabinet, which has imposed
extra taxes on financial, energy and telecommunication companies
since taking power in 2010, may consider cutting levies on banks
once the economy emerges from recession, the newspaper reported,
citing an interview with Mihaly Varga, who Orban nominated on
March 1 to become economy minister.  Varga’s comments “could have some positive impact on the
sentiment,” Marta Czajkowska-Baldyga, a Warsaw-based analyst at
 KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in an e-mailed report today. “We expect
consensus to be cautious to incorporating any changes to the
banking tax assumptions.”  Orban first introduced special industry taxes as temporary
crisis measures, before making the banking levy permanent and
imposed an additional charge on financial transactions last year
in an effort to cut the  budget deficit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
