A case of Chateau Pontet-Canet 2003
fifth-growth Pauillac sold for 760 pounds ($1,140) a case on
the London-based Liv-ex wine market, the highest level on the
exchange for three months, according to data on Liv-exâ€™s Cellar
Watch website.  The vintage traded as high as 960 pounds a case in August
2011, at the height of the market for top Bordeaux wines, and
fell as low as 700 pounds in January 2012 before starting to
recover, according to Cellar Watch data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
