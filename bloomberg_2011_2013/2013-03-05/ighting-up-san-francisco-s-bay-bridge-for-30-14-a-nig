It’s the world’s largest LED art
project on the Bay area’s other iconic bridge.  “Bay Lights” consists of 25,000 LED lights on the western
span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Artist Leo
Villareal controls the display through his personal computer. He
flips the switch tonight.  “The idea is to augment these iconic structures which are
already here and kind of the symbols of the Bay area, by adding
another layer to them of light controlled by software,”
Villareal told Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg West,” airing
today at 6 p.m. New York time.  The $8 million project is funded entirely by private
donations from some of the biggest names in technology,
including  Marissa Mayer , chief executive officer of  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) ,
and Marc Pincus, CEO and chairman of  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)   “I live and work in the city, my office overlooks the
bridge,” said project supporter Jean-Pierre Conte, chairman of
Genstar Capital LLC. “When in your life are you going to have
an opportunity to take a major traffic artery, beautiful bridge
and turn it into a world class art installation?”  The artwork spans almost 2 miles in length, requiring some
100,000 feet of cable for power. The energy bill for the two-
year project is expected to run $30.14 a night.  To contact the reporters on this story:
