Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR)  Chief Executive
Officer  Terry Smith  said the interdealer broker has found no
indications that employees were involved in rigging global
benchmark interest rates.  “We found no evidence that any of our staff had taken part
in manipulation, or in endeavours to manipulate” the London
interbank offered rate, Smith said in a telephone interview
today, citing the results of the firm’s internal probe. The
company hasn’t been told by regulators that it or any of its
employees are under investigation, Smith said.  Interdealer brokers, the middlemen who line up buyers and
sellers of securities for banks, are emerging as key enablers in
the Libor scandal after Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, UBS AG
and Barclays Plc paid total fines of $2.6 billion for rigging
 interest rates . The settlements highlighted numerous instances
where brokers passed on traders’ requests for certain rates and
took payments for doing so.  Employees at ICAP Plc, the world’s biggest interdealer
broker, and RP Martin Group Ltd., a smaller British competitor,
are being probed over their alleged involvement in rate-rigging,
three people with knowledge of the matter said last month.  The Financial Times reported on Feb. 15 that one of London-
based Tullett’s brokers agreed to relay requests from a UBS
derivatives trader asking employees at other banks to make
favourable submissions to Libor.  “We can’t find anything to suggest that we were liable,”
Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
