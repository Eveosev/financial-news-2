     March 5 (Bloomberg) --  Paddy Power Plc (PAP) , Ireland’s largest
bookmaker, increased the most in more than two months in Dublin
trading after posting a record pre-tax profit last year and
saying it had a “strong” start to the year.  Paddy Power gained as much as 3 percent in intraday trading
to 66 euros,  the most  since Dec. 20, after the Dublin-based
bookmaker said pre-tax profit increased 15 percent to 139.2
million euros ($181.4 million) last year. Total net revenue in
first two months of the year on a constant currency basis rose
34 percent from the year-earlier period, the company said today.  Goodbody Stockbrokers’s analyst Gavin Kelleher said in a
note today the Dublin-based broker will likely increase its
full-year estimate for the company's 2013 earnings per share 
by 4 percent. Paddy Power continues to have “significant 
growth potential in the medium term,” he said.  Paddy Power is boosting profit by increasing its number of
active online customers, with three-quarters of profit last year
coming from online.   The stock has climbed 5.3 percent this year, giving the
bookmaker a market valuation of 3.2 billion euros. Trading in
the stock was 1.5 times the three-month average at about 162,000
shares in Dublin today.   Paddy Power traded 1.73 euros, or 2.7 percent, higher at
65.83 euros as of 11:10 a.m. in Dublin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
