Iron ore  fell the most in seven
weeks as cargoes increased after a storm caused little damage in
 Australia , the largest supplier of the steelmaking commodity.  Imported ore with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese
port of Tianjin slid 2.4 percent to $145.20 a dry metric ton
today, the biggest decline since Jan. 16, according to The Steel
Index Ltd. The global benchmark retreated 8.6 percent from a 16-
month high on Feb. 20 after rallying as much as 83 percent from
an almost-three-year low in September.  Australia’s  Port Hedland , home to the world’s biggest bulk
export terminal, escaped with minor damage from Severe Tropical
Cyclone Rusty last week. Steelmakers in  China , the largest
importer of iron ore, are drawing on stockpiles rather than
buying new supplies, according to Ben Goggin, a swaps broker at
ICAP Plc in London.  “There are more cargoes out of Australia now that the
storm passed,” Goggin said by e-mail. “Buyers don’t seem
interested, as they are trading port stocks instead. The swaps
aren’t responding today because they fell so much yesterday, so
it was priced in.”  April contracts rose 1.1 percent to $137 a ton as of 12:10
p.m. in London, according to GFI Group Inc. The swaps fell 4.8
percent yesterday, according to data from SGX AsiaClear.  Stockpiles at 25 Chinese ports dropped 0.9 percent to 76.9
million tons from the end of the Feb. 26-March 1 period, Xinhua
News Agency cited one of its price reports as saying today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
