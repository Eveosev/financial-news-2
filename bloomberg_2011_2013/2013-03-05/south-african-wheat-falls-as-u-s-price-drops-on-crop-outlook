South African wheat futures declined
for the first time in five days after the price of the grain in
the U.S. dropped as snowfall in that country boosted harvesting
prospects.  Wheat for delivery in May, the most active contract, fell
1.7 percent to 3,424 rand ($376) a metric ton, the most in a
week, by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The grain lost 2.5 percent to $7.04 a bushel in
 Chicago  yesterday, erasing four days of gains.  “There was good snowfall in the biggest wheat-planting
area of the U.S.,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar
Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. “Prospects
for the wheat harvest in the U.S. have improved.”  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after Ethiopia. The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
