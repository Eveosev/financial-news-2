Canadian  stocks  rose, as financial
companies and energy producers rallied, after investors
speculated central banks will continue stimulus measures and oil
ended a three-day losing streak.  Bank of Nova Scotia  rose 0.7 percent after  Canada ’s third-
largest bank posted better-than-estimated earnings and boosted
its dividend. Encana Corp. and Cenovus Energy Inc. added at
least 1 percent. WestJet Airlines Ltd. climbed 4.3 percent to a
record after saying February traffic and capacity increased.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 28.63
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,736.04 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark index has gained 2.4 percent this year. Trading was in
line with the 30-day average.  Efforts to bolster economic growth are “providing a
positive backdrop, in that while the Fed and other central banks
might not provide additional stimulus, they’re certainly not
going to take their foot off the gas pedal,” Philip Petursson,
managing director of the portfolio advisory group with Manulife
Asset Management Ltd., said from Toronto. His firm manages about
$238 billion.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said yesterday
the U.S. central bank should press on with $85 billion in
monthly bond buying while tracking possible costs and risks from
the unprecedented program. U.S. stocks jumped today, sending the
Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close of 14,253.77.  Banks Rally  Canadian financial companies rallied 0.4 percent as a
group, contributing the most to the S&P/TSX index’s gains, as
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  climbed 42 Canadian cents to C$61.32. The
stock rose to a record earlier in the day, adding as much as 1.5
percent after the lender’s first-quarter per-share earnings of
C$1.27 beat the C$1.25 average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Scotiabank joined  Royal Bank of Canada  and Toronto-Dominion
Bank in posting higher quarterly profit, even as Canada’s
economic growth began to stagnate on record levels of household
debt. Royal Bank added 0.2 percent to C$63.76 and Toronto-
Dominion rose 0.5 percent to C$85.43. Both banks reported their
results last week.  Energy producers advanced 0.3 percent after oil climbed
from its lowest level in 2013 and China vowed to maintain its
growth target. Encana increased 21 Canadian cents to C$18.23 and
Cenovus rose 31 Canadian cents to C$32.13.  China Growth  China  retained an expansion goal of 7.5 percent for this
year and plans a 10 percent increase in fiscal spending to
support economic growth, the government said. “It gives
confidence to the market that there’s a growth commitment on
that side of the world, and that’s being felt over here,”
Petursson said. Oil climbed 0.8 percent to settle at $90.82 a
barrel in New York.  Raw-material producers advanced 0.1 percent as a group
after rallying as much as 1.7 percent earlier. Teck Resources
added 0.9 percent to C$30.53. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
gained 0.5 percent to C$40.43.  WestJet surged 98 Canadian cents to a record C$24.05. The
Calgary-based discount carrier said February traffic climbed 7.3
percent and capacity rose 3.1 percent.  TMX Group Ltd., the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, is
considering more acquisitions to expand its business, Chief
Executive Officer  Thomas Kloet  said. “We are not standing
still,” he said. “We will acquire, when appropriate and
strategic, key assets -- both small and large -- that advance
our business.”  TMX has expanded through acquisitions since Kloet joined
the company as CEO in 2008, most recently agreeing to buy Equity
Financial Holdings Inc.’s transfer agent and corporate trust
services business. TMX rose 1.1 percent to C$55.86 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
