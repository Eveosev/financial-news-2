  H.J. Heinz Co. (HNZ)  Chief Executive
Officer  Bill Johnson  could receive more than $200 million should
he exit after  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital Inc. buy the ketchup maker.  Johnson, 64, would get “Golden Parachute Compensation”
including $56 million in cash, equity, bonuses and other
benefits, the Pittsburgh-based company said in a  regulatory
filing . Other shares under Johnson’s control are worth almost
$100 million, while his vested deferred compensation account
totals $57 million.  Johnson, who became Heinz’s sixth CEO in 1998, has made
about  40 acquisitions , helping expand the company into  emerging
markets . He streamlined the brand portfolio, boosted spending on
marketing and ratcheted up innovation, including Dip & Squeeze
ketchup packs. Heinz boosted sales to $11.7 billion in fiscal
2012, a gain of 8.8 percent from the year before.  “The payments reflect Mr. Johnson’s success in creating
billions of dollars in shareholder value over his successful 15-
year tenure as President and CEO,”  Michael Mullen , a Heinz
spokesman, said by e-mail. “This compensation consists of
equity that Mr. Johnson accumulated over his 30-year career with
Heinz and existing equity awards and contractual rights that
were in place well before the announcement of the proposed
merger.”  Berkshire and 3G will pay $72.50 a share for Heinz, about
20 percent more than the $60.48 closing price Feb. 13, before
the deal was announced. The company’s existing debt will be
rolled over, valuing the transaction at $28 billion, according
to a previous statement.  ‘Too Young’  Heinz was little changed at $72.48 at the close in New
York.  Johnson’s total compensation in the fiscal year ended in
March was $16.2 million, including $1.3 million of salary.  After announcing the deal Feb. 14, Buffett told CNBC he
hoped Johnson would remain CEO. In a conference call after the
deal was announced, Johnson said he was “way too young” to
retire. Still, Buffett told CNBC that 3G has the final say.  Johnson worked at Ralston, Frito-Lay and Anderson-Clayton
Foods before joining Heinz in 1982 as a general manager of new
business. In 1988, as head of the poorly performing Heinz  Pet
Products (MHAS) , he revived the business. Four years later he did the
same thing at Starkist Foods. Johnson was named president and
chief operating officer in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
