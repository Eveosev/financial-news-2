The pound extended an advance versus
the dollar after a gauge of U.K. services activity expanded more
than analysts forecast last month.  Sterling advanced 0.5 percent to $1.5194 at 9:41 a.m.
London time. It strengthened 0.3 percent to 85.94 pence per
euro.  U.K. 10-year government bonds extended their decline, with
the yield climbing six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 1.97 percent.  A gauge of services activity was at 51.8, from 51.5 in
January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The median of
29 analysts forecasts in a Bloomberg survey was for a reading of
51.0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
