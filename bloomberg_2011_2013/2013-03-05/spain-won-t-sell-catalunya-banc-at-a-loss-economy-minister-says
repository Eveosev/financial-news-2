Spain won’t sell nationalized lender
Catalunya Banc SA at a loss because it’s now a solvent bank,
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said.  “There is no question of selling such institutions at a
loss,” de Guindos told reporters in Brussels today. Spain’s
bank rescue fund, known as FROB, said last night in an e-mailed
statement that it had suspended a planned sale of the bank.  Spain has taken about 40 billion euros ($52 billion) of
European aid to bail out lenders including Barcelona-based
Catalunya Banc, which was nationalized in 2011. FROB said in its
statement that it had time to find the best option for dealing
with the lender that would minimize the cost to the taxpayer
because the sale deadline set by the European Commission is the
end of 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
