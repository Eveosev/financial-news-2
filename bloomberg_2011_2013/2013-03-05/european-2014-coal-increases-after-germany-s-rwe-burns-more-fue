European coal for next year
increased from a record low after  Germany ’s second-largest
utility reported that its power stations in  Europe  emitted more
carbon dioxide last year amid higher coal burn.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp gained 0.1 percent to $96.20 a metric ton as of 3:50
p.m. London time, after falling to $95.90, the lowest level
since the contract started trading in January 2010, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  RWE AG (RWE)  emitted 11 percent more carbon last year than in
2011 as output from plants fueled by hard coal and lignite
increased, the utility said in its  annual report  published
today. Coal-fired plants in Germany were earning 7.82 euros
($10.20) a megawatt-hour for next-year power as of 5 p.m. Berlin
time, while gas-fired plants were losing 14.83 euros a megawatt-
hour, according to calculations based on coal, power, gas and
emissions prices.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
