John Wood Group Plc (WG/) , a U.K. oil
services provider active in  Africa  and the  Middle East , said
profit climbed 43 percent last year as demand rose.  Profit before tax and exceptional items climbed to $362.7
million from $254.1 million a year earlier, the Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company said today in a statement. It raised the
dividend 26 percent to 17 cents a share and said market
conditions are “expected to remain favorable.”  Brent crude prices have more than doubled since the start
of 2009 and remain above $100 a barrel, bolstering demand for
services to help extract more oil from the ground. The company,
which operates in 50 countries, said the pace of expansion may
slow this year after lifting earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization by 35 percent in 2012.  “We’re probably looking at EBITA growth of around 15
percent this year,” said Chief Executive Officer Bob Keiller on
a conference call. “We’re not expecting the trajectory of the
last two years to continue, but we do see strong growth
prospects driven by strong fundamentals.”  Wood Group shares rose 7.9 percent in  London , the most in
two years, to 818 pence, giving the company a market value of
3.1 billion pounds ($4.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
