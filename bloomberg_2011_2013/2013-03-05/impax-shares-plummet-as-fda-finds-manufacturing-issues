Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL) , the
developer of the experimental drug Rytary for  Parkinson’s
disease , fell the most in almost three years after regulators
found that manufacturing issues persist at a company plant.  Impax declined 25 percent to $15.03 at 11:03 a.m. New York
time, after falling to $14.88 in the biggest intraday drop since
May 2010. The plant in Hayward, California, where the company is
based, is barred by the  Food and Drug Administration  from
producing new drugs.  FDA inspectors found 12 “observations” in their most
recent inspection of the facility, including three repeat
manufacturing problems that have not corrected since past
inspections, Impax said yesterday in a statement. The FDA and
Impax have been at odds over the plant since at least 2010,
according to government  letters  to the company.  “We have committed significant resources in our efforts to
meet FDA requirements and are clearly disappointed by this
news,” Impax Chief Executive Officer Larry Hsu said in the
statement. “Resolving the FDA concerns remains a top priority
and we intend to complete this work as quickly as possible.”  The FDA required the re-inspection after rejecting Rytary
in January. If the drug is approved, Impax will sell Rytary in
the U.S. and Taiwan while London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc, will
market it in other regions throughout the world.  Rytary combines standard Parkinson’s medications in a new
sustained release formulation, Impax said. The company also has
manufacturing facilities in Philadelphia and Taiwan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
