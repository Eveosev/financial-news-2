Diagnosticos da America SA , the
Brazilian medical-diagnostics company known as Dasa, fell the
most since July after reporting its first net loss since 2010.  Shares slumped 5.5 percent to 12.30 reais, or $6.26, at the
close of trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day drop since
July 25.  Brazil ’s benchmark  Bovespa index  slid 1 percent.  Dasa surprised analysts forecasting an eighth consecutive
quarterly profit by posting a 1.4 million reais ($712,758)
adjusted net loss for the last three months of 2012. Sales
slumped 19 percent to 547.4 million reais in the fourth quarter,
falling short of the 552 million reais average of seven
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Dasa’s results were “weak and below expectations,” Thiago Macruz, an analyst at Itau BBA, wrote in a note to clients dated
today. “The big miss this quarter will likely lead the market
to revisit expectations for 2013, probably leading to some
downward earnings revision.”  Shares of the medical-diagnostics company have declined 6.7
percent this year, while the Bovespa is down 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
