Raghuram Rajan, chief economic
adviser in  India ’s Finance Ministry, spoke to reporters about
the nation’s economy in Pune today.  On the current-account deficit:  “You have to focus more on financing the current-account
deficit because reducing it will take time. The best way is to
increase exports relative to imports. The problem is, that is
also dependent on growth in foreign countries.  ‘‘My sense is the world economy will over the year start
strengthening, so long as there are no surprises from  Europe . We
are seeing signs that things are stabilizing on the export
front.’’  On economic growth bottoming out:  ‘‘Some of the signs suggest it may have, but you can’t be
sure.’’  On food inflation:  ‘‘Milk inflation has come down relative to the past because
milk production has been strong. But cereal inflation has taken
off. The rabi crop looks like it’s going to be good. That might
bring down cereal prices.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
