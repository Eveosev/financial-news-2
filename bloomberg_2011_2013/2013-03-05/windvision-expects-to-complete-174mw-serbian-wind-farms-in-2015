WindVision Operations Ltd ., a Dutch-
Belgian renewable energy developer and supplier, expects its 174
megawatt project in  Serbia  to come on line in 2015.  Work on two wind farms of 99 megawatts and 75 megawatts
near Alibunar in northeastern Serbia is to begin by the end of
the year at an estimated cost of 290 million euros ($377
million), including a power line and a substation, WindVision’s
Serbian manager, Danilo Drndarski, said in a phone interview
yesterday.  A total of 58 turbines of 3 megawatts each will be
connected to the grid gradually, as of the second half of 2014,
he said. The farms’ projected output is 430,000 megawatt hours a
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
