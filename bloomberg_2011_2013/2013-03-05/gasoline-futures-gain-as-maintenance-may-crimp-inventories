Heating oil rose for the first time
in seven days, advancing from the lowest settlement since Dec.
10 as it rebounded from technical support levels.  Futures gained 1.6 percent. Heating oil climbed above the
lower Bollinger Band for the first time since Feb. 25, signaling
chart support where buy orders may be clustered. This indicator
is around $2.9004 a gallon today. The  crack spread  versus Brent
crude widened for the first time in nine days.  “We had been oversold,” said Mark Anderle, a trader at
Truman Arnold Cos. in Dallas. “We got below the lower Bollinger
band. We bounced off support. It could be a temporary bounce to
cure an oversold position.”  Heating oil for March delivery gained 4.56 cents to $2.9647
a gallon at 1:49 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
spread versus Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe exchange in London
widened 70 cents to $13.21 a barrel.  Futures traded below the 200-day moving average of $2.9875
for the fifth consecutive day.  “The key test is if we get back above the 200-day,”
Anderle said. “If not, this looks like just a reaction to an
oversold condition.  Gasoline advanced on speculation that seasonal maintenance
may have limited production and reduced supplies last week.  ‘‘We’ve got a lot of maintenance coming up and I think
refinery utilization will be down a little bit,’’ said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably fell 1 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg. Supplies of distillates, including diesel
and heating oil, probably also declined 1 million barrels, the
survey showed. The Energy Department is scheduled to report last
week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  April-delivery gasoline advanced 3.66 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.1349 a gallon a gallon. The April  crack spread ,
or premium for gasoline over West Texas Intermediate crude,
widened 74 cents to $40.75 a barrel. The  spread  versus Brent
increased 26 cents to $20.30.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.9 cent to
$3.737 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the sixth
consecutive drop. Prices, which have risen 14 percent this year,
are 3 cents below a year earlier. Prices in 2012 peaked on April
4 at $3.936 after rising every day but one from March 9.  ‘‘Gas prices have increased for the month of March for nine
years in a row, so it is still too early to say whether or not
we have peaked,’’ Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA in
Washington, said in an interview. ‘‘There is still refinery
maintenance to be completed and much of the country must
transition to summer-grade gasoline, which costs more to
produce.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
