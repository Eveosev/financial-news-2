Foreign investors cut their holdings
of Australian  government securities  to the lowest level in
almost two years, as an improving global outlook damped demand
for the safety of the top-rated debt.  Offshore holdings were equal to 70 percent of total
outstanding debt as of Dec. 31, the least since March 2011,
according to government data compiled by Bloomberg. Non-
residents owned A$207 billion ($211.2 billion) of  government
bonds  and bills, down from A$208.3 billion at the end of the
third quarter, the first decrease since the period ended June
2008. Total outstanding debt rose to A$295.8 billion from
A$287.5 billion.  “Better growth and better credit conditions probably mean
investors looked to diversify from government bonds to other
higher-yielding assets,” said  Tony Morriss , head of interest-
rate research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
Sydney. “There’s no doubt the fourth-quarter percentage of debt
held offshore has fallen, but it doesn’t feel like wholesale
profit-taking. Overseas ownership in Australia still remains at
very high levels.”  Foreign holdings of sovereign notes with maturities longer
than a year fell to A$200.1 billion from A$202.7 billion on
Sept. 30. The ratio of overseas ownership fell to 72.9 percent
from 74.6 percent. Over the same period, Australian government
bonds handed investors a 0.6 percent loss, the biggest slide
since the three months ended December 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  A gauge tracking debt by state borrowers was little changed
in the fourth quarter, while corporate securities climbed 2
percent, the Bank of America figures show.  Yields Climbing  Australia ’s benchmark  10-year yield  has risen this year by
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.30 percent
today. The yield climbed 29 basis points in the three months
ended Dec. 31, having touched an all-time low of 2.698 percent
on June 4.  The Australian dollar has fallen 1.9 percent in 2013 to
$1.0202 as of 1:59 p.m. in Sydney as demand from abroad for the
South Pacific nation’s debt eased. The so-called Aussie dollar
climbed 1.8 percent in 2012 and reached $1.1081 on July 27,
2011, the highest since exchange-rate controls were scrapped in
1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
