Foreign investors boosted their
holdings of South Korean bonds and stocks to an all-time high in
February, with Chinese funds taking up a record amount of shares.  Ownership of local-currency debt rose by 3.5 trillion won
($3.2 billion), the biggest monthly increase since October 2010,
to 93.7 trillion won, according to an e-mailed statement from
the  Financial Supervisory Service  today.  Stock holdings 
increased by 1.5 trillion won to 421.2 trillion won.  Prospects for appreciation in the won and the possibility
of an interest-rate cut by the central bank drove the bond
purchases, the FSS said in a statement. The currency climbed 0.5
percent in February, the second-best performance among Asia’s 11
most-traded exchange rates. It reached 1,076.23 per dollar on
Feb. 20, the strongest level since Jan. 25, and traded at
1,087.04 late yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chinese investors bought a net 1.2 trillion won of South
Korean equities, the report shows. Norwegian funds were net
buyers for a third month, led by government entities.  The benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock index gained 3.3 percent in
February after dropping 1.8 percent in January. It has since
declined 0.5 percent to 2,016.61 yesterday.  The Bank of  Korea  kept its benchmark  policy rate  at 2.75
percent in February, after cutting it in October. The central
bank next meets on March 14.  The yield on the government’s three-year bonds declined 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 2.63 percent last
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
