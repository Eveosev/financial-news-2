China ’s smartphone makers are
“heavily dependent” on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android mobile operating
system, hampering the development of the domestic industry,
according a  white paper  from a government research institute.  Android’s core technology is strictly controlled by Google,
and Chinese businesses face commercial discrimination, including
delays in sharing code, according to a document dated in
February from the China Academy of Telecommunication Research,
under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  New market entrants will encounter substantial obstacles,
the institute said. China has more than 300 local Android-
handset manufacturers, accounting for 97.7 percent of
domestically produced smartphones, the report said.  Google  offers  its mobile operating system for free in order
to promote the use of its software and build platform for mobile
advertising. This lets device manufacturers “customize and
offer new user experiences,” said Christopher Katsaros, a
spokesman for Google.  “Android is an open-source mobile platform freely
available to everyone,” Katsaros said.  Worldwide, Android dominates the smartphone market with
about 70 percent of shipments, followed by Apple Inc.’s iOS and
BlackBerry’s operating system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
