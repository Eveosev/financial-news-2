Chile’s peso advanced for the first
time in four days on speculation  Europe  will bolster stimulus
and data showing that the Andean nation’s economy grew faster
than forecast.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 472.81 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago, extending its gain in the past three
months to 1.4 percent. Copper, the country’s biggest export,
rallied 0.5 percent to $3.5175 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  European finance ministers opened the way to looser budget
policies after a backlash against austerity in Italy and France.
Chilean  economic activity  expanded 6.7 percent in the 12 months
through January, beating economists’ estimates for the sixth
straight month.  “The activity data came out and there are expectations of
greater stimulus in developed economies, so everything indicates
the dollar could fall a little more,” said Ronald Volpi, the
head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago.  Copper, which makes up 50 percent of  Chile ’s exports, rose
after  China ’s government announced it would keep its economic
growth target unchanged from 2012 at 7.5 percent. China, the
biggest buyer of Chile’s copper, plans to open more than 5,200
kilometers (3,231 miles) of new railroad lines and build 80,000
kilometers of highways, the National Development and Reform
Commission said today.  International investors in the forwards market increased
net bets against the peso to $2.9 billion on March 1, the most
since Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
