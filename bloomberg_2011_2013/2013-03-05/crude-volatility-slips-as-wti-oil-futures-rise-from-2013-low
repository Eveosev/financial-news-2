Crude options volatility slid for
the first time in three days as oil futures climbed from the
lowest level this year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 19.91 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 22.81 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery rose 70
cents to settle at $90.82 a barrel on the Nymex, a day after
falling to the lowest level since Dec. 24. Oilâ€™s gain was part
of a broad commodities rally after the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  touched a record 14,286.37.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $88 puts, which declined 35 cents to 36 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,226 contracts at 3:45 p.m. in  New York . April $82
puts were the second-most active with 2,079 lots. They slipped 7
cents to 2 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading
volume. In the previous session, puts made up 57 percent of the
110,016 contracts traded.  April $85 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,281 contracts changing hands. They were
unchanged at 25 cents a barrel. April $87 puts rose 2 cents to
50 cents on 5,194 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
35,946 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,207 and June
$90 puts at 31,572.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
