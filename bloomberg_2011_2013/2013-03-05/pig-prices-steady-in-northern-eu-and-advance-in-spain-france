Pig prices were steady in the north
of the European Union and advanced in Spain and  France , industry
group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands
e.V. reported.  Hog prices in Germany, the EU’s biggest pork producer, were
unchanged in the past week at 1.626 euros a kilogram (97 cents a
pound), and prices in Denmark also were steady at 1.63 euros a
kilogram, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report 
today. Prices climbed for a fifth straight week in Spain and
France, to 1.814 euros a kilogram and 1.632 euros a kilogram,
respectively. The two countries are the EU’s second- and third-
largest pork producers.  “The European pigs-mature-for-slaughter market appears in
a stable condition again this week,” ISN wrote. “After German
slaughter companies flexed their muscles last week, naming
discounted prices, calm is being restored now. Demand and supply
are said to be well-balanced.”  Dutch, Belgian, Austrian and Irish pig prices were
unchanged from the previous week, while prices advanced in the
U.K. and declined in  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
