Officer  Thomas Kloet  said the Toronto Stock Exchange owner is
considering more acqusitions to expand its business.  “We are not standing still,” Kloet said, according to the

“We will acquire, when appropriate and strategic, key assets --
both small and large. -- that advance our business.”  TMX has expanded through acquisitions since Kloet joined
the company as CEO in 2008. TMX added Canadian exchange owner
Alpha Group and clearinghouse Canadian Depository for Securities

week to a partnership that combines data pools and creates
indexes that track C$1 trillion of bonds. The new provider will
be called FTSE TMX Debt Capital Markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
