Ideal (IDEALB1) , the construction-financing
firm controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , aims to raise as
much as 10 billion pesos ($785 million) through a debt
instrument that will also give investors cash from toll roads.  The structured notes, which would pay a fixed rate, would
be used to raise money for new projects, the company told
analysts on a conference call last week. In addition to the
interest, investors would get a percentage of the residual cash
flow from four toll roads operated by Ideal, whose name stands
for Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en America Latina SAB.  The funding would position Slim’s company to take advantage
when President Enrique Pena Nieto’s government begins accepting
bids for new infrastructure development over the next year. The
toll-road money will give investors an equity-like vehicle to
invest in Ideal, which has put aside for now a plan to issue
more stock to improve the liquidity of its shares.  Ideal shares  rose  less than 1 percent to 28.30 pesos
yesterday in  Mexico  City, where it’s based. The shares have
gained 19 percent this year, while the benchmark IPC index has
risen less than 1 percent.  The company will file the paperwork for the structured
notes with Mexico’s National Banking and Securities Commission
in the next four to six weeks, so the details of the plans could
change. A company official declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
