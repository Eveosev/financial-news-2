Serbia’s second-largest trade union
agreed to a 20 percent wage cut at the country’s sole steel
plant, which the government wants to restart more than a year
after it bought it back from  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)   The Association of Free and Independent Trade Unions
accepted a proposal to save on wages as part of efforts to
jumpstart production at state-run Zelezara Smederevo, it said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said last week Zelezara
would restart one of its two furnaces by the end of March, after
a sales tender expired without attracting any bids. Serbia has
been looking for a buyer since January 2012 when U.S. Steel sold
Zelezara back to the government for $1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
