Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.
may sell as much as 40 percent of Deutsche Annington Immobilien
AG in an initial public offering slated for 2013 as part of a
plan to end its investment in the property company.  “It’s probably going to take us two years to fully exit,”
 Guy Hands , Terra Firma’s founder, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s Cristina Alesci. “You would probably do
an initial public offering of say 30, 40 percent, so you’ve
still got the vast majority of the shares to be sold.”  Deutsche Annington,  Germany ’s largest residential landlord,
owns 186,000 apartments that were valued at 9.9 billion euros in
its  2011 annual report . The company had about 6.7 billion euros
of debt at the time. In January, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised
about 1.3 billion euros in an IPO of LEG Immobilien AG, making
it the largest listed residential landlord by market value.  “Let’s not focus on what we get on day one,” Hands said
in the interview. “If one does that, one could be a little bit
more relaxed on timing, but it might well mean that you end up
selling less than you would have hoped and you would sell it at
a lower price than you would have hoped.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will manage
Deutsche Annington’s share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
