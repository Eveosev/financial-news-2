Slovenia’s central bank called on
Premier-designate Alenka Bratusek to form a government that will
continue with plans to recapitalize banks and pull the  economy 
out of its second recession since 2009.  Bratusek should continue with fiscal and financial
stabilization as the central bank will “strongly support expert
solutions to rebuild the banking system,” the  Banka Slovenije 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The new government should accelerate measures to boost
the economy, including the restructuring of companies and lower
their financial leverage,” the bank said in the statement.  Slovenia, which adopted the euro six years ago, is mired in
a deepening banking crisis and a recession as Bratusek seeks to
forge a new coalition that would replace the minority Cabinet of
Janez Jansa, who was ousted in a vote in parliament Feb. 27.
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., the biggest lender, reported a 2012
loss of 275 million euros ($358 million) on surging bad-loan
reserves. It was its fourth consecutive annual loss.  Gross domestic product in the Adriatic nation shrank 3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a year earlier after
a 3.3 percent contraction in the previous three-month period.
GDP fell 2.3 percent last year.  The latest available data “point to a strong decline in
economic activity this year,” the central bank said today.  Bratusek has until mid-March to form a new government and
have it approved by parliament, or early elections will be held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
