AS Tallinna Kaubamaja (TKM1T)  rose the most
in 13 months in Tallinn trading following a proposal by
Estonia’s largest listed retailer to pay an unchanged dividend
of 35 euro cents to its shareholders.  The stock gained 24 euro cents, or as much as 4.1 percent,
the biggest increase since February 2012. It traded 2.9 percent
higher at 6.05 euros at 12:05 p.m. in Tallinn, implying a
dividend yield of 5.8 percent. Kaubamaja shares have gained 10.4
percent this year, compared with a 7.8 percent gain for its
regional consumer staples peers, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kaubamaja said yesterday it would pay out 14.3 million
euros, the same as in 2012, on last year’s net income of 20.9
million euros, according to company proposals to its
 shareholders’ meeting , to be held on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
