Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  said
about 50 percent of its Zimbabwean unit’s mining claims would be
seized by the nation’s government.  Implats and its  Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM)  unit “are taking
legal advice in order to protect their rights and, in addition,
remain in consultation with the relevant government
authorities,” the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today.  The Zimbabwe government intends to “compulsorily acquire
27,948 hectares (69,061 acres) of land from the company to be
used for the benefit of the public,” according to a decree in
the March 1 Government Gazette.  Impala, which owned 87 percent of Zimplats and is the
world’s biggest producer of the metal after  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , signed the terms to sell 51 percent of the unit
to the country’s black citizens in January. Mines Minister  Obert
Mpofu  said on Feb. 12 the nation had seized some of Zimplats’
land and would offer it to new investors.  Zimbabwe has the largest known platinum and chrome reserves
after South Africa.  Implats gained 2.2 percent to 134.96 rand by 11:36 a.m. in
Johannesburg. The stock has declined 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
