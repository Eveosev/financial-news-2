A stock listing for China’s  Cnooc
Ltd. (883)  on the Toronto Stock Exchange is “a good thing” for
Canadian capital markets,  TMX Group Ltd. (X)  Chief Executive Officer
 Thomas Kloet  said.  Cnooc, the state-owned Chinese company that bought Calgary-
based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  for $15.1 billion last week, made a commitment
to the Canadian government that it would list shares in Canada
after the purchase. Zhong Hua, Cnooc’s chief financial officer,
told reporters in Calgary on Feb. 27 that Cnooc was about to
file to list in Toronto.  “It’s an important global company active in the energy
markets, and it strengthens our franchise,” Kloet told
reporters today after a luncheon speech in Toronto. “It’s a
good thing for the capital markets.”  TMX, the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, may benefit
from Cnooc’s addition by getting listing fees and an increase in
trading, Kloet said. Nexen was delisted last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
