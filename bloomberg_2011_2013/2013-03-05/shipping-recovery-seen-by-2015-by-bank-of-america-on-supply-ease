Hire costs for the global fleet of
dry-bulk vessels will show a “meaningful increase” by 2015 as
demand for seaborne commodities expands amid slowing fleet
growth, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  “We see a major shift in the sector next year, as demand
growth once again outpaces fleet capacity additions and the
oversupply in the market starts to shrink. Yet, due to the
magnitude of excess  supply  over demand, we believe a sustained
recovery in bulk freight prices will take longer to
materialize,” the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based investment
bank said in a note e-mailed today.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity freight costs,
averaged its lowest since 1986 last year. Dry bulk fleet growth
peaked in 2011 and depressed hire costs now at levels below
operating costs for the biggest vessels, the bank said. The
index used to be a pulse-taker of the global business cycle
until the recession of 2008 and 2009, according to the report.  “High domestic iron-ore production costs in  China  will
encourage imports, which are increasingly being sourced from
farther away,” the bank said. “Shipping demand should also
find support on rising coal demand in China and  India , improving
harvests in  Latin America  and a cyclical recovery in minor bulks
trade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
