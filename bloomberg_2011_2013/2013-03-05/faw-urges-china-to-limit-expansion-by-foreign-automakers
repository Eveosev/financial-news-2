China should order foreign
automakers to contribute more to develop local brands and limit
those whose sole aim is to win more sales in the country,
according to China FAW Group Corp.  The government should also strictly enforce current rules
against foreign automakers having more than two local partners
to maintain market order, said Li Weidou, who heads FAW’s export
and import business. He made the comments in a speech at the
annual meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference, the nation’s top advisory body, in Beijing,
according to a transcript provided by the company.  Chinese automakers have been urging the government to take
more steps to protect homegrown companies, which are facing
intensifying competition from foreign manufacturers expanding in
the world’s largest vehicle market. China FAW Group, based in
the northeastern city of Changchun, has joint ventures with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  and  General
Motors Co. (GM)   The combined market share for Chinese sedans and compact
cars fell to a four-year low of 28.4 percent in 2012, according
to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
