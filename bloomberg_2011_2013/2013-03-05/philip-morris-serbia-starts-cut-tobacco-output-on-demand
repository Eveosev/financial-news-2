Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) 
started producing cut tobacco in  Serbia  to respond to changing
habits of consumers who seek cheaper alternatives following
cigarette price increases.  The cut tobacco is “a growing phenomenon in Serbia” and
Philip Morris’ unit in Serbia will be the first factory in
Europe,  Middle East  and Africa and the “fourth manufacturing
facility that we have in the world to produce cut tobacco,”
outgoing managing director Paul Riley said in Belgrade today.  “We just added 120 people in the factory to manufacture
cut tobacco,” Riley told reporters. “Economic conditions
change the markets somewhat” and in Slovenia the cut tobacco
market has gone up to 8 percent from three percent in 12 months.  An increase in the sales tax and excise duties last
October, designed to beef up state revenue and narrow the budget
gap, has created demand for “cheaper tobacco products in order
to make savings in the personal budget,” deputy managing
director Jelena Pavlovic said at the same news conference.  A can of tobacco will retail at 420 dinars ($4.92) and it
can produce an equivalent of six packs of cigarettes “which
means that a pack would cost 70 dinars compared with the
cheapest pack of cigarettes of 135 dinars,” Pavlovic said.  Riley will be replaced by Stacey Kennedy, the company’s
vice president for sales strategy, who will move from
 Switzerland  to manage  Philip Morris ’ operations in Serbia and
Montenegro and oversee the entire Balkans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
