Jon Stewart  will take a 12-week
summer break from hosting Comedy Central’s “ Daily Show ” to
produce “Rosewater,” a film based on a book by Maziar Bahari.  Contributor John Oliver will host the show for eight weeks
and four weeks will be reruns, Comedy Central spokesman Steve Albani said today in an interview. The show has won Emmy awards
in the variety, music and comedy category annually since 2001,
according to the Internet Movie Database.  Bahari, a BBC journalist who covered Iran’s elections in
2009, was arrested and accused of spying, in part because of an
appearance he made on the “Daily Show,” according to Deadline
Hollywood, which reported the project earlier today. After his
release, Bahari wrote of his captivity and interrogation in
“Then They Came For Me: A Family’s Story Of Love, Captivity And
Survival.”  The movie is being produced by Stewart and Scott Rudin,
along with Gigi Pritzker, whose OddLot Entertainment is
financing the project, according to Deadline Hollywood.  Comedy Central parent  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , a media company
controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , gained 1.9 percent to
$60.69 at the close in New York. Class B shares of the New York-
based company have risen 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
