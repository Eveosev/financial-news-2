Australia ’s current-account  deficit 
unexpectedly narrowed in the three months through December on
increased iron ore exports.  The shortfall on goods, services and investment was A$14.68
billion ($15 billion) from a revised A$15.05 billion in the
third quarter, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney today.
The median  estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of 21 economists
was for a A$15.3 billion gap. Net exports added 0.6 percentage
point to gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter,
the bureau said today. Economists forecast a 0.5 point addition.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens reduced
the benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points from
November 2011 to December 2012 to stimulate industries outside
of resources as commodity prices ease. A high currency has hurt
earnings for manufacturers and retailers, helping create what
the RBA has referred to as a multispeed economy with those
industries lagging behind mining.  The  net-income deficit  narrowed to A$8.83 billion in the
fourth quarter from the July-September period, today’s report
showed. The goods and services trade balance recorded a A$5.55
billion deficit in the fourth quarter compared with a A$5.39
billion shortfall three months earlier.  The current account is the broadest measure of trade
because it includes investment flows as well as goods and
services shipments. A deficit represents money Australia has to
borrow overseas to pay for the goods and services it imports and
to finance investment not covered by local savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
