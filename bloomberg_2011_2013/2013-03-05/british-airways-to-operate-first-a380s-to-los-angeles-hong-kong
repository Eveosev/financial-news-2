British Airways said it will operate
its first  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A380 superjumbo to  Los Angeles , with the
second plane serving  Hong Kong .  Tickets went on sale today for flights to  California  from
Oct. 15 and the Asian city starting Nov. 15, the International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA unit said in a statement.  British Airways is due to receive the first of 12 A380s in
July, with deliveries progressing through 2016. The inaugural
trips may come earlier than the dates given today, depending on
when preliminaries are completed, the London-based carrier said.  “A380 enthusiasts eager to be on the very first commercial
services should note that dates for these will be announced once
plans for training flights are completed,” the carrier said.  British Airways (IAG)  has opted for a lower A380 seating density
than some competitors as it seeks to maximize premium bookings,
offering 469 seats in a four-class layout. Germany’s  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s operates A380s with 526 berths, while  Air
France (AF) ’s planes can accommodate 516 passengers.  BA will become the 10th A380 operator and the only new
customer this year as Airbus targets 25 deliveries globally.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, BA’s parent
company, said today that passenger traffic -- or the number of
people carried times the distance flown -- fell 2.4 percent last
month as workers at Spanish unit Iberia staged a five-day strike
aimed at averting more than 3,000 job cuts.  Traffic at Madrid-based Iberia slumped 21 percent, compared
with a year earlier, contrasting with a 5.3 percent advance at
British Airways. Economy-class travel declined 2.9 percent
overall, while premium bookings gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
