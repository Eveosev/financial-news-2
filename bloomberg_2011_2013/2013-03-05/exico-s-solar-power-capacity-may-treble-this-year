Mexico ’s photovoltaic capacity could
treble this year driven by the richest households and the first
large-scale plants, according to the head of its solar lobbying
group.  Solar installations will at least double to 60 megawatts
from 30 megawatts operating now and may treble if state-owned
utility Comision Federal de Electricidad calls a tender for more
capacity this year, Alvaro Lenz-Herrera, president of the
 Asociacion Nacional de Energia Solar , said in an interview. CFE
has been planning a bidding process for 30 megawatts in large-
scale solar parks in  Baja California  since 2012, he said.  Mexico wants to increase solar-power generation to help
reach its 2026 renewable-energy target of 35 percent of power
generation from clean sources. The country offers tax incentives
for solar projects and a so-called net metering system, as well
as the possibility of long-term power purchase deals with CFE.  Capacity will be boosted by falling panel prices and low
system costs, which are about 20 percent cheaper than projects
in the U.S, according to the ANES president. Growth will
accelerate in 2014 and 2015, he said.  Most installations so far are off-grid or residential,
built through rural electrification programs and households that
don’t qualify for subsidized power rates, respectively. Only
three utility-scale solar parks currently operate with about one
megawatt each, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  The 500,000 residential users that pay the highest rate for
electricity are a key market for solar energy, Lenz-Herrera
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
