JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is expanding
its business in  Argentina  as the country remains a ``key'' market
in the region, the bank’s senior country officer said.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is leasing an additional
three floors in its headquarters in Buenos Aires and hiring
about 15 people this year, Facundo Gomez Minujin said. The New
York-based bank has operated its local investment unit in
Argentina since 1985, according to its website.  ‘‘Argentina remains a key element of our JPMorgan franchise
in Latin America,” Gomez Minujin wrote in an e-mail. “In the
last 12 months we have increased our headcount.”  JPMorgan is expanding in South America’s second-largest
economy even as competitors have cut staff and closed divisions
amid a tightening of currency controls and financial oversight
by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government.
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  closed its wealth management office in Buenos Aires
in January 2012 “for strategic reasons” while Exotix, a
brokerage, last year transferred some staff to New York and
 London  due to regulations.  Gomez Minujin denied a report published today from Buenos
Aires-based newspaper Clarin that the bank was leaving the
country by the end of the month.  “We’re maintaining our presence Argentina just like we
always have,” he said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
