General Electric Co. (GE)  and the
Sakhalin authorities agreed to develop power projects including
gas turbines, coal gasification and  wind energy  as Russia’s
largest island seeks to meet future demand.  GE, the maker of jet engines, locomotives and wind
turbines, will develop projects on the island off Russia’s east
coast with local power companies using GE equipment, the
Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said today in a statement.  “A reliable local supply of electricity is critical to the
future economic growth of this region and to the quality of life
of our citizens,” Sergey Hotochkin, Sakhalin’s deputy prime
minister, said in the statement.  As part of the accord, GE and Sakhalin’s provincial
government will develop the 60-megawatt Nogliki project using
two so-called aeroderivative gas turbines, or turbines derived
from  jet engines , according to GE. The company also won a 16-
year service contract extension worth $333 million for the
Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project, according to a separate
statement released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
