Demand for palm oil, the world’s
most used vegetable oil, is poised to rebound as the worst
losing streak in almost seven years spurs record buying by
refiners in  India , according to  Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. (RSI)   India’s imports may increase 12 percent to 8.5 million
metric tons in the year that started Nov. 1 from 7.6 million
tons a year earlier, Dinesh Shahra, managing director of the
Mumbai-based Ruchi, said in an interview. The country is the
world’s biggest palm importer and Ruchi is the largest buyer and
refiner. Purchases in the quarter ended Jan. 31 surged 28
percent to 2.26 million tons.  Palm, used in foods, biofuels and cosmetics, tumbled for
eight straight days through March 1, the longest run since March
2006, on concern that  supplies  will exceed demand. Stockpiles in
 Indonesia  may drop this year as a significant increase in demand
outstrips record supplies, according to Derom Bangun, chairman
of the nation’s palm board. The excess supply widened  soybean
oil ’s premium over palm to $331.34 a ton today compared with a
five-year average of $183 a ton.  “All incremental demand goes to palm oil as it is very
competitive compared to other soft oils,” Shahra said. “The
current prices are attractive for demand.”  The contract for May delivery traded 0.4 percent lower at
2,403 ringgit ($775) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange
at 5:29 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost 26 percent in
the past year, falling to a three-year low of 2,217 ringgit on
Dec. 13.  Export Taxes  Inventories in Malaysia jumped to an all-time high of 2.63
million tons in December, before falling to 2.58 million tons
last month, according to the  palm oil  board. The country allowed
duty-free shipments in January and February, before setting a
4.5 percent tax in March as futures rallied. Indonesia raised
its tax to 10.5 percent this month from 9 percent.  India imposed a 2.5 percent tax on unprocessed oils in
January to protect domestic growers and have doubled the
benchmark price to calculate the tariff to $849 a ton.  “Palm oil is the cheapest oil in India and regular imports
are happening now, and in summer palm consumption also grows,”
Ruchi’s Shahra said. “Import duty is only 2.5 percent on crude
palm oil and demand has already adjusted to the prices.”  Vegetable  oil imports , including those for industrial use,
jumped 75 percent to 1.16 million tons in January and purchases
last month probably exceeded 1 million tons, according to the
Solvent Extractors’ Association of India. Purchases will
probably reach a record 10.5 million tons to 10.7 million tons
in 2012-2013, B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association,
said in an interview in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  India meets more than 50 percent of its cooking oil demand
through imports of mostly palm from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Brazil and  Argentina . Purchases of cooking oils
will climb 5 percent to 10.7 million tons from 9.98 million tons
year ago, Shahra said.  Consumption in India will expand 6 percent to 17.5 million
tons this year due to rising population and disposable incomes,
according to Mehta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
