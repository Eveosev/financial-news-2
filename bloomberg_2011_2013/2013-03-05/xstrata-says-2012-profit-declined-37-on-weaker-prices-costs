Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the Swiss mining
company whose $33 billion takeover by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) 
may be completed next month, said 2012 profit plunged 37 percent
because of weaker commodity prices and higher costs.  Net income, excluding exceptional items such as impairment
charges, fell to $3.65 billion from $5.79 billion a year
earlier, the Zug, Switzerland-based company said today in a
statement. That beat the $3.49 billion average estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales at the world’s largest
exporter of power-station coal slid 7 percent to $31.6 billion.  “The combined impact of falling commodity prices, ongoing
inflationary pressure on operating costs and continued strong
producer currencies relative to the  U.S. dollar  put pressure on
our margins,” Chief Executive Officer  Mick Davis  said in the
statement. Economic developments in  China  and the U.S. will
support commodity demand in 2013, he said.  The average price for power-station coal at  Australia ’s
Newcastle port, an Asian benchmark, dropped 19 percent to $90.65
a metric ton in 2012, according to McCloskey Group data and
copper slid 9.9 percent.  Xstrata shares rose 6.8 percent to 1,174 pence by the close
in London, the steepest gain since Sept. 14. The 21-member FTSE
350 Mining Index rose 3.5 percent.  Glencore in January won approval from South Africa’s
antitrust regulator for its takeover of Xstrata, leaving Chinese
agreement as the sole outstanding requirement for the deal. The
Baar, Switzerland-based commodities trader today said that the
companies agreed to extend the deadline to complete the deal to
April 16.  Ball Rolling  “All eyes remain on merger completion to get the ball
rolling on cost cuts and capex reviews, where we feel there’s
scope for material upgrades to our forecast earnings and cash
flow,” London-based Liberum Capital Ltd. analysts said in a
note.  The full-year dividend rose 14 percent to 45.5 cents a
share. Xstrata reported $136 million in costs related to the
Glencore transaction.  Net income plunged to $1.18 billion from $5.7 billion,
mainly because of impairment charges from its investments and
operations. Xstrata wrote down $840 million of its stake in
platinum producer  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , it said in the statement. It also
wrote down $978 million from the valuation on the Brunswick zinc
mine in  Canada , the Cosmos nickel mine in Australia and its
Eland operations.  Debt Ratio  The Swiss mining company spent $10.3 billion on expansions
last year. Net debt rose to $14.7 billion in 2012 from $8.15
billion, helping to push the ratio of net debt to net debt plus
equity to 24 percent from 15 percent a year earlier, Xstrata
said.  Thermal coal production last year rose 7.2 percent to 90.4
million tons, while copper output declined 16 percent to 747,042
tons because of the transition from older mines to new ones and
expansions, Xstrata said last month.  Xstrata, the fourth-largest producer of copper, began
output at its $1.5 billion Antapaccay project in southern  Peru 
in November. The mine will produce an average of 160,000 tons of
copper annually in the first five years. The company is seeking
to boost overall  production  by 50 percent through 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
