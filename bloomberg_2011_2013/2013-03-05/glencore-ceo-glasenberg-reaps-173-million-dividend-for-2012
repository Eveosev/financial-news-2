Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive
officer and largest shareholder of  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ,
will reap a higher dividend of $173 million for 2012, even after
the commodities trader reported a drop in profit.  Glencore will distribute a final dividend of 10.35 cents a
share on top of its first-half award of 5.4 cents, the Baar,
Switzerland-based company said in a statement today. That’s 5
percent more than its 2011 payout and reflects “our confidence
in our business and the continued ramp-up of our brown-field
industrial assets,” the trader said today.  Glencore, which is seeking to complete a takeover of
Xstrata Plc by April 16, paid out $1.07 billion in dividends
last year. The final dividend announced today, totaling $735
million, is subject to approval by investors and due to be paid
in June. Glasenberg’s 16 percent stake is valued at about $6.3
billion.  The 56-year-old former accountant turned coal trader has
worked at Glencore, the largest publicly traded commodities
supplier, since 1984, and became CEO in 2002. He received about
$163 million in dividends for 2011 when the payout was 15 cents
a share. He said at the time he planned to reinvest the final
dividend in company stock.  Glasenberg today said he hadn’t decided on what he’ll do
with this year’s dividend.  Glencore Billionaires  After a $10 billion initial public offering of 2011
Glencore’s directors and employees owned about 83.1 percent of
the group. The listing also made billionaires of directors
Daniel Mate, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and  Alex Beard . The
largest shareholders are subject to conditions requiring them to
hold their stock for varying periods, according to the IPO
prospectus.  Glencore intends to maintain or increase its total dividend
every year as part of a progressive dividend policy, the company
says on its  website .  The company today reported a 25 percent slump in 2012
profit as slowing global economic growth eroded demand for raw
materials. Net income excluding “significant items” dropped to
$3.06 billion, it said. That compared with the $3.14 billion
estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
