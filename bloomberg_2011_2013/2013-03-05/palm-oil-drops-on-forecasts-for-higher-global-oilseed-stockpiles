Palm oil  fell on speculation that
rising global oilseed stockpiles may curb demand for the
tropical oil, expanding inventories in top producers.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 2,395 ringgit ($772) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,400
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures tumbled 6.6 percent last week.  Global palm oil inventories will gain to a record 7.203
million tons this season, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Dorab Mistry, a director at Godrej International
Ltd., who’s due to address an industry conference in Kuala
Lumpur tomorrow, has said palm’s outlook is bearish this year as
global oilseed production increases, including soybean harvests
in the Americas.  “There is an expectation in the market that when
production picks up palm oil stockpiles will again climb to a
record, maybe in May,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at
LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur .  Inventories probably contracted 5.4 percent in February
from a month earlier, the steepest drop since April, to 2.44
million tons, the median of estimates from two plantation
companies and six analysts showed. Stockpiles, which reached a
record 2.63 million tons in December, stood at 2.58 million tons
in January. Futures have tumbled 26 percent in the past year as
global supply reached a record.  “Trade in palm oil is going to hinge on the price
forecasts from key industry speakers such as Dorab Mistry
tomorrow,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.,
said by phone from  Singapore .  Soybeans for May delivery was little changed at $14.6325 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for May was at
50.30 cents a pound from 50.26 cents yesterday.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September was little
changed at 6,648  yuan  ($1,067) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month was also
little changed at 8,334 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
