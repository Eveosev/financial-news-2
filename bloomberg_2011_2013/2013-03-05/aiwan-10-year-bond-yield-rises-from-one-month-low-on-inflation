Taiwan’s government bonds fell, with
the 10-year yield rising from a one-month low, as a report
showed consumer prices rose more than analysts estimated. The
local dollar strengthened.  Annual  inflation  was 2.97 percent in February, compared
with the median estimate of 2.8 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey and a revised 1.13 percent in January, official data
showed today. The Chinese New Year holiday, which typically
drives up food costs, was in February this year and January in
2012. Stock indexes advanced across  Asia  today as investors bet
central banks across the world will continue stimulus measures
to boost their economies.  “There’s a jump in the CPI index, but it’s probably due to
seasonally adjusted factors,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income
trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Traders reckoned
there wasn’t much room for yields to go much lower anymore.
Stocks are doing pretty good today.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 was
1.207 percent, compared with 1.201 yesterday, according to
Gretai Securities Market. Yesterday’s level was the lowest for a
benchmark 10-year note since Feb. 1.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.2 percent to NT$29.72 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.77 yesterday, the weakest level in almost six
months. One-month  non-deliverable forwards  rose 0.2 percent to
NT$29.65, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Bond Buying  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the U.S.
central bank should press on with $85 billion in monthly bond
buying while tracking possible costs and risks from the
unprecedented program. China maintained its economic-growth
target at 7.5 percent for 2013, while setting a lower inflation
goal of 3.5 percent, setting up a challenge for new leaders to
keep prices in check without harming expansion.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, dropped 16 basis points, 0.16 percentage point, to 4.69
percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at
0.388 percent, according to Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
