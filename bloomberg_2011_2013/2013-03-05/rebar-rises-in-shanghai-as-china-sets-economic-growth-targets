Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose for the first time in three days as the Chinese
government set its 2013 economic targets.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 0.5 percent to 3,924 yuan ($630) a
metric ton and traded at 3,907 yuan at 9:40 a.m. local time. The
most-active contract bounced back from the lowest close
yesterday since Dec. 27.  China maintained its economic-growth target at 7.5 percent
for this year while setting a lower inflation goal of 3.5
percent. Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday urged prolonging efforts
to rein in real-estate speculation, pushing rebar lower and
triggering the biggest decline in Chinese stocks in 18 months.  “The sharp pullback in prices will encourage some users to
buy rebar in preparation for the traditionally-strong demand
season ahead, as construction activity picks up along with
rising temperature in March,” said Zheng Ge, analyst at Wanda
Futures Co. in Beijing  The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed at
3,789  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate
delivery fell 1.2 percent to $148.80 a ton yesterday, according
to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
