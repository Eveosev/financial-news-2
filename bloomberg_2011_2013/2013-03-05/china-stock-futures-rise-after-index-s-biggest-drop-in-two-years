Chinese stocks  rebounded after the
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) ’s biggest drop in two years and as the government
pledged to increase fiscal spending to support economic growth.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. climbed 7.5 percent after
slumping the most since 2008 yesterday. Kangmei Pharmaceutical
Co. led a rally for drugmakers on the prospect of increased
health-care spending. During today’s start of the National
People’s Congress, the government announced it would keep its
economic growth target at 7.5 percent, unchanged from 2012,
while projecting a 10 percent jump in fiscal spending to fund
areas such as health care, agriculture and education.  The CSI 300 Index jumped 3 percent to 2,622.81 at the
close, while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 2.3 percent to
2,326.31. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 1
percent after sliding 2.1 percent yesterday.  “There’s expectation the new government will spend more
and introduce more reforms to focus on the health of the
people,” Zhang Gang, a strategist at Central China Securities
Holdings Co. in Shanghai, said by phone. “ Moreover, we fell
too much yesterday so there’s some buying back.”  The CSI 300 tumbled 4.6 percent yesterday, the most since
November 2010, after the government ordered more measures to
cool property prices and growth in the nation’s services
industries slowed. The gauge is up 4 percent for the year and
 trades  for 10.4 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
the MSCI Asia Pacific index’s 13.3 times, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The CSI 300 has rallied 24 percent since
the start of a bull-market rally on Dec. 3.  Congress Speech  The CSI 300  Financial Index (SZ399914)  climbed 5.1 percent after
tumbling 6.5 percent yesterday. Minsheng Banking rose to 10.20
yuan. Ping An Bank Co., which is scheduled to report earnings on
March 7, advanced 10 percent to 23.93 yuan.  Premier Wen Jiabao set an inflation goal of 3.5 percent for
this year in his final opening address to almost 3,000 lawmakers
at the annual meeting of the NPC. An annual expansion target of
8 percent was in place from 2005 to 2011. Last year’s inflation
goal was 4 percent. The economy expanded 7.8 percent last year,
the weakest pace since 1999.  A gauge of health-care stocks in the CSI 300 gained 3.1
percent. Kangmei advanced 4.4 percent to 17.53  yuan . Zhejiang
Medicine Co. jumped 6.3 percent to 23.19 yuan.  Fiscal spending is targeted to rise 10 percent to 13.8
trillion yuan, the  Ministry of Finance  said in a report
presented to the NPC. The government will ensure funding for key
areas such as agriculture, education, medical and health care,
social security, employment, government-subsidized housing and
public culture, it said.  Proactive Policies  The nation plans to run a budget deficit of 1.2 trillion
yuan in 2013, amounting to about 2 percent of gross domestic
product, the report said. Last year’s deficit was 800 billion
yuan. The 2 percent target signals a “proactive” fiscal
policy, Bank of America Corp.’s China economist Lu Ting wrote in
a note.  Chongqing Brewery Co. jumped 10 percent to 17.53 yuan after
trading for the first time since Feb. 25. Carlsberg A/S, which
already owns a 29.7 percent stake in the Chongqing municipality-
based brewer, will offer 20 yuan a share for a further 30
percent stake in the maker of Shancheng beer, it said yesterday.  A gauge of  developers  in the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5
percent after plunging 9.3 percent yesterday, the most since
June 2008. China Vanke Corp., the nation’s biggest developer,
advanced 0.5 percent to 10.89 yuan.  Property Concern  China will boost supply of medium, small-sized homes this
year and keep differentiated curbs, home mortgage and tax
policies, the National Development and Reform Commission said
today. The government will steadily curb speculative property
demand and gradually expand a property tax trial, it said.  A 6.9 percent slump by the CSI 300 Financial Index in the
past month is signaling the end to a bull-market rally as the
government takes steps to prevent asset bubbles. The cabinet on
March 1 ordered individuals selling properties to “strictly”
pay a 20 percent tax on profits from sales.  “The stock rally is over,” Zhou Binglin, a senior
economist at Guosen Securities Co. in Shenzhen, said March 1.
Banks and developers are “leading indicators,” with real
estate accounting for about 20 percent of the economy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
