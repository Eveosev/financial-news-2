Synthos SA (SNS) , the rubber maker
controlled by Polish billionaire Michal Solowow, surged to an
11-month high after proposing a record dividend.  The  stock  rose as much as 9.5 percent and traded 8.2
percent higher at 6.37 zloty as of 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
the highest since April. Synthos has been the best-performing
stock in the benchmark WIG20 Index  this year , adding 18 percent.  Management recommended a dividend of 0.76 zloty a share,
compared with  0.5 zloty  in 2012, the Oswiecim, Poland-based
company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The manufacturer
of synthetic rubber used for production of tires will return to
its owners a total of 1 billion zloty ($315 million) even as its
profit fell 39 percent to 586.3 million zloty last year.  The proposal is “a positive surprise” and “implies a
juicy yield of 12.9 percent on yesterday’s close,” Piotr Drozd,
a Warsaw-based analyst at Wood & Co., said in a note today. “An
average dividend-per-share of about 0.4 zloty could be
sustainable going forward.”  Synthos also announced a new dividend policy, saying its
payout may be higher than consolidated profit if  net debt 
doesn’t exceed earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda. If net debt is more than 2.5 times
Ebitda, management won’t recommend a dividend, it said.  Solowow,  Poland ’s third-richest man with fortune estimated
at $1.9 billion by the Polish edition of Forbes magazine, holds
a 62 percent  stake  in Synthos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
