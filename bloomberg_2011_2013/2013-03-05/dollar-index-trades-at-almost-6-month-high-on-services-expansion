The Dollar Index traded at almost
its highest level in six months as service industries in the
U.S. expanded in February at the fastest pace in a year, adding
to signs of economic acceleration.  The U.S. currency was supported after the Institute for
Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index exceeded forecasts,
fueling speculation the Federal Reserve may have scope to reduce
monetary stimulus earlier than projected. The yen erased losses
before the  Bank of Japan (8301)  convenes for a two-day meeting starting
tomorrow. Australia’s currency climbed versus the dollar as the
central bank kept interest rates on hold.  “ISM services were better than expected and markets are
higher,” Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist at Gain
Capital Group LLC in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The market is responding positively to the fundamentals. If
data improve, that reduces the likelihood of prolonged
quantitative easing, which would cause the dollar to
strengthen.”  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 93.29 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York, after decreasing as much as 0.6 percent, the biggest drop
in almost a week. The greenback declined 0.2 percent to $1.3052
per euro after falling as much as 0.4 percent. The yen was
little changed at 121.76 per euro.  Dollar Measure  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners,  fell  0.2 percent to 82.042. The gauge reached 82.509
on March 1, its highest level since Aug. 20.  The correlation between the Dollar Index and the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , which have showed an inverse relationship
since 2008, was negative 0.41 percent, after reaching the
closest to moving in the same direction since June 2011 on Jan.
31. The correlation reached negative 0.76 in February 2012.  The ISM  index  increased to 56 last month from 55.2 in
January, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Economists
projected the guage would be little changed at 55, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50
signal expansion.  The Swedish krona climbed to its strongest level in six
months versus the euro after Stockholm-based Swedbank said an
 index  based on responses from about 200 purchasing managers in
the services industry was a seasonally adjusted 54.6 in February
compared with a revised 52.6 the previous month.  Krona Strength  The krona appreciated 0.4 percent to 8.3265 per euro, after
reaching the strongest since Aug. 29, and gained 0.5 percent to
6.3798 per dollar.  South Korea’s won strengthened the most in a month as
exporters repatriated income following the currency’s biggest
loss since Feb. 1 yesterday. The currency rose 0.6 percent to
1,087.04 per dollar after adding as much as 0.7 percent, its
biggest increase since Feb. 4.  The Hungarian forint fell versus most of its 31 major
counterparts on speculation the country’s government will use
expanded powers at the central bank to deplete foreign-currency
reserves. It declined 0.3 percent to 228.33 per dollar after
weakening to 230.03, its lowest level since Sept. 6.  The yen weakened 11.3 percent in the past three months, the
worst performer among 10 developed market currencies measured by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. It has dropped amid
speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push to expand stimulus
will debase the currency. The prime minister’s nomination for
the next BOJ governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said yesterday the
central bank will do whatever is needed to end 15 years of
deflation.  Options Data  Options traders are the least bullish on the dollar versus
the yen since Nov. 14, according to 25-delta option risk
reversal rates. Traders are paying a 0.46 percent premium for
dollar calls, or the right to buy the greenback versus the
Japanese currency, relative to calls, which allow for purchases.
That is down from the 2012 high of 1.50 percent reached on Dec.
13.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said the yen
is likely to weaken to 100 per dollar on concern that stimulus
measures by the Bank of  Japan  will debase the currency.  “We’re going to see a lot of printing of yen,” Gross said
during an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers”
with  Erik Schatzker  and  Stephanie Ruhle . “You want to avoid the
currency that prints the most, that endorses quantitative easing
to the fullest extent.”  The yen is estimated to weaken to 95 to the greenback by
the end of the year, while the euro is forecast to be about
unchanged at $1.29, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The so-called Aussie rose from an almost eight-month low
reached yesterday after the Reserve Bank of  Australia  left its
overnight cash-rate unchanged at 3 percent.  The Aussie snapped a three-day decline versus the dollar,
gaining 0.6 percent to $1.0258. It dropped to $1.0115 yesterday,
the lowest since July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
