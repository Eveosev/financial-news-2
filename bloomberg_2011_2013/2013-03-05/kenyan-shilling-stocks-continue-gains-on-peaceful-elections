Kenya ’s shilling strengthened to its
strongest level in more than four months and stocks were poised
for a fourth day of gains after yesterday’s national elections
passed off peacefully.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy surged 1
percent to 85.15 per dollar by 10:29 a.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, heading for its strongest closing level since Oct. 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the Nairobi
Securities Exchange, 11 stocks gained, six declined and 44 were
trading unchanged.  “The shilling has strengthened a little bit due to the
fact that so far we remain peaceful despite the relatively slow
tallying of votes,” Raphael Agung, a senior trader at Nairobi-
based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.  Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta held an early lead of
54 percent in Kenya’s presidential election as his main rival,
Prime Minister Raila Odinga, had 41 percent of the vote with
results from about a third of the 31,982 polling stations
counted, according to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission’s  website .  The election was the first since a disputed vote five years
ago triggered violence in which more than 1,100 people died and
another 350,000 were forced to flee their homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
