Gold futures rose on speculation
that central banks will maintain stimulus measures, while
physical demand for the metal climbed. Silver also advanced.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said yesterday
that the U.S. central bank should press on with $85 billion in
monthly bond buying. Haruhiko Kuroda, the nominee to be the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  governor, said he would do whatever is needed to end 15
years of deflation. Gold purchases appear widespread across
Southeast Asia, Standard Bank Plc said today.  “Yellen’s statement and pro-stimulus chatter in  Japan  are
supporting gold,”  Bart Melek , the Toronto-based head of
commodity strategy at TD Securities, said in a telephone
interview. “Also, physical-related demand has picked up.”  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,574.90 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price gained as much as 0.9 percent.  The metal has dropped 6 percent this year. In February, the
commodity fell for the fifth straight month, the longest slump
since 1997, partly as investors shifted to  equities  for the
prospect of higher returns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose to a record today.  Last month, investors sold the most gold ever from
exchange-traded products. Assets as of yesterday at 2,500 metric
tons have dropped 5 percent from the Dec. 20 record, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 0.4 percent to
$28.604 an ounce on the Comex, the third straight gain. The
price has dropped 5.4 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery gained 1.2 percent to $1,585.70 an ounce. The
price dropped in the previous five sessions, the longest slump
since Dec. 24.  Palladium futures for June delivery jumped 2.8 percent to
$734.60 an ounce, the biggest increase for a most-active
contract since Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
