China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell the most in 13 months on speculation a government plan to
step up support for the economy will attract overseas capital,
boosting cash in the financial system.  The rate extended a decline from this year’s highest level
as outgoing Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in a report at the National
People’s Congress in Beijing that China’s budget deficit will
increase 50 percent as expenditure is bolstered to “maintain
support for economic growth.” The nation kept its expansion
target for 2013 at 7.5 percent, the same as last year. The
People’s Bank of China refrained from conducting money-market
operations today, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions.  “Capital inflows may be rising,” said Wang Huane, a
senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co in Jinan, capital of the
Shandong province. “Also, banks no longer need to hoard cash
after the month-end passed.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, slid 111 basis points, or 1.11 percentage
points, to 3.18 percent as of 10:03 a.m. in  Shanghai , according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center. That’s the biggest drop since Jan. 19, 2012.  The PBOC refrained from injecting or withdrawing cash from
the banking system today, after gauging demand yesterday for
seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase contracts, and 28-day
repurchase contracts. The central bank absorbed 915 billion  yuan 
($16.7 billion) from markets in the last two weeks.  Yuan Positions  Yuan  positions  at local banks accumulated from foreign-
exchange purchases rose 134.6 billion yuan in December, the
biggest addition in 11 months, according to central bank data.
The measure of capital inflows may have increased by 100 billion
yuan in January, the official China Securities Journal reported
last month.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, dropped one
basis point to 3.24 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.15 percent government bond due January
2018 dropped two basis points to 3.26 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
