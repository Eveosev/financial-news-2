Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy unveiled a revised anti-gun-trafficking measure
intended to draw more bipartisan support before his panel
considers a series of gun-violence bills March 7.  The measure combines two proposals intended to crack down
on gun trafficking and straw purchases, the practice of buying
firearms for another person who is prohibited from from
purchasing guns.  The legislation will be offered as a substitute to a bill
introduced by Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, that would penalize
those who engage in straw purchases of firearms. Leahy’s bill
would be combined with a proposal by  New York  Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand and Illinois Republican Mark Kirk that would provide
penalties for those who sell to straw purchasers.  “Currently, there is no federal law that defines either
gun trafficking or straw purchasing as crimes,” Leahy said
today in a statement. Leahy said the bill was drawing support
from other senators, including Republican Susan Collins of  Maine 
and Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.  The bill would establish penalties of up to 20 years in
prison for those who engage in straw purchases.  Leahy said the Judiciary Committee will consider the
measure along with several other gun-control bills, including a
proposed ban on assault weapons. The proposals are in response
to the Dec. 14 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown,
 Connecticut , in which 20 students and six adults were killed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
