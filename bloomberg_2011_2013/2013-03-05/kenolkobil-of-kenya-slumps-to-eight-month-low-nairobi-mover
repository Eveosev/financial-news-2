KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, plunged to
the lowest level in more than eight months after it ended talks
on Puma Energy BV’s planned acquisition of a controlling stake.  Shares slumped  9.6 percent to 12.20 shillings by 11:18 a.m.
in Nairobi, the lowest intraday level since June 20. About
84,000 securities changed hands, 14 percent of the three-month
daily average.  Negotiations were terminated, KenolKobil said in an e-
mailed statement on March 1, without giving a reason. The
company will pursue “strategic alternatives” to support its
growth strategy across central, eastern and southern Africa,
Managing Director Jacob Segman said in the statement. The stock
market was closed yesterday as Kenyans voted in presidential
elections.  “There was some speculative buying expecting the
transaction would go ahead at a substantial premium to the
market price and now without the transaction there could be some
selling,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview.  KenolKobil began talks with Puma, the Geneva-based
downstream and storage unit of Trafigura Beheer BV, in May and
the company’s “key” shareholders signed an agreement to sell
their majority stake. Puma said it would offer to buy 100
percent of the company after due diligence and regulatory
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
