European Union  palm oil  imports may
climb to a record this season as supplies of oil made from
soybeans and sunflowers decline, Oil World said.  Purchases of palm oil in the 27-country bloc may climb to
6.4 million metric tons in the year that began Sept. 1 from 5.83
million tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said
today in an e-mailed report. In the fourth quarter of 2012, EU
imports were 1.68 million tons, 19 percent higher than a year
earlier, with most supplies coming from Indonesia and Malaysia,
the world’s biggest producers, as well as from Central America.
 Germany , the Netherlands and  Italy  saw the biggest increases,
Oil World said.  Palm oil prices slid 23 percent last year on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange, touching a three-year low on Dec. 13, as
global stockpiles climbed to a record. Soybean futures rallied
to an all-time high in September on the Chicago Board of Trade
as drought cut U.S. production. EU soybean oil imports fell to
366,000 tons in 2012 from 748,000 tons in 2011, Oil World said.  “Palm oil is needed to offset the reduced consumption of
soya oil and sun oil,” Oil World said. “Also, the recent low
prices have generated considerably higher palm oil demand in the
EU energy sector, for electricity generation as well as for
biodiesel.”  Sunflower Oil  EU sunflower oil imports rose to 1.026 million tons last
year from 857,000 tons in 2011, according to the report. The
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates that EU sunflower oil
production this year was 2.68 million tons, down 8.2 percent
from a year earlier. Some southern and eastern EU countries had
drought last year. EU imports of rapeseed oil fell to 336,000
tons last year from 611,000 tons a year earlier, Oil World said.  The price of olive oil may increase after hot and dry
weather hurt crops in  Spain , Oil World said. Production from
October to January totaled 544,000 tons, 61 percent less than
the same time a year earlier, it said. The country’s output in
the year that began Oct. 1 may be 700,000 tons, down from a
record 1.734 million tons in the 2011-12 season, Oil World said.
Spanish prices at 2.95 euros ($3.71) a kilogram are 60 percent
higher than a year earlier, it said.  “Olive oil supplies are expected to continue to tighten in
January to September 2013,” Oil World said. “Additional price
strength is likely to occur to accomplish the necessary demand-
rationing in olive oil in the months ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
