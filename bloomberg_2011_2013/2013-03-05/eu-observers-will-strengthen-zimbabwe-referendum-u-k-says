Zimbabwe should invite the European
Union to observe the country’s March 16 constitutional
referendum and add credibility to the result, said Deborah
Bronnert, Britain’s ambassador to the southern African nation.  “If Zimbabwe wants to run a free and fair election, I
think it will be very powerful to have outsiders saying this is
a free and fair election,” Bronnert told reporters today in the
capital, Harare.  Zimbabweans will decide on a new constitution this month. A
vote in favor will be the first step to ending almost five years
of power-sharing between the Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front and the Movement for Democratic Change. Both
parties want the constitution approved by voters.  U.S. and European observers won’t be allowed to monitor
ballots in the country because those countries imposed
sanctions, the state-controlled Chronicle reported, citing
Foreign Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi.  The  African Union , the Southern African Development
Community, the  Common Market  for Eastern and Southern Africa and
“friendly” nations will be permitted to observe the
referendum, he was quoted as saying.  President  Robert Mugabe  is expected to announce a date for
presidential elections after the referendum. Under Zimbabwean
law, those elections must be held before Oct. 31, Finance
Minister  Tendai Biti  said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
