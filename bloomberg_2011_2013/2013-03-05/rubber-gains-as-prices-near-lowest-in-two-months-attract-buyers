Rubber rose for the first time in
three as prices close to the lowest level in more than two
months attracted buying interest.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 1.8
percent to 289 yen a kilogram ($3,095 a metric ton) and was at
288 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 11:34 a.m. Futures
closed yesterday at 283.9 yen, the worst since Dec. 20. The 14-
day relative strength index hit 30 yesterday, signaling the
commodity was oversold and poised for a rebound.  Rubber has lost 4.8 percent this year as stockpiles at
warehouses in  China  and  Japan  increased. Inventories registered
with the Shanghai Futures Exchange  climbed  to 103,299 tons at
the end of February, the highest since March 2010. China is the
largest user. Tocom-monitored inventories  more than doubled  this
year to 8,659 tons.  “Today’s price increase is unlikely to sustain, and is
more technical in nature after the slump,” Gu Jiong, an analyst
at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said today from Tokyo.
“China stockpiles are very high and those in Japan are rising.
This factor will continue to cap prices around 300 yen.”  China kept its economic-growth target at 7.5 percent for
2013 while setting a lower inflation goal of 3.5 percent,  Wen
Jiabao  said in a report that he’s reading to almost 3,000
lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National People’s
Congress in Beijing today, his final address as premier. An
annual expansion target of 8 percent was in place from 2005 to
2011.  “China’s growth target for this year is not that high and
unlikely to boost consumption in a significant way,” said Gu.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 1.3 percent to 24,250  yuan  ($3,897) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 88.75 baht ($2.98) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
