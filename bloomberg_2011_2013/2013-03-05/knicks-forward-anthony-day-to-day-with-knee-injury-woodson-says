New York Knicks forward  Carmelo Anthony  is day-to-day after leaving last night’s National
Basketball Association game with a right-knee injury, coach  Mike Woodson  said today.  Speaking on ESPN New York 98.7 FM’s “The Stephen A. Smith
and Ryan Ruocco Show,” Woodson said the injury was alarming but
didn’t rule out Anthony for the Knicks’ next game, tomorrow
night at the Detroit Pistons.  “We’re going to evaluate him, let him rest a day, and then
see how he feels tomorrow morning,” Woodson said. “Then we’ll
go from there.”  A six-time All-Star, Anthony tripped in the second quarter
last night against the  Cleveland Cavaliers  and didn’t return to
action. The Knicks, down 22 at the time, rallied to win 102-97.  Anthony played down the injury, saying it was “definitely
not serious,” according to the New York Post. He also said the
knee has bothered him in recent days and an MRI test last week
showed no structural damage, the newspaper said.  Anthony is averaging 28.2 points per game this season,
second in the NBA behind  Kevin Durant  of the Oklahoma City
Thunder.  The Knicks (36-21) are in first place in the Eastern
Conference’s Atlantic Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
