Hess Corp. (HES) ’s decision to reject
board nominees proposed by Elliott Management Corp. and exit its
gasoline-station and energy trading businesses isn’t sufficient
to resolve shareholder concerns about the company, Relational
Investors LLC said.  “They’re trying to do the minimum they can do to win a
proxy contest,” David Batchelder, a co-founder of the San
Diego-based company, said of Hess in a phone interview today.
“We want them to focus on improving their board. Certainly
Elliott has a lot of very qualified nominees and they need to
reach out to Elliott.”  Hess yesterday proposed a slate of six new board members
and said it would exit the other businesses as it transforms to
an oil exploration and production company.  Paul Singer ’s Elliott
Management, which owns a 4 percent stake in New York-based Hess,
said the changes announced yesterday fall “dramatically
short.”  Batchelder said in a letter to Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John Hess today that the company should appoint “some
or all” of Elliott’s nominees to the board. Relational, which
owns a 2.7 percent stake in Hess, and other shareholders “will
overwhelmingly support” those proposed members, he wrote.  Hess said  shareholders  do support its decisions and board
nominees.  “Despite the letter released by Relational, Hess has been
overwhelmed by the support it has received from its shareholders
to yesterday’s announcements regarding the culmination of its
five-year transformation into a focused higher growth pure play
E&P company,”  Jon Pepper , a company spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
