Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  is considering
reducing the 400 funds it offers and closing some of its 32
offices, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Nachtwey.  “What we’re trying to do at the organization in this new
initiative, which we’re referring to internally as ‘compete to
win,’ is a complete bottoms-up look at the entire organization,
which we’ve never really done,” Nachtwey said today at
Citigroup Inc.’s 2013 U.S. Financial Services Conference in
 Boston . The cuts won’t be on the scale of the streamlining plan
that saved about $140 million a year, he said.  Legg Mason rose 3 percent to $29.22 at 1:08 p.m. in  New
York , the  highest intraday price  since March 2012. The shares
increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through yesterday,
compared with a 24 percent advance in the 20-member  Standard &
Poor’s  index of asset managers and custody banks. The stock has
fallen about 79 percent since reaching a peak of $136.40 in
February 2006.  The firm named Joseph A. Sullivan as chief executive
officer last month, ending a five-month search for a leader to
reverse five years of client redemptions and calm restive fund
affiliates. Legg Mason, whose assets swelled to a peak of $1
trillion in 2007 as investors flocked to funds managed by top-
ranked managers such as  Bill Miller , slumped to $654 billion at
the end of January as performance declined and investors pulled
money. Since the fourth quarter of 2007, the firm has had
investor withdrawals of $368 billion, most recently suffering
redemptions of $7.5 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
