Mexico ’s bond yields tumbled to a
record low amid mounting speculation that the central bank will
reduce the country’s target interest rate this week.  Yields on benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.02 percent at 7:54 a.m.
in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close
at that level would be the lowest since the securities were
first issued in 2005. The price rose 0.32 centavo to 144.21
centavos per peso. The peso gained less than 0.1 percent to
12.7402 per dollar.  Interbank futures contracts show that traders are betting
central bank board members led by Governor Agustin Carstens will
cut the 4.5 percent benchmark rate at the conclusion of their
policy meeting on March 8. Nineteen of 20 economists predicted
lower borrowing costs this year in a bi-weekly survey by
Citigroup Inc.’s local Banamex unit released Feb. 20. The bank
is scheduled to release its latest survey results today.  “We’re again at record lows,” Jose Carreno, a bond trader
at Banco Base SA, said in a phone interview from San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico. Traders speculating about a reduction “are
trying to get a get ahead a bit of the movement that could
happen with the cut. They’re trying to anticipate it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
