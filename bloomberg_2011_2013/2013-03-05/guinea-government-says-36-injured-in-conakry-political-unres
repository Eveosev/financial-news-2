Guinea’s government said at least 36
people were injured in the capital, Conakry, yesterday in
clashes triggered by disagreement over a legislative vote.  Youth put up barricades and damaged cars in several areas
of the capital before security forces were deployed to restore
calm, government spokesman Albert Damantang Camara said in an e-
mailed statement. Gangs with knives and Molotov cocktails
attacked homes in several suburbs, Camara said, without giving
further details.  Guinea is the world’s biggest exporter of aluminum raw
material bauxite, and also has a gold mine owned by  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)   Vale SA (VALE)  has an iron ore project in the country.  According to reports published on the website
 guineeactu.info , the skirmishes are ethnically and politically
motivated, with sympathizers of President Alpha Conde, a
Malinke, fighting with supporters of an opposition coalition
dominated by other ethnic groups.  Conde defeated former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo,
a member of the Fula ethnic community, in 2010 elections seen by
foreign observers as the first democratic presidential vote
since the West African nation became independent from France in
1958.  Three main opposition parties say Conde hasn’t met their
demands for transparent parliamentary elections. The vote, which
has been delayed twice, is scheduled for May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
