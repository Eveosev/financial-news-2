Japan ’s 10-year bond yields may
decline to the record low of 0.43 percent set in June 2003,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. said, citing trading patterns.  Benchmark rates will probably extend their slide within a
so-called downward trend channel, according to Daisuke Uno,
Tokyo-based chief strategist at the unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value. The bottom line of the channel connects the lows of 1.215
percent reached in March 2008 and 0.82 percent in October 2010.  “The next support target level will be around 0.43 to 0.44
percent based on the extended lower line of the downward trend
channel,” Uno said.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell to as low as
0.585 percent yesterday, the least since June 2003, before
climbing four basis points to 0.645 percent from the previous
day’s close, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker.  In  technical analysis , analysts study charts of trading
patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency
or index. A trend channel is formed by two parallel lines
connecting highs and lows. Support is an area where prices may
change direction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
