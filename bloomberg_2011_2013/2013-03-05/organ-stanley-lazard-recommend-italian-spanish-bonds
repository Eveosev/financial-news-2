European bond investors from Lazard
Asset Management and Pioneer Investments recommend investing in
Italian and Spanish government debt this year.  “It’s risk-on with regard to peripheral bond markets,”
Christian Eckert, head of European fixed income at Lazard, which
oversees the equivalent of $9.7 billion, said today at the
Euromoney Bond Investors Congress in London.  Italy’s 10-year government  bond yields  have jumped about 70
basis points since reaching 4.07 percent, the lowest in more
that two years, on Jan. 25, as inconclusive elections threatened
to derail austerity measures designed to control the nation’s
debt and counter  Europe ’s financial crisis. They’re still almost
2 percentage points lower than they were in July, before
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to do
“whatever it takes” to hold the euro area together.  Glenn Hadden, head of European fixed income at Morgan
Stanley, told the conference that he favors “investing in the
policy” of the ECB to drive down the yields of the region’s
peripheral debt.  At 5.06 percent, Spain’s 10-year bonds yield 362 basis
points more than benchmark German bunds.  “The risk premium on peripherals is very competitive,”
said Cosimo Marasciulo, head of government bonds and currencies
at Pioneer. Buying the bonds of the nations is a “compelling”
trade, though investors need to be wary of volatility, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
