McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , which agreed in
November to sell its education unit to Apollo Global Management
LLC, said the transaction is now an all-cash deal.  As part of the sale, the company will receive $150 million
in cash instead of $250 million of unsecured notes by a holding
company of McGraw-Hill Education, the New York-based firm said
in a statement. The sale is expected to close by the end of this
month. The company will be renamed McGraw Hill Financial,
pending shareholder approval.  Chief Executive Officer Harold “Terry” McGraw III decided
to sell the division, which his great-grandfather started 125
years ago, after pressure from Jana Partners LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund, and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan with a
proposal to spin off the deteriorating education business.
McGraw Hill Financial will have  Standard & Poor’s , the world’s
largest credit rater, at its center.  The company’s shares have tumbled since the Department of
Justice sued the unit Feb. 4, alleging it inflated grades on
mortgage-backed securities to win business from Wall Street
banks. McGraw-Hill has  dropped  19.2 percent to $47.14 since the
beginning of last month.  McGraw-Hill’s origins date back to 1888, when James H.
McGraw acquired The American Journal of Railway Appliances,
according to the company’s website. More than 20 years later, he
merged his book-publishing department with John A. Hill’s,
creating the McGraw-Hill Book Co. In 2009, McGraw-Hill agreed to
sell Businessweek magazine to Bloomberg LP, the parent of
 Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
