The city of New York agreed to sell
two  lower Manhattan  buildings for a combined $249 million as
part of an effort to reduce government office space and lower
operating expenses.  The buyers are Peebles Corp., which will pay $160 million
for 346 Broadway, and Chetrit Group, which is acquiring 49-51
Chambers St. for $89 million, Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s office
said in a statement today. The deals require the approval of the
Manhattan Borough Board, led by President Scott Stringer. Both
properties are city landmarks, meaning they can’t be
altered without government approval.  “In 2010, we set a goal of reducing city agency office
space by 10 percent within four years,” the mayor said in the
statement. “Today’s agreement brings us more than 80 percent
towards that goal.”  At almost 600,000 square feet (55,700 square meters)
combined, the deals value the buildings at about $415 a square
foot. That compares with an average value of $362 a square foot
on downtown commercial buildings sold last year, a 48 percent
increase from 2011, according to data from Real Capital
Analytics Inc., a New York-based research firm that tracks
commercial-property sales.  The buyers plan to redevelop the properties, which house
city agencies, for hotel, residential, retail and community
uses, according to the statement. Coral Gables, Florida-based
Peebles agreed to set aside space at 346 Broadway for a 16,000-
square-foot digital-arts and media community center. The
building, constructed in the 1890s, is the former home of New
York Life Insurance Co.  The sales “will continue the revitalization of lower
 Manhattan ,” the mayor said.  Cost Savings  City officials expect the sales to generate $120 million in
net revenue after the costs of relocating city agencies and
creation of the media space. The transactions also will save
another $120 million in operating expenses over the next 20
years, the mayor said at a news conference today at 49-51
Chambers, the former Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank building.  New York-based Chetrit, which in January agreed to buy the
Sony Building in Midtown, plans to convert 49-51 Chambers into a
residential and retail building. About 30 percent of that
building is currently used as storage, which the mayor’s office
called “an inefficient use of valuable real estate.”  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP,
parent company of Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
