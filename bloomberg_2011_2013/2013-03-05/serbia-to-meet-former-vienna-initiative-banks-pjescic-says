Serbia  will meet creditors this week
under International Monetary Fund auspices to agree on new ways
of helping distressed clients overcome financial difficulties.  The so-called “Belgrade Initiative” will take place on
Friday as the National Bank of Serbia seeks to preserve
financial stability, Vice Governor Veselin Pjescic told a
banking forum in today.  “This will bring together bank members of the former
Vienna Initiative with the aim of finding a solution for
handling corporate non-performing loans,” Pjescic said. Serbia
was one of the countries in 2009 to take part in the Vienna
Initiative under the auspices of the IMF securing foreign banks’
commitment to keep credit exposure to Serbia.  “Our region has started to recover and is less vulnerable
than after the fall of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. but
some important challenges still remain,” Pjescic said.  Non-performing loans stood at 19.9 percent of the gross
credits of banks operating in Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
