The Obama administration is
canceling tours of the White House because of staff reductions
caused by the automatic budget cuts that began March 1.  A recorded message on the White House visitors office phone
line said tours starting on March 9 will be canceled “until
further notice.”  The White House is a popular stop for tourists visiting the
U.S. capital, particularly during the spring break season.
Tickets are distributed through congressional offices, so
lawmakers will have to turn away home district voters who are
seeking the tours.  Tours that are already planned won’t be rescheduled,
according to White House officials. The cancellation won’t
affect the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 1.  President  Barack Obama  and members of his Cabinet have
warned government services including air traffic control and
meat inspections eventually will have to be cut unless Congress
and the administration can agree on a replacement for the
automatic spending reductions. Democratic and Republican leaders
have indicated they would revisit the reductions after they pass
legislation needed to keep the government running beyond March
27.  The across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, are
forcing government agencies to reduce spending. The law requires
the government to trim $85 billion for the rest of this fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, distributed evenly between defense
and non-defense portions of the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
