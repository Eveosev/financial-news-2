Morgan Stanley (MS)  led the busiest day
for bank bond issuance in  Europe  in almost two months as lenders
took advantage of borrowing costs that remain near the lowest in
five years.  The New York-based  owner  of the largest brokerage sold 1.25
billion euros ($1.6 billion) of notes due March 2018, its first
benchmark issue in euros since September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Spain’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA (BBVA)  priced its second senior, unsecured deal of the year, while
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in Paris raised its first funds in the
currency since October, people with knowledge of the
transactions said.  Bank bond issuance tumbled 80 percent to 12.8 billion euros
in February from the previous month as the euro-region economy
 shrank  the most since 2009 and  Italy ’s deadlocked election made
investors wary of all but the safest government securities.
Standard Chartered Plc was the last of the 10 biggest European
banks to report earnings today, removing one hurdle to lenders
wanting to raise cash.  “Issuance is taking off as the earnings season is
ending,” said Serafi Rodriguez, an Andorra-based fixed-income
trader at Morabanc, which manages 6.4 billion euros of assets.
He said he may buy the BBVA bonds. “The Italian political
issues are far from being solved, so it makes sense for
financials to take advantage of the market opportunities to get
funding at historical low levels.”  Existing Bonds  Morgan Stanley’s deal is its first in the currency since
issuing 1 billion euros of 3.75 percent senior, unsecured notes
due 2017 on Sept. 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The new
securities were priced to yield 145 basis points more than the
mid-swap rate, compared with the 134 basis-point spread of the
existing bonds. Larissa Haida, a London-based press officer at
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.  It’s the busiest day for benchmark issuance since Jan. 23,
when  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Austrian
unit and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG sold a total of 1.6 billion
euros of bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold European
financial company bonds instead of benchmark government debt
widened six basis points since the results of the Italian
election on Feb. 25 to 160 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Banking Index. The spread compares
with a five-year low of 150 basis points on Jan. 14.  First Sale  BBVA’s 1.5 billion-euro sale of March 2016 bonds is its
first senior, unsecured benchmark note issue since it sold 1.5
billion euros of 3.75 percent securities due 2018 on Jan. 3,
Bloomberg data show.  “BBVA, as always, is taking advantage of opportunities to
tap the markets as they arise,” said Paul Tobin, a Madrid-based
spokesman at the lender.  Spain’s second-biggest bank priced the notes at a yield of
273 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, a person
familiar with the matter said. That compares with the 270 basis-
point spread on the lender’s existing 605 million euros of 4.875
percent April 2016 senior notes.  Credit Agricole sold its first senior, unsecured fixed-rate
bonds in the common currency since it issued 1.25 billion euros
of 1.875 percent notes due 2017 in October. The yield on those
bonds is 70 basis points over the swap rate, compared with the
85 basis-point spread on its new March 2018 securities, a person
with knowledge of the transaction said.  France ’s third-biggest bank also increased the size of its
1.25 billion euros of floating-rate notes maturing January 2015,
first sold in December, by 750 million euros.  Anne-Sophie Gentil, a Paris-based official at Credit
Agricole, didn’t respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
