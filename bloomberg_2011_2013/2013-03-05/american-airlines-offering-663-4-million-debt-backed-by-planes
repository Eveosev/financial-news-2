AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s  American Airlines  Inc.,
the bankrupt carrier that plans to merge with US Airways Group
Inc., is offering $663.4 million of bonds backed by planes in a
two-part sale.  The airline will issue $506.7 million of Class A
certificates maturing in July 2025 and $156.6 million of Class B
notes due in January 2021, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The Class A enhanced equipment trust
certificates are expected to be rated BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s 
and the Class B’s graded B+.  Part of the proceeds will be used to refinance planes and
purchase new aircraft, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  The securities are backed by eight of American’s Boeing 737
planes and one Boeing 777 plane, as well as four Boeing 777
aircraft that will be delivered between April and July, the Fort
Worth, Texas-based company said today in a statement.  American is planning a similar offering to refinance its
10.38 percent notes due 2019, 13 percent debt due 2016 and 8.63
percent bonds due 2021, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
