General Motors Co. (GM) ’s  China  sales
rose during the first two months of the year, extending the U.S.
carmaker’s lead over  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  in the world’s biggest
auto market, as demand for Japanese brands shrank.  Combined sales in the country during January and February
climbed 7.9 percent to 525,835 vehicles, Detroit-based GM said
on its website today. In the past week,  Japan ’s Toyota,  Nissan
Motor (7201)  Co. and Honda Motor Co. have reported declines in January-
to-February deliveries in China.  The results show GM is gaining market share in both of the
world’s two biggest automobile markets. Based on data released
last week, U.S. sales at the maker of Chevrolet and Buick cars
have risen 11 percent this year, outpacing the growth in total
light-vehicle deliveries in the country.  Automakers in China commonly release two-month data when
the week-long Lunar New Year holiday falls on a different month
from a year earlier, as was the case this year.  Among GM’s brands, two-month sales of the Wuling microvan
climbed 25 percent in China, followed by the 12 percent increase
in Buick deliveries and 5.4 percent rise in Chevrolet sales.
Still, the company saw deliveries of luxury Cadillac vehicles
tumble 24 percent during the first two months.  GM vies against  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  for the lead among foreign
automakers in China. Japanese automakers have seen their sales
in the country slump since September, when a territorial dispute
fueled anti-Japanese protests across China, though those
demonstrations have since subsided.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
