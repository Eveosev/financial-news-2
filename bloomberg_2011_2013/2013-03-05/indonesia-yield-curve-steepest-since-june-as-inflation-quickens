Indonesia ’s yield curve steepened,
with the spread between two- and 10-year notes near the widest
since June, after inflation quickened to the fastest pace in 20
months. Rupiah forwards rose for the first time in three days.  Consumer prices gained  5.31 percent  last month, exceeding
the 4.81 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, official
data released March 1 showed. DBS Group Holdings Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s largest lender, expects the central bank to increase its
interbank deposit rate, or Fasbi, in coming months due to
quicker inflation, analysts led by  David Carbon  wrote in a
research note yesterday.  Bank Indonesia  meets on March 7 to
review its policy rate.  “The steepening curve is just an effect of inflation as
investors seek security in the shorter tenors,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt capital markets at PT BCA Sekuritas in
Jakarta, a unit of the nation’s largest bank by market value.
“There is a possibility that the Fasbi may be raised by 25 to
50 basis points in the first half.”  The difference between the yield on two- and 10-year
government notes was 108 basis points as of 3:13 p.m. in
Jakarta, data complied by Bloomberg show. It touched 109 basis
points on March 1, the widest since June. The yield on the 11
percent bonds due October 2014 dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.28 percent, the lowest level for a
benchmark two-year note since February 2012, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The 10-year yield was
little changed at 5.37 percent.  Sukuk Sale  The finance ministry plans to raise 1.5 trillion rupiah
($154 million) from an Islamic bond auction today, after a
previous sukuk sale failed to meet its target.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.2
percent to 9,719 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
They traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the spot rate, which
was steady at 9,704 per dollar, prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to settle rupiah
derivatives was set at 9,709 by the Association of Banks in
 Singapore .  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped two basis points to 5.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
