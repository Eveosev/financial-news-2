Stagnant charter rates for ships
curbed  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ’s profit last year from buying
coal and shipping the commodity elsewhere for sale at a higher
price, known as arbitrage.  The marketing-activities margin at its energy-products unit
narrowed to 0.4 percent from 1 percent in 2011, Glencore, the
world’s biggest publicly traded commodities supplier, said today
as it reported annual earnings. The figure applies to adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  A lack of volatility in freight  rates  that stayed low last
year hindered arbitrage opportunities for coal, hurting margins
and divisional third-party sales, said Tor Peterson, Glencore’s
director of coal and coke. Average hire rates for Panamax ships
as gauged by the Baltic Exchange in London were the lowest last
year for data going back to 1999.  “The freight is a big factor,” Peterson said on a
conference call today. Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore wanted
to avoid taking any extra risk for narrower margins, he said.  Panamax charter costs slumped last year as the fleet
expanded by a record, averaging $7,684 daily, according to the
exchange, which assesses freight costs. A total of 369 new
Panamaxes left shipyards and entered service last year, the most
in records going back to 1970, according to London-based
Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.  Coal Production  The energy-products division sold 78.3 million metric tons
of power-station coal in 2012, down from 91 million tons in
2011, according to Glencore’s statement. The company’s own
production of the fuel climbed to 41.8 million tons from 20.5
million tons in the prior year.  Glencore also said tankers hired under longer-duration
accords to carry crude oil and refined products for itself and
customers “continued to provide headwinds during 2012.”  “However, as we look at 2013, light can be seen at the end
of this tunnel,” the company said, adding that its exposure to
hires for longer periods was declining.  The commodities trader had a fleet of 203 ships as of the
end of 2010, including 176 chartered vessels, and its shipping
division lost money that year and in 2009, according to a
prospectus for Glencore’s initial public offering in 2011. Net
income excluding significant items dropped 25 percent to $3.06
billion last year, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
