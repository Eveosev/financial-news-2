Most Japanese stocks fell, with the
Topix Index halting a three-day rally, as the yen rose against
the majority of its counterparts and paper companies dropped.  Papermakers led declines among the Topix’s 33 industry
group after  Nippon Paper Group Inc. (3893)  said it will raise prices.
 Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 72 percent of its
sales outside  Japan , slid 1.8 percent after gaining as much as
0.7 percent.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) ,  Asia ’s largest clothier, added
5.5 percent after same-store sales rose at its Uniqlo outlets in
Japan. Taiyo Yuden Co. had the biggest gain on the  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  after the ceramic-capacitor maker was raised to
buy at Jefferies.  The Topix fell 0.4 percent to close at 988.62 in  Tokyo 
after rising as much as 0.8 percent. The Nikkei 225 gained 0.3
percent to 11,683.45, paring gains of as much as 1.1 percent.
Shares rose earlier on speculation central banks in the U.S. and
Japan will maintain easing to stimulate growth.  “The market is pausing after rising quite a bit and the
Topix seems to be facing resistance around 1,000,” said  Yutaka Miura , a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., a
unit of Japan’s third-biggest lender by market value. “The
market has priced in  Bank of Japan  personnel changes and the
focus is switching to what the central bank will actually do.”  The Topix surged 37 percent from Nov. 14 on optimism a new
government will push for bold policy to beat deflation, with
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominating easing proponent Haruhiko
Kuroda to lead the central bank. The measure is trading at 1.2
times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Iwata Comment  The BOJ should buy longer-term bonds to help it achieve a 2
percent inflation target, Kikuo Iwata, one of the nominees for
central bank deputy governor, told parliament today. BOJ
Executive Director Hiroshi Nakaso, nominee for the second deputy
governor position, said the central bank may have more room to
be creative in monetary policy. Kuroda yesterday vowed to do
whatever necessary to end deflation should he be named to
replace Governor Maasaki Shirakawa when he retires March 19.  Jim Rogers , who co-founded the Quantum Fund with  George
Soros  in the 1970s, said he boosted his holdings of Japanese
shares and plans to buy more because Abe will boost the economy.
Rogers spoke at a Daiwa Securities Group Inc. equity conference
in Tokyo today.  Exporters reversed gains as the yen advanced against 14 of
its 16 major counterparts. A stronger yen cuts the value of
overseas earnings at Japanese exporters when repatriated. Mazda
lost 1.8 percent to 273 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter
of consumer electronics, declined 0.9 percent to 1,425 yen after
advancing as much as 1.9 percent.  Oji Slumps  Paper companies declined as Nippon Paper said in a
statement it will raise prices with April 21 shipments. Nippon
Paper, which has gained the most of any member in the Topix
Paper & Pulp Index this year, dropped 5.1 percent to 1,634 yen.
Oji Holdings Corp., the biggest Japanese paper company by market
value, slumped 8.3 percent to 331 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today. The
U.S. equity gauge 0.5 percent yesterday, when Federal Reserve
Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the U.S. central bank should
press on with $85 billion in monthly bond buying while tracking
possible risks from the unprecedented program.  China maintained its economic-growth target at 7.5 percent
for 2013 while setting an inflation goal of 3.5 percent,
according to Premier Wen Jiabao’s work report released in
Beijing ahead of the annual meeting of the National People’s
Congress today. The growth projection missed a median estimate
for an 8.1 percent expansion.  Fast Retailing  Among stocks that rose, Fast Retailing jumped 5.5 percent
to 26,770 yen, the biggest advance since April, after same-store
sales at its Uniqlo Japan outlets rose 9.6 percent in February
from a year earlier. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised the
share’s price target to 30,000 yen from 28,000 yen.  Taiyo Yuden soared 9.1 percent to 1,149 yen as its rating
was raised to buy from hold and the price target was lifted to
1,350 yen from 700 yen by Jefferies analyst Masahiro Wakasugi,
citing increased market share in some product categories.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 4.4 percent
to 25.94, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on the
Nikkei 225 was 22 percent below the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
