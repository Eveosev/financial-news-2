Peru’s sol rose for the first time
in four days as China’s pledge to increase  government spending 
spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5945 per  U.S. dollar  in
Lima, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
has dropped 1.7 percent this year after gaining 5.7 percent in
2012.  Emerging-market stocks and currencies rallied today after
China’s Finance Ministry said it will boost spending by 10
percent this year as Premier Wen Jiabao set an economic growth
target of 7.5 percent, unchanged from 2012.  “International markets are more optimistic today,” said
Juan Carlos Odar, a senior analyst at  Banco de Credito del Peru (CREDITC1) 
in Lima.  The sol has had its worst start to a year since 2009 after
the central bank bought $3.4 billion of U.S. currency and raised
lenders’ dollar reserve requirements three times to counter
increased capital inflows.  The central bank said on its website it purchased $10
million today, ending a week-long absence from the foreign
exchange market that was its longest since August.  The yield on the nation’s 7.125 percent dollar bond due
March 2019 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
2.08 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.12 cent to 128.62 cents on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
