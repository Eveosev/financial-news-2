Indian  bonds  gained for a second day
after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said yesterday he
hopes interest rates will be cut.  The Reserve Bank of India cut the repurchase  rate  by 25
basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29, lowering it for the
first time in nine months. The next policy review is due on
March 19. The economy expanded 4.5 percent from a year earlier
in the final three months of 2012, the weakest  pace  in almost
four years, the government reported last week.  “Bonds are recovering after last week’s fall on
expectations of further monetary easing,” said Vaidyanathan
Iyer, Mumbai-based executive director at  AK Capital Services
Ltd. (AKCPS)  “The central bank may cut rates by 25 basis points this
month to revive growth.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.87 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Last week, the 10-year yield rose 11 basis points, the most
since August, after Chidambaram unveiled plans to boost debt
sales by 13 percent to 6.29 trillion rupees ($115 billion) in
the fiscal year starting April 1.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.57 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
