The Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon
race director, who has witnessed the deaths of six competitors
in the last five years at events he has organized, is urging
participants to get proper prerace medical examinations.  Bill Burke, director of the  San Francisco   event  since 2009
and the New York City Triathlon since 2001, said preparing for
the endurance sport involves more than practicing swimming,
biking and running.  “People need to understand this is not a road race,”
Burke, 57, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “When
things go bad in the water, they go bad rather quickly. You’ve
got to know what’s going on in your system. I get frustrated
because I think a lot of these things are avoidable. Sadly, and
I hate to say this, I’ve become numb to it. It’s unfortunate.”  Ross Ehlinger, a 46-year-old man from Austin,  Texas , died
during the swim portion of the San Francisco race three days
ago, the first fatality in the event’s 33-year history.  Burke said he has organized road running races and
triathlons for 34 years, including the U.S. Olympic trials in
2004, 2008 and 2012. He said he had five athletes die in the
first 29 years he was involved in endurance sports, one fewer
than in the past five years.  The recent rise, he said, probably is due to athletes not
undergoing proper medical tests as the sport’s popularity
increases.  ‘Cardiac Event’  Based on personal experience and information he received
from first responders on the scene, Burke said Ehlinger probably
suffered a “massive cardiac event” soon after he started the 1
1/2-mile (2.4-kilometer) swim in  San Francisco Bay  off Alcatraz
Island. The water temperature was about 51 degrees Fahrenheit
(10.5 degrees Celsius).  “It’s Alcatraz,” Burke said. “It’s not to be taken
lightly. This is a difficult race.”  Burke said another competitor told him afterward that
Ehlinger was nervous before jumping into the water.  “Based on what I’ve heard, he was very apprehensive and
sweating bullets while on the boat,” Burke said. “That’s not a
good sign.”  More than 2,000 amateur and professional athletes
from 13 to 80 years old competed in the triathlon, which
included an 18-mile bike ride and an eight-mile run through San
Francisco following the swim in the choppy currents off Alcatraz
Island.  Ironman Death  Ehlinger’s death came less than seven months after a 43-
year-old man died during  New York ’s first Ironman-length race.
In 2011, two competitors died during the swim portion of the
Olympic-distance New York City triathlon, which Burke organizes.  USA Triathlon released a  study  in October 2012 that found
30 of 43 athlete fatalities in triathlons from 2003 through 2011
happened during the swim portion. The study found most
triathlon-related deaths were caused by sudden cardiac incidents
and that course conditions didn’t play a role.  With the increase in triathlon deaths, Burke said, he has
implemented a variety of safety measures at races he puts on,
including requiring competitors to agree to completing an open-
water swim for the New York race and attending mandatory prerace
safety briefings. He has canceled the swim portion of the New
Orleans 70.3-mile half Ironman race the past two years due to
rough water conditions.  He said he recommends that all competitors get examined by
a sports-specific cardiologist and undergo a race-simulation
 stress test . He said privacy laws forbid him from requiring
competitors to bring notes from physicians showing they passed
those tests.  Spend Wisely  “People are spending $5,000-$10,000 on a high-end
triathlon bike, but they’re not spending the $300 to get checked
out physically to find out if they’re physically capable of
completing the event,” Burke said. “That’s the most important
expense that people can have.”  For the Alcatraz race, Burke said, there were more than 100
boats, kayaks, lifeguards and emergency personnel in the water
near the start area. Less than 10 competitors asked to be pulled
from the water due to the cold temperatures, he said.  “Unfortunately, what I came to realize a long time ago, no
matter how prepared you are, sometimes things are out of your
control,” Burke said. “In athletic events, as in life, things
just happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
