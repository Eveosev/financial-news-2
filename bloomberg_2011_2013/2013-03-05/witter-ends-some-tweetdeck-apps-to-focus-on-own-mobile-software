Twitter Inc. is shuttering some
versions of its TweetDeck software, which helps users keep track
of postings on the microblogging service, as it focuses on other
services, including its own mobile application.  TweetDeck apps for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones, Google Inc. Android
devices, Mac computers and machines that run Microsoft Corp.’s
Windows will be removed from app stores in May, San Francisco-
based Twitter said today in a  blog  post. The Web-based TweetDeck
service will keep operating, Twitter said.  The social-media company is paying more attention to
TweetDeck for Web browsers, saying people tend to use the
service more on computers. It’s also stepping up investment in
the main mobile apps, those for the iPhone and Android software,
to cater to users on the go. Those apps were updated in recent
months to include better  search  and color filtering for photos.  “In many ways, doubling down on the TweetDeck Web
experience and discontinuing our app support is a reflection of
where our TweetDeck power users are going,” Twitter said in the
blog.  Twitter also said it will discontinue support for  Facebook
Inc. (FB)  integration.  TweetDeck, originally created by a London-based startup
that was  acquired  by Twitter in May 2011, helps power users of
the microblogging service track multiple tweets in real time. In
the past six months, Twitter has almost doubled the TweetDeck
team, who continue to work on the Web-based version of the
software, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
