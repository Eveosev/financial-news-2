U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne ’s budget this month may determine whether Britain
keeps its top credit rating at  Standard & Poor’s , according to
the ratings company.  Britain’s AAA grade is on a negative outlook, which
“implies a 1-in-3 chance that the rating will go down,”  Moritz Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at S&P, told reporters at the
Euromoney Bond Investors Congress in London today. “The budget
may contain relevant information on the future policy course.”  Moody’s Investors Service took Britain’s rating down to Aa1
from Aaa on Feb. 22, citing weakness in the economic-growth
outlook and challenges to the government’s fiscal-consolidation
program. While the opposition Labour Party used the downgrade to
criticize the government’s policies, Osborne shrugged it off,
citing stable gilt yields.  The chancellor will announce his budget in Parliament on
March 20. S&P put the U.K. on a negative outlook on Dec. 13, a
week after Osborne said he will probably miss his debt-reduction
target.  Fitch Ratings  said the same month that missing the
target “weakens the credibility of the U.K.’s fiscal
framework.” It will review the rating in 2013 incorporating the
budget, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
