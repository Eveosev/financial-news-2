Representative  Dave Camp , the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will release
proposed changes to tax rules for small businesses tomorrow, the
panel said.  Camp, a Michigan Republican, has said his committee will
pass a revision of the  tax code  this year that will lower tax
rates and broaden the tax base.  Many small businesses -- and some larger ones -- pay taxes
on their profits under the individual tax code, with marginal
rates as high as 39.6 percent. Corporations pay a 35 percent top
rate and shareholders are subject to a second level of tax on
dividends.  In a meeting with reporters last week, Camp said that
changes to corporate taxation would pay for a lower corporate
rate. Changes to individual taxes and to businesses taxed as
individuals would pay for lower individual rates, he said.  Camp has released discussion drafts of potential changes to
international taxation and taxes on financial products.  The chairman has planned a meeting with reporters for 1:30
p.m. tomorrow in  Washington . The schedule may be adjusted
because of an expected snowstorm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
