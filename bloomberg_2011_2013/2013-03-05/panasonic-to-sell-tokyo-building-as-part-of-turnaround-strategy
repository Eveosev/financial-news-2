Panasonic Corp. (6752)  is selling a
building in Tokyo for about 50 billion yen ($537 million) as the
electronics maker tries to recover from  losses  of more than 1.3
trillion yen in the past two years.  Japan ’s No. 2 TV maker is selling the office building in
Tokyo’s Shiodome ward, Megumi Kitagawa, a spokeswoman, said by
phone. Sumitomo Mitsui Finance & Leasing Co. will acquire 90
percent of the rights to the property, and Nippon Building Fund
Inc. said it would acquire the remaining 10 percent.  The sale of the building is already reflected in
Panasonic’s fiscal-year forecasts, Kitagawa said yesterday. The
maker of Viera TVs is cutting jobs and reducing the number of
business units after  posting  a 772 billion-yen net loss in the
year ended March 2012 amid competition with Apple Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co.  Panasonic predicts a net loss of 765 billion yen this
fiscal year. The company will stay in the building after the
sale and have a 10-year lease, Kitagawa said.  Panasonic rose 0.3 percent to 661 yen in  Tokyo  trading
yesterday. The stock has  climbed  27 percent this year after
sliding 20 percent in 2012 and 43 percent in 2011.  Nippon Building Fund, Japan’s biggest real estate
investment trust, is part of a group that last month bought a
Tokyo office building from Sony Corp. for 111.1 billion yen.
Kenichi Tanaka, president and chief executive officer of Nippon
Building Fund Management Ltd., which manages the REIT, said in a
November interview the fund planned to buy more assets on
expectations that office rents in Tokyo would rebound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
