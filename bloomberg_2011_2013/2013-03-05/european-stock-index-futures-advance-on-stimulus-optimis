European stocks  rose, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index rallying to a 4 1/2-year high, amid speculation
that central banks around the world will continue with measures
to support economic recovery.  Standard Chartered (STAN)  Plc climbed to a two-year high after
reporting a record profit for the 10th consecutive year. Serco
Group Plc headed for the biggest increase in more than nine
years after boosting its dividend by 20 percent. Ophir Energy
Plc surged the most in more than nine months after announcing a
share sale. Telenet Group Holding NV fell 1.3 percent.  The Stoxx 600 jumped 1.8 percent to 294.11 at the close of
trading, the highest level since June 2008. The gauge gained in
February for a  ninth successive month  -- its longest winning
streak since July 1997 -- as the  European Central Bank  pledged
to preserve the euro and U.S. lawmakers reached a budget deal.  “After lagging for two days, European stocks and
especially cyclical sectors are celebrating today,” said John Plassard, vice president at Mirabaud Securities LLP in Geneva,
which oversees about $28 billion. “On the one hand, we have a
confirmation of the perspective of the  Federal Reserve 
continuing to support the economy, while on the other hand,
growth in  China  looks to remain strong.”  Stimulus Promise  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said yesterday
the U.S. central bank should press on with its $85-billion
monthly bond purchases. Yellen echoed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
comment last week that the benefits of the Fed’s low interest
rates and $3.1 trillion balance sheet outweigh any risk of
financial instability.  In  Asia , Kikuo Iwata, a nominee for deputy governor at the
 Bank of Japan , said the monetary authority should buy longer-
term bonds to help it achieve a 2 percent inflation target.  China plans to raise its  budget deficit  by 50 percent this
year as the government cuts taxes and boosts measures to support
consumer demand in the world’s second-biggest economy. Premier
 Wen Jiabao  set a growth target of 7.5 percent for 2013.  In the euro area, officials indicated that budget policies
may be eased after a backlash against austerity plans.  Economic strains may “justify in a certain number of cases
reviewing deadlines for the correction of excessive deficits,”
European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told
reporters late yesterday.  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18 western
European markets except  Greece . France’s CAC 40 rose 2.1
percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.4 percent. Germany’s DAX
added 2.3 percent.  Earnings Reports  Standard Chartered  climbed 3.2 percent to 1,837.5 pence,
the highest price since December 2010. Britain’s second-largest
lender by market value said pretax profit rose to $6.88 billion
from $6.78 billion a year earlier. That beat the $6.84 billion
estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Serco rallied 8.9 percent to 630.5 pence, the biggest jump
since September 2003. The U.K. services company that operates
prisons and  London ’s Docklands Light Railway posted 6 percent
growth in adjusted pretax profit and increased the dividend 20
percent to 10.1 pence.  Ophir, a U.K. oil-and-gas explorer in East and West Africa,
rallied 11 percent to 513 pence after announcing plans to raise
about $833 million in a share sale, easing concern that funds
will run out.  Carmakers Rise  A gauge of European automotive companies was the  second-
best performer  of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. This
year will be another record period for the global car industry
with sales increasing by 3 percent to 4 percent,  Carlos Ghosn ,
chief executive officer of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA,
said. The European market will decline, he added.  Fiat SpA climbed 5.9 percent to 4.14 euros. Porsche SE
added 3.9 percent to 61.20 euros. Renault SA rose 3.9 percent to
49.96 euros.  Roche Holding AG , the world’s largest maker of cancer
drugs, gained 1.4 percent to 218.30 Swiss francs, the highest
price since October 2007. The company obtained European Union
approval for its breast-cancer drug Perjeta.  Separately, Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan
confirmed the company’s 2013 sales and earnings forecasts and
said he expects Roche will be able to raise its dividend for
this year.  Deutsche Post AG increased 5.8 percent to 17.99 euros, the
highest price since June 2008. Europe’s biggest postal service
said fourth-quarter net income totaled 542 million euros ($707
million), topping the average 482 million-euro analyst forecast.  The company said it expects 2013 earnings before interest
and taxes in the range of 2.70 billion euros to 2.95 billion
euros. That compared with the average analyst estimate calling
for 2.87 billion euros.  Commodity Shares  A gauge of mining shares was the best-performing industry
group on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  today after  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) 
said the long-term outlook for raw materials continues to be
positive.  Glencore and Xstrata Plc, set to merge by April 16, jumped
5.7 percent to 391.2 pence and 6.8 percent to 1,174 pence,
respectively.  Telenet fell 52.5 cents to 38.55 euros after the Belgian
cable operator said Chief Executive Officer Duco Sickinghe will
step down on March 31.  Banco Popolare SC lost 2.7 percent to 1.19 euros for the
biggest drop on the Stoxx 600 after saying it expects a net loss
of about 330 million euros in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
