Zumtobel AG (ZAG) , Europe’s biggest maker
of industrial lighting, plummeted the most in more than five
years in Vienna after the company cut its full-year forecasts on
the risk that the euro crisis may worsen.  The shares  fell  14 percent, the biggest drop since January
2008, to 9.015 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in Vienna. More than
460,000 shares exchanged hands, nine times the average daily
volume over the past three months.  The company said today it doesn’t expect that revenue or
adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the 12 months
through April will reach the prior-year levels, citing the
“danger that the recent elections in  Italy  will further
intensify the euro crisis.” Previously, it had forecast an
improvement in sales and earnings.  Zumtobel generates close to 80 percent of its revenue in
 Europe , where it faced destocking of wholesalers and cost-
cutting in the public sector. The Dornbirn, Austria-based
company also said its third-quarter net loss narrowed to 10.1
million euros from 15.4 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
