Copper futures rose as  China , the
world’s biggest consumer of industrial metal, vowed to maintain
its goal for economic expansion. Aluminum and nickel also
climbed.  China kept the target of 7.5 percent this year and plans to
open more than 5,200 kilometers (3,231 miles) of new railroad
lines and build 80,000 kilometers of highways. The country’s
copper demand will pick up this year, Jiangxi Copper Co. said.  “The copper market is all about China, and the growth-
target announcement shows they’re doing what they can to keep
things going,” Harry Denny, a broker at Hoboken, New Jersey-
based PVM Futures Inc., said in a telephone interview. “We’re
also seeing Chinese buying coming back into the market.”  Copper futures for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
settle at $3.515 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The metal is down 3.8 percent this year.  Rising inventory may cap price gains, Denny said.
Stockpiles monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange have climbed
48 percent this year to the highest since October 2011.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.6
percent to $7,772 a metric ton ($3.53 a pound).  Aluminum in London snapped the longest slump since June.
The price added 0.2 percent to $1,977 a ton, after falling in
the previous 11 sessions.  Nickel climbed 1.4 percent to $16,700 a ton.  Meggitt Plc (MGGT) , which makes parts for aircraft, said that
plane deliveries are poised to keep expanding in 2013 and in
coming years. Each  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-400 airliner contains 171
miles of wiring and 147,000 pounds of aluminum, according to the
company’s  website . Jet engines use nickel alloys for strength at
high temperatures, the Nickel Institute’s website shows.  Lead, zinc and tin prices also gained in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
