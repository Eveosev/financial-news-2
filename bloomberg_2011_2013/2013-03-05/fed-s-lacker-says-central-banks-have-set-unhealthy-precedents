Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said central bankers are setting
“unhealthy” precedents by expanding their involvement in
credit markets.  “I’m a skeptic,” Lacker, 57, said today during a panel
discussion at the National Association for Business Economics
2013 policy conference in Washington. “There is room for doubt
on this bold new limit-busting that  central banks  have done.”  The Richmond Fed president said the “scale and scope of
credit-market interventions has set precedents” that will
change the relationship between financial markets, financial
institutions, the government and central banks. “It was
unhealthy coming into the crisis, and I think it is unhealthy
coming out of the crisis,” he said.  U.S. central bankers launched a third round of quantitative
easing in September, announcing $40 billion of monthly agency
mortgage-backed securities purchases. The program was expanded
in December with $45 billion of monthly purchases of Treasury
notes.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen 
in speeches this month supported the central bank’s efforts to
keep long-term  interest rates  low and hold short-term rates near
zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
