Two cases of Saint-Julien second
growth Chateau Leoville Las Cases 2002 traded at 1,125 pounds
($1,690) each on the London-based Liv-ex wine market, the
highest level for the vintage on the exchange in 17 months,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The trade on March 2 was 18 percent up from a two-year low
of 950 pounds it touched in mid-November, although below the
$1,912 fetched by each of two cases at a  Hart Davis Hart Wine
Co.  auction in  Chicago  in February last year, according to
Cellar Watch data and Hart’s online archives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
