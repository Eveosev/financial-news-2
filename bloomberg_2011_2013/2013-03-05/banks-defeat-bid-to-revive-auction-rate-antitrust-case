Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  defeated an effort to revive lawsuits claiming
they violated antitrust laws by abandoning the market for
auction-rate securities.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York today upheld a lower-
court ruling that dismissed complaints brought on behalf of
issuers of the securities and investors. The market was facing
an “inevitable death spiral” and the banks’ exit from the
market was rational, the court said.  “Defendants’ alleged actions -- their en masse flight from
a collapsing market in which they had significant downside
exposure -- made perfect business sense,” the court said.  Before the market failed, auction-rate securities had their
interest rates periodically reset at auctions. Plaintiffs,
including the Baltimore City Council, claimed the banks had
propped up the market by bidding and violated antitrust laws by
colluding to simultaneously exit the market, according to court
papers.  Other banks named as defendants in the case included  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)   The cases are Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.
Citigroup Inc., 10-0722, and Mayfield v. Citigroup Inc., 10-
00867, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
