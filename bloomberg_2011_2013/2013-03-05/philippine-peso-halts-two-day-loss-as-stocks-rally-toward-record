The Philippine peso gained for the
first time in three days as stocks rallied toward a record
reached last week, while the central bank reiterated it may take
more measures to cap inflows.  The Philippine Stock Exchange  Composite Index (PCOMP)  rose 1.1
percent to 6,711.72, 0.2 percent short of the all-time high of
March 1. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco
said yesterday that a cut in interest rates on its special-
deposit accounts cannot be ruled out as it seeks to “encourage
outflows,” and signaled he may loosen rules on foreign
exchange. Inflation is manageable, he said today.  “The BSP, according to them, continues to keep a strategic
presence in the market,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , Manila-based
chief strategist at BDO Unibank Inc., the nation’s largest
lender. “The floor is being supported by the central bank,” he
added, referring to the decline in the U.S. currency.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 40.708 per dollar in
Manila, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency is holding in a range of 40.60 to 40.80 because of
inflows into shares, Ravelas said.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
40.72 per dollar, a 0.03 percent discount to the spot rate, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.95
percent.  Stock Inflows  Overseas investors bought $812 million more Philippine
stocks than they sold this year through yesterday, according to
exchange data. The benchmark share index has climbed 15.5
percent since Dec. 31. Policy makers cut the interest rate on
about $44 billion held in the special-deposit accounts in
January to 3 percent from more than 3.5 percent.  Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent last month from a year
earlier, after a 3 percent advance in January, the National
Statistics Office reported in  Manila  today. The median estimate
of 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.3 percent.  The yield on the 6.125 percent government bonds due October
2037 fell 12 basis points to 4.78 percent, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
