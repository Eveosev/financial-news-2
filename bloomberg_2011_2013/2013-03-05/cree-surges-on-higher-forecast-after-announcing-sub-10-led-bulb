Cree Inc. (CREE) , the North Carolina-based
maker of energy-efficient lighting products, rose to a two-year
high after increasing its forecast and introducing an LED bulb
that sells for less than $10 at  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  stores.  Cree  advanced  14 percent to $51.16 in New York, the highest
close since March 3, 2011.  The company’s 40-watt replacement light-emitting diode bulb
is available for $9.97, below the “$10 price barrier” that may
motivate consumers to shift from standard incandescent bulbs,
Cree said in a statement today.  “We believe this breakthrough LED bulb will, for the first
time, give consumers a reason to upgrade the billions of energy-
wasting light bulbs,” Chuck Swoboda, chief executive officer of
Durham, North Carolina-based Cree, said in the statement. It
also introduced a 60-watt version for $12.97 and a 60-watt
daylight product for $13.97.  Cree said revenue for the fiscal third quarter ending March
31 will be $335 million to $350 million, up from a January
forecast of $325 million to $345 million. The average  estimate 
of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $336 million.  The company also raised its earnings target to 31 cents to
36 cents a share, from 30 cents to 35 cents, compared with the
33-cent average estimate.  LED bulbs use less power and last longer than incandescent
lights and typically cost more. As prices for LEDs fall,
consumers will be more willing to switch, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
