Serbia , Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina
and Macedonia agreed to increase quality control of cattle feed
and milk to try to reduce levels of aflatoxin appearing in food
products from fungus-infected corn.  Croatia, set to join the European Union in July, offered
its European Union-approved facilities for testing samples, as
the region deals with the consequences of 2012 drought that
caused fungal contamination in corn, Serbia’s government said in
an e-mailed statement after agriculture ministers met in
Belgrade today. The fungi produce the carcinogenic aflatoxin.  “The situation is serious, but it’s under control,”
Serbian Agriculture Minister Goran Knezevic was quoted in the
statement as saying.  Serbia raised the permitted level of aflatoxin in milk 10-
fold to 0.5 micrograms per liter last week, amid controversy
over food safety regulations. The cap will be restored at 0.05
micrograms again in two weeks, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar
Vucic said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
