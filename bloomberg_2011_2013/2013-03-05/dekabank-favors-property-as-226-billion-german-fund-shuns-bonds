(Corrects to say DekaBank sees clients shifting to higher-
yielding assets, changes description to asset manager in first
paragraph.)  DekaBank sees clients shifting
investments from bonds to higher-yielding assets including
German properties as the Frankfurt-based asset manager expects
low  interest rates  to prevail for “much longer” than
originally anticipated.  “Government bonds and money-market investments are sort of
out of fashion,” Deputy Chief Executive Office Oliver Behrens
said in a telephone interview from  Abu Dhabi . “This view has
emerged over the last year and becomes visible in 2013. Not just
only with our company.”  The German company, which manages about 173 billion euros
($226 billion), sees “bright spots” within the euro zone and
favors real-estate assets in Germany and northern Europe, as
well as German manufacturers, Behrens said.  Global stocks have gained more than $2 trillion since the
start of 2013 as central banks fight battles from Europe’s debt
crisis and slowing U.S. economic growth. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled last month that the  Federal Reserve  will keep
holding down the benchmark rate near zero and purchasing
Treasuries and mortgage debt.  DekaBank has lured about $1 billion from Middle East
investors into European equities, Behrens said today before
holding a presentation to investors in the capital of the United
Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
