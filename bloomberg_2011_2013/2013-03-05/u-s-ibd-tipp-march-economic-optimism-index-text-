Following is the text of the March
economic optimism index as released by TechnoMetrica Market
Intelligence and Investors Business Daily.  The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index declined by 5.1
points, or 10.8%, in March, posting 42.2 vs. 47.3 in February.
The index is 5.5 points below its 12-month average of 47.7, 2.2
points below its reading of 44.4 in December 2007 when the
economy entered the recession, and 7.5 points below its all-time
average of 49.7.  Note: Index readings above 50 indicate optimism; below 50
indicate pessimism.  The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index has a good track
record of foreshadowing the confidence indicators put out later
each month by the  University of Michigan  and The Conference
Board.  IBD/TIPP conducted the national poll of 847 adults from
February 25 to March 4. The margin of error is +/-3.4 percentage
points.  The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index has three key
components.  This month, all of the three components declined.  The Six-Month Economic Outlook, a measure of how consumers
feel about the economy’s prospects in the next six months,
dropped 8.5 points, or 18.0%, to 38.8.  The sub-index was 32.1
when the economy entered the last recession in December 2007.  The Personal Financial Outlook, a measure of how Americans
feel about their own finances in the next six months, declined
2.4 points, or 4.4%, to 52.2.  Confidence in Federal Economic Policies, a proprietary
IBD/TIPP measure of views on how government economic policies
are working fell 4.4 points, or 11.0%, to reach 35.5.  “Americans across-the-board think that the economic outlook
is grim.  The big slide in our economic outlook sub-index
perhaps signals a turning point and an impending entry into a
recession.  This month sixty percent believe that the economy is
in a recession,” said Raghavan Mayur, president of TIPP, a unit
of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, IBD’s polling partner.  “Given the spate of tax hikes hitting Americans and the
cynical manipulation and exaggeration of the impacts of the
sequester in Washington, Americans seem to be fed up,” said
 Terry Jones , associate editor of Investor’s Business Daily.
“This could be a political game-changer in the nation’s
capital.”  The Breakdown  This month, two of the 21 demographic groups that IBD/TIPP
tracks were above 50 on the Economic Optimism Index. One group
improved and 20 declined.  On the Economic Outlook component, two of the 21 groups
that IBD/TIPP tracks scored in optimistic territory.   All 21
groups declined.  On the Personal Financial component, 13 of the 21 of the
groups IBD/TIPP tracks scored in optimistic territory. Three
groups improved on the component and 17 declined.  One group did
not change.  On the Federal Policies component, two of the 21
demographic groups tracked were above 50.  Three groups advanced
on the component and 18 declined.  SOURCE: TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence and Investors Business
