Soybean futures rose to the highest
in more than a week as the U.S. government reported more sales
to  China , the world’s biggest buyer. Corn and wheat gained.  U.S. exporters sold 345,000 metric tons of soybeans to
China for arrival in the 12 months starting Sept. 1, and 330,000
tons were sold to unknown destinations for delivery before Aug.
31, the Department of Agriculture said today. There were 174
vessels at Brazilian ports loading or waiting to get 10.3
million tons of the oilseed and soy-based  animal feed  today,
according to SA Commodities.  “The unknown sales are probably headed to China because of
the serious logistical problems developing in  Brazil ,” David Smoldt, a vice president at INTL FCStone Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Crush margins for
Chinese soybean processors importing soybeans are very good now,
and they want to get as many soybeans as possible.”  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
close at $14.665 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price reached $14.8175, the highest for a
most-active contract since Feb. 22.  About 40.3 million bushels were  inspected  for export for
the week ended Feb. 28, up 45 percent from a week earlier, USDA
data show. Shipments last week were almost six times larger than
the weekly average needed to reach the USDA forecast for the
year, Smoldt said.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.8 percent to $7.09 a
bushel. The grain climbed for the sixth time in seven sessions
as U.S. farmers withheld dwindling supplies.  Premiums for corn at terminals near  New Orleans  rose to
highest since Nov. 30, USDA data show. Inspections of the  grain 
climbed 34 percent to 15.7 million bushels in the week ended
Feb. 28.  Wheat futures for May delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $7.06
a bushel. Yesterday, the price touched $6.975, the lowest since
June 25, after rain and snow boosted prospects for the U.S.
winter crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
