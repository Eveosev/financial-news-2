Marriott International Inc. (MAR) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, and Ikea’s parent will
start a chain of European budget hotels, with the first due to
open in Milan in 2014.  Moxy Hotels will have 150 locations in  Europe  over the next
10 years, Marriott, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a
statement today.  “We see a huge opportunity to expand our market share in
Europe,” said Amy McPherson, president of Marriott
International in Europe. “The economy tier in Europe represents
nearly half of total room supply, yet only 20 percent of these
hotels are branded.”  Moxy will open in countries including  Germany , the U.K.,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, Marriott said. Inter
Hospitality, a subsidiary of Inter Ikea Group, will develop and
own the properties, according to the statement.  “The new brand will fuel Marriott’s  company-wide growth  in
the region, which is expected to reach 80,000 rooms by 2015,”
the company said.  Moxy will be Marriott’s first chain of three-star economy
hotels in Europe, the company said.  The Wall Street Journal reported the plan earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
