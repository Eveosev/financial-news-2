Check out these new, and forthcoming books from HBR Press: Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works 
by A.G. Lafley, Roger L. Martin  Strategy is not complex. But it is hard. It's hard because it forces people and organizations to make specific choices about their future — something that doesn't happen in most companies. Now two of today's best-known business thinkers — A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin — get to the heart of strategy, explaining what it's for, how to think about it, why you need it, and how to get it done.  Sidetracked: Why Our Decisions Get Derailed, and How We Can Stick to the Plan 
By Francesca Gino  You may not realize it but simple, irrelevant factors can have profound consequences on your decisions and behavior, often diverting you from your original plans and desires.  Sidetracked  will help you identify and avoid these influences so the decisions you make do stick — and you finally reach your intended goals.  Global Dexterity: How to Adapt Your Behavior Across Cultures without Losing Yourself in the Process 
By Andrew Molinsky  What does it mean to be a global worker and a true "citizen of the world" today? It goes beyond merely acknowledging cultural differences. In reality, it means you are able to adapt your behavior to conform to new cultural contexts without losing your authentic self in the process. Not only is this difficult, it's a frightening prospect for most people and something completely outside their comfort zone. But managing and communicating with people from other cultures is an essential skill today.  Global Dexterity  will help you reach across cultures — and succeed in today's global business environment. Innovation as Usual: How to Help Your People Bring Great Ideas to Life 
By Paddy Miller and Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg  Most organizations approach innovation as if it were a sideline activity. Every so often employees are sent to 'Brainstorm Island": an off-site replete with trendy lectures, creative workshops, and overenthusiastic facilitators. But once they return, it's back to business as usual. Innovation experts Paddy Miller and Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg suggest a better approach. They recommend that leaders at all levels become "innovation architects," creating an ecosystem in which people engage in key innovation behaviors as part of their daily work.

This new, completely updated edition brings the numbers up to date and continues to teach the basics of finance to managers who need to use financial data to drive their business.
