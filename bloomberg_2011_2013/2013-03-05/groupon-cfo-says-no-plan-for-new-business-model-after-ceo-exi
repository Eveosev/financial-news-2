Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the largest daily deal
website, has no plans to change its business model after firing
Andrew Mason as chief executive officer last week, Chief
Financial Officer Jason Child said.  “We’ll be looking for the right long-term replacement,”
Child said at a Deutsche Bank AG conference today. “I would not
expect there to be any sort of business-model changes or
anything like that.”  Mason’s departure puts pressure on Chairman Eric Lefkofsky
to find a successor who can create a money-making business after
the daily-deal provider  lost  $723.8 million in the past three
years.  Lefkofsky, who co-founded Groupon with Mason in 2008, will
run the company with Vice Chairman  Ted Leonsis  as they search
for a new CEO. The board members are charged with finding fresh
leadership while accelerating a risky push into e-commerce and
away from daily deals, a market Mason helped create.  To contact the reporter on this story:
