Hybris AG, a German e-commerce
platform provider, got a $30 million investment from two new
investors, Meritech Capital Partners and Greylock  Israel , and
existing shareholder Huntsman Gay Global Capital.  Hybris will use the funds to accelerate growth in  emerging
markets , the company said today in a statement. Huntsman Gay has
been Hybris’s biggest investor since 2011.  The company’s technology helps customers such as Levi
Strauss & Co. and  Nikon Corp. (7731)  sell more goods and services
online. Hybris said it has boosted revenue at a compound annual
growth rate of 70 percent over the past three years while
producing positive operating cash flow, without disclosing total
sales.  Hybris, which employs more than 600 people, may go public
in the middle of the year, Fortune reported in January, without
saying how it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
