Serbia  may hold elections this year
after the European Union decides whether to give the country a
date to start accession talks, Novosti reported, citing Deputy
Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.  The moment Serbia ‘gets or doesn’t get the date,’’ Vucic’s
Serbian Progressive Party is ready for elections whenever the
opposition wants, Vucic was quoted by the Belgrade-based
newspaper as saying, adding that a ballot would be an
alternative to Cabinet changes. Regular elections are due in
2016.  Serbia, a candidate for EU membership since March 2012,
needs to improve ties with its former breakaway province of
Kosovo by April 16, when European Union foreign policy chief
 Catherine Ashton  reports to the European Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
