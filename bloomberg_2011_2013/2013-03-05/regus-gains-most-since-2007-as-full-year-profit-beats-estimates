Regus Plc (RGU) , the world’s largest
operator of serviced offices, rose to the highest in more than
five years in London trading after full-year earnings beat
estimates.  Regus gained as much as 8.5 percent to 140.50 pence, the
highest since September 2007. Pretax profit increased to 85.1
million pounds ($129 million) last year from 49.4 million pounds
a year earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said in a statement
today. Analysts expected earnings of 83.6 million pounds, the
average of 7 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is a strong set of results from Regus, which
reflects the benefits of good growth in its core markets and the
costs benefits of its growing scale,” Investec Securities said
in a research note. “We like that this business is on the front
foot for growth, a rarity in the sector at present.”  Regus plans to increase the number of its offices to 2,000
by 2014 and the company acquired a majority stake in  MWB
Business Exchange Plc (MBE)  last month to help achieve that goal. The
company expects to add at least 350 centers in 2013.  The company today said it plans to increase the full-year
dividend by 10 percent to 3.2 pence.  Today’s share price increase was the biggest since Sept. 7,
2011. The stock was up 7.5 percent at 139.2 pence as of 9:49
a.m. in London trading, boosting this year’s gain to 30 percent
and giving the company a market value of 1.31 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
