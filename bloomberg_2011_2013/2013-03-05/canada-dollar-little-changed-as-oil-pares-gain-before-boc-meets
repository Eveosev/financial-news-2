 The Canadian dollar was little
changed against its U.S. counterpart as oil prices pared gains
before tomorrow’s central-bank decision, in which policy makers
are expected to keep interest rates unchanged.  Oil,  Canada ’s biggest export, rose earlier from the lowest
level in 10 weeks as traders speculated recent declines may have
been excessive. The currency touched the strongest level versus
the greenback since Feb. 28 as the Bank of Canada is forecast to
keep its benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial
banks at 1 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  “We’re trading in the range we’ve been in the past four
days,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , said by telephone from Toronto. “Part of that is
likely because we have Bank of Canada tomorrow. We’re unlikely
to make a major shift leading right into that.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, traded at C$1.0275 per U.S.
dollar at 9:06 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys 97.32 U.S.
cents.  BOC Governor Mark Carney last month said the need to raise
interest rates is less urgent because the economy will take
longer to reach full output, keeping inflation below target
until the second half of next year.  “The market has gone from pricing in interest-rate hikes
in Canada to pricing in the potential for interest-rate cuts
over the next 12 months,” Sutton said. “I think they maintain
an overall hawkish bias, though they continue to pare back that
hawkish tone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
