Nigeria ’s Eurobond yields fell the
most in almost nine months after reports showed the economy
accelerated in the fourth quarter and foreign-currency reserves
rose.  Yields on the $500 million of debt due January 2021 dropped
17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 4.144 percent as
of 11:52 a.m. in  London , the biggest decline since June 6 on a
closing basis and the lowest since Feb. 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira retreated less than 0.1 percent
to 157.45 a dollar.  Nigeria’s economy grew by 6.99 percent year-on-year in the
fourth quarter, compared with 6.48 percent in the third, the
Abuja-based  National Bureau of Statistics  said late yesterday.
The  foreign-currency reserves  of  Africa ’s most populous country
rose to $47.385 billion, the highest level since at least 2010,
the  Central Bank of Nigeria  in Abuja said yesterday. The
reserves have increased 7 percent this year.  “The current position of Nigeria’s reserves and trend in
gross domestic product adds to the positive investment outlook
of the economy,” Kunle Ezun, a Lagos-based analyst at Ecobank
Transnational Inc., said by phone.  The economy of Africa’s largest oil producer will probably
expand 6.8 percent this year, the National Bureau of Statistics
said Feb. 18.  The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, according to the statistics office.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined two basis points to 10.60 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
 Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi retreated 0.1 percent to 1.9195 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
