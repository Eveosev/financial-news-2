The  New York  Knicks re-signed
forward Kenyon Martin, who played five minutes without recording
a point, block, steal or assist during his first 10-day contract
with the team.  The 35-year-old will return for his second consecutive 10-
day contract starting today, the National Basketball Association
club said in an e-mailed release.  A 13-year veteran, Martin was an All-Star in 2004 with the
Denver Nuggets. He joined the Knicks two weeks ago and appeared
in one game, playing five minutes in the Feb. 27 win over the
Golden State Warriors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
