Peru ’s sol rose for the first time
in four days after the central bank halted dollar purchases and
as  China ’s pledge to increase government spending spurred demand
for emerging-market assets.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5935 per U.S. dollar at
11:45 a.m. in Lima, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has dropped 1.6 percent this year after gaining 5.7
percent in 2012.  The central bank hasn’t bought dollars in the foreign
exchange market for a week, its longest abstention since August,
after purchasing $3.4 billion in the first two months of the
year to weaken the sol. Emerging-market stocks and currencies
rallied today after China’s Finance Ministry said it will boost
spending by 10 percent this year as Premier Wen Jiabao set an
economic growth target of 7.5 percent, unchanged from 2012.  “International markets are more optimistic today,” said
Juan Carlos Odar, a senior analyst at Banco de Credito del Peru
in  Lima . “The central bank has decided to wait and consider
what its next move will be.”  The sol has had its worst start to a year since 2009 after
the central bank raised lenders’ dollar reserve requirements
three times to counter increased capital inflows.  The yield on the nation’s 7.125 percent dollar bond due
March 2019 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
2.08 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.12 cent to 128.62 cents on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
