The zloty is heading for a six-week
high on speculation that Poland’s policy makers will end a
series of interest rate cuts at tomorrow’s meeting.  The zloty strengthened 0.2 percent to 4.1352 per euro at
10:16 a.m. in Warsaw, on course for the highest close since Jan.
17. The yield on the government’s two-year bond fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.54 percent.  Poland’s Monetary Policy Council (MPC) will probably
deliver a quarter-point cut in  interest rates  to 3.5 percent
tomorrow, according to 22 out of 38 economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg. The remaining 16 expect rates to stay unchanged after
four quarter-point reductions in as many months.  “The council will cut rates by 25 basis points for the
fifth month in a row and at the same time signal a switch to a
neutral ’wait-and-see’ approach, which -- given the market’s
more aggressive expectations regarding further cuts -- should
strengthen the Polish currency,”  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  economists,
led by  Grzegorz Maliszewski , wrote in a note.  The rate-setting council was unanimous in ordering a 25
basis point rate cut in January, press agency PAP said today,
citing voting records published in the government’s Judicial and
Economic Monitor. The vote was 9-0 with Zyta Gilowska absent,
the record showed.  “We stick to our view that rates will be reduced by 25
basis points for the last time in the cycle,”  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) 
economists, led by  Marcin Mrowiec , wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
