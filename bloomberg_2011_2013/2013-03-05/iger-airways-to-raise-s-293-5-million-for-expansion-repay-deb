Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR) , the
budget airline partly owned by  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , plans to
raise S$293.5 million ($236 million) to help fund its operations
in  Indonesia  and the  Philippines  as well as to repay debt.  Tiger Air will sell 164.3 million new shares at 47
Singapore cents each, 34 percent discount to yesterday’s closing
price, according to a statement to the Singapore stock exchange.
It will also offer shareholders convertible bonds for every four
shares they own, the carrier said.  “The proceeds from the fundraising exercise will allow us
to fortify our balance sheet and be well-positioned to grow the
Tiger franchise in Asia,” the carrier’s Chief Executive Officer
Koay Peng Yen said in the statement.  Tiger Air shares fell as much as 2.1 percent to 70
Singapore cents, the most since Dec. 6, and changed hands at
70.5 Singapore cents as of 9:45 a.m. in the city. The stock has
dropped 2.1 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent rise
in the benchmark Straits Times Index.  Shareholders Singapore Airlines and Temasek Holdings Pte-
owned Dahlia Investments Pte will subscribe to the offerings,
Tiger Air said. The fund raising comes as budget airlines in
Asia are expanding their network to meet the surge in travel
demand.  Singapore Air, which owns 32.7 percent of Tiger, will buy
additional shares and bonds if they aren’t taken up by other
shareholders, as long as its holding doesn’t exceed 49.9 percent,
Tiger Air said. Dahlia holds 7.3 percent of the budget airline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
