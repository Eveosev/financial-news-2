MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the
pay-as-you-go wireless carrier that agreed in October to merge
with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile USA business, is planning to
sell benchmark debt in two parts.  The company may offer eight- and 10-year debt through its
MetroPCS Wireless Inc. unit, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The bonds are being marketed this week.  A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay the
company’s senior secured credit facility upon consummation of
the T-Mobile transaction, the Richardson, Texas-based company
said yesterday in a statement.  The bonds will redeemed if the merger doesn’t close by Jan.
17, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set. The securities will be redeemed at par through
Sept. 30 and at 101 cents on the dollar afterwards.  Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Morgan Stanley are managing the offering, the person
said. Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
