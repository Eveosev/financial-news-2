Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , the London-based
interdealer broker run by  Terry Smith , reported a loss as it
wrote down the value of its U.S. operations and “challenging”
markets weighed on revenue.  The 59 million-pound ($89.2 million) loss for 2012 compared
with a profit of 89.4 million pounds in the year-earlier period,
as revenue shrank 6.5 percent to 850 million pounds, the company
said in a statement today. The firm took a 123 million-pound
goodwill charge on its U.S. unit after rival interdealer broker
BGC Partners Inc. poached a number of its employees in the
country four years ago.  “Despite the action that has been taken to rebuild the
scale of the North American business since the raid in the
second half of 2009, and to reduce costs, its performance
weakened further during 2012,” Tullett said in the statement.
Legal action continues to be pursued against BGC and former
employees, it said.  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett act as a go-between
for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They typically handle more trades between banks
during periods of greater market volatility.  The company also said it expects spending on regulatory
compliance will more than offset its cost-cutting program, and
that revenue for the first two months of 2013 is 5 percent lower
than it was a year earlier.  Tullett, which split off from U.K. stockbroker  Collins
Stewart  in 2006, competes against ICAP Plc, the biggest broker
of transactions between banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
