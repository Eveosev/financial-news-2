Coverity Inc. has held talks with
banks including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. about holding an initial public offering later this year,
Chief Executive Officer Anthony Bettencourt said.  The San Francisco-based company, which makes applications
to detect errors in software, would look to raise less than $100
million in an IPO for future acquisitions, Bettencourt said in
an interview.  Coverity is on track for annual revenue of about $70
million, and sales are growing at 30 percent a year, Bettencourt
said. More than 1,100 customers, including Microsoft Corp.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, license Coverity’s tools, he said.  “Our eye is on the public markets,” Bettencourt said.
“It helps with the credibility. It’s nice to have a war chest
in reserves.”  Michael DuVally , a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and  Justin Perras , a spokesman at JPMorgan, declined to comment.  Coverity  raised  $22 million from Foundation Capital and
 Benchmark Capital  in 2008, and currently has $25 million in the
bank and is cash-flow positive, Bettencourt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
