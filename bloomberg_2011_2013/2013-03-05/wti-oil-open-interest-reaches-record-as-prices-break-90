Open interest for West Texas
Intermediate oil futures reached a record high in New York
yesterday as prices broke below $90 a barrel for the first time
since December.  The amount of total contracts outstanding rose to 1.675
million on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to data
from CME Group Inc., owner of the Nymex. Futures prices ended at
the lowest level in more than two months on concern slowing
growth in  China  may reduce crude demand.  “We have technical levels being broken and a lot of short-
term traders are bottom-fishing,” said Tariq Zahir, a  New York- 
based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
“However, fundamentals are extremely weak, and I won’t be
surprised to see open interest come lower in the next few
days.”  WTI for April delivery slid 56 cents to $90.12 a barrel
yesterday, the lowest settlement since Dec. 24. Prices fell to
$89.33 in intraday trading, dropping below the $90 level for the
first time since Dec. 26. The contract added 16 cents to $90.28
at 1:04 p.m. today.  Yesterday’s open interest broke an earlier record of 1.672
million set on March 1. Oil has tumbled 7 percent since Feb. 13,
when open interest set a then record of 1.665 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
