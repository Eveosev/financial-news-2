Sunborn International , a Finnish
property development and  investment company , is seeking
investors for its 189-room luxury yacht hotel being built in
 Malaysia , according to a sales document.  The 140-meter (459-foot) long “ Sunborn III ,” with 15,500
square meters (167,000 square feet) of floor space spread across
seven floors, will be completed this month and Sunborn is
seeking to raise 120 million euros ($156 million) from investors,
the document seen by  Bloomberg News  said. The group also owns
“Sunborn II,” a decade-old 140-room floating hotel docked off
the Finnish coast, according to the company’s website.  Turku, Finland-based Sunborn is turning to  Asia  as  Europe ’s
economy struggles to emerge from the deepest recession in almost
four years. Asia-Pacific millionaires outnumbered those in North
America for the first time in 2011, according to the World
Wealth Report published by RBC  Wealth Management  and Capgemini
SA in June.  The “Sunborn III” includes a ballroom and banqueting
facilities for 360 people, 22 suites, a nightclub and an outdoor
infinity pool, according to the document. Xavier Valero, head of
international development and legal affairs at Sunborn, declined
to comment on the new boat, saying they are always looking for
investors.  Super yachts have become the world’s ultimate symbol of
wealth and exclusivity, according to the sales document.
Floating hotels can be relocated and offer a secure investment
that can be moved for economic reasons or political instability.  Wealthy Asians  Sunborn pioneered the  yacht-hotel  concept by building its
first one in 1998. Sunborn International set up Sunborn Marine,
a shipbuilding complex, in Lumut, on the west coast of Malaysia,
in 2007, according to the company’s website. The group, with
interests in property, hospitality, health care and media,
employs 800 people globally, according to the website.  The number of individuals in Asia-Pacific with at least $1
million in investable assets advanced 1.6 percent in 2011 to
3.37 million, according to the RBC and Capgemini report. That’s
higher than 3.35 million in  North America  and 3.17 million in
Europe. North America still topped as the region with the
largest amount of investable wealth, at $11.4 trillion, compared
with $10.7 trillion in the Asia-Pacific region.  The European Central Bank forecasts gross domestic product
will decline 0.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
