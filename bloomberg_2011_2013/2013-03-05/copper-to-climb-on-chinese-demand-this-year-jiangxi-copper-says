Copper may advance this year as
consumption in  China , the world’s biggest user of the metal used
in wires and pipes, is poised to expand, said Li Baomin,
chairman of  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s largest producer.  “Demand growth momentum is strong on expansion of
urbanization,” said Li, whose promotion as chairman of the
Jiangxi-based company was announced in Beijing yesterday.
“Global copper market is expected to be in balance,” he said
without giving a forecast for Chinese demand growth.  Copper use in China will jump 8 percent to a record 8.833
million metric tons this year, boosting global demand and
creating a 6,000-ton product deficit, compared with a surplus of
216,000 tons in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The
metal  tumbled  4.3 percent last month on the London Metal
Exchange, erasing gains this year.  Copper may trade in a range of $8,000 a ton and $8,300 a
ton this year with the average price of about $8,100, Li told
reporters at the National People’s Congress in Beijing today.
The metal for delivery in three months rose 0.6 percent to
$7768.25 a ton at 7:28 p.m. Beijing time.  Jiangxi may produce as much as 1.22 million tons of refined
copper this year, compared with 1.2 million tons in 2012, Li
said. Exports will depend on the price differential between
Shanghai and  London , he said.  Surplus copper in China was 1 million to 1.5 million tons
last year, “far more significant than the reported 600,000-ton
build in bonded warehouse inventory,” David B. Wilson, an
analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
