Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  had the biggest
share of the global foreign-exchange market as of November,
followed by  Citigroup (C)  Inc.,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Greenwich
Associates said.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche, Germanyâ€™s largest bank, had a
10.7 percent share of the foreign-exchange market, according to
a survey conducted between September and November 2012. It was
followed by Citigroup at 10.1 percent,  UBS (UBS)  at 10 percent and
Barclays at 9.7 percent, a statistical tie, Greenwich Associates
said. Barclays was the largest currency trader in the 2011
survey.  Citigroup was the No. 1 dealer for corporate entities,
while Deutsche led among financial-service institutions such as
hedge funds and insurance companies.  Greenwich Associates, a research company based in Stamford,
Connecticut, tracks foreign-exchange trading volume among 2,661
