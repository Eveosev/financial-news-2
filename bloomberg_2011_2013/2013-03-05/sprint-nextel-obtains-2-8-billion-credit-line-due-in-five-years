Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. mobile-phone service provider, replaced a $2.2
billion revolving line of credit that expires in October with a
larger pact.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. arranged the new
deal, which matures in February 2018 and expands its borrowing
capacity by $600 million, the company said today in a regulatory
filing. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
Sprint Nextel said.  Under terms of the credit pact, the Overland Park, Kansas-
based company’s debt to earnings must not exceed 6.25 times
through June 30, 2014, stepping down gradually to 4 times for
the fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2016, and remaining at that
level for its duration, according to the filing.  Verizon Wireless and  AT&T Inc. (T)  are the two largest U.S.
mobile-phone service providers.  In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
