Nordic electricity for April traded
near the highest in six weeks as forecasters maintained
predictions for dry and cold weather in the coming weeks, while
German prices were little changed.  The April contract gained as much as 0.6 percent to 39.50
euros ($51.35) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.â€™s energy
exchange in Oslo, after rising yesterday to 39.75 euros, the
highest since Jan. 18. Temperatures in  Finland  for the next 10
days may be colder than earlier forecasts, MetraWeather data on
Bloomberg show.  The Nordic region gets more than half of its power from
hydroelectric plants. The amount of water and snow available to
generate electricity in the region may be 17.5 terawatt-hours
below normal for the time of year in two weeks, up from 14.8
terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft data on Bloomberg show. Drier
weather signals less supply and points to higher prices.  Temperatures in Finland will average minus 7.6 degrees
Celsius (18 Fahrenheit) through March 15, compared with an
earlier forecast of minus 7.2, MetraWeather data using the ECMWF
model show.  The April Nordic contract was unchanged at 39.25 euros a
megawatt-hour at 11 a.m. in Oslo, while the benchmark next-
quarter contract was at 37.35 euros.  German power for baseload delivery next quarter gained 0.1
percent to 37.25 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. Electricity usually flows from the
cheaper area to the more expensive one, which means Nordic
contracts can track movements in  Germany .  The Nordic next-quarter power contract traded higher than
the German equivalent for first time since March 31, 2011,
according to data from the Nasdaq OMX Group energy exchange and
brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
