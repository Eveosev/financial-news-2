Austria ’s Social Democrats, the
party led by Chancellor Werner Faymann, named Defense Minister
Norbert Darabos as manager for its campaign in national
elections due at the end of September.  Darabos will step down as defense minister, a position he
held since the center-left party returned to the government in
2007, Faymann told journalists in a briefing in Vienna broadcast
over the Internet. Darabos’s successor as minister, Gerald Klug,
now a lawmaker in Austria’s Upper House, will be sworn in
Monday, Faymann said.  While Darabos in January lost a referendum in which he
fought for terminating the military draft in the Alpine country,
he is also credited with managing the 2006 campaign that brought
his group back to power as the senior partner in the coalition.
Faymann and his conservative coalition partner plan to hold the
elections Sept. 29, they said last week.  Under Faymann’s leadership, the Social Democrats have seen
their share of the vote dwindling in opinion polls. They would
win 27 percent of the vote now, according to a survey published
by Profil magazine last week, less than the all-time low of 29
percent in the 2008 elections. They would remain the biggest
party, ahead of the conservatives, according to Profil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
