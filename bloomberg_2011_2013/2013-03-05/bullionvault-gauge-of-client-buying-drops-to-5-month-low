BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index dropped to a five-month low in February.  The gauge fell for a second month, slipping to 54.4 from
54.9 in January, the London-based company said today in an e-
mailed report. That’s the lowest since September. A reading
above 50 means more buyers than sellers. Gold slumped 5.1
percent in February, a fifth straight monthly drop and the worst
run since 1997. It traded at $1,582.27 an ounce by 8:02 a.m. in
London and is down 5.6 percent this year.  The metal rallied the past 12 years as nations from the
U.S. to  China  pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth.
Investors sold the most metal ever from gold-backed exchange-
traded products last month as global equities reached a four-
year high, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While the 80,500
ounces of American Eagle gold coins sold by the U.S. Mint in
February was down from the 150,000-ounce total in January, it
was still 28 percent more than last year’s monthly average.  “With stock markets rising this new year, it’s natural for
gold prices to struggle,” Adrian Ash, head of research at
BullionVault, said in the report. “Investors continue to lose
patience with central-bank policy. Sentiment outside the City
and Wall Street remains positive towards bullion,” he said,
referring to the financial districts in  London  and New York.  The gauge reached a one-year high of 58.3 in December and
peaked at 71.7 in September 2011, the month gold reached a
record $1,921.15.  BullionVault’s customers own about 1.11 billion pounds
($1.67 billion) of gold, the company said. The metal is stored
in vaults in London, Zurich and New York.  To contact the reporter for this story:
