OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) , the Mexican unit of
Spanish construction company  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , led gains
on the benchmark  IPC index  after first-quarter net income
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Shares rose 4.2 percent to 36.25 pesos at 1:52 p.m. in
Mexico City, the most intraday since March 22. The IPC advanced
0.3 percent.  Net income increased 97 percent in the first three months
of the year to 1.8 billion pesos ($147 million), OHL said in a
statement to the country’s stock exchange after the close of
trading yesterday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a
profit of 971 million pesos.  “Our first impressions on the report are very positive,”
Marco Medina, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Ve por Mas SA,
wrote in an e-mailed report. OHL Mexico’s efforts to cut costs
boosted the company’s profitability in the period, according to
Medina, who rates the stock the equivalent of buy.  OHL has gained 28 percent this year while the benchmark
index dropped 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
