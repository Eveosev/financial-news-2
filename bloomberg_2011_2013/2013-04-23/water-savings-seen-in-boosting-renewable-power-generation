Power produced from renewable
sources including wind and solar photovoltaics may use 100 times
less water than plants that use fossil fuels, according to the
chief climate and sustainability analyst for  GDF Suez SA. (GSZ)   “Most renewables, they use maybe two orders of magnitude
less water,” Amit Pathare from the French electric and gas
utility said today at a Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference
in  New York . “It’s not comparable to the amount of water used
for fossil fuels.”  Turbines and solar panels don’t require the amount of water
needed for cooling plants fired by coal, oil or natural gas,
Pathare said. Hydraulic fracturing to tap petroleum deposits
underground also requires vast water resources, he said.  China , which burns almost half the world’s coal, has
diverted rivers, which is “extremely expensive,” and is
investing more in desalination plants to better balance its
energy and water needs, Pathare said.  “From the water-supply standpoint, they’re exploring all
sorts of ways,” he said. “From the water-demand perspective,
they will continue to grow with thermal generation, but that’s
the other advantage of diversifying away from thermal
generation.”  GDF Suez SA, based in Courbevoie,  France , is Europe’s
biggest utility by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
