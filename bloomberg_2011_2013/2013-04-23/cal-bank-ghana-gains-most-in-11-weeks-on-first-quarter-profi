CAL Bank Ltd. (CAL) , a Ghanaian lender
whose 50 percent gain this year has outpaced the climb in the
stock market’s composite index, rose the most in 11 weeks after
first-quarter profit more than doubled.  The stock added 5.6 percent to 57 pesewas by 1:58 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the biggest intraday increase since Feb. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income in the three months through March advanced to
21.3 million cedis ($11 million) from 8.2 million cedis a year
earlier, it said in a statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock
Exchange yesterday. Net interest income, the money banks make
from loans, grew to 32.4 million cedis from 12.8 million cedis
in the previous period.  The Ghanaian bourse’s composite index has increased 49
percent this year, the world’s best-performing equities gauge in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
