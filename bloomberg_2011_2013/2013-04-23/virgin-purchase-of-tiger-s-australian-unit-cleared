Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH) , the
nation’s second-largest carrier, gained antitrust approval to
buy a 60 percent stake in the local unit of  Tiger Airways
Holdings Ltd. (TGR)   The deal “is unlikely to lead to a substantial lessening
of competition,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement today. Virgin said Feb. 27
it would drop the bid if the regulator forced it to increase
fleet numbers to a specified level.  Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer John Borghetti,
who is targeting corporate customers with business class seats
and upgraded lounges, plans to use Tiger to help challenge
 Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ’s 65 percent share of the market. Tiger’s
largest shareholder,  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , is helping to fund
the takeover by acquiring a 10 percent stake in Brisbane-based
Virgin for A$105 million ($108 million).  Tiger, which has never made a profit in  Australia  since
starting services six years ago, was unlikely to remain in the
market if the deal didn’t go ahead, the regulator said.  “Absent this conclusion the acquisition raised
considerable competition concerns,” Sims said in the statement.  Virgin Australia shares gained as much as 4.6 percent to
A$0.46 and traded at A$0.45 as of 10:15 a.m. in Sydney.  Borghetti is also spending about A$95 million in cash and
shares buying Skywest Airlines Ltd., which operates regional
routes mainly in Western Australia state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
