Arabica-coffee futures fell the
most in seven weeks on speculation that ample supply in  Brazil ,
the world’s leading producer and exporter, will compensate for
production losses from a fungal disease in Central America.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecasts for the
beans favored by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , citing improving prospects for
the 2013 crop in Brazil, the bank’s analyst Damien Courvalin,
said today in an e-mailed report. As of March 31, farmers in the
South American country sold 75 percent of the most recent
harvest compared with 86 percent a year earlier,  Porto Alegre ,
Brazil-based consulting firm Safras & Mercado estimates.  “This improving Brazilian production outlook offsets
additional downward revision to Central American production, on
damages from the leaf rust fungus,” Courvalin said.  Arabica coffee for delivery in July tumbled 3.2 percent to
$1.385 a pound at 10:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
heading for the biggest drop since March 5.  Prices will be at $1.45 in three, six and 12 months,
Goldman said. That is down from previous forecasts of $1.55,
$1.65 and $1.75, respectively, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
