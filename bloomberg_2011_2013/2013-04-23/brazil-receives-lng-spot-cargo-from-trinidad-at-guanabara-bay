Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, received a spot cargo from
Trinidad & Tobago, according to ship-tracking data.  The Hispania Spirit, with a capacity of 137,814 cubic
meters, arrived April 21 at Rio de Janeiro, according to ship
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker
sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point Fortin terminal, where it
docked to load the supercooled natural gas.  Brazil’s driest rainy season in a decade has reduced
hydropower supply, boosting the country’s LNG demand, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in a Jan. 28 note. Petrobras, as the
Brazilian oil company is known, has a floating regasification
terminal at Guanabara Bay near Rio de Janeiro.  Officials from Petrobras in Houston and Atlantic LNG didn’t
immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment out of normal
working hours.  Brazil  doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Trindad & Tobago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Trinity Glory, with a capacity of 152,675 cubic meters,
last delivered a shipment from Nigeria LNG to Guanabara Bay on
April 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
