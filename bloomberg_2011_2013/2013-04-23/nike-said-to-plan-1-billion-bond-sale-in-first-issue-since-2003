Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods company, boosted the industry’s biggest cash
hoard by entering the bond market for the first time in a decade
with a new $1 billion offering.  The athletic-footwear maker sold equal $500 million
portions of 2.25 percent, 10-year debt and 30-year securities
with a 3.625 percent coupon, the lowest among similar corporate
bonds issued in the U.S. this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 2023 notes yield 58 basis points more than
Treasuries, with the 2043 bonds paying a spread of 75.  Nike’s sale adds to the $4 billion of  cash  and marketable
securities the company had on Feb. 28, Bloomberg data show.
Proceeds from the offering may be used to fund  capital
expenditures , share buybacks or acquisitions, Beaverton, Oregon-
based Nike said today in a regulatory filing. The issue is more
than six times the $150 million of bonds previously outstanding.  The company last issued new debt in October 2003 with $100
million of 5.15 percent notes due 2015. Those securities traded
at 110.4 cents on the dollar April 11 to yield 0.94 percent, or
70.5 basis points more than benchmarks, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Nike debt is  rated  A1 by Moody’s Investors Service and an
equivalent A+ by  Standard & Poor’s . Before today’s sale, the
lowest coupon linked to 30-year, non-utility debt issued this
year was 4 percent for Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  and
 Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
