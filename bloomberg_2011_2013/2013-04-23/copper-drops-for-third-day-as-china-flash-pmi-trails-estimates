Copper declined for a third day in
 London  after a preliminary reading of China’s manufacturing in
April trailed estimates, raising concerns about demand from the
largest user. Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also fell.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 1.2 percent to $6,853 a metric ton,
before trading at $6,877.25 at 10:01 a.m. in  Shanghai . Metal for
delivery in July on the Comex in  New York  lost 0.9 percent to
$3.1150 per pound.  A preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood
at 50.5. That compares with 51.5 in a Bloomberg News survey, and
a final reading of 51.6 in March.  “Economic data again fell short of estimates, hitting the
stock market and metals,” said Wang Na, an analyst at Guolian
Futures Co. “Now all eyes will be on the official PMI data to
be released on May 1.”  Morgan Stanley lowered its 2013, 2014 copper, aluminum,
nickel, zinc, lead estimates, while reiterating its preference
for copper and tin, analysts  Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane
said in a quarterly report today. Copper’s 2013 estimate was cut
by 9 percent to $3.53 a pound ($7,793 a ton), and the 2014
estimate was reduced by 3 percent to $3.60.  Metal for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 49,260 ($7,976) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
