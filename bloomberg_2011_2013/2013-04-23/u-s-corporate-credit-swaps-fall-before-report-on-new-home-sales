A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk dropped for a third straight day as new-home sales rose,
boosting confidence that improvement in the housing market can
be sustained.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 80.7 basis points at 4:21
p.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales of single-family properties  climbed  1.5 percent to a
417,000 annual pace last month, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The median estimate of 76 analysts
in a Bloomberg  survey  called for March sales to rise to 416,000.
Investors use signs of economic health to help gauge whether
companies will struggle to repay debt.  “We do think that housing will be the driver of the
economic recovery, and our forecast is for continued signs of
strength in the economy,” George Rusnak, national director of
fixed income for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $170
billion in assets, said in a telephone interview.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Home Prices  The median price of a new home climbed 3 percent in March
from a year ago to $247,000, today’s report showed. Home sales
averaged a 424,000 annual rate in the first three months of this
year, the strongest since the third quarter of 2008.  “So long as the  Federal Reserve  continues its monetary
policy, there are a lot of reasons why housing will continue to
go up, and the health of the housing market has been the best
proxy of the jobs market to date,” Tim Rood, a partner in the
Collingwood Group LLC, a Washington-based financial services
consulting firm, said in a telephone interview.  Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest sporting-goods company,
raised $1 billion in bonds with its first debt sale in a decade.  The athletic-footwear maker sold equal $500 million
portions of 2.25 percent, 10-year debt and 30-year securities
with a 3.625 percent coupon, the lowest among similar corporate
bonds issued in the U.S. this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 2023 notes yield 58 basis points more than
Treasuries, with the 2043 bonds paying a spread of 75.  Nike Issuance  Nike last sold bonds in October 2003, with $100 million of
5.15 percent debt due 2015, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Those notes traded at 110.4 cents on the dollar April
11 to yield 0.94 percent, or 70.5 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Borrowers are coming to market as yields on companies in
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. High Yield Index, which
includes debt tied to firms from D.R. Horton Inc. to J.C. Penney
Co., reached a record low 6.28 percent yesterday.  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index decreased 6.5 basis points to 393.7 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The cost to protect against a default by  RadioShack Corp. (RSH) 
climbed as the electronics chain trailed first-quarter revenue
estimates.  RadioShack Revenue  Five-year credit swaps linked to RadioShack rose 1.2
percentage points to a mid-price of 26.2 percent upfront at 4:20
p.m., according to CMA, the data provider owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. that compiles prices quoted by dealers. That means it would
cost $2.6 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10
million of obligations.  RadioShack  reported  $849 million in sales for the first
quarter, below the $960.7 million expected by 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The company has about 38 months until it
would need to seek additional financing if operations don’t
improve, Bloomberg  data  show.  “We see ratings risk, and we expect earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be
insignificant (or negative) for the coming two quarters,” Carla Casella and Paul Simenauer, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
New York, wrote today in a note to clients.  The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-
rated, debt tightened 4.6 basis points to 532.3 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- at  Standard
& Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
