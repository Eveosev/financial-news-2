Panera Bread Co. (PNRA)  fell in extended
trading after the operator of bakery cafes cut its 2013 forecast
for same-store sales and said founder Ron Shaich would become
sole chief executive officer effective Aug. 1.  The shares fell as much as 8 percent to $166, after closing
at $180.44 in regular trading in New York. The stock had gained
14 percent this year through today’s close, compared with an 11
percent advance for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Panera, which has more than 1,670 bakery-cafes, now expects
same-store sales at company-owned bakeries this year to increase
from 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with a prior forecast of
4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, after “severe weather” in the
first quarter, according to a statement today.  Founder Schaich will become sole-CEO Aug. 1, as co-CEO Bill Moreton transitions to executive vice chairman to spend more
time on a family matter, the company said. Schaich served as
sole CEO from 1994 to 2010, the company said.  Earnings per share for the quarter ended March 26 were
$1.64, from $1.40 a year earlier. That compared to an average
estimate of $1.65. Total revenue rose 13 percent to $561.8
million, trailing estimates of $566 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
