Former Ivory Coast President
Laurent Gbagbo, who faces war crimes charges, lost a bid to have
a court overturn European Union measures freezing funds and
restricting travel.  The EU Court of Justice, the 27-nation bloc’s highest
court, said in a ruling today that the actions were filed too
late.  Gbagbo was arrested in Abidjan in April 2011 after five
months of violent clashes in the world’s biggest cocoa producer.
He and his wife Simone Gbagbo face war-crimes charges at the
International Criminal Court in The Hague. Alassane Ouattara,
who won the disputed vote, was inaugurated a month after
Gbagbo’s arrest.  The EU General Court, the bloc’s second-highest tribunal,
in  2011 rejected  appeals by Gbagbo and several other members of
his government against their inclusion on a list of people who
would be subject to the restrictions. The list and appellants
also include Pascal Affi N’Guessan, a former prime minister.  EU governments imposed further  sanctions  two years ago by
banning the purchase of bonds from Gbagbo’s “illegitimate”
government and any loans to it.  The cases are: C-478/11 P, Gbagbo v. Council, C-479/11 P,
Kone v. Council, C-480/11 P, Boni-Claverie v. Council, C-481/11
P, Djedje v. Council, C-482/11 P, N’Guessan v. Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
