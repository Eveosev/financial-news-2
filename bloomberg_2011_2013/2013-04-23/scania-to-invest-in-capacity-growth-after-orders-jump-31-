Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said it will focus investments on
adding capacity as European fleet replacements contributed to a
31 percent jump in first-quarter orders.  Sales contracts rose to 20,787 trucks and buses from 15,809
vehicles a year earlier, while deliveries increased 4 percent,
Soedertaelje, Sweden-based Scania said today in a statement. Net
income fell 22 percent to 1.4 billion kronor ($212 million) as
sales declined 4 percent to 19.3 billion kronor.  “In the longer term, there are good growth
opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Lundstedt said
in the statement. “Scania will therefore continue to prioritize
investments in core development projects and will extend
technical production capacity, as well as expanding the sales
and services organization in  emerging markets .”  Scania is promoting new models that meet tighter emissions
standards to boost sales in an effort to counter an economic
decline in Europe. Demand for commercial vehicles in the region
fell for a 14th consecutive month in February, industry
association ACEA said on March 27. The economy of the 17 nations
sharing the euro is in the second recession in four years.  Scania rose as much as 5.3 percent to 134.5 kronor, the
biggest intraday gain since Sept. 14, and was trading up 4.9
percent at 10:08 a.m. in  Stockholm . That pared the shares’
decline this year to 0.3 percent, valuing the company at 105.1
billion kronor.  The company said it will raise production capacity “in
coming years” to 120,000 vehicles from 100,000 units currently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
