Kazakhstan’s farmers have planted
about 300,000 hectares (741,300 acres) of wheat so far and may
sow a total 13 million hectares of the grain, farm adviser
Agritel forecast.  Spring planting in the country, which accounts for more
than 95 percent of crop area, is just starting, the Paris-based
company wrote on its website. Kazakhstan’s barley area may be
1.6 million hectares, Agritel predicted.  The country harvested 12.4 million hectares of wheat and
1.6 million hectares of barley last year, with production of
9.84 million tons and 1.5 million tons respectively after
drought hurt yields, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.  In Kazakhstan’s three main grain-growing regions of the
country, soil-water reserves are improved compared to last year,
Agritel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
