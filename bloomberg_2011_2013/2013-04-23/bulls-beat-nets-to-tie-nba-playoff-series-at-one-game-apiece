The  Chicago  Bulls defeated the
Brooklyn Nets 90-82 to level their National Basketball
Association playoff series at one game apiece.  Luol Deng led Chicago with 15 points, while Carlos Boozer
scored 13 and had 12 rebounds at the Barclays Center. Kirk Hinrich also scored 13 for the Bulls, Nate Robinson came off the
bench to contribute 11 and Joakim Noah added 10 points and 10
rebounds.  “We’re a team with great character,” Noah told reporters.
“Every time we hit adversity, we’ve responded pretty well.”  After two games in New York, the teams now head to Chicago
for matchups on April 25 and 27 in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference first-round series.  The Bulls, who led 71-57 at the start of the fourth quarter,
held on to become the first team to win on the road in nine
playoff games so far this year.  The Nets are in the playoffs for the first time since the
2006-07 season, while the Bulls have lost in the first round of
the postseason three times since 2008-09.  Also tonight, the Los Angeles Clippers will seek to take a
2-0 lead in games over the Memphis Grizzlies in their Western
Conference first-round series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
