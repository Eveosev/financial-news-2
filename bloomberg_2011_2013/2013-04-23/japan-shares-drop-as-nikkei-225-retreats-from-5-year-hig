Japanese  shares  dropped, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling from its highest since July
2008, as the yen gained against the dollar and investors await
major earnings reports this week.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets nearly 20 percent of its sales from
the U.S., fell 0.6 percent. Yamada Denki Co. dropped 4.8 percent
after the electronics retailer missed its profit forecast by 35
percent.  Oki Electric  Industry Co. surged 21 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper said operating profit doubled at the maker of
ATMs. Komatsu Ltd., a machinery maker that gets 17 percent of
its sales in  China , reversed gains after Chinese manufacturing
data fell short of estimates.  The Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 percent to 13,529.65 at the close
in Tokyo. The Topix Index lost 0.2 percent to 1,143.78, with
about three stocks gaining for every two that fell on the 1,698-
member index.  “The yen is weakening at a slower pace, and there’s no
catalyst for the  Bank of Japan  to ease further, which is what it
would take to send the yen down,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which
manages about $163 billion. “Investors now need to see how the
yen’s slide impacts earnings.”  The Topix has climbed 58 percent since mid-November through
as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge trades
at 1.3 times  book value  compared with 2.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Manufacturing  The yen rose and shares tied to China reversed gains after
as report on the country’s manufacturing added to concern  Asia ’s
largest economy is faltering.  The preliminary reading for China’s  Purchasing Managers ’
Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compared was below the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 11 analysts.  The yen rose 0.5 percent to 98.75 against the dollar,
reducing the outlook for Japanese exporters’ earnings when
repatriated.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 0.7
percent. Honda Motor Co., which gets about 44 percent of its
sales from  North America , declined 1 percent. Sony slid 0.6
percent to 1,625 yen.  Komatsu,  the world’s second-biggest construction equipment
maker, declined 0.2 percent to 2,504 yen, reversing an earlier
gain of as much as 1.5 percent. Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co., which gets 17 percent of its revenue from China, closed
down 0.3 percent at 2,160 yen after earlier advancing 1.8
percent.  Earnings Releases  Nintendo Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. are among more
than 200 companies on the Topix scheduled to report earnings
this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 61
companies that have posted results so far this month and for
which Bloomberg has estimates, 43 percent beat expectations,
while 57 percent fell short, the  data  show.  Yamada Denki,  Japan ’s biggest electronics retailer, dropped
4.8 percent to 4,710 yen after full-year net income was 35
percent below its forecast of 34 billion yen, according to a
preliminary earnings report.  Oki Electric surged 21 percent to gain the most on the
Nikkei 225 after the Nikkei newspaper said the company may
report an operating profit of 22 billion yen for the year ending
March 2014, more than double the company’s forecast for the
previous period.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index lost 1.9 percent
to 25.38 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.3
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
