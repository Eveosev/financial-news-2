Junior bonds of Energy Future
Holdings Corp.’s unregulated generation and retail electricity
provider jumped by the most in more than a month.  Texas Competitive Electric Holdings’s $1.23 billion of 15
percent, second-lien notes due April 2021 rose 2.1 cents to 27.8
cents on the dollar at 2:36 p.m. in  New York , according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That’s the biggest increase since March 8.  The junior notes, which get paid back after first-lien
securities in a bankruptcy, won’t have any recovery, according
to an April 22 report by New York-based debt-researcher
CreditSights Inc. Noteholders may be hoping for a long stay in
bankruptcy in the event that  gas prices  recover, analysts led by
 Andy DeVries , wrote in the report.    KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners
took Dallas-based Energy Future private in 2007 in the largest
leveraged buyout on record. The transaction was a bet that would
have paid off had natural gas prices increased. Instead prices,
which set the cost of electricity in the Texas market, have
fallen 69 percent since mid-2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
