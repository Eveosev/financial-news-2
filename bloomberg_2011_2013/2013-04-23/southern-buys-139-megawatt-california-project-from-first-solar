Southern Co., the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, acquired its fifth U.S.
solar project in partnership with billionaire  Ted Turner ’s
renewable-energy company.  Southern and Turner Renewable Energy LLC bought  First Solar
Inc. (FSLR) ’s 139-megawatt Campo Verde project in California, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Terms weren’t
released.  The Campo Verde project will be Southern’s first solar farm
in California and will more than double its solar generating
capacity, according to the statement. First Solar in December
began building the project with its thin-film panels and will
operate it after completion later this year.  Sempra Energy (SRE) 
utility San Diego Gas & Electric will buy the power under a 20-
year contract.  Southern and Turner Renewable in 2010 acquired First
Solar’s 30-megawatt Cimarron project adjacent to a ranch owned
by Turner in  New Mexico . The companies have also bought  MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) ’s 30-megawatt Spectrum Solar and 20-
megawatt Apex projects in Clark County, Nevada, as well as a
2.5-megawatt facility in Granville County, North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
