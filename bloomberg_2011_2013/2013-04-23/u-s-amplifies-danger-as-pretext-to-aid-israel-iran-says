Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the
U.S. is amplifying threats in the  Middle East  to justify its
backing of  Israel  and continue selling weapons.  The comments by Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  to reporters came after U.S. Defense Secretary
Chuck Hagel described plans to sell Israel advanced weaponry, as
a “very clear signal to Iran” about the possibility of an
Israeli military strike against its nuclear facilities.  “Israel and the U.S. see the threat of Iran in exactly the
same” way, Hagel said on April 21, on his way to Israel.  “U.S. arms contracts and ready help to the Zionist regime
isn’t a new matter,” Mehmanparast said in Tehran today. Hagel’s
comments “are justification to overplay the danger, which the
U.S. has fueled in the region, and the ultimate goal is to sell
weapons.”  The U.S. questions Iran’s assertion that its nuclear
program is designed to stimulate electricity generation and
medical research. Israel has said  Iran  must be pressured to curb
its nuclear program with a “credible military threat.” The
U.S. and Israel have both said a military solution may be
needed.  “Our country is powerful enough to defend its rights and
its sovereignty,” Mehmanparast said. “These governments should
stop psychological moves launched against our nation, which will
only make our people more resilient.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
