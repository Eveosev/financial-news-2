The yield on  Indonesia ’s five-year
government bonds fell for a fourth day, the longest run of
declines in a month, on speculation  Japan ’s monetary easing is
drawing investors to the nation’s higher-yielding assets.  Overseas funds pumped 7.5 trillion rupiah ($771 million)
into the country’s local-currency  notes  since April 3, the day
before Japan’s central bank said it would buy 7.5 trillion yen
($75.6 billion) of debt per month to stimulate its economy.
Indonesia’s benchmark interest  rate  is 5.75 percent, the highest
among  Southeast Asia ’s five biggest economies and more than
Japan’s 0.1 percent.  “I know that there’s quite an increase in overseas
investment,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, head of treasury at PT
Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta. “Investors are
looking for high yields but they are not in a rush and the
volume is not that much. Increases in gas fuel prices will be
this month or next and that will be an inflation drag.”  The yield on the 5.25 percent securities due May 2018 fell
one basis point to 4.99 percent as of 9:08 a.m. in Jakarta,
according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.
The rate dropped 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, in
the last four days, which was the longest stretch of declines
since March 7.  Indonesia may raise gasoline prices for privately owned
cars by around 50 percent to cut fuel subsidies, Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Jero Wacik said April 16. Consumer
prices rose 5.9 percent in March from a year earlier, the most
in 22 months, official data show.  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,723 per dollar, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, declined 12 basis points to 5.72
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
