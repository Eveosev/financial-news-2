The U.S. economy has recovered for
households with net worth of $500,000 or more, a new study
shows. The recession continues for almost everyone else.  Wealthy households boosted their net worth by 21.2 percent
in the aftermath of the recession, according to the  study
released today  by the Pew Research Center. The rest of America
lost 4.9 percent of household wealth from 2009 to 2011.  Pew attributed the disparity to gains during that period in
the stock and bond markets, benefiting affluent households,
while the housing market’s decline hit others harder. The report
underscores the nation’s growing income inequality, with the top
13 percent of households recovering their losses from the 18-
month recession that ended in June 2009, and the rest of the
country continuing to hemorrhage wealth.  “The results are entirely sensible, but depressing,” said
Richard Fry, a Pew senior research associate and co-author of
the study by the Washington-based organization. “It’s a stark
story of two Americas.”  Average household net worth across all income levels
increased 14 percent to $338,950 from 2009 to 2011, the latest
figures available from the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Pew report, based on the Census Bureau’s Survey of
Income and Program Participation, reinforces a body of evidence
that the U.S. is becoming a nation of haves and have-nots.  Widening Gap  One of the most common measures of income inequality, the
Gini coefficient, has risen in the last generation. The
coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, with a zero indicating
that all income is shared equally and a one representing
complete concentration of income.  Income inequality in the U.S. grew to 0.477 in 2011,
 according to the Census Bureau , a 20.2 percent increase from the
0.397 measured in 1967.  The gap between rich and poor is most pronounced in the
Bridgeport, Connecticut, metropolitan area, about an hour from
Wall Street. The Gini of 0.535 measured there is approximately
the same as the national rate for  Thailand , surpassing the
figures for Zimbabwe and  Chile .  The U.S. Gini is equivalent to the figures for  Ecuador ,
 China  and Madagascar.  The growing inequality during the past three decades is
becoming a permanent fixture of the U.S. economy, according to a
 Brookings Institution study  released last month and co-authored
by Jason DeBacker, a Middle Tennessee State University
economist.  ‘Less Dynamic’  “From a number of different perspectives, there’s evidence
that the U.S. economy has become a little less dynamic,”
DeBacker said.  Carl Van Horn, director of the Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University, said the
recession’s effects are still being felt because of the length
and breadth of the downturn, the worst since the Great Depression.  Americans feel mired in a slump even though the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based National Bureau of Economic Research
declared that the recession ended in June 2009, Van Horn said.  “From the standpoint of the typical American, the data
used aren’t always very useful indicators,” he said.  The Pew report found that interest-earning assets such as
U.S. government securities, municipal and corporate bonds
boosted wealth among high-income Americans. The value of those
assets, owned by 13 percent of U.S. households with net worth
greater than $500,000, rose 389 percent during the two-year
period to an average of $803,641.  “Very few households have those assets, but when they do
-- wow!” Fry said. “The average values just skyrocketed.”  401(k) Plans  Tax-deferred 401(k) plans, owned by 65 percent of wealthy
households, recorded the second-fastest growth rate of any asset
class, climbing 57 percent to an average value of $119,799.
Thirty-nine percent of U.S. households with net worth less than
$500,000 reported owning 401(k) or thrift savings plans.  Real estate, which sparked a global financial crisis in
2008 when the housing bubble collapsed, remained a poor
investment after the recession. The Pew study said average
rental-property equity plunged to $370,013 in 2011, down 32
percent from the $547,462 registered in 2009. Home equity
dropped 16 percent to an average of $127,290.  To contact the reporter on this story:
