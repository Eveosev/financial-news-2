Nicolas Leoz resigned from the FIFA
executive committee and as president of the South American
Football Confederation for health and personal reasons, world
soccer governing body FIFA said in a statement.  The 84-year-old Paraguayan has been a member of FIFA’s
executive committee since 1998 and has led the South American
association, known as CONMEBOL, since 1986. He has undergone
several rounds of heart surgery, according to the  Associated
Press .  “FIFA has taken note of the formal resignation of Nicolas
Leoz as a member of the FIFA Executive Committee and as
president of CONMEBOL for health and personal reasons,” the
body said in its  statement .  Leoz’s resignation comes in the same week FIFA is expected
to announce the results of an investigation from its ethics
committee into a scandal involving the organization’s former
marketing partner ISL. Leoz was named in court documents five
years ago as receiving payments from the now defunct company.  FIFA said CONMEBOL will now have to decide immediately on
Leoz’s replacement on the executive committee for the remaining
period of office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
