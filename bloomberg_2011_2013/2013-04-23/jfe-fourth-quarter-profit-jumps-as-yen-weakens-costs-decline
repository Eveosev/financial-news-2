JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest steelmaker, posted a 28-fold jump in fourth-quarter
profit, helped by a weaker yen and cost cuts.  Net income  was 17.6 billion yen ($178.1 million) in the
three months ended March 31, the Tokyo-based company said today
in a statement. That compares with 625 million yen a year
earlier, according to a Bloomberg calculation.  The Japanese currency has depreciated about 14 percent
against the dollar since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office
Dec. 26, alleviating cost pressures at exporters. JFE exports
half of its steel products.  JFE Holdings didn’t provide an earnings outlook for the
current year to March 2014, saying it isn’t possible to make
accurate forecasts at this stage. Profit is expected at 120.8
billion yen for the year, almost seven times the level of the
previous year, according to the average estimate of 17 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  JFE Holdings rose 2.9 percent to 2,012 yen as of 2:07 p.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, extending its gain this year to 25
percent.  For the full-year ended March 31, the company had a profit
of 39.6 billion yen, compared with a 36.6 billion yen loss a
year earlier. Sales increased 0.7 percent to 3.19 trillion yen,
the company said in the statement.  Based on improving profits, JFE also raised its dividend
for last fiscal year to 20 yen from the 15 yen it forecast on
Jan. 31.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) , Japan’s biggest
steelmaker created by the merger of Nippon Steel Corp. and
Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. in October, is scheduled to
report full-year result on May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
