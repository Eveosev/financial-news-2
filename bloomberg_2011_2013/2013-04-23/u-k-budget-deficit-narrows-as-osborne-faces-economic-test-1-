Britain’s budget deficit narrowed
more than economists forecast in March as capital spending fell,
providing a boost for Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne
as he faces new questions over his economic management.  The  shortfall  excluding temporary support for banks was
15.1 billion pounds ($23 billion), compared with 16.7 billion
pounds a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said
in London today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of 23 economists was for a deficit of 15.5 billion pounds.  Figures this week are forecast to show Britain narrowly
avoiding a third recession in five years, according to the
median of 20 economist estimates collected by Bloomberg. The
data may add to pressure on Osborne less than a week after Fitch
Ratings stripped the U.K. of its top credit grade and the
International Monetary Fund urged him to ease the pace of
deficit reduction. In the fiscal year that ended March, the
deficit narrowed to 120.6 billion pounds from 120.9 billion
pounds a year earlier.  “The rate of improvement in 2012/13 makes a snail look
fast, but at least the chancellor can say the finances moved in
the right direction,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS
Global Insight in  London . The figures, though, are “unlikely to
take the heat off and he faces another very difficult year ahead
of both the growth the public finance fronts.”  Tax and Spending  Tax income fell 5.7 percent in March from a year earlier.
Income-tax receipts dropped 12 percent and interest and
dividends plunged by a half, reflecting a revenue boost a year
earlier stemming from the reorganization of Britain’s social-
housing stock. Spending dropped 4.7 percent. Net investment
declined to 4.6 billion pounds from 7 billion pounds.  The pound remained weaker against the dollar after the data
were released. It was trading at $1.5220 as of 11:30 a.m. in
London, down 0.5 percent from yesterday. Gilts rose, pushing the
10-year yield down 2 basis points to 1.63 percent.  In the latest fiscal year revenue and spending both rose
1.8 percent. The overall budget shortfall, equal to 7.8 percent
of gross domestic product, was in line the  Office for Budget
Responsibility ’s forecast last month.  The figures exclude the 28-billion-pound transfer of Royal
Mail Group Ltd. pension assets and 6.4 billion pounds of gilt-
coupon income from the Bank of England’s bond-buying program.  Debt Sales  EU accounting rules restrict the amount of coupon income
the Treasury can count against net borrowing, though cash
measures of the public finances receive the full benefit. In
March, the central bank paid a third 3.8 billion-pound
installment.  The  public-sector cash requirement  was 31.3 billion pounds,
the highest for any March since records began in 1984. The
central government cash requirement was 109.5 billion pounds in
the 2012-13 fiscal year, 7.1 billion pounds higher than the OBR
forecast last month. The Debt Management Office announced after
the figures it was increasing planned debt sales for 2013-14 by
6.7 billion pounds, with 4.7 billion pounds coming from gilt
issuance.  The Treasury said in a statement that while the government
is fixing the country’s economic problems, it is taking time.  The lack of economic growth has undermined efforts to cut a
deficit that stood at a record 11.2 percent of GDP when Prime
Minister David Cameron took office almost three years ago by
sapping tax revenue and pushing up spending on welfare.  Missed Goals  OBR forecasts last month show the government borrowing 160
billion pounds more by April 2015 than had been forecast in June
2010, forcing the government to miss its target of balancing the
structural budget deficit within five years.  Fitch on April 19 became the second ratings company to
strip Britain of its top grade, citing a gross debt burden it
estimates will peak at 101 percent of GDP in 2015-16 compared
with 74 percent in 2010. Two days earlier, the IMF cut its 2013
growth outlook to 0.7 percent and urged Osborne to consider
easing his austerity program.  The U.K. economy probably grew 0.1 percent in the first
quarter, meaning it avoided an unprecedented triple-dip
recession after contracting 0.3 percent in three previous
months, Bloomberg forecasts show.  Britain has recovered little more than half of the output
lost during the financial crisis, lagging behind every other
Group of Seven nation bar Italy. The government blames the debt
crisis in the euro region, the biggest market for British
exports. The opposition Labour Party says Osborne has made the
situation worse by trying to cut the deficit too quickly.  Today’s figures showed net debt climbed to 75.4 percent of
GDP in March, or 1.19 trillion pounds. It is forecast by the OBR
to peak at 85.6 percent of GDP in 2016-17, three years later and
345 billion pounds higher than first envisaged.  European Union figures yesterday showed gross government
debt rose to 90 percent of GDP in 2012, compared with an EU
average of 85.3 percent and up from 85.5 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
