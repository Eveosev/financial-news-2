Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the debt-free maker of
the iPhone, said it plans to borrow to help finance an expanded
program to return capital to shareholders.  Apple will sell an unspecified amount of debt as it returns
$55 billion in cash to equity investors in a push to compensate
for a share price that’s been hammered by signs of slower
growth. The company has no  outstanding  bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The company plans to borrow and expects to announce more
details about this in the near future,” Cupertino, California-
based Apple said in a statement as it reported fiscal second-
quarter net income that fell 18 percent to $9.55 billion, or
$10.09 a share.  Standard & Poor’s  gave the company its AA+ grade, the
second-highest level of investment grade, and Moody’s Investors
Service ranked Apple an equivalent Aa1, according to statements
issued by the ratings firms.  Apple may be lifted to Moody’s top Aaa grade if changes in
U.S. corporate tax laws allow the company to repatriate cash
held overseas on a more tax-efficient basis, reducing the need
to borrow, wrote Gerald Granovsky, a senior vice president in 
that ratings firm’s corporate finance group.  At S&P, analyst Martha P. Toll-Reed wrote that Apple’s
potential for an upgrade is “constrained” by “highly
competitive and rapidly evolving market conditions.”  Apple could potentially sell $21.3 billion of debt and
still have the average debt-to-equity ratio of a top-rated
company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
