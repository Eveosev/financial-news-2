KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper and silver producer, headed for a seven-month low as UBS
AG downgraded the stock on falling commodity prices.  The  shares  sank 3.9 percent to 140.05 zloty at 11:07 a.m.
in Warsaw, poised to close at the lowest level since September
and extending  this year ’s decline to 26 percent. Copper fell to
an 18-month low in  London  today and touched levels not seen in
 Shanghai  since 2009 as manufacturing growth in  China , the
world’s biggest user of metals and energy, missed estimates.  KGHM’s stock slump this year isn’t “exaggerated given that
lower commodity prices not only will impact KGHM profits but
also increase its cost profile due to lower silver credits,”
Michal Potyra, an analyst at UBS in Warsaw, said in a research
note today.  UBS cut its recommendation for the state-controlled
producer to neutral from buy and lowered its price estimate to
150 zloty from 202 zloty.  The producer’s risk profile increased “significantly and
its mid-term dividend payment capacity is reduced,” according
to UBS, which expects next year’s dividend to drop to 9.6 zloty
a share and from 2014 earnings to 6.3 zloty.  This year KGHM shareholders will probably demand a “high
dividend” of 14.6 zloty per share, compared with 12 zloty a
share seen in a  Bloomberg forecast , according to UBS. The
government, which faces a widening budget deficit, holds a 32
percent stake in KGHM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
