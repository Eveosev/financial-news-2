Trading continued on the New
Zealand stock exchange after some traders were left without
access to live prices and market announcements for about two
hours due to a technical problem at  NZX Ltd. (NZX)   The market depth feed is now operating as normal, NZX, the
operator of the countryâ€™s stock exchange said in a statement.
Earlier NZX said it was unable to provide market announcements
or price information to the wider market. The cause of the
incident is being investigated, the exchange said in a
statement. Trading proceeded during the disruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
