The naira advanced for the first
time in nine days as the Central Bank of Nigeria sold dollars
directly to the market outside of its regular currency auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.1
percent to 158.70 per dollar by 3 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital, paring its retreat this month to 0.1 percent. The naira
has dropped 1.6 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $86 million today to lenders outside
its scheduled Monday and Wednesday auctions to keep the currency
stable, Ugochukwu Okoroafor, a spokesman for the regulator, said
by phone from Enugu in southeast Nigeria.  “Once they see the offer go to 159 then it’s a trigger for
them to come to the market,” Augustus Nwachukwu, a money-market
trader at  Stanbic IBTC Holding Co. (STANBIC) , said by phone today from
Lagos.  The central bank sold $246.5 million to lenders yesterday,
down from $266.2 million on April 17. The regulator uses the
auctions to stabilize the naira as the cost of importing refined
fuel, which accounts for 70 percent of the local gasoline
market, boosts dollar demand and puts pressure on the currency.  The central bank has enough reserves to defend the naira
and “keep it where we want,” Governor Lamido Sanusi said in a
March 24 interview in Lagos. Nigeria’s  foreign-currency reserves 
advanced 10 percent this year to $48.8 billion, according to
April 18 data compiled by the central bank.  Borrowing costs on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic
bonds due January 2022 fell four basis points to 11.42 percent,
according to yesterday’s data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined
four basis points to 4.07 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.1 percent to 1.9685 per dollar in
Accra, snapping five days of declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
