(Corrects December drop to 2.2 percent in third
paragraph.)  Canadian  retail sales  rose for a
second month in February, registering the biggest two-month gain
since 2011, on increased purchases at gasoline stations and new
 car dealerships .  Sales climbed 0.8 percent to C$39.5 billion ($38.4
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, following a
revised increase of 0.9 percent in the prior month. Economists
 surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  forecast a 0.3 percent increase,
based on the median of 21 projections.  The data suggest consumers may have recovered some
confidence after December’s 2.2 percent decline in sales, the
biggest drop in more than two years, and adds to evidence the
 economy  may be gathering speed after ending last year with the
slowest rate of growth since the 2009 recession.  In volume terms, sales were little changed, suggesting
gains stemmed from higher prices. That  measure  more closely
reflects the industry’s contribution to real economic growth.
Sales were up 1.5 percent from a year earlier,  Statistics Canada 
said.  Sales at new car dealers rose 2 percent in February, while
 gasoline stations  recorded a 1.9 percent rise. Purchases
 excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category increased 0.7
percent, faster than the 0.6 percent economists predicted.  Receipts advanced in seven of 11 categories marking 82
percent of total sales. Furniture and home furnishing stores led
declines with a 2.5 percent drop in proceeds, suggesting a
slowing housing market is having an impact on sales for that
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
