Faurecia,  Europe â€™s biggest maker
of car interiors, said first-quarter revenue rose 1.7 percent as
growing sales in North America and Asia offset the economic
slowdown in Europe.  Sales advanced to 4.37 billion euros ($5.7 billion) from
4.3 billion euros a year earlier, the Nanterre, France-based
manufacturer said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales outside
Europe accounted for 45 percent of the total in the first
quarter, compared to 39 percent a year earlier.  The French auto parts maker, 57 percent-owned by  PSA
Peugeot Citroen (UG) , plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in its home
region, or 7.5 percent of the workforce, by the end of this
year. Like its struggling parent and other carmakers in Europe,
it needs to cut capacity and expand in other markets as demand
in Europe falls for the sixth straight year in 2013.  Faurecia (EO)  said on Feb. 12 that vehicle sales in Europe may
decline by 4 percent to 5 percent this year.  Peugeot, which is scheduled to report first-quarter revenue
tomorrow, has sold assets to shore up its balance sheet as cash
reserves dwindle, adding uncertainty over its continued
ownership in the company.
