VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  rose the most
in more than six weeks after competitor  Ingenico (ING)  SA’s comments
suggested that the maker of credit-card terminals is taking back
market share.  VeriFone  shares  gained 7.6 percent to $20.07 at 3:02 p.m.
in New York after climbing as much as 13 percent for the biggest
intraday advance since March 6. The  San Jose , California-based
company’s stock had fallen 37 percent this year through
yesterday, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 9.6 percent.  Ingenico executives said yesterday on an earnings
conference call that business in the early part of the first
quarter was “ extremely high” and in the rest was “much more
in line” with its full-year outlook. Investors took that to
mean that later in the quarter, VeriFone began to regain market
share,  Gil Luria , a Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst in Los
Angeles, said in an interview. Luria rates VeriFone neutral.  The comments on the Neuilly-sur-Seine, France-based
company’s call may have eased concerns that have dogged VeriFone
since March, when Chief Executive Officer Douglas Bergeron was
dismissed. His departure followed VeriFone’s forecast for fiscal
second-quarter profit, which trailed analysts’ estimates amid
diminished demand for credit-card terminals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
