The  U.S. Mint  ran out of its
smallest American Eagle gold coin after demand surged following
the biggest drop in futures in three decades.  Sales of the coins weighing a 10th of an ounce were
suspended after demand more than doubled in 2013 from a year
earlier, the Mint said yesterday in a statement. Total  sales  of
American Eagles in April have almost tripled from a month
earlier, according to its website.  Shoppers from  India  to  China  and  Japan  joined consumers in
the U.S. and  Australia  in the rush to buy jewelry and coins
after futures slumped 13 percent in two days through April 15.
Indian buyers flocked to stores and banks for ornaments, coins
and bars as purchases from the Perth Mint in Australia doubled
and retail sales across China tripled.  “This week has been very busy for us,” Michael Kramer,
the president of New York-based MTB Inc., a dealer authorized to
purchase coins directly from the Mint. “We do not yet
anticipate suspension” of heavier coins, he said. The Mint also
sells 22-karat American Eagles of 1 ounce, half an ounce and a
quarter of an ounce.  “The 1-ounce gold bullion coins are the most popular,”
 Michael White , a Mint spokesman, said in the e-mail.  A rush by Indian consumers for bracelets and coins is
prompting jewelers to offer premiums on imports as traders and
banks run out of stockpiles, a trade group said yesterday.
Jewelers in big cities are paying as much as 800 rupees ($14.73)
per 10 grams (0.02 pounds) while retailers in some remote areas
are paying about 1,200 rupees per 10 grams as a premium,
according to Haresh Soni, chairman of the All India Gems &
Jewellery Trade Federation.  Hong Kong, Japan  Overseas purchases may jump 36 percent to 305 metric tons
in the three months ending June from 225 tons a year earlier,
Mohit Kamboj, president of the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd.,
said last week. Imports may climb as much as 20 percent this
month from year earlier, he said.  Volumes of gold products sold jumped 150 percent in  Hong
Kong  and Macau during the April 13 weekend compared with the
weekend before, according to Dennis Lau, director of sales
operations at  Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. (116) , last
week. Retail sales tripled across China on April 15-16, the
China Gold Association reported.  Japanese consumers are poised to become net buyers of gold
for the first time in eight years as the yen’s decline and
looming inflation drive them to seek refuge in bullion,
according to Standard Bank Plc.  Futures on the Comex in New York climbed 1.1 percent to
$1,424.90 an ounce by 5 p.m. in  Singapore , about $100 above the
$1,321.50 reached on April 16, which was the lowest level in
more than two years. Prices have plunged 26 percent from the
record $1,923.70 in September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
