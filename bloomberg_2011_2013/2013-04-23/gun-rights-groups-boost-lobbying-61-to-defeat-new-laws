Supporters of gun-owners’ rights
spent almost $1.5 million during the first three months of this
year -- a 61 percent increase over the same time last year -- to
defeat Senate proposals restricting firearm purchases after the
slaughter of 20 elementary school students in  Connecticut .  Advocates of new gun legislation also boosted their
lobbying spending by at least fivefold in the first quarter of
2013 compared with a year earlier. The Senate on April 17 failed
to pass legislation expanding background checks for gun
 purchasers  and a renewal of an assault weapons ban.  The  National Rifle Association  reported spending $700,000
on lobbying from January to March, congressional disclosures
show. That was up from $575,000 during the same period a year
ago. Another gun rights organization, Gun Owners of America,
boosted its spending to $313,032 in 2013 from $272,075 in 2012.  The National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc., the trade
group for gun manufacturers such as Sturm Ruger & Co. Inc. and
 Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC) , spent $480,000, six times the
$80,000 spent a year ago.  The foundation is based in Newtown, Connecticut, near Sandy
Hook Elementary School students, where the children and six
adults were killed Dec. 14, spurring a call for new gun
legislation.  The NRA also reported hiring additional outside lobbyists,
including Scott Styles, former chief of staff to House Rules
Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican.  On the other side, Mayors Against Illegal Guns formally
registered to lobby on April 1. The group was co-founded by  New
York  City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , the founder and majority
owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  Pro-Restrictions Lobby  The organization spent $250,000 during the first quarter of
2013 on outside lobbyists, a fivefold increase over the $50,000
spent during the first three months of 2012.  The mayors’ group, too, brought in additional outside
lobbyists who formerly worked in government, including Jamie
Hantman, a one-time aide to President  George W. Bush ; Carlyle
Thorsen, a former deputy attorney general and aide to House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican; and Robert Stevenson, a former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader  Bill
Frist , a Tennessee Republican.  The hires came before the Senate fell short of the 60 votes
needed to advance legislation requiring background checks for
most gun purchases and the weapons ban.  Currently, those buying firearms at gun shows and online do
not have to undergo the checks in some states as compared with
those buying from registered dealers.  The background checks amendment was favored by a majority,
54 senators. It was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators,
led by Democrat  Joe Manchin  of West Virginia and Republican  Pat Toomey  of Pennsylvania, in response to the Newtown killings. The
assault weapons ban drew 40 favorable votes from the Senate’s
100 members.  A Jan. 30-Feb. 2 poll by  Quinnipiac University  in Hamden,
Connecticut, showed 92 percent of registered voters favoring
expanded background checks, including 91 percent of gun-owning
households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
