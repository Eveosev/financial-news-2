SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-
largest maker of computer memory chips, posted first-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates amid a rebound in prices for
semiconductors used in personal computers.  The company turned to  net income  of 178.7 billion won ($159
million) in the three months ended March from a loss of 271
billion won a year earlier, Icheon, South Korea-based Hynix said
in a regulatory filing today. That compares with the 172 billion
won average of 25  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  SK Hynix, a  supplier  to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , is shifting its focus
to more profitable mobile dynamic random access memory, or DRAM,
chips amid rising demand for smartphones and production cuts by
smaller rivals. Demand from handset makers including  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  will drive sales and improve earnings in the
second quarter, said Oh Sang Woo, an analyst at Leading
Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul .  “A strong earnings improvement is expected in the second
quarter,” Kim Young Chan, an analyst at Shinhan Investment
Corp. in Seoul, said before the announcement. “PC DRAM prices
will continue to rise, while the global mobile DRAM chip supply
will be in shortage.”  Hynix fell 0.5 percent to 28,850 won in Seoul trading
yesterday. The stock has gained 12 percent this year.  Operating profit, or sales excluding the cost of goods sold
and administrative costs, was 317 billion won on sales of 2.8
trillion won.  The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM rose to
$1.74 on Mar. 29 from $1 a year earlier, according to TrendForce
Corp.’s DRAMeXchange,  Asia ’s largest market for the components.  The pace of price drops in mobile DRAM will slow to about
1.1 percent in the fourth quarter from about 9.2 percent in the
first quarter, said KB Investment & Securities analyst Byun Han
Joon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
