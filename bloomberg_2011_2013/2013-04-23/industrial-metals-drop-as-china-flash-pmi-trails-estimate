Copper slumped to an 18-month low
in  New York  after manufacturing was weaker than estimated in
 China , the world’s biggest metals consumer.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for
China fell to 50.5 for April, below the 51.5 projected in a
Bloomberg News survey, data released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics showed. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. Euro-area services and factory output shrank for a
15th month, while a manufacturing index in the U.S. dropped more
than forecast, separate reports showed.  “Metal prices are down once again, this time on account of
growing concern over the poor macro readings out of China,”
 Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone in New York, said in a
report. The PMI figures were “indicative of overcapacity in the
supply chain and soft demand,” he said.  Copper futures for delivery in July declined 1.3 percent to
settle at $3.104 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices earlier touched $3.0685, the lowest since Oct. 20, 2011,
after entering a  bear market  last week.  Morgan Stanley cut its price forecasts for industrial
metals today, citing a “soft patch” in the global economy.
Copper will average $3.53 this year, 9 percent less than
previously estimated, the bank said in a report.  Copper  stockpiles  tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange
increased 1.4 percent to 621,600 metric tons, the highest since
August 2003, exchange figures showed.  As of April 19, the number of copper futures outstanding in
London, or open interest, rose to the highest since December
2011, exchange figures showed today.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months fell 0.9
percent to $6,870 a ton ($3.12 a pound).  Nickel, tin and zinc also retreated in London. Aluminum and
lead gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
