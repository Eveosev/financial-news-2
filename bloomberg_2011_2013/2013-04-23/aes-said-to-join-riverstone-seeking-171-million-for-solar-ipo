AES Corp. (AES)  and Riverstone Holdings
LLC are seeking to raise C$175 million ($170.6 million) by
selling part of their solar-power plant partnership in a
Canadian initial public offering, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction.  Silver Ridge Power Inc., formed in July by Arlington,
Virginia-based AES and New York-based private-equity firm
Riverstone, plans to sell shares and list on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the terms aren’t public.  Silver Ridge will acquire solar plants and projects owned
by AES  Solar Energy Ltd. (SLRE) , a March 2008 joint venture between AES
and Riverstone, when the offering is completed, according to an
April 4 filing with Canadian regulators. The plants, located in
the U.S.,  Europe  and India, will have a generating capacity of
522 megawatts when the Mount Signal project in  California  is
fully operational by next year, according to the filing.  Ellen Gallup, a spokeswoman for AES Solar, declined to
comment. An e-mail message left with Robert Hemphill Jr., chief
executive officer of Silver Ridge, and telephone messages with
AES and Riverstone weren’t immediately returned.  Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. are leading the sale, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
