Swedish  unemployment  unexpectedly
rose as a strengthening krona and faltering demand from
recession-plagued Europe hurt demand for the largest Nordic
economy’s exports.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment  rose to 8.4 percent from
8.2 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based  Statistics
Sweden  said today. The rate  was predicted  to stay unchanged,
according to the median estimate of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The  non-seasonally adjusted rate  rose to 8.8 percent
from 8.5 percent.  Sweden’s government last week announced increased spending
on infrastructure and education over the next two years to cut
unemployment, which it estimates will average 8.3 percent this
year, up from 8 percent in 2012. The central bank last week
delayed the timing of its next interest rate rise by about a
year to late 2014, citing a strengthening krona and inability of
companies to raise prices because of weak demand.  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest maker of mobile phone
networks, and truck maker Volvo AB, are among exporters who have
announced they will cut jobs.  Sweden  sells about half of its
output abroad, of which about 70 percent go to Europe where
countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
