South African wheat futures dropped
the most in three weeks as prices for the grain fell in the U.S.
after Russian exports and plantings increased.  Wheat for delivery in July, the most active contract,
decreased 1 percent, the most since April 2, to 3,440 rand
($372) a metric ton by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg.  Wheat for July delivery declined for a second day on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Russian farmers planted 2.7 million
hectares (6.7 million acres) of spring grains as of yesterday,
compared with 1.43 million hectares at the same time a year ago,
Interfax reported, citing Agriculture Ministry data. Exports
from  Russia , the world’s fourth-biggest wheat producer, surged
57 percent in the first 17 days of this month compared with the
first 20 days of March, according to the ministry.  “U.S. prices went down today because better planting
weather is anticipated,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at
Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in July fell 0.4 percent to 2,168
rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in the same
month declined 0.2 percent to 2,146.80 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
