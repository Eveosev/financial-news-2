Japanese consumers are poised to
become net buyers of gold for the first time in eight years as
the yen’s decline and looming inflation drive them to seek
refuge in bullion, according to Standard Bank Plc.  Net sales of gold bars and coins by Japanese individuals
shrank to 10.1 metric tons in 2012, the smallest amount since
2005, data from the World Gold Council show. A surge in
purchases this month and the chance to buy after bullion slumped
into a bear market foreshadow a turnaround in 2013, said Bruce Ikemizu, Standard Bank’s head of commodities trading in Tokyo.  The currency has depreciated 13 percent against the dollar
this year and is trading near a four-year low after the central
bank’s pursuit of unprecedented monetary easing to end deflation
was unopposed by Group of 20 nations. Inflation may rise above 1
percent in the 12 months starting April 2014 and approach a 2
percent target as early as that year,  Bank of Japan (8301)  policy board
member Ryuzo Miyao said April 18.  “The time has come for Japanese to buy gold with the
government trying to engineer inflation,” Ikemizu, who has
traded commodities for almost three decades, said in an
interview in Tokyo yesterday. “Retail investors are turning
from sellers to buyers of bullion.”  Japanese households have 1,547 trillion yen ($15.6
trillion) in  financial assets , according BOJ data. They
purchased 22.9 tons of gold last year from Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo K.K., Japan’s largest gold retailer, and sold 28.6 tons to
the company, at an average price of 4,321 yen a gram.  Tocom Gold  Yen-denominated gold futures on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange climbed to a record 5,081 yen a gram on Feb. 7, before
slumping along with dollar-priced bullion this month. The retail
price of gold bars in  Japan  advanced to the highest level since
1980 on April 10, according to Tanaka Kikinzoku.  Tocom gold futures fell 0.3 percent to 4,553 yen a gram at
9:04 a.m. in Tokyo. Gold for immediate delivery posted the
biggest decline since 1983 on April 15, and slid to $1,321.95 on
April 16, the lowest level since January 2011. It was down 0.3
percent at $1,422.48 at 9:04 a.m.  Gold for delivery in Tokyo was offered at $1 to $1.50 an
ounce higher than the metal for delivery in  London  last week, as
gold stockpiled by Japanese bullion houses was depleted because
of surging demand from consumers, Ikemizu said.  Every one-yen depreciation in the Japanese currency against
the dollar can boost bullion prices in Japan by 50 yen a gram,
assuming the international market is unchanged, Masahiro Arai,
general manager at Tokuriki Honten Co., the nation’s second-
largest bullion retailer, said on April 16.  Purchases from Japan will partially absorb metal flowing
out of exchange-traded funds such as  SPDR (GLD)  Gold Trust and give
support to the international market, according to Ikemizu.  India, China  In India and  China , the biggest gold-consuming nations,
shoppers last week lined up in bazaars from  Mumbai  to  Shanghai 
to buy the metal for brides, babies and strongboxes after prices
fell. Indian consumers bought a net 312.2 tons of gold bars and
coins in 2012, while purchases by individuals in China reached
265.5 tons, according to the World Gold Council.  Ending deflation would pave the way for Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe to go ahead with a plan to double sales tax
to 10 percent by October 2015 to reduce the nation’s fiscal
deficit. The prospect of higher taxes has also spurred consumers
to buy gold, Kate Harada, general manager at the precious metals
department of Tanaka Kikinzoku, said in an interview in  Tokyo  on
April 16.  “As Japanese begin paying more for fuel and some foods
because of a weakening yen, they’re wondering how to hedge the
risk of rising prices,” she said. “Gold is sought to protect
against inflation and the yen’s debasement.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
