Swiss stocks  advanced for the third
time in four days as Cie. Financiere Richemont SA posted profit
that beat forecasts and  Novartis AG (NOVN)  said its lung-disease drug
met its objective in a study.  Richemont, the owner of the Cartier brand, jumped the most
since early January as full-year net income jumped about 30
percent. Novartis rose 1 percent. DKSH Holding AG fell 1.2
percent as HSBC Holdings Plc gave it a rating similar to sell.  The Swiss Market Index gained 0.7 percent to 7,661.11 at 10
a.m. in Zurich. The benchmark gauge dropped 1.8 percent last
week as economic reports from the U.S., China and  Germany  missed
forecasts. The measure has still rallied 12 percent so far this
year. The broader Swiss Performance Index also climbed 0.6
percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 43 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Richemont (CFR)  advanced 5.7 percent to 72.05 Swiss francs,
contributing the most to gains on the SMI. Net income growth in
the year through March beat analystsâ€™ average estimate of a 25
percent increase. Operating profit rose about 18 percent,
matching projections.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of Swiss watches,
climbed 1.5 percent to 519 francs. Swiss watch exports rose 0.6
percent in March after a 2.5 percent drop the previous month.  Novartis climbed 1 percent to 68.25 francs. The drugmaker
said a study showed its once-daily QVA149 drug improved lung
function and quality of life in patients of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  Georg Fischer AG (FI/N) , the maker of auto parts and piping
systems, rose 1.9 percent to 387.75 francs. The company won an
order for truck parts worth more than 380 million francs ($405
million).  DKSH (DKSH)  fell 1.2 percent to 83.50 francs after HSBC started
coverage of the company with an underweight rating. HSBC set its
12-month price estimate for the marketing and services company
at 50 francs, citing pressure on profit margins and the
likelihood of increased competition in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
