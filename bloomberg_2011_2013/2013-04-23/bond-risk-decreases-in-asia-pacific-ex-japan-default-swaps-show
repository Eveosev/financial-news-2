The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased in the Asia-Pacific
region outside  Japan , according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 0.5 of a basis point
to 113 basis points as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge is on course for its lowest close
since April 12, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 1 basis point to 112.5 as of
8:42 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  prices
show. The benchmark has fallen 9.8 basis points this month,
according to RBS and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 of a basis point to
92 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank prices
show. The measure has fallen 21 basis points this month,
according to Deutsche Bank and CMA prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
