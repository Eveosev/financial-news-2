The European Commission’s antitrust
probe into whether  Google Inc. (GOOG)  favors its own services over
competitors in search results will conclude “towards the end of
the summer break,” at the earliest, L’Echo quoted EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  as saying in an
interview.  The commission will begin a so-called market test, in which
is seeks views from industry on concessions offered by Google,
“in the coming days,” the newspaper cited Almunia as saying.  “In the best case scenario, the decision could come
towards the end of the summer break, if we take the optimistic
hypothesis that there is an agreement,” Almunia told L’Echo in
the interview.  Should efforts to reach a settlement fail, then “Google
risks a long confrontation,” Almunia was quoted as saying. “We
would present a statement of objections. That would lead to
bans. But I continue to think that the option of an agreement is
the best.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
