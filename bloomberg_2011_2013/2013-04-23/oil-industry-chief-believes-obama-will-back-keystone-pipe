President Jack Gerard said he believes President  Barack Obama 
will approve the Keystone XL Pipeline this year, after another
environmental-impact study of the proposal is complete.  “When it’s all said and done, the president will approve
the pipeline,” Gerard said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Radio’s “The Hays Advantage” with Kathleen Hays and Vonnie Quinn. “It’s a very important part of the broader
infrastructure necessary to make the United States more energy
secure.”  Obama may approve the $5.3 billion  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) 
project as early as July, Gerard said. Critics of the plan
including The Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council
said they’ve collected more than 1 million comments against the
pipeline, which they assert will exacerbate global warming and
threaten water supplies.  “We have a long track record that shows it’s a safe
technology -- as we continue to improve it, it will become even
safer,” Gerard said. “There’s never been a case of groundwater
contamination as a result of hydraulic fracturing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
