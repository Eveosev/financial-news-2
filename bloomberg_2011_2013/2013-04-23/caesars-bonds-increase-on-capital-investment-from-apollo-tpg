Bonds of Caesars Entertainment
Corp. rose after the largest owner of U.S. casinos announced a
new venture to help finance growth, including a $500 million
investment from Apollo Global Management Holdings LLC and TPG
Capital LP.  The company’s $3.3 billion of 10 percent, second-lien notes
maturing in December 2018 increased 0.8 cent on the dollar to
65.5 cents at 9:03 a.m. in New York, the highest since April 17,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt yields 20.6
percent.  The venture, Caesars Growth Partners LLC, intends to use
proceeds to buy a stake in Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in
Las Vegas from a Caesars subsidiary, according to a statement
today. The investment may increase to $1.2 billion if all
subscription rights are exercised in full, Caesars said.  Caesars was acquired by the private equity firms Apollo and
TPG for $30.7 billion in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
