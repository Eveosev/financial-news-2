Electricite de France SA  will
reduce staff at its project to build the U.K.’s first new
nuclear plants in almost two decades, as the French utility
seeks to curb costs as power price talks continue.  The decision to “refocus its activities” at the Hinkley
Point C plant where about 800 people are employed “reflects its
priorities ahead of securing the financing necessary for the
project,” EDF said today in a statement. The company declined
to give a figure for cuts when contacted by phone.  The utility has been in talks with the British government
to agree a deal guaranteeing the price EDF will earn for power
from the two reactors in Somerset, southwest  England . U.K.
lawmakers have warned a failure to build new nuclear plants will
jeopardize the country’s chances of meeting its legally binding
obligations to slash  greenhouse gases .  “Negotiations with the U.K. government to agree a contract
for the electricity from Hinkley Point C are making progress,”
the company said in today’s statement.  EDF Chief Executive
Officer  Henri Proglio  said April 18 the French utility may let
talks fail if the parties can’t agree a price.  EDF has already spent 480 million euros ($624 million) at
the project, which would have a total capacity of 3,260
megawatts, enough to supply 5 million homes for 60 years, it
said in February. Pre-construction engineering work at the site
continues, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
