A powerful explosion early today
rocked the French Embassy in Libya, wounding two of its guards,
an official with the prime minister’s office said.  The blast also shook nearby houses in the upscale Tripoli
district of Hay al-Andalus, Muftah Beleid, an official in the
premier’s press office, said by phone. He said the explosion
damaged the embassy building, though didn’t provide details or
comment on the type of bomb.  The incident was the latest example of the security
challenges gripping the oil-rich North African nation since the
2011 ouster and subsequent death of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi.  Since then, Libya’s new central government has struggled to
rein in armed militias and Islamist militants, including those
blamed for the September death of the U.S. ambassador to the
country. Several foreign missions and diplomats have been
targeted by militants, mostly in the eastern part of Libya where
the uprising against Qaddafi originated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
