The  yuan  climbed to within 0.1
percent of a 19-year high after the People’s Bank of  China 
boosted the currency’s reference rate.  The central bank raised the  fixing  by 0.09 percent to
6.2360 per dollar today and the spot rate was 0.91 percent
stronger than that. A preliminary April reading of 50.5 for a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics was less than the median estimate of 51.5 in a
Bloomberg survey. The final PMI for March was 51.6 and a reading
of 50 or above indicates expansion.  “Capital is flowing into China on bets the yuan will
appreciate and the government will keep delivering stable
growth, even though it’s not as strong as expected,” said Kenix Lai, a foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. in
 Hong Kong .  The yuan gained 0.06 percent to close at 6.1791 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency touched 6.1756 earlier. That’s close to
6.1723 reached on April 17, the strongest level since the
government unified the official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  China’s economy  expanded 7.7 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, slowing from a 7.9 percent growth in the
previous three months.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was steady at
6.1778 per dollar, from yesterday’s 6.1780, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
slipped 0.02 percent to 6.2550, trading at a 1.2 percent
discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
