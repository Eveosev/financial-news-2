United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the only U.S. carrier to operate  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787, ferried the
first of its Dreamliners to a Texas facility for installation of
a new battery system that U.S. regulators approved last week.  The plane was flown today by three United pilots from  Los
Angeles , where it had been grounded, to Kelly Field in San
Antonio, Christen David, a spokeswoman for United, said in a
telephone interview. The flight went as planned, David said.  United is working with Boeing on a schedule for installing
the battery system on its other five Dreamliners, David said.
Battery faults that sparked a fire on a Japan Airlines Co. 787
in Boston and forced an emergency landing by an ANA Holdings
Inc. jet in January triggered a global grounding of the plane.  Boeing has said it will take about five days per jet to
install the new battery system, which includes more protection
around power cells, a steel enclosure to prevent fire and a tube
that vents fumes outside the fuselage.  There’s no change to United’s dates of May 31 for resuming
domestic 787 flights and June 10 for international service,
David said.  The  Federal Aviation Administration  grounded the Dreamliner
on Jan. 16. The FAA approved Boeing’s fix for the batteries on
April 19, paving the way for the 787 to resume commercial
flights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
