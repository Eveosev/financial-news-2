Publicis Groupe SA (PUB) , the world’s
third-biggest advertising company, will work with Twitter Inc.
on how to make money out of the micro-blogging service’s
audience, Chief Executive Officer  Maurice Levy  said today.  Publicis’s Starcom MediaVest Group “will find the way to
monetize their audience,” Levy said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television with Francine Lacqua. “This could be pop-
ups, this could be video, this could be new formats so we are
working very hard with Twitter to find the right way to
commercialize their space.”  The CEO said the deal with San Francisco-based Twitter may
involve spending “between four to six hundred million dollars
over a period of three, four years.”  Levy will speak with Publicis investors today in London to
update them on the company’s outlook and strategy. The Paris-
based company last week reported first-quarter sales rose 1.3
percent, missing analyst estimates, and characterized 2013 as a
“difficult” year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
