The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.234
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in April 2015, yielded 0.230
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. The record auction low was 0.220 percent on July 24.  The size of today’s offering is the same as at the past 30
sales of two-year notes after peaking at $44 billion from
October 2009 through April 2010.  The March 26 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.27, the lowest since July 2011 and down from 3.77 at the
January sale. The average for the past 10 auctions was 3.72.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 20.6 percent of the notes at the
February sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 25.8
percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 21.8 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 22.5
percent at the past 10.  Two-year notes have gained 0.1 percent this year, versus
0.7 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year securities returned 0.3
percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on April 25. The Treasury sold $18 billion of five-
year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities on April 18.  The sales will raise $59.05 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $57.95 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
