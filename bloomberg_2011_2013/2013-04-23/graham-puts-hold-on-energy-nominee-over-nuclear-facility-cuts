Senator Lindsey Graham , a South
Carolina Republican, is blocking a vote on the nomination of
Ernest Moniz to be energy secretary over proposed funding cuts
to a nuclear processing facility in his home state.  The U.S. Energy Department’s budget requested $503 million
in fiscal year 2014, down from $667 million in 2012, for a
program that includes a plant being built in South Carolina to
convert weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for nuclear power
plants.  The project is being led by a consortium that includes
Paris-based  Areva SA. (AREVA)   Tate Zeigler, a spokesman for Graham, confirmed that the
senator had placed a hold on Moniz’s nomination. Bloomberg BNA
earlier reported Graham was upset about reduced spending for the
processing plant, which is behind schedule and over budget.  Graham planned to meet with Moniz, who serves as the head
of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology , tomorrow,
Bloomberg BNA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
