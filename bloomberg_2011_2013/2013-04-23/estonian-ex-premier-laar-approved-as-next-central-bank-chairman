Mart Laar was confirmed as the next
supervisory board chairman of  Estonia ’s central bank after
parliament swept aside criticism of the former prime minister by
the opposition for refusing to quit his junior coalition party.  Lawmakers voted 46-34 with four abstentions today in the
capital, Tallinn, to back Laar, 53, who’ll replace outgoing Jaan Mannik for a five-year term starting June 13, according to the
parliament  website .  Laar, Estonia’s first elected prime minister after the
country regained independence in 1991, liberalized prices and
began to sell off state assets in the Baltic nation. During his
tenure, Estonia became the first country in eastern  Europe  to
introduce a flat income tax in 1994. Laar, who resigned as
defense minister last May after suffering a stroke three months
earlier, returned to parliament in November.  “Mart Laar, who has withdrawn from party politics having
twice served as prime minister of the Republic of Estonia and
who was one of the chief architects of the economic reforms that
laid the foundation for Estonia’s success, is a tough person
with excellent willpower,” President Toomas Ilves said on April
9 when proposing Laar’s candidacy.  The country’s political opposition has criticized Laar’s
nomination for threatening the central bank’s independence. Laar
told the  Postimees newspaper  in an interview this month that he
won’t quit Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit, saying his only link with
the party is limited to serving as its honorary chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
