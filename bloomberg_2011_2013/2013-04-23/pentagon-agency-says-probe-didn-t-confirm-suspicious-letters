Further investigation didn’t
confirm an initial alert by screening equipment of a potentially
harmful substance at a military base in  Washington , the Defense
Intelligence Agency said in an e-mailed statement.  “After thorough on-scene investigation, no suspicious
packages or letters were located,” the agency said. “The FBI
took samples and will conduct further testing off-site.”  Earlier today, the agency said a “potentially harmful
substance” was found in mail at Bolling Air Force Base in
Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
