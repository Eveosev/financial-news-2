BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  is deploying
smaller suppliers to pressure U.S. lawmakers to speed up orders
to modernize Bradley fighting vehicles, a move the company said
may protect thousands of subcontractor jobs and keep a
 Pennsylvania  assembly line open.  Representatives of between 30 and 40 of the vehicle’s more
than 586 suppliers are lobbying Congress to shift orders to the
2014 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, instead of waiting until
fiscal 2015 and 2016 as outlined in President  Barack Obama ’s
budget proposal.  The Army’s plans would pause a Bradley fighting vehicle
production line from 2014 until at least 2017, putting at risk
1,200 jobs at BAE’s plant in York, Pennsylvania, Mark Signorelli, BAE’s general manager of vehicle systems, has said.  The move may eliminate as many as 7,000 additional
subcontractor jobs, Signorelli has said. Bradley suppliers
include  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL) ,  Cummins Inc. (CMI) , and DRS
Technologies Inc., according to London-based BAE.  Bringing forward future orders would help keep suppliers in
business and deter skilled workers from looking for jobs in
other industries, John Polacek, chief operating officer of
Johnstown, Pennsylvania-based JWF Defense Systems LLC, said
today. Polacek’s company cuts aluminum and welds it to the
precise specifications for use in the Cold War-era Bradley
vehicles.  “We’re fighting off brain-drain of young people leaving
our town and moving to places like Washington, D.C.,” said
Polacek, whose roughly 400-person company had 700 employees in
2008. “When you’re in a rural town, people leave if they can’t
find work.”  Conversion Plan  BAE wants Congress to fast-track into fiscal 2014 plans to
convert 93 Bradley M3 Cavalry vehicles to M2 Infantry Fighting
Vehicles. The London-based company is also pushing to equip some
Bradley units with thermal vision capabilities, so all of the
vehicles have the increased ability to detect hazards.  “We are now faced next year with a shutdown if nothing
happens,” said Alice Conner, a director of manufacturing
integration and deployment for BAE at the York facility. “It
hits the suppliers first.”  The U.S. military has cut spending on ground vehicles after
withdrawing from  Iraq  and planning to pull most U.S. troops from
 Afghanistan  by the end of 2014. BAE’s defense contracts dropped
more than 60 percent to $6.11 billion in fiscal 2012 from $16.3
billion in fiscal 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BAE estimates it would cost as much as $750 million to shut
the Bradley line in York and re-start production in 2017, when
the Army plans more upgrades. The Army would save money by
funding some Bradley work in York through 2017 and increasing
BAE’s activities on other vehicles, according to the company.  The Pentagon is grappling with automatic budget cuts known
as sequestration that would total $500 billion over nine years.
Those reductions are on top of $487 billion in already-planned
defense cuts over a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
