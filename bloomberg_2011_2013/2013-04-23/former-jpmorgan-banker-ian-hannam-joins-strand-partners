Ian Hannam, the former  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  banker advising mining companies, has joined
corporate-advisory firm Strand Partners Ltd.  Hannam, 57, started with Strand Partners this month,
according to the  Financial Services Register  records. His
private firm Elgin Partners has bought Strand Partners,
according to Financial News, which reported the story earlier.
Hannam declined to comment when contacted by telephone.  Hannam, a former JPMorgan chairman of equity-capital
markets, stepped down in April last year to appeal a decision by
the U.K.â€™s financial-services regulator to fine him 450,000
pounds ($686,000) for market abuse. He e-mailed a potential
customer in 2008 with details of a bid for his client  Heritage
Oil Plc (HOIL) , as well as news of an oil find, it said at the time.
Hannam said in a statement then he would appeal and planned to
continue his financial career after the dispute is over.  Based in  London , Hannam was among bankers advising  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) , the subject of a bid by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  last
year. At JPMorgan, which also served as a broker to Xstrata,
Hannam helped the mining company first sell shares in 2002, and
was involved in many of its subsequent transactions, including
the $18.1 billion purchase of the Canadian nickel producer
Falconbridge Ltd. in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
