Canada’s export financing agency
says growth in  shipments  of goods abroad will quicken to 9
percent this year from 1.9 percent in 2012 as U.S. housing and
business investment picks up.  The pace of export growth will slow to 5 percent in 2014,
Export Development Canada chief economist  Peter Hall  wrote in a
report today.  Canada sells three-quarters of its goods to the U.S., with
lumber, machinery and energy goods among the most-important
products. Exporters may benefit from higher orders because
consumer and business demand is leading the  U.S. economy  as
 government spending  is curtailed, according to the EDC report.  “ Consumer spending  is vibrant again, this time without
diving into debt,” Hall said about the U.S. in a semi-annual
Global Export Forecast. “Already in comeback mode, business
investment has only just begun.”  U.S. growth will accelerate from 2.3 percent this year to
3.3 percent next year, according to the report. The world
economy will grow 3.6 percent this year and 4.2 percent in 2014.
Canada’s dollar will weaken to an average of 97 U.S. cents this
year and 96 U.S. cents next year, EDC predicted.  EDC’s export forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of
Canada’s assessment last week, which said exports are being
hobbled by a strong Canadian dollar and the need for companies
to invest more and regain competitiveness.  The agency’s forecast for 2.2 percent growth in Canada this
year and 1.9 percent in 2014 compares with the central bank’s
 outlook  for expansions of 1.5 percent and 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
