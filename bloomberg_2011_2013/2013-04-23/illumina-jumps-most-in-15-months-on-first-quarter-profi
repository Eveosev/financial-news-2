Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  rose the most in
almost 15 months after the maker of genetic decoders reported
earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates on higher sales.  Illumina climbed 13 percent to $62.44 at the close in  New
York , its biggest intraday gain since Jan. 25, 2012. The San
Diego-based company reported first-quarter earnings excluding
one-time items of 46 cents a share, beating the 38 cent average
of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Illumina’s machines provide a full transcript of a person’s
DNA, information that is used to diagnose rare disease, identify
the risk for a genetic condition, or match cancer treatments to
patients’ tumors. The company’s shares tumbled in January after
 Roche Holding AG  indicated it may no longer be interested in
buying the company after a year of talks.  Revenue rose 21 percent to $331 million from a year
earlier. The company reported a net loss of $23 million, or 18
cents a share, hurt by $106.9 million in costs related to a
patent dispute with Syntrix Biosystems Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
