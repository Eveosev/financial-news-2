Zambian president  Michael Sata 
suspended Clive Chirwa five months after his appointment as
chief executive officer of the state-owned railway company in
 Africa ’s biggest copper producer.  Chirwa, previously an automotive and aerospace professor at
Bolton University in the U.K., is being investigated following
claims of corruption, Sata’s office said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “The Anti-Corruption Commission has been instructed to
carry out full investigations concerning the allegations,” Sata
said in an extract of a letter to Chirwa, who must leave a house
provided by Zambia Railways Ltd.  The southern African nation is seeking to upgrade its
1,200-kilometer (746-mile) railway system which Sata said Nov.
15 had “deteriorated beyond description” under the private
operators whose contract he canceled in September. Zambia
Railways planned to spend as much as $1.5 billion over five
years to refurbish the land-locked country’s system and build
new lines. Mining companies including Konkola Copper Mines Plc,
the local unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , is seeking to lower its
costs by using the railway to transport copper.  Chirwa didn’t answer two calls to his mobile phone or reply
to an e-mail seeking comment.  Sata appointed Muyenga Atanga, permanent secretary at the
Ministry of Transport Works, Supply and Communications to “take
charge” of Zambia Railways with immediate effect, he said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
