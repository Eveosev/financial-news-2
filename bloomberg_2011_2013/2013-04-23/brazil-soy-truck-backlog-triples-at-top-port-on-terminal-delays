Trucks waiting to unload soybeans
and corn at  Brazil ’s largest port more than tripled in number
today because of delays at a grains and oilseeds terminal.  The line of trucks waiting at the Port of Santos reached as
many as 21.1 miles, up from 5.6 miles earlier, road operator
Ecovias said in an e-mail. The line later decreased to 10.6
miles, Ecovias said in a separate statement. The disruption
occurred at the T-Grao Cargo Terminal de Graneis SA terminal, a
press official at the Port of Santos said by telephone, without
providing further details.  Brazil, forecast to surpass the U.S. as the top soybean
producer in the current 2012/2013 season, has faced road and
port bottlenecks since growers started harvesting a record crop
in January. Brazilian producers will reap 83.5 million metric
tons of the oilseed, compared with American output of about 82.1
million tons, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates.  There were 214 vessels waiting to load 12.2 million tons of
soybeans at Santos, down from 221 ships a week earlier,
consulting firm SA Commodities said yesterday.  T-Grao didn’t immediately return an e-mail from Bloomberg
News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
