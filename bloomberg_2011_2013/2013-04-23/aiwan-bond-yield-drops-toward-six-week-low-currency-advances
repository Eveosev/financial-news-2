with the five-year yield dropping toward a six-week low, as
investors sought safety in sovereign debt amid signs the local
economy is weakening. The local dollar rose.  Export orders  slumped 6.6 percent in March from a year
earlier, official data showed yesterday, compared with the

percent a month earlier. Overseas shipments are equivalent to
about two-thirds of the island’s gross domestic product.  “The road to higher growth this year is very bumpy,” said
Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp., which oversees $700 million. “We’re still not
getting a clear direction from fundamentals. It’s causing more
volatilities in the  bond market .”  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 fell

according to Gretai Securities Market prices. The rate touched
0.918 percent on April 18, the lowest level since March 8.  The central bank will sell NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of

its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. It was
little changed one minute before the 4 p.m. close yesterday and
finished 0.1 percent weaker. The central bank has sold the local
dollar in the run-up to the close on most days in the past year,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  Currency Forwards  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
