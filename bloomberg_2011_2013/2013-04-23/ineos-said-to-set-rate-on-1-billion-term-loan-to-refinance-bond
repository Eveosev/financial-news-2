Ineos Group Holdings SA, a chemical
maker, set the rate it may pay on a $1 billion loan to refinance
bonds due in 2015, according to three people with knowledge of
the deal.  The debt, due in 2018, will consist of a $570 million
portion and a 300 million-euro ($390 million) slice, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the deal is
private. The dollar portion may pay interest at 300 basis points
to 325 basis points more than benchmarks, while the euro portion
may pay a spread of 325 basis points to 350 basis points. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The loan may be sold between 99.5 percent of face value and
par and will feature a minimum 1 percent benchmark-rate floor,
the people said.  The rate paid on a $1.97 billion covenant-light loan and
497 million-euro debt will be reduced to match the level of the
new financing, according to the people.  The margin on the company’s $370 million  term loan  maturing
in 2015 also will be reduced to pay between 225 basis points and
250 basis points and be offered at par, the people said.
Investor commitments are due by April 30, they said.  Ineos will have a total leverage ratio of 4.1 times, one of
the people said. The measure will be 2.8 times through senior
debt. Leverage is the measure of debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  Barclays Plc and Bank of America Corp. are joint global
coordinators on the deal. Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and UBS AG are bookrunners, the people said.  Ineos, based in Rolle,  Switzerland , on April 16 offered to
redeem bonds maturing in 2015 and 2016, conditional upon the
completion of one or more financings by the company, according
to announcements on the Luxembourg stock exchange.  Richard Longden , an Ineos spokesman, wasn’t immediately
available to comment after business hours.  Ineos  reported  first-quarter earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 415 million euros, the
company said last week. It had net debt of about 6.5 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
