The Airbus Military A400M airlifter
for the U.K. is now running over budget by 770 million pounds
($1.2 billion), according to the British Ministry of Defence.  There is also a cost overrun on a  Thales SA (HO)  Watchkeeper
drone program and a  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  electronic system for
aircraft, Philip Dunne, a minister for defense, told Parliament
in written answers to questions.  The U.K. is acquiring 22 A400M transports to replace
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  C-130s, a program running 73 months behind
plan, the National Audit Office said. The airlifter is scheduled
to enter service with the Royal Air Force in 2015. Lead customer
 France  should get its first plane by the middle of this year.  “Project performance can be affected by a number of
reasons, not all of which are in the contractor’s control,”
Dunne said. The increases are against the ministry’s total cost
baseline,  and not contracts with the companies, he said.  Airbus SAS and countries funding the development of the
A400M restructured the program in 2010 to address cost increases
and schedule delays. The U.K. trimmed its purchase to 22 units
instead of 25 as part of the review.  The Watchkeeper unmanned aircraft program for the army is
57 million pounds above estimate and Northrop Grumman’s aircraft
identification beacon is 6 million pounds above projections,
Dunne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
