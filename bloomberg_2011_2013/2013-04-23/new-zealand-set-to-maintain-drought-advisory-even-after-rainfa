New Zealand will probably keep a
drought declaration until September, even as rains in some
regions boosted soil moisture after the most widespread dryness
in three decades curbed pasture growth, the government said.  “It will take time to build up enough grass cover to
provide feed for winter,” Minister for Primary Industries
Nathan Guy said in a statement e-mailed today. “The dry
conditions may have ended in many parts of the country, but
there are still major challenges ahead.”  Whole-milk  powder  climbed to a record last week as the
drought, declared across the entire North Island, curbed output.
Milk collection slumped 16 percent last month from a year
earlier, Auckland-based  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG) , the
world’s largest dairy shipper, said. Parts of Nelson on the
South Island and Tauranga on the North Island’s north coast were
flooded after heavy rains over the weekend, the New Zealand
Herald said yesterday.  “It’s very important that farmers plan ahead for how they
will manage their feed supply,” said Guy. “A large amount of
supplementary feed has already been used over summer and will be
in short supply later this year.”  A weakening low pressure system and associated rain is
expected to move across central New Zealand early tomorrow
morning,  MetService said  on its website today.  Soil moisture deficits are reducing, enabling pasture to
start recovering, according to the government. The drought may
cost NZ$2 billion ($1.7 billion) as the conditions threaten
economic growth, the government estimates.  To contact the reporter for this story:
