Italian Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli , who has led a crackdown on  tax evasion , bought his Rome
apartment partly with funds from a Channel Islands account and
then avoided sales tax on renovations by paying cash for about
half the costs, Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper reported, citing
documents it obtained.  Grilli, who has spent most of his career in civil service,
bought the 310 square-meter (3,336 square-foot) apartment in
Rome after returning to government work from London, where he
was a managing director and head of Italian  investment banking 
at  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  First Boston for about a year from 2001 through
2002. At the time of the 2004 purchase, he was serving as
Italy’s general accountant.  Grilli, 55, told the newspaper that he’d properly declared
the Channel Islands funds and paid taxes. He said that having
worked at a Swiss bank it was normal to have such accounts and
that he brought the money with him to Italy when he moved back.  Regarding the renovation, which the newspaper said cost
642,281 euros ($835,442), Grilli said he paid all his bills in a
transparent manner.  Bloomberg News  reported in January that Grilli declared a
purchase price for the apartment that was about half its
assessed value of 2.03 million euros according to his signed
filings with Italian authorities. Grilli said the mismatch was
due to a separate payment he made to a relative of the seller
for earlier renovations of the 14-room home.  A spokesman for Grilli, who was appointed by Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  to spearhead a drive to prevent tax evasion, didn’t
respond to calls seeking comment on today’s story.  To contact the reporters on this story:
