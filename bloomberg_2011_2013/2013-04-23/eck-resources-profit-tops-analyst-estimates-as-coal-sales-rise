Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest diversified mining company by market value, reported
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as coal sales rose.  Net income increased to C$319 million ($310 million), or 55
cents a share, in the first quarter from C$258 million, or 44
cents, a year earlier, the Vancouver-based company said today in
statement. Excluding one-time items, Teck earned 56 cents a
share, more than the 38-cent average of 23 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales fell to C$2.3 billion from C$2.5 billion a year
earlier, beating the C$2.22 billion average of 14  estimates .
Teck’s coal sales rose 24 percent to 6.6 million metric tons in
the quarter, up from 5.3 million a year earlier.  China , the world’s biggest steelmaker, imported 1.26
million tons of metallurgical coal from Canada in January and
February, according to the latest  figures  from the Canadian
government, 27 percent more than the year-earlier total. Chinese
imports from  Australia , the largest exporter by sea, also rose
33 percent, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Coal accounted for 45 percent of Teck’s revenue in 2012,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The company also mines
copper, which represented 30 percent of sales, and zinc, which
made up 25 percent.  BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, a joint venture between
Australia’s BHP Billiton Ltd. and Japan’s  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , is
the biggest exporter of seaborne metallurgical coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
