The  Charlotte  Bobcats fired head
coach Mike Dunlap after the team won 21 games this season,
second-fewest in the National Basketball Association.  Dunlap, 55, was let go after just one season with the NBA
team, the Bobcats said today in a statement on their website. A
search for his successor will begin immediately.  “As an organization, it was decided that we needed to make
a change with the head coach position,” President of Basketball
Operations Rod Higgins said in the statement.  Dunlap was hired last June after the Bobcats finished 7-59
in the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, at .106 the lowest
winning percentage in NBA history. Previously an assistant at
St. John’s University in New York.  The Bobcats were 21-61 this year, and finished 17 games out
of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
Their 61 losses were second only to the Orlando Magic’s 62 and
Charlotte’s 6-35 road mark was the worst in the league.  The Bobcats have been to playoffs once since entering the
league as an expansion team in 2004. Dunlap was the fifth coach
the team has used in that nine-year span.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
