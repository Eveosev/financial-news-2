FastJet Plc (FJET)  and Five Forty Aviation
Ltd. Chief Executive Officer  Don Smith  said they have agreed to
end a legal battle in a dispute over payment and licensing
agreements in  Africa .  The accord with Nairobi-based Five Forty is designed to
reach “mutually beneficial and constructive resolutions,”
FastJet said in a statement today.  London-based FastJet, which began commercial flights Nov.
27, combined with Five Forty Aviation in June to gain access
rights in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Angola. Smith in February
withdrew licensing rights, saying FastJet had reneged on
payments, triggering the legal battle.  “The signing of this MOU provides a positive platform for
FastJet to strengthen its East African Hub,” Ed Winter, FastJet
CEO, said in the statement. Smith will remain head of the Kenyan
Fly540 business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
