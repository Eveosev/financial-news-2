Royal Imtech NV (IM) , the Dutch provider
of 2012 London Olympics stadium infrastructure, fell the most in
nearly two months after the company increased a writedown on
projects in  Germany .  Imtech fell as much as 8.9 percent to 8.10 euros, the
biggest drop since Feb. 27, and was down 7.4 percent at 8.23
euros as of 10:12 a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 774
million euros ($1.01 billion).  The writedown on Germany rose by 70 million euros from an
earlier estimate in February to about 220 million euros on
valuation problems with projects and debtors in Germany, the
Gouda, Netherlands-based company said today in a statement. The
company is investigating German and Polish projects and expects
to present the results in the summer, Chief Executive Officer
Gerard van de Aast said on a conference call today.  “With this new disappointment, total costs taken for the
German and Polish projects amount to an enormous 370 million
euros,” Edwin  de Jong , an Amsterdam-based analyst at SNS
Securities, said today. “On the other hand, management is
cleaning ship, which is positive,” said De Jong, who has a hold
recommendation on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
