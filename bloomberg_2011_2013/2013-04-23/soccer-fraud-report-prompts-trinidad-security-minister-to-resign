Trinidad & Tobago  replaced security
minister  Jack Warner  after he was accused of corruption as
president of CONCACAF, the soccer federation overseeing the
Caribbean and North and Central America.  Emmanuel George, who headed public works for the Caribbean
nation, was appointed the new security minister, the government
said in a  statement  on its website today.  The resignation follows an April 19 CONCACAF ethics
committee report that accused Warner and Chuck Blazer, a former
general secretary for the group, of enriching themselves through
fraud. Warner, who served on soccer governing boards for three
decades and was elected CONCACAF president in 1990, was said to
have registered a $22.5 million soccer center in his own name.  In a phone interview, Warner said he would be meeting with
lawmakers and other officials this week to discuss the
allegations. He declined to answer further questions. Blazer has
denied the allegations.  Warner, who also resigned his seat in Trinidad’s ruling
People’s Partnership Party yesterday, stepped down from CONCACAF
in June 2011 following accusations that he bribed members during
presidential elections at FIFA, soccer’s global governing body.
He remains a lawmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
