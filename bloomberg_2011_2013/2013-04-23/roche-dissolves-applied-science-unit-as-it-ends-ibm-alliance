Roche Holding AG (ROG)  will dissolve its
Applied Science unit as it sees further price pressure and
funding cuts in life-science research and said itâ€™s ended an
alliance with  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   The Swiss drugmaker said its polymerase chain reaction
technology and nucleic acid product lines business will become
part of its Molecular Diagnostics unit. The custom biotechnology
portfolio will join the Professional Diagnostics business, while
the company will create a unit to focus solely on sequencing,
the Basel-based drugmaker said in a  statement  today.  The reorganization will affect 110 jobs in Penzberg,
Germany and 60 in Branford,  Connecticut , Roche said.  Roche and IBM agreed in July 2010 to try to make genome
sequencing for medical purposes cheaper and more common. The
drugmaker said today it had ended its partnership with IBM for
the development of a nanopore-based sequencing platform, due to
high technical risks involved.  Roche said its outlook for 2013 remains unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
