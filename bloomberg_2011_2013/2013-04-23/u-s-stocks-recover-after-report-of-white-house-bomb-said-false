U.S. stocks recovered after
benchmark indexes briefly erased their gains in a matter of
minutes following a post on Twitter from the  Associated Press 
saying there had been explosions at the White House. The AP said
their Twitter account had been hacked and there was no
explosion.  The  S&P 500  was up 1 percent at 1,578.42 at 1:17 p.m. in
New York after briefly dipping as low as 1,563. An AP White
House correspondent said in a post on Twitter that the news
agencyâ€™s account had been hacked and there was no explosion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
