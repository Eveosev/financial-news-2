A group led by Malaysian
billionaire Quek Leng Chan increased its offer to take  Guoco
Group Ltd. (53)  private to HK$9.37 billion ($1.2 billion) after some
investors said the initial HK$8.25 billion bid was too low.  In addition to the original per-share payment of HK$88 the
buyers will pay HK$12 a share when the buyout provision of the
deal is either satisfied or waived, the company said in a  Hong
Kong  stock-exchange filing yesterday. The buyout group won’t
further increase the offer, Guoco said.  The revised offer of HK$100 per share is 2.6 percent more
than the  closing price  of HK$97.45 on April 22. The stock was
suspended yesterday pending the increased offer and will resume
trading in Hong Kong today. The stock has surged 38 percent
since the day before Quek group first made its offer on Dec. 12.  The original HK$88 offer was “unfair” and “absurd,”
given that Guoco’s balance sheet alone could support a higher
price, without Quek contributing, Sandy Mehta, Hong Kong-based
chief executive officer of Value Investment Principals Ltd.,
said on Dec. 13. Mehta’s fund then owned Guoco shares.  The company has cash and short term funds of HK$11.6
billion on Dec. 31, rising from HK$8.8 billion on June 30,
according to the company’s interim report for the six months
through December.  The proposal will give Guoco Chairman Quek more control of
the company’s 14 percent stake in  Bank of East Asia Ltd. , Hong
Kong’s biggest family-run bank. Quek is making the bid together
with related parties, including a unit of Hong Leong Co., in
which he has a 49 percent stake.  Guoco, based in Hong Kong, gained 1 percent on April 22,
the last date of trading before the suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
