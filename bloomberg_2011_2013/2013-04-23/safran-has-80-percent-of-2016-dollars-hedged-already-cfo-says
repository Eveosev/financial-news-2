Safran SA (SAF)  has already covered 80
percent of its dollar hedging requirements for 2016 at $1.25 to
the euro, above its $1.26 target, and expects to have completed
currency cover through the end of 2016 by year-end.  The French company, which makes engines for single-aisle
planes through a joint venture with  General Electric Co. (GE) , has
fully hedged for 2013 and 2014 and is close to achieving the
$4.8 billion needed to protect dollar revenue in 2015 not
secured otherwise, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman
and Chief Financial Officer Ross McInnes said today on a call.  Safran has sought to have three years of anticipated dollar
revenue protected by contracts locking in favorable exchange
rates when translating dollars into euros. Commercial aircraft
and engines are sold almost exclusively in dollars worldwide.
While security equipment such as software for recognizing
fingerprints is also frequently sold in dollars, Safran is
better protected from currency swings in that area because it
has a large workforce in the U.S.  “It’s mainly for commercial aerospace revenues that we buy
financial hedges, for both new engines, spares, and also for
aerospace equipment,” CEO Herteman said today on a call with
journalists after the company announced first quarter sales.  About 50 percent of the company’s U.S. revenue is naturally
protected by U.S. procurement.  Herteman also said that Safran
also faces “indirect exposure” to dollars in some cases where
even if Safran is being paid in euros, it competes with U.S.
companies that have their costs in dollars.  Safran has benefited from more favorable rates since early
February as the dollar as risen against the euro.  In 2011, a hedge book covering $4.3 billion in revenue was
achieved at a rate of $1.37 to the euro, and in 2012 coverage
for $4 billion came at $1.32 to the euro.  For 2013, $5 billion was covered at $1.29, for 2014 $5.2
billion is covered at $1.28. For 2015, the company has achieved
an average rate of $1.25 to cover $4.8 billion of $5.2 billion
required, McInnes said. For 2016, Safran brought coverage from
$1.7 billion in February to $4.1 billion at $1.25 billion by the
end of the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
