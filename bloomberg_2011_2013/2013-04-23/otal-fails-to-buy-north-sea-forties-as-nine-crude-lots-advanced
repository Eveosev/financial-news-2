Total SA failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties crude for a third session even after increasing its
purchase price.  Eight more cargoes of the benchmark grade for loading next
month were advanced by one to four days, including two lots
brought forward to April, according to five people with direct
knowledge of the matter.  North Sea  Total bid Forties for loading from May 15 to May 20 at 25
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent without finding a seller,
five cents more than its unsuccessful bid yesterday, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window.  The company also failed to buy the grade for May 5 to May 9
at $1.05 a barrel less than the cash cost of Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk for July, the survey showed.  Shell offered Forties for May 8 to May 10 at a discount of
10 cents to Dated Brent. That compares with a deal yesterday at
minus 30 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at a discount of 19 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the narrowest since March 20.  Brent for June settlement traded at $99.90 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
unchanged from the previous session. The July contract was at
$99.86 at the same time today, a discount of 4 cents to June.  Forties consignments F0501, F0502, F0503, F0504, F0509,
F0511, F0512, F0515 and F0517 have now been brought forward, the
people said, asking not to be identified as the information is
confidential.  The changes to the loading schedule mean that a total of 23
cargoes will be shipped this month, while exports in May will
drop to 20 lots.  Buzzard’s share of Forties was unchanged at 44 percent for
the week ending April 21,  BP Plc (BP/)  said on its website.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals for a second
day, the Platts survey showed. The grade traded at a discount of
40 cents to the benchmark in the Mediterranean and minus $1.20
in northwest Europe on April 19.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 2 cents to 35 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.25 a
barrel compared with $1.27 at yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 2 cents to $3.11 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nigeria raised its official selling price for its Qua Iboe
and Bonny Light crudes in May to $3.30 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, up from $3 in April, according to a statement from the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.  The loading schedules for the country’s crudes are expected
to be released tomorrow, according to two people with knowledge
of the plans, asking not to be identified as the information is
confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
