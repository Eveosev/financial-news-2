Russian  stocks  rose for a second
day, erasing earlier declines, amid bets the European Central
Bank will cut interest rates to fuel growth in the country’s
biggest trade partner. OAO Sberbank, the nation’s biggest
lender, advanced.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.2 percent to 1,339.91 at the close
in Moscow, after falling as much as 1.2 percent. Russian
equities have the cheapest valuations on an estimated price
basis among 21  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. Sberbank
jumped 1.5 percent to 96.44 rubles, the most in two weeks.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for Micex rose to 23.5,
still below 30 that signals the gauge is oversold and may be set
for a rebound. Euro-area services and factory output shrank for
a 15th month in April, according to Markit Economics, fueling
expectations the ECB will take action to revive the recession-
hit economy.  “ Russia  is rising, although in a weak way, as the global
sentiment improves on expectations of the ECB rate cut,” Dmitry Malykhin, who oversees $30 million in Russian assets as chief
investment adviser at Moscow-based hedge fund DV Advisers LLC,
said today by phone. “Sberbank is definitely gaining on this.”  OAO Rostelecom slid 4 percent to 111.36 rubles, the
steepest percentage decline on the Micex.  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s
Onexim Group said that it may consider buying a stake in the
phone operator from Marshall Capital after the fund annulled its
deal with Arkady Rotenberg.  Rosneft, TNK-BP  Sberbank has the  third-largest weighting  on the Micex at
14.4 percent. The shares added 1.8 percent to $12.23 in London,
the most since April 8.  VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest lender, added 2.5
percent to 4.55 kopeks, increasing for a third day. VTB’s
depositary receipts advanced 2.5 percent to $2.845 in London.
OAO Lukoil, the second-largest oil producer, rose 2.1 percent to
1,899.10 rubles.  OAO Magnit, the biggest food retailer, dropped 1.8 percent
to 6,281.20 rubles. The GDRs retreated 1.3 percent to $48.81.  OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  surged as much as 8 percent before
closing 3.3 percent higher at 45.94 rubles. Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin said today OAO Rosneft is willing to work
with TNK-BP Holding’s minority investors. Proposals include
directing all profit to dividends, Sechin said.  Rosneft’s plan not to buy out minority stakes in TNK-BP, to
borrow money from it and possibly end its dividend policy sent
shares of TNK-BP tumbling the most on record on March 26.
Investors including Prosperity Capital Management Ltd., which
manages about $4 billion of Russian assets, said Rosneft is
putting Russia’s reputation at risk.  Norilsk Cut  Crude, Russia’s chief export, dropped 0.3 percent to
$100.12 per barrel in  London . Most metals retreated in London
after a preliminary report showed  China ’s manufacturing may be
expanding at a slower pace this month.  China’s preliminary reading of 50.5 in a Purchasing
Managers’ Index, a gauge of manufacturing activity that was
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, compared
with a final reading of 51.6 for March.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the
metal, sank 1.3 percent to 4,925 rubles. The stock was cut to
underweight, the equivalent of sell, at Morgan Stanley on lower
commodity prices, according to a note released today. The GDRs
lost 1.6 percent to $15.53.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodities retreated 0.4
percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.4 percent to
1,333.89.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 8.4 percent
above its 30-day average, while the gauge’s 10-day price swings
rose to 13.27.  The measure trades at 4.9 times its 12-month estimated
earnings and has lost 10 percent this year, compared with a 10.1
multiple for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , which has dropped
4.7 percent in the period.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
stock futures, slipped 3.3 percent to 23.66 after surging 4.8
percent yesterday. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest
dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, lost 0.2 percent to
25.61 today, while the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  added
0.5 percent to 90.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
