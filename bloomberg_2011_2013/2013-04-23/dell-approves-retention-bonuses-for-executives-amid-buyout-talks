Dell Inc. (DELL) , the personal-computer
maker considering buyout offers, approved cash retention bonuses
for executives other than Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell.  The $91.1 million program includes “members of the
executive leadership team, vice presidents and executive
directors of the company who are critical to the company’s
future success,” Dell said today in a regulatory filing.
Participants can receive as much as 100 percent of their base
salary, the company said, without giving individual figures.  Dell, based in  Round Rock , Texas, is trying to secure
executives’ loyalty as it goes through the buyout process amid
falling demand for desktop and notebook PCs. Sales of those PC
types, its core business, slid 8.2 percent in the fiscal year
that ended Jan. 31, with a 20 percent drop in the final quarter.  Michael Dell , seeking to rally employees amid the buyout
talks, said earlier this month that he has made headway in
efforts to transform the computer maker into a broader provider
of business products, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Dell said in the memo that he intends to take the No. 1 spot in
market share for servers from  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  this year.  The bonuses will be based on fiscal 2014 free operating
cash flow performance and will be payable in March 2014 for
employees who remain continuously employed through that date,
Dell said in today’s filing. They would be paid “regardless of
whether a change in control takes place or Dell remains a
publicly traded company,” according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
