Cattle futures rose for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that beef demand in the
U.S. is climbing. Hog prices also increased.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.4 percent to $1.9078 a pound
yesterday, and prices are up 0.9 percent his month, heading for
the third straight gain, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Temperatures are rising in the central Plains and upper
Midwest, according to MDA Weather Services. More consumers tend
to grill outdoors in warmer weather, boosting meat demand.  “Weather is supposed to improve dramatically late this
week and into next, and this should be somewhat supportive
throughout this week,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind
Cattle Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed
report today. “Cattle are trading higher, and that could have
more to do with the prospects of improving boxed beef and cash-
fed cattle markets this week and next.”  Cattle futures for June delivery increased 0.4 percent to
$1.2125 a pound at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices lost 0.8 percent in the previous three
sessions.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 1.4
percent to $1.4805 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement climbed 0.7 percent to
90.075 cents a pound on the CME. The commodity was up 4.3
percent in 2013 through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
