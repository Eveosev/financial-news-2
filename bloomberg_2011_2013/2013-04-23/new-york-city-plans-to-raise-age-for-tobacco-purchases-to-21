     April 23 (Bloomberg) -– New York City plans to raise the
age to buy cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products to 21
from 18, making it the first major U.S. city to lift the minimum
age above 19, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said.  The city council move complements efforts by Mayor Michael
Bloomberg to lower smoking rates. Last month, Bloomberg proposed
requiring stores to hide tobacco products. The mayor has worked
with council to raise tobacco taxes and ban smoking in
restaurants and bars.  “Too many adult smokers begin this deadly habit before age
21,” Quinn said in a release. “By delaying our city’s children
and young adults access to lethal tobacco products, we’re
decreasing the likelihood they ever start smoking, and thus,
creating a healthier city.”  Twenty-thousand public high-school students smoke in New
York, and the youth smoking rate has remained flat at 8.5
percent since 2007, Quinn said. By one estimate, raising the
threshold to 21 could reduce smoking among 18-to-20-year-olds by
as much as 55 percent, Quinn said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
