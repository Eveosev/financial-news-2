Stocks (SXXP)  rallied amid growth in U.S.
home sales, better-than-forecast earnings and speculation the
 European Central Bank  will cut  interest rates . U.S. equities
recovered after briefly erasing gains following a false report
of explosions at the White House.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1 percent at 4 p.m. in
New York, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 2.4 percent, the
most since August. Two-year note yields tumbled to record lows
in Italy and Ireland while rates on U.S. Treasuries were little
changed. The euro erased early gains, falling 0.5 percent to
$1.2999. Coffee, silver and copper lost at least 0.9 percent as
commodities fell.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  jumped 4.4 percent in after-market
trading after boosting its dividend and share-buyback program.  The S&P 500 briefly erased almost all of its rally
following a post on the  Associated Press ’s Twitter account that
said there were explosions at the White House. Stocks recovered
as AP said its account had been hacked and there were no
explosions. Plans to raise dividends at companies including
MetLife Inc., Travelers Cos. and Coach Inc. also helped fuel
today’s rally. Apple Inc.  is scheduled to report earnings after
the close of U.S. markets today.  “The global liquidity story remains in place,”  Dan Veru ,
chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management LLC,
said over the phone. The Fort Lee, New Jersey-based firm manages
$3.8 billion. “We’ll have swings in the market because of
earnings like today and last week or data reports, but we have
this central bank underpinning that will prevent very
significant drops from happening. The  U.S. economy  with all its
warts is growing, whereas other economies are not and that makes
our stocks attractive.”  Home Sales  A gauge of  homebuilders  jumped 5.6 percent as Toll Brothers
Inc. rallied 9.3 percent and D.R. Horton Inc. surged 5.3
percent. Sales of single-family properties climbed 1.5 percent
last month to a 417,000 annual pace from a 411,000 rate in
February, Commerce Department figures showed today. The median
estimate of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for March
sales to rise to 416,000.  Netflix Inc. jumped 24 percent after acquiring more new
subscribers than analysts forecast and beating the average
earning-per-share projection by 17 percent. Travelers rose 2.1
percent and Coach Inc. jumped 9.8 percent on better-than-
estimated earnings and plans to raise dividends. MetLife Inc.
surged 5.5 percent after increasing its dividend for the first
time since 2007 as its exit from banking limited oversight from
the  Federal Reserve .  ‘Most Bullish’  “Dividend-paying stocks is the area I’m most bullish on,
people need income,”  Matt McCormick , who helps oversee $9.1
billion as a  money manager  at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor
Inc. “This is the most-hated  bull market , so if you are nervous
about the stock market then at least get paid something while
you hold stock.”  Apple rallied 1.9 percent in regular trading, and added 4.4
percent at 4:54 p.m. New York time. After the market closed, the
company boosted its dividend and share-buyback program. Apple
reported its first profit decline since 2003 and forecast
revenue that missed analysts’ estimates amid slowing iPhone
sales growth and accelerating competition from Samsung
Electronics Co.  Earnings beat analysts’ average  estimate  at 73 percent of
the 131 companies in the  S&P 500  that reported so far this
season, while 55 percent trailed sales projections, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Per-share profits have grown 3.9
percent on a 1.4 percent increase in revenue.  False Tweet  Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender, rose
3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight
because expense savings are greater than potential legal costs.  The false report of explosions at the White House wiped out
$136 billion from the S&P 500 in about two minutes. The
benchmark gauge was up 1 percent at about 1,578 at 1:07 p.m. New
York time when a posting on the AP Twitter account said there
had been explosions at the White House and President  Barack
Obama  had been injured. The index erased almost the entire gain,
falling as low as 1,563.03 by 1:10 p.m.  The S&P 500  recovered  from the plunge within three minutes
as the news service said its Twitter account had been hacked and
there were no explosions. Exxon Mobil Corp., Apple, Johnson &
Johnson and Microsoft Corp. briefly lost about 1 percent before
recovering.  Treasuries, Dollar  Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes dropped
about six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to a low for
the year of 1.64 percent immediately after the false tweet as
investors sought refuge in the world’s safest assets. The dollar
weakened to about 98.60 yen before recovering to 99.27 after the
report was discredited.  The 10-year yield rose 1 basis point on the day to 1.71
percent while the dollar was up 0.2 percent to 99.43 yen.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
 VIX (VIX) , surged more than 9 percent before reversing the gain. The
VIX, which moves in the opposite direction to the S&P 500 about
80 percent of the time, ended the session 6.3 percent lower at
13.48 and is down 25 percent for the year.  “We saw a huge dip in the futures, immediately starting as
headlines went out that the AP Twitter feed was reporting on the
White House incident,”  Dave Lutz , head of exchange-traded fund
trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said
by e-mail. “That spread quickly but we advised clients there
was no confirmation from the White House or any of the other
news outlets.”  European Profits  More than 15 shares advanced for every one that declined in
the Stoxx 600, which jumped the most since Aug. 3. ARM Holdings
Plc, the designer of chips for Apple’s iPhone, rallied 12
percent after reporting sales jumped 29 percent.  Cie. Financiere
Richemont SA (CFR) , the maker of Cartier jewelry, surged 8.3 percent
after saying full-year net income increased 30 percent.  Italian 10-year government bonds yields fell below 4
percent for the first time since November 2010 and Portugal’s
10-year  yield  fell 14 basis points to 5.74 percent, the lowest
since October 2010.  Spain’s 10-year rate dropped 21 basis points to 4.28
percent, the least since November 2010. The country’s recession
eased in the first quarter, the Bank of Spain said. The extra
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
benchmark German bunds briefly dipped below 300 basis points for
the first time since March 2012.  Euro Economy  The euro weakened against 12 of 16 major peers. The 17-
nation shared currency slid as much as 0.7 percent to $1.2973,
reaching its lowest level since April 8.  Euro-area services and factory output shrank for a 15th
month in April as the currency bloc struggled to emerge from a
recession. A composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries held at 46.5, London-based Markit
Economics said today, in line with the median of 26 economists’
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  “The data is sufficiently weak to up the pressure on the
ECB to cut rates in June,”  Lena Komileva , managing director and
chief economist at G+ Economics Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note.
“With excess capacity growing and business expectations
falling, the only question is why the ECB has not cut  rates 
already.”       The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities dropped 0.3 percent.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its “near-term” outlook for
commodities and reduced forecasts for oil and coffee amid
prospects for weak demand from China to Europe. The bank also
exited a bet on lower  gold prices .  Commodities Slump  Gold and silver futures slumped. Gold futures for June
delivery fell 0.9 percent to settle at $1,408.80 an ounce,
ending a three-session rally. The drop was the biggest for a
most-active contract since April 15, when the metal plunged 9.3
percent, the most in 33 years. Silver slumped 2.2 percent to
$22.866 an ounce.  West Texas Intermediate oil was little changed at $89.18 a
barrel, erasing a loss of 1.6 percent. Copper futures for
delivery in July declined 1.3 percent to $3.104 a pound. Prices
earlier reached $3.0685, the lowest since Oct. 20, 2011, after
entering a  bear market  last week.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.2 percent as rallies
in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey were overshadowed by losses
in China. The Shanghai Composite Index declined 2.6 percent, the
most in three weeks. A report showed Chinese manufacturing
slowed more than economists estimated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
