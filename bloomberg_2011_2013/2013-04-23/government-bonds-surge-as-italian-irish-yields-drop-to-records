European  government bonds  rose,
with  Italy ’s two-year yields falling to a record, as euro-area
output contracted for a 15th month in April, boosting
speculation the region’s central bank will lower  interest rates .  The yield on Italian 10-year government bonds fell below 4
percent for the first time in almost 2 1/2 years, while Spanish
and Portuguese yields dropped to the least since 2010. Borrowing
costs in  France  and Ireland declined to the lowest on record as
a purchasing managers’ index showed German services and
manufacturing unexpectedly shrank. Benchmark German 10-year bund
yields slid to the lowest since July.  “The weaker tone in the headline and German PMIs this
morning has fueled rate-cut speculation with regard to the next
meeting,” said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London . “Bonds are rallying across the board,
bunds as well as peripherals, which clearly shows to us that
this hunt for yield is really intensifying and the market is
expecting an ultra-low yield environment to stay in place for
the foreseeable future.”  Italy’s  two-year yield  fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.17 percent at 4:47 p.m. London time,
after reaching 1.125 percent, the  lowest level  since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 1993. The 6 percent security due
November 2014 rose 0.09, or 90 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,302) face amount, to 107.41.  The nation’s 10-year  yield declined  as much as 17 basis
points to 3.89 percent, the  lowest  since Oct. 27, 2010.  Output Falls  A euro-area  composite index  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries held at 46.5, London-based Markit
Economics said.  A gauge of German manufacturing from a survey by Markit
fell to 47.9 from 49 the previous month, while the  median
estimate  of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no
change. For services, the index declined to 49.2 from 50.9.
Economists had predicted an increase to 51. Readings below 50
show contraction.  The  European Central Bank  next meets on May 2. Policy
makers have kept the main  refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.75
percent since July.  “The data is sufficiently weak to up the pressure on the
ECB to cut rates in June,”  Lena Komileva , managing director at
G+ Economics Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note today. “The only
question is why the ECB has not cut rates already.”  Yields Tumble  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds posted the biggest
intraday slide since Oct. 17, falling as much as 26 basis points
to 4.24 percent, the lowest since Nov. 1, 2010, while the rate
on similar-maturity Portuguese debt dropped 14 basis points to
5.74 percent, the lowest since Oct. 27, 2010.  Spain ’s recession eased in the three months ended March 31,
even as the economy shrank for a seventh quarter, the Bank of
Spain said today in its monthly bulletin. Gross domestic product
fell 0.5 percent from the prior three months, when it contracted
0.8 percent.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Italy and Ireland, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Irish two-year  yields tumbled as much as 15 basis points to
0.844 percent, the least since Bloomberg began compiling the
data in 2003. The nation’s 10-year bond yield dropped to 3.48
percent, the  lowest  since 2006.  The ECB may cut interest rates if data show a need for it,
Executive Board Member Joerg Asmussen said April 20 on a panel
in  Washington . ECB President  Mario Draghi  said April 19 the
economic situation in the 17-nation euro area hasn’t improved
since the central bank’s last meeting on April 4.  Bunds, Treasuries  German 10-year  bund yields  dropped as much as four basis
points to 1.19 percent, the lowest since July 24. The rate on
similar-maturity U.K.  gilts fell  to 1.62 percent, the least
since Sept. 5 and the Treasury 10-year note yield slid to 1.64
percent, the lowest since Dec. 12.  The yield on Austrian  five-year notes  declined to 0.524
percent, the least since Bloomberg began tracking the data in
1993. France’s 10-year bond yield slipped as much as five basis
points to 1.701 percent, also a record.  France is due to repay more than 30 billion euros of bills
and bonds on April 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Italian bonds returned 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds gained 6.3 percent, while German debt rose 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
