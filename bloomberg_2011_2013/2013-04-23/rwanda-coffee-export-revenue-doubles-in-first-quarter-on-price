Rwanda ’s coffee-export revenue more
than doubled in the first quarter as prices increased and stocks
carried over from last year were sold, the National Agricultural
Export Board said.  Earnings surged to $11.5 million in the three months
through March from $4.9 million a year earlier, Eric Kabayiza,
the board’s director of planning, said in an interview yesterday
in the capital, Kigali. Average prices climbed to $3.13 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) from $2.58 previously, he said.  Production in the first quarter grew to 1.22 million
kilograms from 1.06 million kilograms, Kabayiza said.  Rwanda, a $6.38 billion East African economy with 10.9
million people, relies on coffee and tea to generate almost half
of export earnings, according to the  African Development Bank .
Output may increase 53 percent to 26,000 metric tons this year,
the board said last month.  The country is expected to earn $87 million from coffee
shipments this year, Kabayiza said. Earnings totaled $60.9
million last year, he said on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
