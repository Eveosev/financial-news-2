Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, declined the most in four years after
reporting sales growth that missed analysts’ estimates.  Amgen fell 6.9 percent to $104.93 at the close in New York,
the biggest single-day drop since February 2009. The shares of
the  Thousand Oaks , California-based company had gained 65
percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  Revenue increased 5 percent to $4.24 billion, Amgen said in
a statement yesterday. The sales were less than the $4.37
billion estimated by analysts, the first time in 11 quarters the
company has missed expectations, according to Bloomberg
Industries.  “This is a negative quarter,” Judson Clark, an analyst
with Edward Jones & Co., said in an interview. “The bigger
question mark is their sales numbers -- it was a pretty broad-
based disappointment.”  Net income increased 21 percent to $1.4 billion, or $1.88 a
share, from $1.18 billion, or $1.48 a share, a year earlier,
Amgen said. Earnings, excluding some items, of $1.96 a share
topped by 12 cents the average of 20 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company benefited in the first quarter from a 2012 U.S.
research tax credit that wasn’t renewed until January. The
company said it expects 2013 profit “to be above the mid-
point” of its previous forecast of earnings excluding one-time
items of $7.05 to $7.35 a share.  Biotechnology Focus  Amgen shares rose 19 percent in the first quarter, its best
three-month gain since the third quarter of 2008. The company
was benefiting from investor interest in the sector, with
drugmakers, health insurers and biotechnology companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returning 20 percent this year, the
 most  among the 10 main groups.  Amgen is looking for new products and  acquisitions  as its
former core anemia business declines. Eight late-stage medicines
in development will generate data through 2016 and some may lead
to billions of dollars in sales, Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said in February at a business review meeting in  New
York .  One, a heart medication called AMG-145, targets the
cholesterol-regulating gene PCSK9 in the liver. Another therapy,
romosozumab, grows bone for patients with osteoporosis.  Last year, the company agreed to buy gene researcher DeCode
Genetics Inc. for $415 million and gained an experimental
leukemia treatment by acquiring Micromet Inc. for $1.16 billion.
Amgen also signed a development deal with London-based
AstraZeneca Plc and boosted its presence in the cancer market
with Xgeva, a bone drug that reduces fractures.  Anemia Medicines  The company is focusing on the potential of the
experimental treatments to help offset declining revenue from
its anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen. Sales of Aranesp fell 10
percent to $468 million, and Epogen, an older version, declined
2 percent to $435 million in the first quarter.  Sales of Xgeva, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in November 2010, and Prolia, used to treat
osteoporosis in menopausal women, increased 51 percent to $365
million in the quarter, falling short of analysts’ estimates of
$394.2 million.  Sales of Amgen’s  top product  Enbrel, used to treat
rheumatoid arthritis, rose 11 percent to $1.04 billion in the
quarter. Analysts had estimated $1.06 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
