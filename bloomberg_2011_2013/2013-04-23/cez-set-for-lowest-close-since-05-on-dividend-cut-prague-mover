CEZ AS (CEZ)  headed for its lowest level
in almost eight years after the biggest Czech utility reduced
its dividend.  The stock dropped 1.2 percent to 559.6 koruna by 1:01 p.m.
in  Prague , set for the weakest close since August 2005. More
than 290,000 shares changed hands, 54 percent of the three-month
daily average.  Majority state-owned CEZ will pay 40 koruna a share, or 64
percent of its 2012 profit, the company said yesterday after the
stock market closed. Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at Komercni
Banka AS in Prague, said today he had expected CEZ to keep its
dividend at last year’s level of 45 koruna.  “The news is negative for CEZ shares,” Adamkovic wrote in
an e-mailed report to clients.  Utilities were the second-worst performers today among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The continent’s
benchmark power contract for next-year delivery in  Germany ,
where CEZ exports part of its output, retreated 0.6 percent to
38.95 euros a megawatt-hour, heading for the lowest close since
