Merck & Co. (MRK)  said an experimental
drug against hepatitis C was more effective than its Victrelis
pill in a patient study.  The virus was undetectable in the blood of as many as 92
percent of patients six months after they stopped the 12-week
course of treatment with the drug, known as MK-5172, compared
with 54 percent of those who received Victrelis,  Whitehouse
Station , New Jersey-based Merck said in a statement today. The
trial included 332 people with the most common form of hepatitis
C in the U.S., and all received standard therapy ribavirin in
addition to either MK-5172 or Victrelis.  Merck said yesterday that it’s entered a non-exclusive
agreement with  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  to test MK-5172 in
combination with Bristol’s daclatasvir.  “The interim findings from this study provide clear
direction for future larger trials designed to evaluate MK-5172
in novel, all-oral regimens for HCV,” Eliav Barr, Merck’s vice
president of infectious diseases, said in today’s statement.  Merck rose 1.5 percent to $48.63 at the close in  New York .  The drug caused increased levels of potentially harmful
liver enzymes in some patients on the highest doses, who had
their doses reduced as a result, Merck said.  Victrelis was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in May 2011, the first hepatitis C drug in almost
a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
