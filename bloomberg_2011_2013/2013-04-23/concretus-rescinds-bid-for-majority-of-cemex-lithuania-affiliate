UAB Concretus Materials called off
the purchase of a majority stake in Lithuanian cement maker
Akmenes Cementas AB after a competition body threatened to block
the deal over market share.  Concretus withdrew its request for approval and canceled a
contract to buy as much as 51 percent of Akmenes, which is one-
third owned by  Cemex SAB (CX)  of  Mexico , after being shown draft
decisions from the Competition Council in Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital, the council said today.  A market study showed that Concretus, which is based in
Vilnius, owns companies that already control large parts of the
Baltic nationâ€™s cement industry, the council said in a statement
on its website. The purchase of Akmenes would have increased its
dominance and limited competition, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
