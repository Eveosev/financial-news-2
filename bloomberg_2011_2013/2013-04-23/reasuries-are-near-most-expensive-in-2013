Treasury 10-year yields rose from
the lowest level this year before the U.S. is scheduled to sell
$35 billion of two-year debt, in the first of three note
auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  The benchmark  yields  fell earlier as reports showed  China ’s
manufacturing is expanding at a slower pace and euro-area output
contracted for a 15th consecutive month in April. Yields pared
losses as purchases of new U.S. homes rose in March, capping the
best quarter for the industry since 2008. European stocks
rallied the most in eight months on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will boost monetary accommodation. U.S. equities
gained for a third day.  “Equities are higher already today, so it’s tough to say
the market’s view of global growth has deteriorated
significantly,” Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked
research at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the  Federal Reserve .  Benchmark  10-year yields  were little changed at 1.70
percent as of 12:01 p.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader data, after reaching 1.64 percent, the lowest level
since Dec. 12. The price of the 2 percent note due February 2023
was 102 23/32.  Ten-year yields were as high as  1.73 percent  yesterday,
versus the 200-day moving average of 1.75 percent. The average
is an indicator of momentum.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  gained 1 percent and the
MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWO)  of stocks added 1.2 percent.  Notes Auction  The two-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.23
percent in pre-auction trading. The previous two-year auction on
March 26 drew bids for 3.27 times the amount of securities
available, the lowest level since July 2011.  “Level-wise, these twos are pretty rich,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The auction could tail a little
bit because of the levels. The excitement in our market is not
in the two-year sector, it’s out the curve.” A tail is the
amount of yield in excess of where the security was trading
before the auction.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $35 billion in five-year
notes tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year debt the next day.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$632 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.95 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Economic Data  The preliminary reading of 50.5 for China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a final 51.6 for March. The figure was
also below the median 51.5 estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey
of 11 analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  A composite  index  of activity in the service and
manufacturing industries in the 17-nation euro bloc was 46.5
this month, a separate report showed.  “With all the slowing data, the debate continues to be: Is
this just a momentary blip or a sign of things to come?” said
 Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income strategies at GMP
Securities LLC in New York. “The home-sales figures were a push
at best and at worst a confirmation of a brief slowing in the
housing market, that’s all.”  Sales of  single-family properties  in the U.S. climbed 1.5
percent last month to a 417,000 annual pace from a 411,000 rate
in February, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 76 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for March sales to rise to 416,000.  Relative Value  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3 percent annual
rate in the first quarter after growing 0.4 percent in the final
three months of 2012, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce
Department report on April 26.  “People are starting to see  Europe  take off instead of it
being an albatross or inhibiting the U.S., it’s forcing people
out,”  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income
trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. Treasuries are
trading “inverse to equities,” he said.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, reached
negative 0.84 percent in the U.S, the lowest level since
December. Negative readings indicate investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.58 basis points
yesterday, below the previous low of 51 basis points reached in
December. The data stretches back to 1988.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
bonds a month to boost the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs, including $937 million of securities
maturing between August 2023 and February 2031 today, according
to the New York Fed’s  website .  Treasuries have returned 0.7 percent this year, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German  government
bonds  have also earned 0.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
