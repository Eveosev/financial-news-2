West Texas Intermediate crude rose
to the highest in more than a week as an industry report showed
stockpiles declined in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer.  Futures increased as much as 0.8 percent in  New York  to the
highest intraday price since April 15. U.S. crude inventories
fell 845,000 barrels last week, the  American Petroleum Institute 
said in a report yesterday. Government data today will show
supplies climbed 2 million barrels to the most in 22 years,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Iraq may exit OPEC if the
group won’t let the nation’s output rise, State Minister Ali al- Dabbagh said in  Abu Dhabi  yesterday.  “We are getting support from the inventory numbers,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive officer of Barratt’s
Bulletin, a commodity newsletter in Sydney. “The trend is
slightly improving from a demand perspective,” he said,
predicting WTI’s advance may stall at about $90 a barrel.  WTI for June delivery rose as much as 70 cents to $89.88 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $89.72 at 2:31 p.m. Singapore time. The volume of all
futures traded was 17 percent below the 100-day average. The
contract slid 1 cent to $89.18 yesterday. Prices are down 2.3
percent this year.  Brent for June settlement gained as much as 49 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $100.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade was at a premium
of $10.92 to WTI futures, from $11.13 yesterday.  Goldman Forecast  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its three-month outlook for
Brent to $100 a barrel from $110 and lowered its 2013 forecast
to $105 from $110. Oil demand in China, the world’s second-
largest crude consumer, “slowed down significantly” from
January to March, the bank said in a report yesterday.  China ’s apparent oil consumption, or the amount of crude
processed plus net imports of refined products, dropped to 9.77
million barrels a day last month, the slowest rate since
October, government data show.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles decreased 2.7 million barrels last
week to 219.9 million, the lowest level this year, the report
from the industry-funded API showed. Distillate inventories,
including heating oil and diesel, gained by 666,000 barrels.
Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
Nymex futures, increased by 38,000 barrels to 51.1 million, the
highest level since Feb. 1.  The Energy Information Administration report today may show
gasoline stockpiles declined  600,000 barrels  while distillates
rose by 500,000 barrels last week, according to the median
estimate of 11 analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  Iraqi Output  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, for its weekly survey.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must make
room for 5 million barrels a day of Iraqi oil exports in the
future, al-Dabbagh said yesterday at the Middle East Petroleum
and Gas Conference, without giving a time frame. The country is
the second-biggest producer in the group, pumping 3.2 million
barrels a day in March, according to a Bloomberg survey of
producers and analysts. OPEC is scheduled to meet May 31 in
Vienna to discuss its collective output ceiling of 30 million
barrels a day.  “We want to stay in OPEC, but if OPEC is not helping us
then we are looking at our interests,” al-Dabbagh said.  WTI’s advance may stall as an indicator of technical
momentum falters. The 50-day moving average, around $92.87 a
barrel today, has pared a premium to the 100-day and 200-day
mean to the least in about 12 weeks, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Investors typically sell contracts on a “death
cross,” when a moving average drops below a longer-term one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
