The  New York Jets  re-signed outside
linebacker Calvin Pace, two months after releasing him to reduce
team payroll.  Pace, a 10-year National Football League veteran, was under
contract to make $11.6 million this season before he was cut in
February to make room under the NFLâ€™s salary cap. The Jets
officially announced yesterday that Pace had  re-signed , without
disclosing terms of the contract.  Pace, 32, led the team with 28 sacks over the past five
seasons, the most by a Jets linebacker over a five-year span
since Mo Lewis had 33 1/2 from 1997 through 2001.  Pace entered the NFL as a first-round draft pick of the
Arizona Cardinals in 2003 and has 42 career sacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
