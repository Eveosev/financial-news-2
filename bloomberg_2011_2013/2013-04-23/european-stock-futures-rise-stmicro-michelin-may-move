European stocks  jumped the most in
eight months as  ARM (ARM)  Holdings Plc and Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA reported results that topped estimates and speculation grew
that the region’s central bank will cut  interest rates .  ARM, the designer of chips for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, soared
to a 13-year high on better-than-forecast sales. Richemont
surged the most since 2008 as the maker of Cartier jewelry said
net income climbed. Prudential Plc led a gauge of insurers
higher. Royal Imtech NV sank 5.6 percent after increasing a
writedown on projects in Germany.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  soared 2.4 percent to 292.63 at
the close of trading, the biggest jump since Aug. 3. The
benchmark measure has still retreated 2 percent from this year’s
high on March 14 as economic data from the U.S. to  China  missed
forecasts and Cyprus reignited concern about the euro area’s
debt crisis. The gauge has climbed 4.6 percent this year.  “We are reasonably positive and look for another 7 to 10
percent on equities worldwide this year,” Alan Higgins, who
oversees about $44 billion as chief investment officer at Coutts
& Co. in  London , told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television.
“Provided the weaker growth doesn’t result in an earnings
crash, the market can come to terms with it.”  Stocks extended gains even after a report showed euro-area
 services and manufacturing output  shrank for a 15th month in
April. The reading of 46.5 in the Markit Economics purchasing-
managers index boosted speculation the  European Central Bank 
will trim  interest rates  when it meets next week, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Numbers below 50 indicate contraction.  ECB Cut  “Today’s PMI makes an ECB rate cut more likely,” Greg Fuzesi, a London-based economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a report.
“Our current call is for June, but there is an increased chance
that a 25 basis-point cut of the main rate could be delivered
next week.”  A separate report showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at
a slower pace than forecasts this month. The preliminary PMI for
April released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit stood at 50.5,
compared with a final 51.6 in March. That was below the median
economist estimate of 51.5 in a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes climbed in all 18 western
European markets, except  Greece . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased 2
percent and Germany’s DAX rallied 2.4 percent.  France ’s  CAC 40 (CAC) 
jumped 3.6 percent for the biggest gain since August.  The yield on Italian 10-year  government bonds  fell below 4
percent for the first time in almost 2 1/2 years today, while
Spanish and Portuguese rates dropped to the lower since 2010.  Volume Climbs  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies today was 18 percent higher than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ARM surged 12 percent to 972 pence, the highest price since
March 2000. Revenue in the quarter ending in March rose 29
percent to 170.3 million pounds ($260 million) amid demand for
it graphics and processing technology, the company said.
Analysts had predicted 160 million pounds, according to the
average of a Bloomberg survey.  Richemont (CFR)  rallied 8.3 percent to 73.80 Swiss francs, the
biggest gain since December 2008. The Swiss company said full-
year net income climbed about 30 percent as the dollar’s
strength against the euro boosted sales growth. Analysts had
expected a 25 percent gain in profit, according to the average
of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  All 19  industry groups  advanced in the Stoxx 600, with a
measure of insurance companies jumping 3.7 percent. Prudential,
the U.K.’s largest insurer by market value, climbed 6.2 percent
to 1,096 pence. Axa SA rose 4.8 percent to 13.65 euros in Paris.  STMicro Surges  STMicroelectronics NV, a maker of semiconductors, rallied
9.2 percent to 6.13 euros even after reporting a first-quarter
net loss. Chief Executive Officer  Carlo Bozotti  told analysts on
a conference call he expects “significant growth” in the
second half of 2013, driven by new products and improved demand.  Aixtron SE, a German maker of semiconductor- and lighting-
production equipment, climbed 10 percent to 10.66 euros, rising
for the first time in eight days. The shares advanced as U.S.
peer Veeco Instruments Inc. forecast “meaningfully higher”
bookings in the second quarter.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  increased 6.3 percent to 61.4 euro
cents. The Italian phone company that’s exploring a separation
of its fixed-line assets is considering a sale of an initial 30
percent stake in the new company to state lender Cassa Depositi
e Prestiti, two people familiar with the matter said.  Imtech tumbled 5.6 percent to 8.39 euros after the Dutch
provider of stadium infrastructure for the London Olympics
increased a writedown on projects in  Germany  by 70 million euros
($91 million) to about 220 million euros. The company is
investigating German and Polish projects and expects to present
the results in the summer, Chief Executive Officer Gerard van de
Aast said on a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
