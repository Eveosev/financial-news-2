Spanish police arrested two men
they said may have ties to an al-Qaeda terrorist group in North
Africa after one of them allegedly praised the recent  Boston
Marathon bombings .  The suspects, who were detained five days before the  Madrid 
marathon event, are not believed to have possessed explosives or
planned attacks though there are sufficient indications they
have links to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM,
Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters in Madrid
today. The men acted as “lone wolves” and were identified with
the help of French and Moroccan authorities, he said.  Madrid is set to double the number of security personnel
this year to host about 25,000 runners in its 36th edition of
the city’s Marathon on April 28 after three people died and more
than were 170 injured in the bombing in  Boston , newspaper  El
Pais  reported, citing Cristina Cifuentes, the central
government’s representative to Madrid.  The Algerian and Moroccan were respectively arrested in the
Spanish regions of Zaragoza and Murcia and have “similar
profiles” to the suspects in the U.S. bombings, police said in
a statement. The investigation lasted for more than one year.  The Algerian suspect regularly posted in radical online-
forums and expressed wishes to “die as a martyr,” according to
a statement from  Spain ’s  Interior Ministry . He praised the
attack in Boston, Fernandez Diaz said.  Spain has detained 13 Islamic terrorism suspects in the
country since the beginning of 2012, according to Interior
Ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
