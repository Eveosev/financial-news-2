Coffee prices declined for a fourth
consecutive week at an auction in  Kenya  as deteriorating bean
quality curbed demand.  The average price for all coffee sold dropped 12 percent to
$157.61 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $178.30 a week
ago, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today by e-mail. The
benchmark AA grade gained 1.2 percent to an average of $321.31 a
bag after supplies dropped.  Kenya produces arabica coffee, sought after for blending
into specialty beverages. Export destinations for the African
nation’s beans include  Germany , the U.S. and  Sweden , according
to the Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders Association, which
owns the exchange.  “Trading activity was low,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader
at Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “The quality of
coffee has come down a bit.”  Sales at the auction climbed 15 percent to 7,054 bags worth
$1.36 million, from 6,147 bags valued at $1.33 million last
week, the exchange said. Supply fell 4.7 percent to 21,487 bags.  Kenya’s coffee season runs from Oct. 1 through September.
Output in the current period may fall to 45,000 metric tons from
49,000 tons last season after lower global prices discouraged
farmers from investing, Louise Wanjira Njeru, managing director
of industry regulator Coffee Board of Kenya, said Feb. 15.  Following are details of today’s auction in dollars per 50-
kilogram bag:
