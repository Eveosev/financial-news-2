U.S. stocks will extend their gains
as the nation’s economy grows and outperforms other regions,
according to New York-based  Brian Belski , chief investment
strategist at BMO Capital Markets.  “Structurally, U.S. equities remain the best asset in the
world,” Belski said on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance.”
“And not just the best asset in a bad neighbourhood, just the
best asset, period.”  The strategist said investors should favor companies
exposed to the domestic U.S. economy. He advised not buying into
the best-performing industries this year, including healthcare
and utilities companies, which are known as defensives because
they tend to be less tied to economic growth.  “Any time you see” defensive industries outperforming
“and you combine it with a double-digit advance in the market,
I would call that goofy sector performance.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has rallied almost 10
percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
