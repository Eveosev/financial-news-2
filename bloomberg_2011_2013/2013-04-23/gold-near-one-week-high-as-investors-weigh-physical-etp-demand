Gold swung between gains and
losses, after rallying for five days in its best run this year,
as investors weighed increased physical purchases against
shrinking exchange-traded product assets. Silver fell after data
showed China’s manufacturing expanded at a slower pace.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,430.52
an ounce by 10:26 a.m. in  Singapore . The metal rose for five
days through yesterday, when it touched a one-week high of
$1,439.30. Prices are 8.4 percent below the $1,561.45 close on
April 11, before a two-day, 14 percent drop through April 15.
That was the worst slide since 1983.  The volume for the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s benchmark cash
contract jumped to a record yesterday, while sales of gold coins
at the U.S. Mint are almost triple so far in April compared with
total sales a month ago. Bullion held in exchange-traded
products decreased for a 15th day to 2,330.517 metric tons
yesterday, the least since November 2011.  “Gold has rebounded as physical demand picked up
significantly, but the magnitude of the rebound has been small
in light of the very sharp decline in prices,” said Feng Liang,
an analyst at GF Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s third-biggest
listed brokerage. “The persistent reduction in exchange-traded
funds continues to be worrying.”  Gold has fallen 15 percent in 2013 after advancing for 12
years through 2012. The metal touched a two-year low of
$1,321.95 on April 16, on speculation central banks in  Europe 
may sell holdings to raise funds and data showed China’s economy
grew less than estimated. Investor conviction about the
desirability of gold-backed exchange-traded products is
declining, Morgan Stanley said in a report today.  Coin Sales  Gold for June delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$1,428.30 an ounce on the Comex, gaining for a fourth day. The
U.S. Mint has sold 175,000 ounces of gold coins so far in April,
according to its website. That compares with 62,000 ounces sold
in the whole of March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cash gold of 99.99 percent purity was little changed at
288.65  yuan  a gram ($1,453.61 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange, China’s largest spot bullion market. The contract’s
volume reached a record 43,272 kilograms yesterday, according to
exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash silver dropped 0.5 percent to $23.324 an ounce. Spot
platinum fell 0.3 percent to $1,429.90 an ounce, while palladium
lost 0.9 percent to $677.20 an ounce.  China’s manufacturing is expanding at a slower pace this
month, adding to concern that the world’s second-biggest economy
is faltering. The preliminary reading of 50.5 for a Purchasing
Managers’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a final 51.6 for March.  To contact the reporter for this story:
