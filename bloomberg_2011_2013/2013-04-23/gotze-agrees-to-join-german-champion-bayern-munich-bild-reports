Borussia Dortmund playmaker Mario Gotze agreed to join German soccer champion  Bayern Munich ,  Bild
reported , without saying where it got the information.  Gotze, 20, will leave Dortmund at the end of this season
after Bayern agreed to pay the 37 million-euro ($48.2 million)
release clause in his contract, Bild added on its website. Gotze
has agreed on a long-term deal with Bayern and will be paid a
salary of about 7 million euros a year, the newspaper said.  Gotze won back-to-back Bundesliga titles with Dortmund in
2011 and 2012 and has helped the club reach this season’s
 Champions League  semifinals, where it faces Real Madrid over two
matches starting with tomorrow’s opener in Germany.  Bayern, which faces Barcelona in the other two-game
semifinal in  Europe ’s elite club competition, will have a new
coach from July when Pep Guardiola takes over from the retiring
Jupp Heynckes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
