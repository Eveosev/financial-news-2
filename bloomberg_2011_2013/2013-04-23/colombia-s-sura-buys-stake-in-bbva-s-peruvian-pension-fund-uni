Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana
SA , the Colombian pension-fund manager trying to double assets
by 2017, bought a 50 percent stake in  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) ’s pension unit in Peru.  Sura said in a regulatory filing that it made the purchase
through its Peruvian pension unit, AFP Integra. Profuturo AFP
SA,  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s pension unit in the country, bought
the other 50 percent, according to a separate statement from
Bilbao, Spain-based BBVA. The total purchase price paid by the
two companies was $514 million, Sura said.  Chief Executive Officer David Bojanini is targeting 15
percent annual growth at Medellin-based Sura, with assets set to
double through 2017. Peru is “very attractive for investment”
because of its economic growth rate compared with other Latin
American countries, Bojanini said in an interview in November.  Peru  will grow 6.3 percent this year, the fastest in Latin
America after Paraguay and  Panama , according to the
International Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
