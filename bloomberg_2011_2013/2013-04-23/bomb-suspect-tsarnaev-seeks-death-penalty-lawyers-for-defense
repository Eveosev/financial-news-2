Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the  Boston  Marathon bombing suspect, asked a court to appoint two lawyers with experience in death penalty cases to help with his defense.  Tsarnaev’s lawyer, Miriam Conrad, said in a filing in federal court in Boston that two lawyers who have defended capital prosecutions should be appointed, “given the magnitude of this case.”  Conrad cited the case against Jared Loughner, the gunman who killed six people and injured 13, including former Democratic congresswoman  Gabrielle Giffords , who was allowed to hire two attorneys with experience in death penalty matters to assist the public defender. Loughner pleaded guilty to the 2011 rampage and is serving life in prison.  Tsarnaev, 19, was charged with executing the April 15 bombings with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died of injuries sustained in a gun battle with police four days after the attack.  The case is U.S. v. Tsarnaev, 13--mj-02106, U.S. District Court, District of  Massachusetts  (Boston).
