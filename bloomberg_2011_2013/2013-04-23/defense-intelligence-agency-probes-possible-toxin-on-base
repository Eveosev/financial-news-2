A “potentially harmful substance”
found in mail at a Washington military base is under
investigation, the Defense Intelligence Agency said.  The agency said the substance was found today “during
routine screening of incoming mail” at Bolling Air Force Base.  “Tests by experts called in to assist indicate possible
biological toxins,” the Pentagon agency, which is based at
Bolling, said in an e-mailed statement. “Prudent screening
methods and force protection measures were implemented to
prevent personnel from being harmed. DIA has maintained normal
operations, and will not comment further on this event until an
investigation is complete.”  Army Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Veale, a spokesman for the
agency, declined to comment on whether the possible toxin may be
ricin, a deadly poison made from castor beans. A granular
substance that tested positive for ricin was found last week in
letters sent to President  Barack Obama  and Republican Senator
Roger Wicker of  Mississippi .  Paul Kevin Curtis, a Mississippi man who was charged in
that case, has been released from jail, according to Philip
Halbert Neilson, one of his lawyers. Another lawyer for Curtis
argued at a hearing in federal court in Oxford, Mississippi,
that the government lacked evidence linking him to ricin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
