National Petroleum Corp. of  Namibia 
wants to reduce its 54 percent interest in the Kudu gas field
off the southwest African nation, Managing Director Obeth
Kandjoze said.  Namcor, as the state-owned company is known, would keep a
30 percent stake, he said at a conference in Windhoek, the
capital. The company has a directive from the government to
produce first gas from the field by 2018.  Exploration off Namibia, where 18 wells have been drilled,
has so far focused on the Kudu gas field, still untapped since
its discovery in 1997. Namibia Power Corp., the electricity
utility known as Nampower, this month issued a tender for an
800-megawatt plant, expected to cost 9 billion Namibian dollars
($973 million) that will use gas from the Kudu field.  Namcor wants to resolve the sale of the interest in Kudu in
a matter of weeks, Kandjoze said. “We don’t want to keep it
open for longer in order to move things along,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
