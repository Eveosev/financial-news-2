EE, the U.K. joint venture owned by
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , said it has signed up
almost 400,000 fourth-generation mobile customers in its first
six months.  The U.K.’s largest mobile-phone service provider registered
318,000 4G customers through the end of March, London-based EE
said in a statement. The company, which has 26 million total
subscribes, has said it expects to reach 1 million customers for
its faster network by the end of the year.  EE is the first British company to be able to provide 4G
service, which makes file and video downloads faster and can
carry heavier traffic loads.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telefonica
SA (TEF) ’s O2 will join in with their own offers later this year
following a government auction of 4G spectrum that raised 2.34
billion pounds ($3.57 billion) from the industry.  “In the next couple of days we will even pass the 400,000
mark, so we have strong uptake,” Chief Executive Officer Olaf Swantee said on a conference call. “It’s not only consumers.
It’s really Britain’s businesses that are waking up to the
benefits of 4G.”  Carriers in  Europe  are counting on faster speeds and better
service from 4G upgrades to boost how much customers are willing
to pay for mobile service after years of heavy competition drove
service revenues down. EE is spending 1.5 billion pounds over
the next three years to develop its network and plans to cover
98 percent of the U.K. by 2014.  Monthly Bills  EE declined to provide average customer bills for the 4G
service. Customers across the business paid an average of 18.20
pounds per month, up from 17.80 pounds a year earlier, excluding
the effect of regulatory costs.  Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom’s merger of their T-
Mobile and Orange British operations to form EE was authorized
in 2010. The parent companies, which are examining their
strategies amid a slowdown in Europe’s economies, have said
they’ve considered selling shares in EE as soon as the fourth
quarter. The British company has also attracted interest from
private-equity firms, France Telecom has said.  Swantee said today that the parent companies haven’t
provided an update on their plans for the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
