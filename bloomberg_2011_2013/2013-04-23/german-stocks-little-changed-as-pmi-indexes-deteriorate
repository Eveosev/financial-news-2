German stocks  advanced for a second
day as falling yields on European government bonds offset data
showing the manufacturing and service industries in  Europe ’s
largest economy unexpectedly dropped in April.  Aixtron SE jumped 10 percent after peer Veeco Instruments
Inc. forecast higher bookings in the second quarter.  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  rose the most in three months, following European
travel stocks higher. Deutsche Bank AG rose for a third day.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 2.4 percent to 7,658.21 at
the close of trading in  Frankfurt . The measure rose 0.2 percent
yesterday, snapping six days of losses, as Italy chose a
president and the Bank of  Japan ’s stimulus policies went
unopposed at a Group of 20 meeting. The broader HDAX Index rose
2.3 percent today.  “It looks like the yield compression in periphery
countries is driving the market higher,” Ion Marc Valahu, co-
founder and fund manager at Clairinvest in Geneva, wrote in an
e-mail. “Also helping is that investors are running out of
assets in the search for yield/performance and are starting to
look at equities.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 29 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on Italian 10-year  government bonds  fell below 4
percent for the first time in almost 2 1/2 years, while Spanish
and Portuguese yields dropped to the least since 2010. Borrowing
costs in France and Ireland declined to the lowest on record.  PMI Drops  A gauge of German  manufacturing  from a survey by Markit
Economics dropped to 47.9 from 49 in March, while the median
estimate of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no
change. For  services , the index fell to 49.2 from 50.9.
Economists had predicted an increase to 51. Readings below 50
show contraction.  Separate data showed euro-area services and manufacturing
output contracted for a  15th month  in April. A composite index
based on a survey of purchasing managers in both industries held
at 46.5, London-based  Markit Economics  said.  In  China , a report showed manufacturing is expanding at a
slower pace this month. The preliminary reading of 50.5 for a
 purchasing managers’ index  released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit compared with a final 51.6 for March. The number was also
below the median 51.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11
analysts.  Aixtron Jumps  Aixtron, a maker of equipment for the semiconductor
industry, surged 10 percent to 10.66 euros, its biggest gain
since March 15. U.S.-based Veeco forecast “meaningfully
higher” bookings in the second quarter.  Lufthansa, Europe’s second-biggest airline, advanced 3.9
percent to 14.65 euros as European travel-related stocks rose.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s biggest bank, led gains on the
DAX, rising 5.1 percent to 31.69 euros.  Munich Re , the world’s largest reinsurer added 3.7 percent
to 154.85 euros, its highest price since September 2002. Allianz
SE, Europe’s largest insurer, added 4.1 percent to 109.15 euros.
A gauge of insurers posted the biggest gain of the 19 industry
groups on the Stoxx 600 Europe Index.  BASF SE (BAS)  advanced 2.5 percent to 67.66 euros. The world’s
biggest chemical maker said it will cut about 500 jobs at its
performance-products division making additives for the water,
leather and textile industries in an initial round of
restructuring to counter increased competition.  Sartorius Gains  Sartorius AG climbed 7.3 percent to 78.92 euros after
reporting first-quarter revenue of 214 million euros ($278
million), compared with 208 million euros a year earlier. The
maker of electronic equipment and components said it’s on course
for further growth and confirmed its 2013 forecast for revenue
growth of as much as 9 percent.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-biggest bank, slipped 1.1
percent to 1.08 euros, its lowest price since at least August
1992, as it carried out a reverse share split.  Commerzbank reduced the number of shares to 583 million
from 5.83 billion in the reverse share split, which is part of a
2.5 billion-euro capital increase plan.  Freenet AG declined 2.3 percent to 18.18 euros. Deutsche
Bank downgraded Germany’s biggest non-network telecommunications
company to hold from buy, citing limited upside to the shares
after gains in the last year.  Borussia Dortmund GmbH fell 2.7 percent to 3.14 euros after
 Bayern Munich  agreed to buy Mario Goetze, the 20-year-old
midfielder whose 10 Bundesliga goals put him among Dortmund’s
top four scorers this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
