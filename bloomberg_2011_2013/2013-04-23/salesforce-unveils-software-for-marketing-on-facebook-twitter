Salesforce.com Inc., the largest
maker of online customer-management software, introduced an
advertising application that lets brands run campaigns on
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Twitter Inc.  Social.com gives marketers software to create campaigns for
the Web and mobile devices, targeting data from Facebook and
Twitter, and analytics to track the performance of their ads,
the San Francisco-based company said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Marc Benioff  is pushing Salesforce
beyond customer-relationship software and into social-media
marketing with acquisitions of Buddy Media Inc. and Radian6
Technologies Inc. in the last two years. Earlier this year, the
company was among the first to sell ads appearing alonside
status updates on Twitter.  “Salesforce.com is doubling down on social ads,” Michael Lazerow, co-founder of Buddy Media and now chief marketing
officer for Salesforce marketing cloud, said in today’s
statement.  Salesforce  rose  2.9 percent to $41.47 at 12:35 p.m. New
York time. The shares had dropped 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday compared with a 9.5 percent gain for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
