Indiana Pacers  forward  Paul George 
was named the National Basketball Association’s Most Improved
Player after increasing his scoring, rebounding and assists
while helping his team to a division title.  George received 52 first-place votes from a panel of
sportswriters and finished with 311 of a possible 1,080 points,
beating runner-up Greivis Vasquez of the New Orleans Pelicans
(formerly the Hornets), who had 13 first-place votes and 146
points, the NBA said in a statement.  George, 22, entered his third NBA season with career
averages of 10 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. He
averaged 17.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists this season
and was named an All-Star as the Pacers went 49-32 to claim the
third seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs.  Danny Granger  was the last Indiana Pacer to win the award,
in 2009. Other Pacers named most improved were Jermaine O’Neal
in 2002 and Jalen Rose in 2000.  The Milwaukee Bucks’ Larry Sanders finished third in voting
this year, fourth-place went to Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando
Magic and Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers was fifth. All
three players received 10 first-place votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
