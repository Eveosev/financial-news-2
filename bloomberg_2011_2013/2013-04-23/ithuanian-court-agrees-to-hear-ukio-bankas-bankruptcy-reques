A Lithuanian court said it would
consider starting bankruptcy proceedings against  Ukio Bankas AB (UKB1L) 
at the request of the central bank, which shut the lender in
February citing risky loans to related parties.  Kaunas District Court agreed today to consider the Bank of
 Lithuania ’s request in a written process with a hearing on May
2, court spokeswoman Gintare Putnikiene said by phone.  Ukio was Lithuania’s fourth-largest bank by deposits when
it was closed. The lender’s liabilities exceeded its assets by
1.2 billion litai ($463 million) as of March 18, the central
bank in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital, said last week, citing
financial statements prepared by Ukio’s temporary administrator,
Adomas Audickas, and auditor KPMG Baltic.  “The bank was and remains insolvent,” the Bank of
Lithuania said on its website on April 18, proposing that the
court name Valnetas UAB as Ukio’s bankruptcy administrator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
