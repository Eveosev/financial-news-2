Israeli billionaire Stef Wertheimer, founder of the Warren Buffett-owned Iscar
Metalworking Cos., opened an industrial park in Nazareth today
that intends to provide manufacturing jobs for local Arab
residents.  The park’s aim “is to use the skills of the people of
Nazareth and surrounding area,” to create export-oriented
products, Wertheimer said.  Unemployment and poverty rates for Israeli Arabs, who
comprise about 20 percent of the country’s population, are
higher than for the Jewish majority. The percentage of Arabs who
participate in the Israeli labor market is about 41 percent
compared with 60 percent of Jewish citizens, according to a 2011
 report  by the  Israel  Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem research
center. Slightly more than half of Israeli Arabs live below the
official poverty line, according to the National Insurance
Institute.  Wertheimer, whose machine-cutting tools company Iscar was
bought by Buffett’s  Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)  for $4 billion in
2006, operates five other industrial parks in Israel’s outlying
Galilee and Negev regions that have attracted export-focused
manufacturers. He also established an industrial park that
opened in Gebze,  Turkey  in 2003.  The Nazareth park is planned to ultimately house about 25
companies and provide about 1,000 jobs. Some firms have already
set up there, including customer-services software provider
 Amdocs Ltd. (DOX)  and Alpha Omega Ltd., an Israeli Arab-owned maker of
precision medical instruments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
