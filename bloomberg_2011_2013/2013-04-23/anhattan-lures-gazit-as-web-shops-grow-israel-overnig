Gazit-Globe Ltd. (GZT) , the Israeli mall
owner that has 2 million people through its properties every
day, is concentrating on densely populated cities as a hedge
against growth in online shopping, said Chairman Chaim Katzman.  “We’re focused on urban real estate given everything
that’s going on with e-commerce,” Katzman said in an interview
at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York yesterday. “The
importance of urban markets will become greater and greater” as
retailers close stores in less populated and rural areas in
favor of cities such as Sao Paulo and New York where foot
traffic is high, he said.  Gazit-Globe has climbed 21 percent in New York in the past
year, beating a 2.4 percent drop in the  Bloomberg Israel-US
Equity Index (ISRA25BN) , as the Tel Aviv-based company’s focus on tenants
engaged in essential services -- such as barbershops and
supermarkets -- helped it weather the recession in  Europe . The
Bloomberg gauge of the 25 biggest Israeli companies traded in
New York gained 0.8 percent to 88.70 yesterday, as  Mellanox
Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  jumped before reporting earnings today.  E-commerce sales in the U.S. grew 15 percent to a record
 $186.2 billion  in 2012, according to data researcher ComScore
Inc., as online retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and EBay
Inc. boosted sales by at least 20 percent. While Gazit-Globe,
which owns commercial real estate in more than 20 countries, saw
revenue rise 22 percent last year to a record 7 billion shekels
($1.9 billion), analysts are projecting an 18 percent drop in
2013 sales to 5.7 billion shekels, estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Shopping Re-Invention  Retailers from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Sears Holdings Corp.
are struggling to re-invent themselves as consumers increasingly
shop online. Best Buy Co.’s new Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly has been closing big-box stores and improving e-commerce
operations at the world’s largest consumer electronics retailer.  Gazit-Globe, which spent the equivalent of $1.04 billion on
new acquisitions last year, had 41.9 billion shekels in total
debt at the end of 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While
the company is looking for new opportunities, it is also working
on reducing its leverage, through divesting assets that are not
performing well and raising more capital, Katzman said.  “We were clearly net buyers until the end of 2012,”
Katzman said. “The market has dried up, and since we won’t
compromise on quality, there’s not as much to buy today.”  Norstar Holdings  Gazit-Globe slipped 0.2 percent to $12.85 in New York,
extending its drop from a six-year high on March 26 to 6.8
percent. Its largest investor, Norstar Holdings Inc., sold a 2.4
percent stake in Gazit,  Israel  Brokerage & Investments said in
an e-mailed note April 9. Katzman is also chairman at Norstar,
which had a  54 percent  stake in Gazit-Globe on April 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The stock was at highs, so it was a good time for Norstar
to sell,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at Psagot Investment House
Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone yesterday. He has a hold
rating on Gazit-Globe. “It won’t cause a change in the
company.”  Shares of Gazit-Globe advanced 1.9 percent to 47.30
shekels, or $13.08 in Tel Aviv today.  The  Bloomberg Israel-US gauge  added 0.8 percent to 88.70,
capping a third day of gains. Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index
this morning rose 0.6 percent to 1,215.02.  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  led the gains on the Israel-US index,
jumping 3.7 percent to $5.83. Shares surged 8.8 percent to
22.96, or $6.35, in Tel Aviv today as Opko Health Inc. agreed to
buy the Israeli drug-maker for about $480 million, according to
a statement from the companies today. Miami-based Opko will pay
about $7 a share in stock.  Syneron, Mellanox  Syneron Medical Ltd. (ELOS)  declined the most on the index,
falling 1.8 percent to $8.84.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. added 3.4 percent to $61.28, the
most since April 4. Shares in Tel Aviv this morning advanced 3
percent to 220.50 shekels, or $60.97. First-quarter sales at the
developer technology used to transfer and store data fell 9
percent to  $80.8 million , according to the mean of 14 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Clicksoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW) ’s revenue rose 21 percent
to $26.3 million in the first three months of 2013, according to
the mean of three analysts’ estimates collated by Bloomberg.
Shares of the maker of computer programs used to manage
workforces gained 0.4 percent to $7.05 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
