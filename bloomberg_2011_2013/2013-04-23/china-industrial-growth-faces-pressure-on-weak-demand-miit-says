China ’s industrial growth is facing
downward pressure amid slowing domestic and international
demand, a Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
official said.  The lack of “efficient demand” and the unwillingness by
companies to invest are among challenges to the industrial
economy, Xiao Chunquan, a MIIT spokesman,  said  at a briefing in
Beijing today. Profits at industrial companies are at “very low
levels” compared with the past few years because of falling
product prices and surging costs, Xiao said.  “The appropriate” slowdown in industrial output growth is
“normal after years of high-speed growth,” said Xiao. “It
will help relieve pressure on resources and the environment.”  China’s  industrial production  increased 9.5 percent in the
first quarter, lower than the government’s target of 10 percent
growth this year, according to data collected by the National
Bureau of Statistics. A preliminary reading of HSBC Holdings
Plc’s purchasing managers’ index for China showed manufacturing
is expanding at a slower pace this month, adding to concern that
the world’s second-biggest economy is faltering.  The outlook for Chinese  exports  also isn’t optimistic given
the lack of external demand and trade protectionism, said Xiao,
who is also director general of the MIIT’s Bureau of Operation
Monitoring and Coordination.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
