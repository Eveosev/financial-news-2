India ’s one-year  interest-rate
swaps  touched a 27-month low on speculation cooling commodity
prices and slowing economic growth will spur the central bank to
reduce borrowing costs.  Brent crude oil fell 9.3 percent this month. India imports
about 80 percent of its oil needs. Wholesale  prices  rose 5.96
percent in March, the least since November 2009 and below the
central bank’s 6.8 percent projection for the month, official
data showed last week. The monetary authority has lowered its
repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points this year, and is scheduled
to review policy next on May 3.  “The softening of commodity prices gives more headroom for
the central bank to cut rates,” said Lakshmi Iyer, head of
fixed income in Mumbai at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.,
which oversees $6 billion.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, was steady at 7.26
percent as of 10:18 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate earlier touched 7.25 percent,
the lowest level since January 2011.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will reduce the repo rate by 50
basis points by the end of September, Iyer predicts. India’s
gross domestic  product  rose 5 percent in the fiscal year ended
March 31, the least since 2003, the statistics agency estimates.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds maturing in
June 2022 rose one basis point to 7.77 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 7.75 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
