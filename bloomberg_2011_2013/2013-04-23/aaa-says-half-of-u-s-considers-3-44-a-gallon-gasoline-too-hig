Half of U.S. drivers find the price
of gasoline too high at $3.44 a gallon, and almost two-thirds
are changing their habits on the road and at home to offset the
cost, a AAA survey found.  The average price of  gasoline at the pump  fell 0.3 cent to
$3.515 a gallon today, AAA said on its website. It’s been higher
than $3.44 threshold since Jan. 30.  The largest U.S. motoring organization said people are
driving less, delaying major purchases and limiting shopping and
eating out because of high gasoline prices, even as the  U.S.
economy  tries to rebound from job losses,  bank failures  and
housing market collapses.  “Most people have resigned themselves to paying higher gas
prices and are cutting back on driving, shopping and dining out
to save money,” Robert L. Darbelnet, chief executive officer of
Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, said in a statement.  About 46 percent of the 974 respondents in a AAA telephone
survey said gasoline prices are too high at $3 a gallon, and 90
percent said $4 is their threshold. AAA expects prices to be
between $3.20 and $3.40 a gallon this summer, said  Michael
Green , a spokesman for the organization.  More than half those responding said they are driving more
fuel-efficient cars because of high gasoline prices. One-third
are carpooling, 39 percent work closer to home and 15 percent
use public transportation more regularly.  About 86 percent said they are driving less, 71 percent
reported shopping and eating out more infrequently and 53
percent said they put off major purchases.  AAA said it surveyed landline and mobile phone users over
age 18 during the last three days of March and combined answers
from 974 people to determine the potential “consumer breaking
point” for gasoline prices. The study has a 95 percent margin
of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent, the organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
