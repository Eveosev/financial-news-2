The U.S. Treasury Department said
it took actions against two Lebanese exchange houses, Kassem
Rmeiti & Co. For Exchange and Halawi Exchange Co., for what it
called  money laundering .  “Today’s action reflects the Treasury Department’s
continuing commitment to target illicit financial networks that
launder millions of dollars in funds for narcotics traffickers
and that, in the process, provide substantial financial benefits
to the terrorist organization Hizballah,” the department said
in a statement today in  Washington .  The action was taken under Section 311 of the USA Patriot
Act, the first time that section was used against a non-bank
financial institution, the Treasury said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
