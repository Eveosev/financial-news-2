Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. lender, rose the most among firms on the KBW Bank
Index after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight
because expense savings are greater than potential legal costs.  The lender may trim $16.1 billion in costs over the next
three years, exceeding the added $5 billion that the Charlotte,
North Carolina bank may spend on  lawsuits ,  Betsy Graseck  of
Morgan Stanley wrote today in a research note. Bank of America
advanced 2.5 percent to $12.01 at 10:18 a.m. in New York.  “Bank of America is about to deliver on a significant
expense reduction over the next several quarters, which should
fall to the bottom line and boost earnings per share,” Graseck
wrote. First-quarter  results  “give us increased confidence in
management’s ability to right-size the business, shed legacy
assets and chop off tail risk.”  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 53, has sold
assets, repaired the firm’s balance sheet and settled more than
$40 billion in claims tied to defective mortgages. He has
targeted $8 billion in annual cost savings from his efficiency
plan, Project New BAC, and more reductions as the firm deals
with fewer delinquent mortgage customers.  The firm’s 1 percent  advance  through yesterday to $11.72
trailed the 11 percent rise of the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
and the 6.9 percent increase of the 24-company KBW Bank Index.
Graseck raised her price target by $3 for Bank of America shares
to $16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
