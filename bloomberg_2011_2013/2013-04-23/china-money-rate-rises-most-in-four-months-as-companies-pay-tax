China’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed the most in four months on speculation cash supply will
tighten as local companies pay tax this month.  The People’s Bank of China auctioned 10 billion  yuan  ($1.6
billion) of 28-day repurchase contracts today, according to a
trader required to bid at the sales. The preliminary reading of
a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.5 in April, compared with a
final 51.6 for March, according to data released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  “The increase in the seven-day repo is more the effect of
tax payments,” said Pin Ru Tan, a Hong Kong-based strategist at
HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. “Local companies pay tax every
quarter. For the second quarter, the tax payment is in April.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, increased 55 basis points, or 0.55
percentage point, to 3.71 percent as of 10:25 a.m. in Shanghai,
the biggest increase since Dec. 25, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
3.29 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editor:  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
