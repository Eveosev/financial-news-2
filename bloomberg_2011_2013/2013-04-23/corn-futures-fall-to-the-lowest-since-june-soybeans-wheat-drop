Corn plunged to the lowest in
almost 10 months on speculation that improving weather will
boost planting in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and
exporter. Soybeans and wheat also fell.  Less rain is expected to fall in the eastern Midwest of the
U.S. in the next six to 15 days than fell in the past week,
Commodity Weather Group said in a report today. That may reduce
corn-planting delays, according to the forecaster. About 4
percent of the crop was seeded as of April 19, double the amount
a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “The perception is that by the end of next week some areas
will be warm and dry enough to start planting again,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said by telephone. “If that happens, then most of
the corn will be planted in the May 1 through May 10
timeframe.”  Corn futures for July delivery fell 0.7 percent to $6.1925
a bushel at 10:28 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price
earlier touched $6.1325, the lowest since June 26.  Soybean futures for delivery in July slid 0.1 percent to
$13.625 a bushel in Chicago, heading for a third straight
decline.  Wheat futures for July delivery dropped 1.1 percent to
$6.95 a bushel on the CBOT after reaching $6.8825, the lowest
since April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
