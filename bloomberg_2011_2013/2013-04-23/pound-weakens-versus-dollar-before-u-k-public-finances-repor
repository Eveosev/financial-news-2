U.K. government bonds declined,
with 10-year yields rising the most in two weeks, as the Debt
Management Office increased planned sales of gilts by 4.7
billion pounds ($7.18 billion) this year.  Two-year yields  climbed to the highest level in six weeks
as European and U.S. stocks advanced, undermining demand for
safer assets. Gilts also fell as Britain’s budget deficit
narrowed more than economists forecast in March. The slide in
gilts increased the extra yield investors demand to hold the
U.K. securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds. The
pound strengthened against the euro.  “Although these borrowing data were not a surprise for the
market, other forecast revisions, including 7.1 billion-pound
upward revision in the central government net cash requirement
for 2012-2013, have consequently resulted in a revision of this
year’s funding remit,” said Sam Hill, a fixed-income strategist
at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “Perhaps that’s why gilts
underperformed bunds.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.70 percent at 4:26 p.m. in  London  after
falling to 1.62 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 5. The
1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 dropped 0.38, or
3.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.47.  The  two-year yield  rose as much as five basis points to
0.28 percent, the highest level since March 8.  Extra Supply  The U.K. debt office said it raised its planned bond sales
for the fiscal year started this month to 155.7 billion pounds.
The extra sales will include 300 million pounds more short-dated
gilts, 2.5 billion pounds more medium-maturity gilts, 900
million pounds of extra longer-dated securities and 1 billion
pounds more index-linked debt, it said in a statement.  The U.K.’s  budget shortfall  excluding temporary support for
banks was 15.1 billion pounds, compared with 16.7 billion pounds
a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said in
London. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
deficit of 15.5 billion pounds.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year U.K.
securities instead of German bunds increased for a second day,
rising three basis points to 45 basis points. The spread shrank
to 39 basis points yesterday, the narrowest since Feb. 4.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares rose 2.3 percent and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent.  U.K. gilts returned 1.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 0.9 percent and Treasuries rose 0.8 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound strengthened for a second day against the euro
after a European report showed services and factory output
shrank for a 15th month in April, adding to pressure on the
region’s central bank to cut interest rates.  The U.K. currency advanced 0.3 percent to 85.21 pence per
euro after gaining 0.3 percent yesterday. Sterling was little
changed at $1.5280.  The pound has weakened 3.4 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 3.6 percent and the euro rose 2 percent.  The data today “doesn’t change the bigger picture of the
country’s economic outlook which is weak,” said  Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan.
“The pound is likely to remain under pressure and we see any
rebound as an opportunity to sell.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
