German factory and service company
indexes unexpectedly dropped to show contraction, suggesting
weakness in the euro region is persisting into the second
quarter.  A gauge of  manufacturing  from a survey by  Markit Economics 
fell to 47.9 from 49 the previous month, while the median result
of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no change.
For  services , the index fell to 49.2 from 50.9. Economists had
predicted an increase to 51. Readings below 50 show contraction.  For the  euro area , a composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries probably held at 46.5,
according to the median of 26 economists’ forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey. That number will be released today at 9
a.m. in  London .  The Bundesbank said yesterday that sluggish industrial
production and cold winter weather may have delayed Germany’s
economic recovery, which it had forecast for the first quarter.  “While the industrial sector didn’t provide any growth
impulses in the first quarter of 2013, services should have
expanded,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly
report. “Against this backdrop, growth seems possible. But that
assumes that the impact of especially cold winter weather, which
was apparent in the construction sector, remained contained
within tight limits.”  German  business confidence  probably declined for a second
month in April, according to the median of 44 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Germany ’s Ifo research institute will
publish that report tomorrow at 10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
