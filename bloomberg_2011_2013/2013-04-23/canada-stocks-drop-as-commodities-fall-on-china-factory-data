Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in four days as commodities retreated after data showed
manufacturing in  China  is expanding at a slower pace.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  and Lundin Mining Corp. dropped at
least 2.8 percent as copper slumped a third day. Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. lost 1.4 percent as crude fell for the
first time in four days.  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  declined 3.5
percent after analysts lowered their ratings for the stock.
Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Banro Corp. slid more than 5.1
percent as gold declined.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 42.80
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,047.88 at 9:59 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has fallen 3.1 percent this year.  China’s manufacturing is expanding at a slower pace this
month on weakness in global and domestic demand. The preliminary
reading of 50.5 for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index released by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compared with a final
51.6 for March. The number was also below the median 51.5
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 analysts. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
