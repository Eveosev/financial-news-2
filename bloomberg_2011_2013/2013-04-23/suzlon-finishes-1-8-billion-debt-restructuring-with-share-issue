Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the Indian
wind-turbine maker that failed to repay convertible debt last
year, said it implemented its 95 billion rupee ($1.8 billion)
debt reorganization plan and issued new shares to lenders.  Suzlon completed an issue of 302.4 million shares at 18.51
rupees each to its lenders on a preferential basis, the first
phase of its planned allotment, the Pune-based company said
today in a statement.  The share issue was part of the $1.8 billion debt
restructuring plan the company’s domestic lenders -- comprising
a group of 19 banks -- approved in January after Suzlon failed
to pay $209 million of foreign-currency convertible notes on
Oct. 11. It was  India ’s biggest convertible-bond default.  The plan included a two-year moratorium on principal and
interest payments, a proposal to reduce the  interest rate  by 3
percent, an extension of repayment by eight years after the
moratorium begins Oct. 1  and equity allotment to its lenders,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
