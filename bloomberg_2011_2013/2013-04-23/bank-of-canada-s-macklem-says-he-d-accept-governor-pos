Tiff Macklem, the Bank of Canada’s
senior deputy governor, said for the first time he’s interested
in replacing Governor  Mark Carney , who leaves for the  Bank of
England  in June.  Speaking in Ottawa to lawmakers at the House of Commons
Finance  Committee , who asked him what the challenges might be
for Carney’s replacement, Macklem said he didn’t want to answer
interview-type questions, because there’s a separate process to
select a new governor.  “Yes, if asked, I will serve,” Macklem said in response
to a question about whether he had interest in the job.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said April 18 he has some
“very good candidates” for the position. He said earlier this
month it would be best to have a replacement by this month for
Carney, who is leaving June 1 to take over the Bank of England.  Carney’s successor will take over a central bank that has
balked at joining efforts by other Group of Seven bankers such
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to stimulate demand.
Canada faces its slowest growth since the 2009 recession and
Flaherty’s plans to eliminate the country’s budget deficit by
2015 limit scope for further fiscal stimulus if the economy
weakens further.  Flaherty said in January he will be directly involved in
the selection of Carney’s replacement. Analysts at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said last month the most likely candidates are
Macklem and Export Development Canada Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Poloz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
