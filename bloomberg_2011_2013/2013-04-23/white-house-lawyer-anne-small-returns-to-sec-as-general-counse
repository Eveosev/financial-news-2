The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said today that White House legal adviser Anne K.
Small would become the top market regulator’s general counsel.  Small has served as a special assistant and associate
counsel to President  Barack Obama , and worked for the SEC as its
deputy general counsel from March 2011 to October 2011, when she
joined the White House, the SEC announced in a news release.  Small’s hire shows how new SEC chairman Mary Jo White, who
took over April 10, is moving quickly to build her team of top
advisers and managers. White announced yesterday that George Canellos and Andrew Ceresney will co-direct the SEC’s
enforcement division. The general counsel oversees regulatory
developments and provides legal advice to the commission.  “I’m delighted that Annie will be returning to the agency
at a time when our rule writing is in full swing and our
enforcement program continues to pursue cases involving some of
the most complex transactions,” White said in a statement.
“The Commission will benefit from her experience, judgment, and
tremendous talent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
