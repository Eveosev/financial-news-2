The number of people receiving
emergency food handouts from a British charity nearly tripled in
the year to April as food and fuel prices rose.  The  Trussell Trust , which runs a network of “food banks”
across the U.K., said it helped 346,992 people in the period, up
from 128,697 in the year to April 2012. Its centers, staffed by
churches and voluntary groups, give out non-perishable supplies
to cover short-term emergencies.  Delays in welfare payments were cited by 30 percent as the
reason for coming, with low income blamed by 18 percent and
changes to the welfare system by 15 percent. At the start of
this month, more welfare changes took effect, as the government
tries to cut spending.  “We’re seeing people from all kinds of backgrounds turning
to foodbanks: working people coming in on their lunch-breaks,
mums who are going hungry to feed their children, people whose
benefits have been delayed and people who are struggling to find
enough work,” Chris Mould, the Trussell Trust’s executive
chairman, said in an e-mailed statement. “Since April 1, we
have already seen increasing numbers of people in crisis being
sent to foodbanks with nowhere else to go.”  U.K.  consumer price inflation  was 2.8 percent last month.
It has been above the Bank of England’s 2 percent target for
more than three years, hitting a high of 5.2 percent in
September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
