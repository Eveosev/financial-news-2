Former All-Pro linebacker  James Harrison  was signed by the  Cincinnati Bengals , remaining in the
same National Football League division after the Pittsburgh
Steelers cut him.  Harrison, who was released by the Steelers in March after
playing his entire 10-year NFL career for the American Football
Conference North Division team, agreed to a deal with Cincinnati
on April 19. The team listed the signing today on its website.
Contract terms weren’t disclosed, though ESPN said it’s a two-
year deal, citing Harrison’s agent, Bill Parise.  The 34-year-old Harrison won the 2008 Associated Press
Defensive Player of the Year award. He was named a first-team
All-Pro that season and in 2010.  Harrison has 64 career sacks. The six he had last season
while playing 13 games marked his fewest since becoming a full-
time starter in 2007.  The Bengals went 10-6 last season to finish in second place
behind the  Baltimore Ravens , earning a playoff spot as a wild-
card team. The Steelers were 8-8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
