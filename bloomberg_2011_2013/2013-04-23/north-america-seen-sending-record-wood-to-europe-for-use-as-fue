Wood pellet producers in the U.S.
and  Canada  sent record cargoes to  Europe  last year to meet the
continentâ€™s rising demand for biofuels, according to Wood
Resources International LLC, an industry researcher.  North American shipments advanced 60 percent to 3.2 million
tons last year, the Bothell, Washington, company said in a note
sent by e-mail today. Europe is purchasing more because
countries including the U.K., Belgium and the Netherlands need
to burn less coal to lower  carbon emissions  and they have
limited wood raw material resources, it said.  Shipments gained from British Columbia in Canada, as well
as from states in the south of the U.S. where 14 plants either
opened recently or will do so within the next year, Wood
Resources said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
