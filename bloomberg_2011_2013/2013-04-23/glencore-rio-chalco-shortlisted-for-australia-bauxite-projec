Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , Rio
Tinto Group and  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  are among companies
shortlisted by the  Queensland government  to develop a bauxite
project in the northeast Australian state.  Queensland last year invited bids to develop the Aurukun
resource, dropping a previous requirement to include a refinery.
Aluminum Corp. of  China , known as Chalco, in 2010 had ended an
accord with the state government to develop the mine in the Cape
York Peninsula after market conditions deteriorated. The project
cost was estimated at A$3 billion ($3.1 billion) at the time.  “The successful companies will now have until mid-
September to submit their detailed proposals for the mine,”
Deputy Prime Minister Jeff Seeney said today in an e-mailed
statement. “The government is working towards a final decision
on a preferred proponent by year’s end.”  Mining companies are seeking to cut expenses as commodity
prices decline, focusing on the lowest-cost projects. Refining
bauxite from Aurukun at an already existing refinery in
Australia or overseas would make the project more competitive.  The other shortlisted bidders are Chinese consortium
Australian Indigenous Resources Pty, made up of Hong Kong-listed
 APAC Resources Ltd. (1104)  and Aust-Pac Capital Pty, and Cape Alumina
Consortium, comprising Australia-listed  Cape Alumina Ltd. (CBX) ,
commodity trader  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  and Qube Bulk Pty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
