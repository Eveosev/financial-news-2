Dubai’s shares  rose to the highest
level in more than three years, spurred by investor bets on
first-quarter results from banks and telecommunication
companies.  The Dubai Financial Market General Index advanced 1.8
percent to 2,021.15, the highest close since November 2009. The
 volume of shares  traded reached 281 million shares, or about 30
percent more than the three-month daily average.  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the emirate’s biggest listed real-estate
developer, rose to the highest in almost two weeks, while  Air
Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the region’s biggest budget airline, closed at the
highest level since April 2010.  Dubai’s economy is recovering from a property crash and the
impact of the global credit crisis helped by a rebound in
tourism, trade and transport. Home prices and rents rose for the
16th month in March “highlighting the return of investor
confidence in Dubai,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a report
yesterday.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the only bank in the emirate
to report results, last week posted a 17 percent gain in
quarterly profit.  “Liquidity is high and investors are optimistic about the
first-quarter results,” Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-
based Al Fajer Securities, said in an e-mail. “We expect good
results” from banks and telecommunication companies, he said.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Dubai’s biggest bank, will report a 7
percent increase in quarterly profit to 686 million dirhams
($187 million) on April 25, according to the mean estimate of
four analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU) , known as Du, will post a  32 percent  jump
in quarterly profit, according to the mean estimate of five
analysts on Bloomberg.  Shares of Emirates NBD climbed 2.5 percent to 4.51 percent,
the highest since June 2011. Du gained 2.1 percent.  Air Arabia jumped 4.1 percent to 0.955 dirham. The carrier
said April 20 the number of passengers it flew in the first
quarter surged 18% from a year ago to a record 1.45 million.  Emaar advanced 1.3 percent to 5.35 dirhams and Dubai
Islamic Bank rose 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
