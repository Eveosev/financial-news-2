Estonian banks’ net income declined
22 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, mainly due
to lower net-interest income.  Profit dropped to “about” 81 million euros ($105 million)
from 104 million euros, the central bank, based in the capital,
Tallinn, said today in an e-mailed statement. Net interest
income declined 16 percent in the same period due to low base
interest rates, it said.  The Baltic nation’s lenders, led by local units of
Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  and  SEB AB (SEBA) , reported underlying net
profit increasing 8 percent last year as corporate lending
recovered following a slump in 2008 and 2009 when the Baltic
economies went through the deepest contractions in the 27-member
European Union.  Swedbank, the largest Baltic lender, expects corporate loan
market in  Estonia  to continue growing this year as export-driven
growth needs additional investment, Priit Perens, head of
Swedbank’s local unit, said in an interview on Feb. 20.  Credit growth to companies and households accelerated in
March to 2.8 percent from a year earlier from 2.4 percent the
previous month, with the stock of loans and leases by companies
having inreased 7.1 percent on year by the end of last month,
the central bank said. Amortization of mortgage loans still
exceeded new loan issuance, which grew 22 percent on year,
according to the central bank.  Savings growth accelerated to 8 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 7 percent in February, the central bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
