Italian  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly rose as two months of political gridlock that left
the country without a new government amid the longest recession
in more than two decades neared an end.  The confidence index increased in April to 86.3 from a
revised 85.3 in March, the Italian statistics office Istat said
in  Rome  today. Economists had forecast a drop to 85, according
to the median of 13 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italy ’s divided Parliament needed six rounds of voting for
a new president before the divisions forced the reelection of
Giorgio Napolitano, 87. He will now lead another round of talks
starting today to try to end the political impasse after
inconclusive elections in February.  Without a working government, Italy is struggling to
respond to the recession after eight quarters of economic
contraction. The region’s third-biggest  economy  will shrink 1.3
percent this year, according to a report earlier this month by
Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government that has managed the
country on a caretaker basis since the vote.  Monti’s austerity policies, including higher taxes and
spending cuts, pushed Italy deeper into recession. Italian
companies are facing shrinking domestic demand after joblessness
reached 11.6 in February, nearing the highest in more than two
decades.  Istat originally reported a consumer confidence index at
85.2 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
