Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s largest
natural-gas producer, saw profit wiped out in the first quarter
after booking currency losses and provisions for hedging.  The net loss was $431 million, compared with net income of
$12 million a year earlier, the Calgary-based company said today
in a statement. It reported a non-operating foreign-exchange
loss of $101 million, after an $86 million gain the prior year.  The result was “largely due to mark-to-market accounting
of the company’s unrealized risk-management position and a non-
operating foreign-exchange loss,” Encana said. It expects cost-
reduction efforts to be reflected in second-half figures.  Encana sells some of its output forward to protect itself
from falling prices. U.S. gas averaged $3.478 a million British
thermal units in the quarter, 39 percent more than a year
earlier as producers reduced drilling and demand was pushed
higher by cold temperatures. The futures recovered from a
decade-low last April on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Encana had hedged about 1.52 billion cubic feet a day of
expected April-to-December output as of March 31, locking in
prices at $4.39 per 1,000 cubic feet. It hedged 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day of 2014 production at $4.19 and 825 million
cubic feet a day of 2015 output at $4.37, today’s filing shows.  The company reported a 48 percent increase in oil and
natural-gas liquids volumes, with average production rising to
43,500 barrels a day in the first quarter. Average natural-gas
volumes were 2.88 billion cubic feet a day.  Chief Executive Officer Randall Eresman resigned in January
after six years in the role and was replaced by board member
Clayton Woitas until a permanent successor could be found. The
selection committee has drawn up a short-list of candidates and
plans to complete its search by the end of June, Encana said
today.  The company released results before the start of regular
trading on North American markets. The shares, which have four
buy, 18 hold and five sell  recommendations  from analysts, rose
0.6 percent to C$19.28 yesterday in Toronto. Encana has dropped
1.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
