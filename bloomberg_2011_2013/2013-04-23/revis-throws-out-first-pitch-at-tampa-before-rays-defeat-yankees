Darrelle Revis, acquired by the
 Tampa Bay Buccaneers  two days ago in a trade with the  New York 
Jets, threw out the ceremonial first pitch yesterday before the
host Tampa Bay Rays defeated the New York Yankees 5-1.  Revis, a three-time All-Pro cornerback, was cheered by fans
at the game, hours after being introduced at a news conference
as the newest member of the National Football League’s
Buccaneers.  Rays starting pitcher  Matt Moore  then limited the Yankees
to two hits over eight innings in St. Petersburg, Florida, to
improve his record to 4-0 this Major League Baseball season.  Ryan Roberts hit two solo home runs for Tampa. Both came
off Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia, who gave up five runs
over seven innings. Yunel Escobar added a two-run homer for the
Rays (9-10), who have won eight of their past 10 games against
the Yankees (10-8) at Tropicana Field. Sabathia allowed all
three homers in the first three innings.  Robinson Cano  had the Yankees’ only two hits, including a
solo home run in the fourth inning.  The Boston Red Sox, who lead the American League East
division, improved to 13-6 by beating the Oakland Athletics 9-6
as  Mike Napoli  hit a grand slam and drove in five runs.  The Baltimore Orioles (11-8) are in second place in the AL
East -- a half-game ahead of the Yankees -- after beating the
Toronto Blue Jays 2-1 on Nick Markakis’s run-scoring single with
two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
