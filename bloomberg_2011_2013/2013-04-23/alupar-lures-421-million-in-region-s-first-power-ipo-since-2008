Alupar Investimento SA, a Brazilian
electricity transmission and generation company, raised $421
million in South America’s first initial public offering by a
power utility since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.  Alupar, based in  Sao Paulo , raised 851 million reais ($421
million) after selling 46 million units comprising one voting
share and two preferred shares at 18.5 reais each, the low end
of its target range, according to data posted on the  website  of
 Brazil ’s securities regulator late yesterday. The units are
slated to start trading in Sao Paulo on April 24.  The sale comes as Brazil targets electricity rate cuts of
as much as 32 percent this year, while distributors struggle
with surging costs for power generated in thermal plants, which
have been operating on government orders since October to
compensate for low water levels at dams.  Eight electricity companies held IPOs in  South America  in
the past decade, five of them Brazilian, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The region’s last offering was from
 Colombia ’s  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA , which listed on July
8, 2008, two months before Lehman’s bankruptcy, the data show.
Brazil’s  Transmissora Alianca de Energia Eletrica SA  raised 1.5
billion reais in a secondary share offering on July 18.  Alupar plans to use 80 percent of proceeds from the sale to
acquire new concessions and assets and 20 percent to buy
existing transmission lines or generation plants, according to
the offering’s prospectus.  Banco Itau BBA SA, the wholesale arm of  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA (ITUB4) , the biggest Latin American bank by market value,
acted as lead coordinator of the offer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
