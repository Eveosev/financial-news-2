U.S. crude-oil options volatility
fell as the underlying futures settled 1 cent lower after data
from  China  and  Europe  pointed to slower manufacturing.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.75 percent at 4 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down from 23.74 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery lost 1 cent
to settle at $89.18 a barrel on the Nymex.  Futures fluctuated through the day after the release of a
preliminary reading of 50.5 for a  Purchasing Managers â€™ Index in
China by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics that was below
estimates. In Europe, a composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers held at 46.5 this month, London-based Markit
said. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  A false report of an explosion at the White House from the
Associated Press Twitter account caused oil to briefly extend
losses and U.S. equities to pare gains before the AP said its
account had been hacked.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $80 puts, which slid 5 cents to 21 cents a barrel on volume
of 4,217 contracts at 3:42 p.m. June $85 puts were the second-
most active, dropping 14 cents to 74 cents on volume of 2,073
lots.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
53 percent of electronic trading volume.  December $115 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 13,113 contracts changing hands. They
gained 2 cents to 32 cents a barrel.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 39,256
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 35,406 contracts
and June $85 puts with 33,264.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
