A unit of Japanese refiner  Showa
Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002)  and  Development Bank of Japan  will build a
solar power station with New Kansai International Airport Co.  The station at Kansai International Airport near  Osaka  in
western  Japan  will have 11.6 megawatts in capacity and is
expected to start running early next year, the companies said in
a statement today.  This is the first project of a venture between Showa
Shellâ€™s Solar Frontier K.K. and DBJ, set up in January to invest
in solar projects in Japan, according to the statement.  Solar Frontier will supply solar panels and operation and
maintenance services, while DBJ will support financial
structuring for the project, the companies said. Airport land
and buildings for the project will be provided by New Kansai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
