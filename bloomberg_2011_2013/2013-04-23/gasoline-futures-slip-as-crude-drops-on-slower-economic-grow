Gasoline futures dropped along with
crude after a report that  China ’s manufacturing is expanding at
a slower pace and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its outlook for
Brent crude prices. Crack spreads narrowed.  Prices fell as much as 1.9 percent. The fuel’s  crack spread 
versus June WTI declined 56 cents to $26.23 a barrel. The June
 spread  versus Brent sank 52 cents to $15.07. A preliminary
Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index for March showed a decline
from the previous month.  “The general consensus is it’s still about demand, and
it’s not getting better,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks and Opinions LLC in Houston. “Economic numbers are
still tepid. I think the Goldman report is going to weigh on
people.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 3.35 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.7359 a gallon at 10:31 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on volume that was 51 percent above the 100-day average
for the time of day.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to
$3.515 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  Goldman Sachs cut its near-term outlook for Brent oil to
$100 a barrel, from a previous outlook of $110 a barrel, and
lowered its 2013 forecast to $105 a barrel from $110 a barrel.  China Manufacturing  A preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index for China released
by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics came in at 50.5,
compared with a final 51.6 for March. The number was also below
the median 51.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11
analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  In  Europe , a composite index based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  held at 46.5, London-based Markit Economics
said today. It’s the 15th straight month below 50, which
indicates contraction.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery fell 0.65 cent to
$2.8029 a gallon on the Nymex. Trading volume was 26 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate
crude gained 38 cents to $28.60 a barrel. The June  spread  versus
Brent gained 52 cents to $17.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
