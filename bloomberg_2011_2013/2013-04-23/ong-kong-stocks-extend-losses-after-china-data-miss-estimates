Hong Kong   stocks  fell, extending
losses after a preliminary survey of China’s manufacturing
activity missed analyst estimates.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.7 percent to 21,883.62 as of
10:01 a.m. in Hong Kong. Just seven of the 50 companies on the
index advanced as consumer-goods companies led the decline. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in
the city slid 1.3 percent to 10,455.79.  A preliminary reading of a Purchasing Managers’ Index
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was 50.5 for
April, missing the 51.5 median estimate of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and below a final reading of 51.6 for
March. Every group on the Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s
broadest equity measure, declined.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures dropped 0.6 percent to 21,890. The
 HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 0.4 percent to 16.98, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
