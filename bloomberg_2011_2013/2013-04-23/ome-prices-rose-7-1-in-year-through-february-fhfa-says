U.S. house  prices   rose  7.1 percent in the year through February, the biggest gain since 2006, indicating a solidifying recovery as buyers compete for properties amid tight inventory.  Prices  climbed  0.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from January, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a report today from Washington. That matched the average estimate of 16 economists, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Home prices  have been increasing as improving employment and borrowing costs near  record lows  fuel demand for a limited  supply  of properties for sale. Prices haven’t declined on a monthly basis since January 2012, according to the FHFA’s data.  “The market was fairly strong in January and February and it continues to expand fairly robustly,”  Peter Morici , a professor of business at the University of Maryland who estimated a 0.7 percent monthly increase, said in a telephone interview before the report was released.
