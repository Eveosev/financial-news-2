West Texas Intermediate crude was
little changed as data from  China  and  Europe  signaled a slowdown
in global manufacturing and equities climbed for a third day.  Oil slipped 1 cent as China’s preliminary manufacturing
data for April showed growth was less than in March. Euro-area
output shrank for a  15th month . U.S. oil supplies rose to the
most since 1990 last week in a Bloomberg survey before a
government report tomorrow. Equities advanced on better-than-
expected corporate earnings and U.S. new-home sales. Crude
briefly extended losses as stocks pared gains just after 1 p.m.
in New York on a false report of a bombing at the White House.  “The Europe and China numbers are rather weak,” said
Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche
Capital Advisors. “The equities definitely helped oil today but
I do think we will continue to go lower. We had that blip due to
the false White House headline. It looked like there was some
high-frequency trading going on.”  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery settled at $89.18
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
dropped 8.3 percent this month and 2.9 percent this year. The
volume of all futures traded was 19 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day at 5:14 p.m.  Prices rose after the  American Petroleum Institute  reported
U.S. oil inventories decreased 845,000 barrels last week to
383.2 million. The June contract gained 37 cents to $89.56 a
barrel in electronic trading at 5:14 p.m. It was $89.32 before
the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent for June settlement fell 8 cents to end the session
at $100.31 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
volume of all contracts traded was 3.4 percent above the 100-day
average.  Chinese Manufacturing  “The manufacturing numbers were really what hurt the
market,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at
commodities trading firm Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “Some of the
earlier pressure has been relieved.”  The preliminary reading of 50.5 for a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index in China released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a final 51.6 for March. The number was
also below the median 51.5 estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11
analysts.  Brent Forecast  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its 2013 Brent price forecast
to $105 from $110 in a report today by analysts including
 Jeffrey Currie  in New York. They highlighted the increased risk
that Chinese demand growth will remain weak in the near-term.  The  International Energy Agency  and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced their 2013 global oil-
consumption estimates earlier this month.  “China gives more downside risk to these demand
forecasts,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based
analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more than $20
billion in companies’ annual energy spending.  In Europe, a composite index based  on a survey  of
purchasing managers in the services and manufacturing industries
held at 46.5 this month, London-based  Markit said . A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  “We’ve got some disappointing manufacturing data out of
both China and Europe and the market is under pressure,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is moving back and forth
based on changing economic perceptions.”  The European Union and China combined used 27 percent of
the world’s oil in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy. The U.S. consumed 21 percent.  U.S. Supplies  U.S. oil inventories probably rose to the highest level in
more than 22 years last week, according to a Bloomberg survey
before an Energy Information Administration report tomorrow.  Stockpiles probably grew by 2 million barrels to 389.6
million last week, the highest level since July 1990, according
to the median estimate of 11 analysts in the survey. The EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release
the weekly report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  WTI dropped to $88.29 at 1:10 p.m. from $88.87 less than a
minute earlier as U.S. equities erased gains following a post on
Twitter from the  Associated Press  saying that there had been
explosions at the White House. The AP said its Twitter account
had been hacked and there was no explosion. The contract
rebounded to $89.14 at 1:13 p.m.  False Report  “Oil went straight down with stocks on rumors that there
was a bomb at the White House,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 1 percent to
1,578.78, the strongest level since April 12. The index closed
at a record high of 1,593.37 on April 11. The benchmark equity
gauge briefly dipped as low as 1,563 following the Twitter post.  Sales of single-family properties climbed 1.5 percent last
month in the U.S. to a 417,000 annual pace, the Commerce
Department reported today in Washington. The  median  estimate of
76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for March sales to
rise to 416,000.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 22.7 percent, compared with yesterday’s 23.9 percent.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 581,288
contracts as of 5:14 p.m. It totaled 447,940 contracts
yesterday, 24 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.73 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
