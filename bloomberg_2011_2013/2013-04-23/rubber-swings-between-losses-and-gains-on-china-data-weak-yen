Rubber swung between losses and
gains as data showed  China ’s manufacturing is growing at a
slower pace this month, raising concern that demand may weaken
from the world’s largest user of the commodity used in tires.
The weaker Japanese currency supported yen-based futures.  Rubber for delivery in September fell as much as 0.7
percent to 249.1 yen a kilogram ($2,520 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the lowest level since April 19.
Futures swung between gains and losses and traded at 251.3 yen
at 11:48 a.m.  The preliminary reading of 50.5 for China’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics slowed from a final 51.6 for March. The number was
also below the median 51.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
of 11 analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “Rubber was capped by concerns that slowdown in  China’s
economy  may weaken demand,”  Kazuhiko Saito , analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  Losses were limited as Japan’s currency traded near a four-
year low against the dollar, making yen-denominated futures
attractive to investors, he said.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 18,635  yuan  ($3,017) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 1.9 percent to 80.50 baht ($2.80) a
kilogram yesterday, according to Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand. The price fell to 79 baht on April 19, the lowest
since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
