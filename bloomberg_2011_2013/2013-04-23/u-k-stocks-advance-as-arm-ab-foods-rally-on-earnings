U.K. stocks  advanced as companies
from  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  and  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  reported
sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  ARM jumped the most in 11 weeks after saying that demand
increased for its graphics and processing technology. AB Foods
added 1.8 percent as the owner of the Primark discount-clothing
chain also raised its dividend.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 24.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,304.76 at 9:09 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark lost 1.5
percent last week as economic data from the U.S. to China and
Germany missed forecasts. It has still  climbed 6.9 percent  this
year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also gained 0.4 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 0.6 percent.  In  China , the  preliminary reading  for a purchasing
managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics was 50.5 in April. That missed the 51.5 median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Figures greater
than 50 mean that manufacturing activity increased.  ARM surged 7.4 percent to 933 pence, its biggest gain since
Feb. 5, after the designer of chips for Apple Inc.’s iPad and
iPhone said that first-quarter revenue rose 29 percent to 170.3
million pounds ($259 million). That exceeded the 160 million-
pound  average estimate  of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  AB Foods gained 1.8 percent to 1,884 pence after reporting
 first-half revenue  of 6.33 billion pounds, beating the 6.15
billion-pound average analyst estimate. The British owner of
Twinings tea said first-half pretax profit rose 26 percent to
415 million pounds. The company increased its  interim dividend 
by 10 percent to 9.35 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
