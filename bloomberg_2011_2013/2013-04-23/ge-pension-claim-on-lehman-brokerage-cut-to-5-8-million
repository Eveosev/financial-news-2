General Electric Pension Trust will
settle a dispute with the defunct Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage
by agreeing to take a $5.8 million claim on the bankrupt estate,
down from the $356.6 million creditor claim it originally filed
in 2009, according to a filing in federal court in  Manhattan .  Creditors will get paid what remains after all customers
are compensated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
