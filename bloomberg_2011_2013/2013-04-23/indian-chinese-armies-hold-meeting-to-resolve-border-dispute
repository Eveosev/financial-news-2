Indian and Chinese military
commanders are holding a meeting to ease tension between the
world’s two most populous countries after an alleged Chinese
incursion along their disputed 3,550-kilometer (2,205-mile)
Himalayan border.  China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a
briefing today denied  India ’s allegations, while Foreign
Secretary Ranjan Mathai of the South Asian country summoned Wei
Wei, the Chinese ambassador in  New Delhi , for talks last week
after the incident in Ladakh in northern India.  “We have asked the Chinese side to maintain the status
quo,” Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for the Ministry of External
Affairs told reporters in New Delhi today. “We aim to resolve
everything peacefully.”  The nuclear-armed neighbors, home to more than a third of
the world’s people, claim territory held by the other and
clashed during a brief border conflict in 1962. India accuses
China of occupying 38,000 square kilometers of territory in
 Jammu and Kashmir  to the west, while the government in Beijing
lays claim to 90,000 square kilometers of land in Arunachal
Pradesh, a state in India’s east.  The two sides have been unable to resolve their disputes
after more than a dozen rounds of discussions since 2005.
Military relations between the two countries were suspended in
August 2010 after  China  issued a visa to an Indian army officer
in charge of forces in Kashmir without stamping his passport, an
act seen as questioning India’s rule over the disputed Himalayan
territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
