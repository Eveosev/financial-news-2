FedEx Corp. (FDX)  won a seven-year
contract with the U.S. Postal Service valued at about $10.5
billion to carry mail between U.S. airports, fending off a
challenge from  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)   The new accord to fly Express Mail and Priority Mail starts
in October once the current deal ends, FedEx said yesterday in a
 statement . The Memphis, Tennessee-based company didn’t give
details beyond the value and length of the agreement.  The contract locks in FedEx’s business with the Postal
Service and erases concern that it would lose some work to UPS
as the U.S. mail carrier restructures after years of losses.
FedEx has a larger U.S. air network and already has the labor
and assets to handle Postal Service volume, most of which is
processed during the day after the company’s premium overnight
packages and documents have been cleared.  “This contract win is a sorely needed shot in the arm for
FedEx,”  Justin Yagerman , an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New
York, wrote today in a note. He recommends buying the stock.  FedEx rose 1.4 percent to $94.46 in New York, while
Atlanta-based UPS fell 0.3 percent to $83.50.  FedEx shares have tumbled 13 percent since reaching a 2013
closing high on March 15. The company cut its annual earnings
forecast on March 20 as customers shift to cheaper deliveries.  Frozen Out  Analysts such as Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie Capital Inc.
in New York said FedEx investors were worried that UPS might
have taken away as much as 30 percent of the postal business.  FedEx described its bid as “competitive,” which Dougherty
said is a signal that it has lower profit margins than the
current contract. Dougherty rates FedEx outperform.  Some analysts trimmed their earnings estimates for FedEx.
Art Hatfield, of Raymond James in  Memphis , lowered his estimates
for fiscal 2014 by 15 cents a share, to $7.35, and for fiscal
2015 by 20 cents, to $8.60.  Although FedEx probably won the deal on “lower pricing,”
it was better than losing the business to UPS, Hatfield said.  “We view this deal as the best FedEx could have hoped
for,” wrote Hatfield, who rates the stock outperform.  The $1.5 billion-a-year contract implies about $100
million, or 6 percent, less in annual revenue, Deutsche Bank’s
Yagerman said.  FedEx got about $1.62 billion from the Postal Service in
fiscal 2012, up about 8 percent from a year earlier, according
to  estimates  compiled by Washington law firm Husch Blackwell
LLP, which tracks postal contracting. UPS got $126.4 million.  Contract Competition  UPS said in July that it planned to fight FedEx for the
postal contract, triggering speculation about what financial
terms might be set after the Postal Service lost $15.9 billion
in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.  The Postal Service didn’t elaborate on those issues
yesterday. The agency said in a  statement  that FedEx’s contract
proposal represented the “best value,” and a spokeswoman,
Katina Fields, declined to discuss specifics.  FedEx’s winning the sole award for the domestic airlift
work was a “disappointment” to UPS, said Kara Ross, a
spokeswoman for the world’s biggest package-delivery company.  “UPS has other contracts with the USPS and will continue
to provide excellent service and the company looks forward to
future opportunities to expand its business with the USPS,”
Ross said in a statement.  FedEx has been flying for the Postal Service for 12 years,
and the new accord provides more flexibility for possible
changes as the service restructures, FedEx Express Chief
Executive Officer David Bronczek said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
