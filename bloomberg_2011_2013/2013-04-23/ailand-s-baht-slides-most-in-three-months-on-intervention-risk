Thailand ’s baht dropped the most in
three months on speculation the central bank will intervene to
slow the pace of gains that may hurt exports. Government bonds
were little changed.  The baht has rallied 6.2 percent against the dollar this
year, the most among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. It has
started to move beyond its fundamentals, central bank Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said April 19, while Assistant Governor
Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said yesterday the baht has risen “too
much and too quickly.” The dollar’s 14-day relative strength
index has been below 30 since April 16, the threshold that
suggests to some traders the baht’s gains have been excessive.  “A sharp appreciation is hurting exports, while those
central bank comments are causing concern about possible
intervention,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in  Tokyo . “There must be some
profit-taking from the baht’s recent gain as well.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent, the most since Jan. 25, to
28.79 per dollar as of 9:10 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 28.56 yesterday and
on April 19, the strongest level since a devaluation in July
1997 that sparked the Asian financial crisis  Overseas investors  bought $2.1 billion more local sovereign
bonds than they sold this month through yesterday, adding to net
purchases of $9.8 billion in the first quarter, Thai Bond Market
Association data show.  Debt Sales  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of Southeast
Asia’s second-largest economy, increased 2.3 percent in March
from a year earlier after declining 5.8 percent in February,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey before a government report today due 1 p.m. local time.  “The basic trend remains for the baht to gradually rise on
fund inflows due to the solid economic outlook,” Hayashi at the
Japan Center for Economic Research said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was unchanged at
5.37 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent  government bonds  due June
2023 was 3.41 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Bank
of Thailand will sell 25 billion baht ($868 million) each of 28-,
91- and 182-day bills today. The government plans to auction 17
billion baht of debt due 2017 and 7 billion baht of notes
maturing 2027 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
