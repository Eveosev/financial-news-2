Philippine  stocks  fell, dragging
the benchmark index down the most in three weeks, after a four-
day rally drove the gauge above 7,000 for the first time.  Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI) , which has a Manila casino
venture with Genting Hong Kong Ltd., and  Philex Mining Corp. (PX) ,
the nation’s largest metals producer, led the slide, losing more
than 4 percent.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  sank 0.9 percent to
7,055.12 as of 11:35 a.m. in Manila, heading for the sharpest
loss since April 2. The measure rallied 4.9 percent in the past
four days to a record 7,120.48, pushing  valuations  to an all-
time high of 20.4 times 12-month projected profits, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Valuations have always been an issue,” Marvin Fausto,
who helps manage about $20 billion as chief investment officer
at Manila-based BDO Unibank Inc., said by phone today. “This is
a natural correction from yesterday’s exuberance of reaching the
7,000 level for the first time.” BDO Unibank is the nation’s
largest bank by assets.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index has surged 21 percent
this year as fourth-quarter economic growth data beat estimates
and after  Fitch Ratings  awarded the nation its first investment-
grade debt rating. The Philippine index trades at 22.8 times
reported earnings, the third-highest valuation in the Asia-
Pacific region after Japan and  South Korea , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
