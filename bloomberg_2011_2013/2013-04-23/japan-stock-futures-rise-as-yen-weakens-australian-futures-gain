Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average trading close to
its highest level in almost five years, as the yen weakened and
sales of new U.S. homes climbed.  American Depositary Receipts  of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, and  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
gets 80 percent of sales outside Japan, gained 1.9 percent from
the closing price in Tokyo yesterday. Shares of Daikin
Industries Ltd. may be active in Tokyo among suppliers to  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  after the maker of iPads forecast sales that missed
analysts’ forecasts.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 expiring in June traded at
13,695 in Chicago yesterday compared with 13,540 at the close in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 13,700 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  advanced 1 percent. The yen traded at 99.35 per dollar as
of 7:25 a.m. in Tokyo, down from 98.76 when Japanese equity
markets closed yesterday. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2
percent, a fourth day of gains.  “The economy in the U.S. is hitting that sweet spot where
it’s not bad enough to worry investors but not strong enough for
the  Federal Reserve  to start withdrawing stimulus,” said Stan Shamu, a markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne, a
provider of trading services in currencies and equities. “It’s
positive for the global economy. There are still heightened
expectations of central-bank action.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, rallied 5.8 percent this year through yesterday
amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering and as the Bank of
Japan stepped up economic stimulus measures. That left the gauge
trading at 13.9 times average estimated earnings compared with
14.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed. The gauge climbed 1 percent yesterday as earnings from
Travelers Cos. to Netflix Inc. beat estimates and new-home sales
rose in March.  Purchases of single-family properties climbed 1.5 percent
last month to a 417,000 annual pace, Commerce Department figures
showed yesterday in Washington. The median estimate of 76
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for sales to rise to
416,000.  Bomb Scare  A false report of explosions at the White House wiped $136
billion from the  S&P 500  in about two minutes yesterday. The
benchmark gauge was up 1 percent at 1:07 p.m. New York time when
a posting on the Associated Press Twitter account said there had
been explosions at the White House and President Barack Obama
had been injured.  The index erased almost the entire gain, recovering from
the plunge within three minutes as the news service said its
Twitter account had been hacked and there were no explosions.
Exxon Mobil Corp., Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft Corp.
briefly lost about 1 percent before recovering.  In Europe, a contraction in euro-area services and factory
output in April stoked speculation the  European Central Bank  may
cut  interest rates  to boost growth.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 0.5 percent in New York
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
