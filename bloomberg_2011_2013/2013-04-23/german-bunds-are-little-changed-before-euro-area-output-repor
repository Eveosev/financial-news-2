The euro fell to a two-week low
against the dollar as a report showed services and manufacturing
in the region shrank for a 15th month, adding to speculation the
European Central Bank will cut interest rates to spur growth.  The single currency dropped against 12 of its 16 major
counterparts as a German factory index unexpectedly declined
after the Bundesbank said yesterday the nation’s recovery may be
delayed. The yen and the dollar strengthened after an industry
report showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower pace,
boosting demand for safer assets. Sweden’s krona dropped after
the nation’s  unemployment rate  unexpectedly increased.  “The overall picture is pretty bleak,” said  Lutz Karpowitz , a senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt . “The likelihood of the ECB cutting interest rates
increased today. All in all, it’s negative for the euro.”  The euro declined 0.6 percent to $1.2989 at 6:51 a.m.  New
York  time after sliding to $1.2973, the weakest level since
April 8. The 17-nation currency dropped 1.3 percent to 128.02
yen after falling 0.2 percent yesterday.  Japan ’s currency
advanced 0.7 percent to 98.55 per dollar.  A euro-area composite index based on a  survey  of purchasing
managers in the services and manufacturing industries was 46.5
in April, below the level of 50 that separates contraction from
expansion, London-based Markit Economics said. A gauge of German
factory output dropped to 47.9 from 49, Markit said, while
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast no change.  ECB Rates  The ECB may cut borrowing costs if data show a need for it,
Executive Board Member Joerg Asmussen said April 20 on a panel
in  Washington . ECB President Mario Draghi said the previous day
the economic situation in the euro area hasn’t improved since
the central bank’s last policy meeting on April 4. The ECB’s
benchmark rate is currently at 0.75 percent.  The euro has still strengthened 1.8 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The yen slumped 10 percent and
the dollar gained 3.6 percent.  The yen advanced at least 0.6 percent today against all 16
of its major counterparts, rising 1.8 percent against Sweden’s
krona and 1.7 percent versus the Norwegian krone.  China ’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.5 in April
according to a preliminary reading released by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics said, compared with a final figure of 51.6
for March. A level above 50 indicates expansion.  Krona Drops  The krona dropped to a four-month low against the dollar
after Statistics  Sweden  said the  seasonally adjusted
unemployment  rate climbed to 8.4 percent in March from 8.2
percent the previous month. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for the  rate  to stay unchanged.  Sweden’s central bank last week delayed the timing of its
next interest-rate increase by about a year to late 2014, citing
a strengthening krona and inability of companies to raise prices
because of weak demand.  The krona declined 1.2 percent to 6.6053 per dollar after
depreciating to 6.6225, the weakest level since Dec. 18. The
currency slipped 0.5 percent to 8.5778 per euro.  The pound dropped to a two-week low against the dollar
after a U.K. factory index unexpectedly fell this month to the
lowest since October 2010.  The U.K. currency declined versus most of its 16 major
counterparts even as a separate report showed Britain’s budget
deficit narrowed more than economists forecast in March.  The data today “doesn’t change the bigger picture of the
country’s economic outlook which is weak,” said  Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan.
“The pound is likely to remain under pressure and we see any
rebound as an opportunity to sell.”  The pound weakened 0.4 percent to $1.5230 after sliding to
$1.5197, the lowest level since April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
