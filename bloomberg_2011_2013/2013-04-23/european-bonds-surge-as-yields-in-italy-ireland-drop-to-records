Italian bonds advanced, pushing
two-year note yields to a record low, as data showing European
output contracted more than economists forecast in April boosted
speculation the  European Central Bank  will lower  interest rates .  The yield on Italian 10-year government bonds dropped below
4 percent for the first time in almost 2 1/2 years, while the
rate on Irish two-year notes dropped to the lowest on record.
Portuguese and Spanish 10-year yields dropped to the least since
2010 as borrowing costs across Europe tumbled. German bunds rose
for a second day, with yields falling to the lowest since July,
as a purchasing managers’ report showed euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted for a 15th month.  “The weaker tone in the headline and German PMIs this
morning has fueled rate-cut speculation with regard to the next
meeting,”  Michael Leister , an interest-rate strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London. “Bonds are rallying across the board,
bunds as well as peripherals, which clearly shows to us that
this hunt for yield is really intensifying and the market is
expecting an ultra-low yield in environment to stay in place for
the foreseeable future.”  Italy’s two-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.18 percent at 11:01 a.m. London time,
after dropping to 1.165 percent, the lowest level since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993. The 6 percent
security due November 2014 rose 0.065, or 65 euro cents per
1,000-euro ($1,299) face amount, to 107.385.  The nation’s 10-year yield declined as much as eight basis
points to 3.975 percent, the lowest since Nov. 8, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
