Farmers in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso
state will produce more corn as a second crop than expected a
month ago after rain boosted yields, researcher Instituto Mato-
Grossense de Economia Agropecuaria said.  The harvest in the state, Brazil’s second-biggest corn
grower behind Parana, is predicted to be 14.6 million metric
tons in 2012-13, from a previous outlook of 13.3 million tons,
Cuiaba, Brazil-based IMEA wrote in an online  report  dated
yesterday. That compares with last year’s record 15.6 million
tons.  Favorable rainfall during the corn-growing season prompted
a crop survey by IMEA that led it to increase the yield outlook
by 10 percent, the researcher wrote. The harvest would be the
second-biggest ever, IMEA said.  Most corn in Mato Grosso is planted as a second crop after
soybeans. The outlook for Mato Grosso corn yields was raised to
88 60-kilogram bags (5.28 tons) per hectare (2.47 acres) from 80
bags per hectare in March, and compared with 104 bags in 2012,
according to IMEA.  For the Medio-Norte region, which grows more than half of
Mato Grosso’s second-crop soybeans, the outlook for yields was
lifted to 91 bags per hectare from 83 bags forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
