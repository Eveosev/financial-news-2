Serbia  should reach agreement with
the International Monetary Fund on a precautionary loan program
that would cover “at least” three years, state-run news agency
Tanjug reported, citing central bank Governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic.  The balance of payments does not require outright financial
support and the precautionary agreement would prove that Serbia
is a country where people will “gladly invest” because of
predictable economic conditions, Tabakovic told Tanjug in an
interview.  An IMF mission arrives in Belgrade on May 8 to open talks
on a new loan program and to conduct periodical review of
Serbia’s economic policies and monetary and fiscal performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
