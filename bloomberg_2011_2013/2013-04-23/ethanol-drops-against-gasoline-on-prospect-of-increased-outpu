Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for the third time in four days on speculation that
lower corn costs will prompt idled plants to resume production.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 0.32 cent to
31.36 cents a gallon at 11:37 a.m.  New York  time a day before
the Energy Information Administration is to release the latest
production and stockpiles figures for the biofuel. Output rose
8.1 percent to 832,000 barrels a day as of April 12 from a
record low of 770,000 in the week ended Jan. 25.  “We’re looking for a slight increase in production and a
build in stockpiles due to the lower corn prices,” said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in
Chicago. “It may just take a couple weeks to turn these plants
back on.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  dropped 3.3 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.426 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery declined 2.98 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.7396 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  As many as 20 plants idled output after drought in the
Midwest ravaged corn crops and devastated profits to make
ethanol, according to data from the Renewable Fuels Association
in  Washington .  Resuming Output  Some companies have resumed output, including  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) , which restarted operations at two of its idled mills and
another in February.  Abengoa SA (ABG)  resumed output at its
ethanol mills in York and Ravenna,  Nebraska , in February after
idling them for about four weeks, Christopher Standlee, a
spokesman for the company, said today.  Corn for May delivery fell 1.75 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$6.44 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread was 8 cents a gallon, down from 11
cents yesterday. That compares to minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
