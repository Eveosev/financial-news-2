The Delaware House of
Representatives voted 23-18 to authorize same-sex marriages and
to convert civil unions to marriages, a step toward making
Delaware the 10th state to recognize such unions.  The  bill  now goes to the state Senate, which like the House
is controlled by Democrats, according to the state General
Assembly website.  Nine states  and Washington, D.C., allow same-sex marriage,
including three states where voters authorized it last year,
according to the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign.  “This is a huge step forward for equality in Delaware,”
said Attorney General  Beau Biden  in an e-mailed statement.
“Everyone is equal under the law, and all Delawareans should be
free to marry the person they love.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
