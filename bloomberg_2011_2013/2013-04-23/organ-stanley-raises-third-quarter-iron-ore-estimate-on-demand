Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for  iron ore  prices in the third quarter on prospects that
demand will improve in  China , the world’s biggest buyer, and a
global surplus will be delayed to 2015.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to China may
average $128 a ton, up from $125 estimated in January, analysts
 Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane said in a quarterly report
today. While the bank cut its forecast for the final three
months to $125 from $130, it kept its 2013 estimate at $133. The
prediction for 2014 was reduced by 3 percent to $117 a ton.  Prices tumbled 13 percent from a 16-month high in February
as growth in China unexpectedly lost momentum in the first
quarter, threatening to curb demand for the steelmaking raw
material. Steel reinforcement-bar  inventory  fell in the week
ended April 12 to 9.99 million tons, the first time it dropped
below 10 million tons in six weeks, according to Shanghai
Steelhome Information.  “The latest steel inventory data suggests that finally
optimism about improving demand might be rewarded as both mill
and distributor inventories have started declining in absolute
terms and in days of consumption for the first time in several
months,” Morgan Stanley said.  The bank estimates the seaborne market to be in deficit of
16.2 million tons in 2014, from a surplus of 3.3 million tons
forecast in January. The surplus for 2015 was raised to 49.8
million tons from the previous forecast of 40.1 million tons.  Seaborne Trade  “Our assessment of the seaborne market balance and price
outlook in the light of the supply side issues and the improved
prospects for Chinese demand is that 2013 and 2014 will be years
in which the seaborne market remains in deficit,” the report
said. “We expect the deficit to progressively shrink as new
supply is ramped up in  Australia ,  Brazil  and  South Africa .”  The bank is bearish on supplies from Brazil, the biggest
exporter after Australia, cutting its estimate for shipments
from  Vale SA (VALE5)  to 263 million tons this year from 287 million tons
estimated in January. China’s demand will total 840 million tons
in 2013 from 832 million tons in January, it said.  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was  unchanged  at $138 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact the reporter for this story:
