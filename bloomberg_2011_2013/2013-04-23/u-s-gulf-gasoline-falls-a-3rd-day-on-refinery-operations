U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
for a third day, falling to an 11-day low against futures, as
operations returned to normal at Texas refineries owned by
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and Motiva Enterprises LLC.  Valero’s  Port Arthur  plant experienced no material impact
to operations after a system upset resulted in flaring
yesterday, according to  Bill Day , a San Antonio-based company
spokesman. The refinery has a capacity of 310,000 barrels a day.  Motiva’s  600,000-barrel-a-day refinery  in Port Arthur, the
biggest in the U.S., began restarting units last week after an
area power failure led to a shutdown of the plant on April 14.  Conventional,  85-octane gasoline  on the Gulf slid 3.75
cents to 20.25 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 11:59 a.m., the lowest level since April
12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CBOB’s discount has
increased 7.25 cents in two days, the biggest widening since
February.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  was unchanged at 2 cents below
Nymex futures.  The  3-2-1 crack  spread on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refinery margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, retreated $1.60 to
$23.19 a barrel, a second consecutive decline. The same spread
for Light Louisiana Sweet also slid for a second day, falling
$1.05 to $10.94 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
