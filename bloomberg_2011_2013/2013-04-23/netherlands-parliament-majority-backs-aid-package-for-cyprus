A majority of Dutch lawmakers
backed the 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) aid package to Cyprus
amid skepticism from the opposition about the island’s economic
prospects.  Economic growth prospects for Cyprus after 2015 can hardly
be considered to be realistic, Eddy van Hijum, a member of the
Christian Democratic opposition party, said in parliament today.
Mark Harbers, a member of the governing VVD Liberal Party, said
the country has the potential for gas and tourism revenue to get
the economy growing without its being dependent on aid.  European finance ministers signed off on the Cyprus terms
in Dublin at their meeting April 12 and April 13, concluding an
episode that exposed the tensions between northern creditor
countries and southern debtor countries that beset European
economic governance after three years of wrangling over the debt
crisis.  The debate comes amid difficult economic circumstances for
the coalition government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte. They
agreed on a four-year, 16 billion-euro austerity package in
October and will decide later this year on additional measures
of 4.3 billion euros for 2014. The Netherlands, in the throes of
a housing-market slump and facing its third recession since
2009, has breached the European Union’s deficit limit of 3
percent of gross domestic product since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
