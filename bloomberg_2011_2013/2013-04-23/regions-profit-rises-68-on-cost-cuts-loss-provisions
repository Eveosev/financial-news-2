Regions Financial Corp. (RF) ,  Alabama ’s
biggest bank, said first-quarter profit rose 68 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates on cost cuts and lower provisions for loan
losses. The shares rose the most in three months.  Net income climbed to $335 million, or 23 cents a share,
from $199 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier, the Birmingham-
based company said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was profit of 20 cents a share.  Regions’ 7.8 percent decline in non-interest expense to
$842 million exceeded a 2.4 percent drop at PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., the No. 2 U.S. regional bank, and a 3.5
percent cut at U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional
lender. Regions expects 2013 costs to be lower than last year,
the bank said in a slide presentation on its website.  “Building on this foundation while prudently managing
expenses, Regions is moving forward to take advantage of growth
opportunities in all of our businesses as the economy
improves,” Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 55, said in
the statement.  Regions rose 3.6 percent to $8.01 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York 
trading, the biggest gain on the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  Regional banks are reducing the amount they reserve for bad
loans, boosting net income as revenue growth stalls. Regions set
aside $10 million for soured loans in the quarter, compared with
$117 million a year earlier.  Revenue Decline  Total revenue fell 3.8 percent to $1.3 billion, according
to the statement.  Revenue from fees fell 4.4 percent to $501 million in the
period as service charges on deposit accounts, credit-card
income and commercial credit fee income declined.  Total loans fell 3.6 percent to $73.9 billion in the first
quarter from a year earlier, driven by a 28 percent drop in
total investor real estate loans, Regions said in a  supplement 
posted on its website.  Loan production should outpace attrition this year, leading
to growth in the low single digits in 2013, Chief Financial
Officer  David Turner  said today on a conference call following
the results. Hall said he’s seeing more diversity of loan
demand, which he called an encouraging sign.  The bank will continue to consolidate branches this year, a
process it goes through annually, Turner said on the call.
Regions has reduced its branch count by 16 percent since 2007,
the fastest of any other bank, he said.  Regions said last month it plans to raise the quarterly
dividend to 3 cents and buy back as much as $350 million in
shares. It said it may also repurchase or redeem as much as
about $500 million in trust-preferred securities after the
 Federal Reserve  didn’t object to its capital plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
