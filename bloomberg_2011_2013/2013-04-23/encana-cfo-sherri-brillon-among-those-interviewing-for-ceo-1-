Encana Corp. (ECA) ’s Chief Financial
Officer Sherri Brillon is among those being interviewed to head
 Canada ’s largest natural gas producer after the resignation of
the company’s chief executive officer in January.  The board plans to make a decision and have the new CEO in
place by the end of June, Clayton Woitas, interim CEO of the
Calgary-based company, told reporters today. Encana narrowed a
global search of more than 150 candidates down to a short list
now being interviewed. Three internal candidates including
Brillon submitted their names, he said.  “This is going to be the leadership of the company for the
next five to eight years. This is where we have to ensure we
have the best possible candidate,” Woitas said.  Encana’s CEO search began after the resignation of Randy Eresman, who transformed the company into a gas-focused producer
by spinning off its oil assets in 2009. Encana began signing
joint-venture partnerships and redirecting capital to increase
oil and petroleum liquids output as North American gas prices
fell to a decade-low last April, squeezing profits.  When a new CEO is named, Woitas, an Encana director, will
become chairman, replacing David O’Brien, who will retire, the
company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
