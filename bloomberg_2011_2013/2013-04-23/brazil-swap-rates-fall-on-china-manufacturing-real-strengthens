Brazilian swap rates fell as a
report that showed manufacturing improved less than forecast in
 China , the country’s top trade partner, fueled speculation that
policy makers will limit borrowing-cost increases.  Swap rates due January 2015 fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.23 percent at 10:38 a.m. in Sao Paulo,
the lowest on a closing basis since Feb. 14. The real rose 0.3
percent to 2.0137 per dollar.  A preliminary April reading of 50.5 for a purchasing
manager’s index published by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit
Economics compared with 51.6 in March. The median estimate of 11
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 51.5. A figure above 50
means the number of manufacturers who said conditions improved
was greater than those who said they deteriorated.  “Policy makers made it clear that the foreign scenario is
a main source of uncertainty for  Brazil  and the world economy’s
data has disappointed,” said Marcelo Fonseca, an economist at M
Safra & Co DTVM, in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “It will
be difficult for the central bank to not raise rates in May, but
the bets tend to converge toward a hike of 25 basis points. The
total tightening cycle could be just 100 or even 75 basis
points.”  The central bank’s board last week voted 6 to 2 to raise
the target lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from
a record low 7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18
of 58 economists had forecast an increase of 50 basis points.  Policy makers said in their statement that “resilience of
inflation” required a response tempered by the central bank’s
recognition that “external uncertainties” also required “that
monetary policy be managed with caution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
