Russia  needs to diversify its
economy away from oil and gas to spur economic growth, Suma Chakrabarti, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction &
Development, said at a conference today.  Russia is the country most dependent on its fossil-fuel
industry and would benefit from developing alternative sources
of power including wind and solar, he said at the gathering
hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in New York.  “Russia is so dominated by oil and gas, more than in the
Soviet Union era,” Chakrabarti said in an interview on
Bloomberg television.  The bank, based in  London , lends about 9 billion euros
($11.7 billion) a year for projects in a broad range of
industries from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, including 2.9
billion euros for power plants.  Demand for renewable energy is growing, and one of the
hurdles is inconsistent policy, he said.  “I’m seeing lots of renewable projects coming to our board
for approval,” Chakrabarti said.  “The biggest problem always is when you have a project
approved and it’s based on a policy framework that you’ve agreed
on with the government” and then “the rules of the game
change,” he said. “That can sometimes really endanger an
investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
