Treasury 10-year note yields fell
to the lowest level this year as slowing growth in  China  and
 Europe  underscored the appeal of  U.S. government debt  even with
the  Federal Reserve ’s unprecedented stimulus measures.  The U.S. sold $35 billion of  two-year notes  at a yield of
0.233 percent, just above the record low auction level of 0.22
percent at the July sale. Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped
briefly to 1.64 percent, the least since Dec. 12, following the
auction after an erroneous report of explosions near the White
House, which sent investors to seek the world’s safest assets.  “We have slow growth and will remain stagnant as the
market doesn’t seem to want to break either way,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, one of the 21 primary dealers required to bid at
the auction. “The auction came and went and was fair -- this
has been exactly where we have been for some time, as the front
end isn’t moving much right now given the Fed’s stance.”  Benchmark  10-year note yields  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.70 percent as of 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, after reaching 1.64
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 12. The price of the 2
percent note due February 2023 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000
face value, to 102 21/32.  Current two-year notes yielded 0.23 percent.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.58 basis points
yesterday, below the previous low of 51 basis points reached in
December. The data stretches back to 1988.  Foreign Buying  At today’s sale, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 3.63. The ratio was 3.27 at the last sale and
averaged 3.72 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 20.7 percent of the notes, compared
with 20.6 percent at the last sale and an average of 25.83
percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 27.7 percent of
the notes, compared with 21.8 percent at March sale. The average
at the past 10 offerings was 22.5 percent.  Primary dealers  purchased 51.6 percent of the notes at
today’s sale, compared with 57.6 percent at last month’s sale.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$667 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.98 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The U.S. plans to sell $35 billion of five-year notes
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year debt on April 25.  European Bonds  Yields on 10-year notes  tumbled  six basis points at 1:08
p.m. after an Associated Press report of explosions near the
White House. The yields quickly retraced the loss after AP said
its Twitter account had been hacked and there was no explosion.  Treasuries rose earlier along with European  government
bonds , with  Italy ’s two-year yields falling to a record, as
euro-area output contracted for a 15th month in April, boosting
speculation the region’s central bank will lower  interest rates .  The yield on Italian 10-year government bonds fell below 4
percent for the first time in almost 2 1/2 years, while Spanish
and Portuguese yields dropped to the least since 2010. Borrowing
costs in France and Ireland declined to the lowest on record,
while benchmark German 10-year bund yields slid to the lowest
since July.  ‘Weakening’ Economies  “We are in a lower-interest-rate-for-longer environment as
Europe and other countries are weakening every day, and things
aren’t great here, either” said Tom Tucci, managing director
and head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets
Corp. “People are still anticipating the Fed to be fully
engaged in easing, and the market is readjusting to that as well
as the expectation for Japanese buying that is helping keep the
bid.”  A  composite index  of activity in the service and
manufacturing industries in the 17-nation euro bloc was 46.5
this month, a separate report showed.  The preliminary reading of 50.5 for China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a final 51.6 for March. The figure was
also below the median 51.5 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
of 11 analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Sales of  single-family properties  in the U.S. climbed 1.5
percent last month to a 417,000 annual pace from a 411,000 rate
in February, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 76 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for March sales to rise to 416,000.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
bonds a month to boost the economy by putting downward pressure
on borrowing costs, including $937 million of securities
maturing between August 2023 and February 2031 today, according
to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
