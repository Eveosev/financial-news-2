Palm oil  advanced for the first
time in three days on speculation that a drop to the lowest
level in more than four months was overdone.  The contract for July delivery gained as much as 1.5
percent to 2,288 ringgit ($750) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,279 ringgit at 3:16 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures lost 2.3 percent in the two days through
yesterday when they dropped to 2,255 ringgit, the lowest closing
level since Dec. 13.  Shipments from Malaysia, the second-largest producer,
dropped 6.4 percent to 864,206 tons in the first 20 days of
April from a month earlier, surveyor  Societe Generale  de
Surveillance said yesterday. Exports fell 4.9 percent to 882,469
tons, surveyor Intertek said April 20. Declining exports and
expectations of higher production may lead to an increase in
stockpiles this month, according to Ker Chung Yang, an analyst
at Phillip Futures Pte.  Futures gained on “some bargain-hunting” by investors as
the “market is kind of oversold,” Ker said by phone from
 Singapore . “We still see the risk of prices going lower.”  Reserves dropped to a seven-month low of 2.17 million tons
in March as  shipments  gained for the first time in five months,
according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Futures lost 23
percent in 2012 when stockpiles rose to a record.  Soybean oil for July delivery gained 0.2 percent to 48.70
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans climbed
0.4 percent to $13.70 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery rose 1 percent to
close at 6,020 yuan ($975) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , after closing yesterday at the lowest level for the
most-active contract since October 2009. Soybean oil ended
little changed at 7,412  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
