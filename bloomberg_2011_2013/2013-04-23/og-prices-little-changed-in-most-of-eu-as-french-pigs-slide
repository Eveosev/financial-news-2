European Union pig prices were
mostly stable, staying unchanged in  Germany  while falling in
France and Belgium, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. said.  Hog prices in Germany, the EU’s biggest producer, remained
at 1.646 euros ($2.15) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from a week ago,
while those in Spain slipped 0.1 cent to 1.818 euros, Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  today.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to
fall to 40.1 kilograms a person this year from 40.5 kilograms in
2012, the EU said last month.  “Overall the European slaughter-pig market presents itself
as very quiet at the start of this slaughtering week,” ISN
wrote. “Again a wait-and-see sentiment in the market.”  Prices in  France , the third-biggest EU producer, fell for a
fifth week to 1.602 euros a kilogram from 1.63 euros. Prices
remained unchanged in the Netherlands, Italy and  Austria  while
falling 0.1 cent to 1.603 euros a kilogram in  Denmark  and
dropping 1.2 cents to 1.581 euros in Belgium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
