Most Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index heading for its first decline in three
days, after a preliminary report showed Chinese manufacturing
expanded less than economists estimated.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s third-largest
lender, slid 2.3 percent in  Hong Kong . Yamada Denki Co. sank 4.8
percent in  Tokyo  after the consumer electronics retailer missed
its full-year profit forecast.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil producer, jumped 9.7 percent
after announcing plans to return cash to shareholders.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.04 point, or less than
0.1 percent, to 137.34 as of 7:58 p.m. in Tokyo, after rising
0.3 percent and dropping 0.3 percent. About eight shares
retreated for every five that increased on the gauge. The
measure climbed 6.2 percent this year through yesterday as
Japanese equities rallied on speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
step up efforts to stimulate its economy. China’s manufacturing
is expanding at a slower pace this month, according to a
preliminary report today.  “There could be some overreaction in the market,” said Ng Soo Nam, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Asia Ltd., whose Japan-based parent oversees about
$165 billion. “I’m not too worried over China’s softening
economic data. The government is introducing policies to make
sure the economy moves along a sustainable growth path.
Valuations are still OK and earnings are still growing.”  China PMI  China’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2.6 percent, the
most since March 28. The preliminary reading of 50.5 for a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index, a gauge of manufacturing activity
that was released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics,
compared with a final reading of 51.6 for March. The number was
also below the median 51.5 estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey
of 11 analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 1.1 percent.  Japan ’s
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.3 percent as the yen advanced,
moving away from the 100-to-the-dollar level. South Korea’s
Kospi Index and Taiwan’s Taiex Index both dropped 0.4 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 1 and New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index added 0.7 percent.  Shares on the benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at
14 times estimated earnings as of yesterday compared with 14.1
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.4 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent today. The gauge climbed 0.5 percent yesterday as
Caterpillar Inc. jumped and a rally in commodity prices spurred
energy and raw-material producers.  ‘Prevailing Uncertainties’  Chinese lenders declined.  Agricultural Bank of China  sank
3.1 percent to HK$3.42 in Hong Kong, heading for the biggest
drop since Feb. 5.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. ,
the world’s biggest lender by market value, slipped 0.8 percent
to HK$5.21. China Construction Bank Corp. fell 1.3 percent to
HK$6.14.  “Investors are worried about whether the recovery of the
Chinese economy will continue,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating
officer at brokerage KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “If you look
at the number, it’s still above 50, so it’s not bad. But  market
sentiment  remains cautious because there are still prevailing
uncertainties like bird flu and the earthquake in Sichuan.”  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) , China’s biggest maker of the
material, slid 3.3 percent to HK$28 as its first-quarter profit
dropped 22 percent. China Mobile Ltd., the world’s largest phone
company by subscribers, lost 0.9 percent HK$81.85 after posting
its weakest profit growth in three quarters.  Earnings Performance  Of the 52 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that

available, 52 percent exceeded expectations, while 48 percent
missed forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Yamada Denki (9831)  sank 4.8 percent to 4,710 yen in Tokyo. The
company said yesterday it expects to report full-year net income
22 billion yen ($223 million), compared with its previous
forecast of 34 billion yen.  Among stocks that advanced, Woodside Petroleum jumped 9.7
percent to A$37.96 in Sydney, the biggest advance since November
2008. The company said it will return about $520 million to
investors in dividends after dropping plans to build a liquefied
natural gas project estimated to cost $45 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
