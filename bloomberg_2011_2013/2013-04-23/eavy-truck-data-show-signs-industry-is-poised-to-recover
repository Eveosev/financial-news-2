Net heavy truck orders have been
above 20,000 since December, an indication trucking companies
are doing more than just swapping out aging tractors for new
ones.  Truckers need to buy about 20,000 vehicles a month just to
replace older ones made by companies such as  Navistar
International Corp. (NAV)  and  Paccar Inc. (PCAR)  North American net orders
have averaged 21,619 a month since October and stayed above
20,000 since December. In February, net orders grew 3.4 percent
to 22,816, the first such monthly gain in 14 months.  While still shy of a full-fledged rebound in the industry,
investors see the early signs as reasons for optimism in an
industry that is an economic bellwether. Carriers are moving
more automobiles and home construction equipment, helping drive
demand for Class 8 tractors, the backbone of interstate hauling.  “There is a lot of optimism out there,” Kristine Kubacki,
a St. Louis-based analyst at Avondale Partners LLC. “It’s
really geared toward a back-half recovery.”  Truck production has risen each of the past two years, it
topped the typical replacement level of 250,000 in 2011 for the
first time since 2006 after a fitful recovery from the
recession-low of 120,000 in 2009.  New trucks are needed to replace aging models and to handle
more goods as the economic recovery gains traction. The American
Trucking Association’s truck tonnage index has risen 7.6 percent
since October to the highest level since December 2011.  Class 8 Concern  Forecasters initially expected new orders of 285,000 last
year. It ended up at 273,036, after a sluggish economy slowed
demand in the second half of the year, said Karen Ubelhart, an
analyst with Bloomberg Industries.  Despite the positive signs, Class 8 shipments will fall
about 12 percent to 240,719 this year, industry consultant FTR
Associates forecasts. Class 8 retail sales fell 18 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
Industries report.  Orders are running at an annualized rate of 250,000 to
260,000, FTR said. Orders tend to run higher early in the year
as freight haulers buy new trucks in advance of peak shipping
demand in the summer, Eric Starks, FTR’s president, said in an
interview.  “I expect orders to start moving down as we get into the
summer,” Starks said. “If they hold up, that’s a great thing,
but I don’t expect them to, based on traditional behavior. We
need to see monthly orders above 25,000 to be really optimistic,
but we’re just not seeing that right now.”  Fleets tend to replace trucks after three to seven years of
use, or about 500,000 miles, Starks said.  Cancellation Rate  The rate of canceled orders also is an important industry
indicator. Class 8 order cancellations in  North America  dropped
to 4.4 percent in March, the lowest level since December 2011,
from 7.1 percent in February, according to FTR. A cancellation
rate below 10 percent is a positive sign, Ubelhart said.  In addition, record stock prices and a housing-market
rebound are offering reasons for optimism, she said.  New home sales  in February capped the best two-month
stretch in more than four years, the U.S. Commerce Department
said March 26. Orders for durable goods climbed more than
forecast in February, boosted by automobiles and a rebound in
commercial aircraft. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained
11 percent this year and closed at a record of  1,593.37 (SPX)  April
11.  “Freight started to improve and that ultimately is what’s
going to move things,” Ubelhart said. “What drives freight?
The economy. A couple of sectors finally turned. The stock
market looks at orders and confidence is going to build if
orders stay at this level.”  Navistar, Paccar  Navistar, based in Lisle,  Illinois , has advanced 46 percent
this year, while Paccar climbed 7.9 percent. Those increases
compare with a 1 percent drop for Stuttgart, Germany-based
 Daimler AG (DAI) , the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars which also
sells heavy trucks, and a 1.1 percent increase for Gothenburg,
Sweden-based  Volvo AB. (VOLVB)  Columbus, Indiana-based  Cummins Inc. (CMI) , a
maker of engines including for Class 8 trucks, slid 0.8 percent.  The  U.S. economy  may grow 2 percent this year, the median
forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The nation’s
jobless rate fell to  7.6 percent  in March.  “We’re cautiously optimistic,” Starks said. “We’re
seeing some things that are really good and some things that are
not so good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
