Asda, the U.K. supermarket chain
owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , said sales rose 4.5 percent last
year and it’s investing 700 million pounds ($1 billion) into
stores and online operations.  Revenue including petrol advanced to 22.8 billion pounds,
the Leeds, England-based retailer said in an e-mailed statement
today. Asda will start same-day delivery services for grocery
orders and is building 12 new stores.  The U.K’s top food retailers are struggling to defend their
market share as the economic slump prompts shoppers to turn to
discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda’s biggest rival,  Tesco Plc (TSCO) ,
earlier this month reported its first drop in annual profit in
almost 20 years, and its dominant share has slipped below 30
percent.  Asda reported Feb. 21 that sales growth at stores open at
least a year had slowed to 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, a
weaker pace than the 1 percent for the full year.  The retailer’s market share slipped to 17.5 percent in the
12 weeks to April 14 from 17.6 percent in the year-earlier
period, Kantar Worldpanel figures showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
