Romania merged its supervision
authorities for the stock exchange, insurance and private
pensions markets into a single entity to meet pledges to the
 International Monetary Fund .  President Traian Basescu signed a law to form the Financial
Supervision Authority today in Bucharest, his office said in an
e-mailed statement. Dan Radu Rusanu, a lawmaker from the ruling
coalition, will probably head the office, while Daniel Daianu, a
former finance minister, may serve as vice president, according
to  Mediafax . Parliament must vote on their appointment.  Romania, the European Union’s second-poorest member, is
trying to complete a 5 billion-euro ($6.5 billion) precautionary
accord with the IMF and the EU in June, after getting a three-
month extension to have more time to complete pledged state-
asset sales and pass legislation.  “The approval of the financial authority is one of
 Romania ’s pledges to the IMF and needs to be respected,” Rusanu
said. “My plan, as head of the institution, is to have a non-
banking market, valued at about 15 billion euros, that is
compatible with other European markets.”  The government, which hasn’t drawn any money from the
bailout so far, plans to start talks on a new accord with the
lenders after the current one ends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
