The Jockey Club , the largest
commercial group in British horseracing, is marketing a debut
bond to individual investors to help fund development at its
Cheltenham racecourse.  The  Jockey Club , which was founded in 1750, wants to raise
at least 15 million pounds ($22.9 million) from the offer of
five-year securities, according to a statement from the London-
based company. As well as a coupon of 4.75 percent, the notes
will pay 3 percent a year in interest that can be used for
tickets, food and drink at the company’s 15 racecourses in the
U.K., including Aintree, Newmarket and Cheltenham.  Sales of retail notes listed on the  London Stock Exchange (LSE) 
jumped to a record 1.5 billion pounds last year compared with
230 million pounds in 2010, when the bourse started its bond
platform for individual investors, exchange data show. Sterling-
denominated company debt handed investors 2.3 percent this year,
outpacing 0.3 percent returns from euro bonds, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data.  “Our racecourse bond offers you generous cash returns at a
time of rock-bottom  interest rates ,”  Paul Fisher , group
managing director of Jockey Club Racecourses said in the
statement. “The money we raise from The Jockey Club Racecourse
Bond will go straight into British racing through the iconic 45
million-pound development we are planning at Cheltenham
Racecourse.”  Companies raised 340 million pounds from retail bond sales
so far this year, according to the LSE.  The Jockey Club’s bonds won’t be listed and there will be a
minimum investment of 2,000 pounds and a maximum of 100,000
pounds, it said. The notes will be marketed until about May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
