Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, will boost holdings of corporate debt and
stocks this year to counter depressed returns from government
bonds, Chief Executive Officer Michel Lies said.  Corporate debt and equities will rise as a proportion of
the portfolio while remaining below the industry average, Lies
said in an interview yesterday in  Lima , where he was attending
the World Economic Forum on Latin America.  Reinsurers are adjusting investments after central banks in
the U.S.,  Europe ,  Japan  and the U.K. attacked the longest and
deepest recession since the 1930s with low interest rates and
asset purchases. Underwriting income is helping to cushion lower
bond yields, Lies said.  “There are positive effects compensating the low-yield
environment for us,” Lies said. “It forces the industry to be
more disciplined in underwriting. If the market goes sometimes a
little bit crazy about accepting any kind of risk, we are not
ashamed of reducing our premium income.”  Swiss Re expects investment income to decline in 2013,
Chief Financial Officer George Quinn said on Feb. 21. The yield
on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to 1.85 percent at the end of
the first quarter from 2.21 percent a year earlier.  Emerging markets  will contribute 25 percent of Zurich-based
Swiss Re’s premium income by 2015 compared with 15 percent now,
Lies said. Latin America accounts for 5 percent. Munich Re is
the world’s largest reinsurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
