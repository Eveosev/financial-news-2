The Banking Association of South
Africa, which represents the country’s  lenders , and its members
may implement changes to unsecured lending rules by May.  Cas Coovadia, managing director of  Basa , said in a
presentation in Johannesburg today that the association wanted
to have new rules ready by the end of next month dealing with
lending affordability and the garnishing of workers’ salaries
when loans aren’t repaid.  South Africa’s National Treasury and the banking lobby
group agreed on Nov. 1 to tighten lending rules after the number
of consumers with bad credit rose to a record and the increase
in loans not backed by assets led to concern that a credit
bubble was developing.  The country’s  National Credit Regulator  reported unsecured
loans granted in the fourth quarter increased at least 2 percent
to 26 billion rand ($2.8 billion) from September to December
last year. The regulator said expanded research showed such debt
climbing 12 percent over the quarter to 29.1 billion rand.
Unsecured credit now makes up 11 percent of the country’s total
outstanding gross debtors’ book, it said.  “We do expect a deterioration in the unsecured lending
book,” Greg Saffy, Johannesburg-based analyst for RMB Morgan
Stanley, said in a note to clients on March 28. “With reduced
appetite and ability to adequately service unsecured credit, we
expect loan impairments to increase in the second half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
