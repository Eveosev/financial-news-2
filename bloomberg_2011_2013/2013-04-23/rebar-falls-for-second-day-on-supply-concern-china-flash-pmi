Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell for a second day amid concerns that production is too high
at local mills and after a preliminary reading of  China ’s
manufacturing in April trailed estimates.  The contract for October delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange declined by as much as 1.2 percent to 3,605 yuan ($584),
before trading at 3,625 at 10:42 a.m. local time. Futures lost 4
percent last week, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 22.  A preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood
at 50.5. That compares with 51.5 in a Bloomberg News survey, and
a final reading of 51.6 in March. China approved more steel-mill
capacity yesterday, giving the go-ahead to Shandong Steel Co.’s
8.5 million ton-a-year plant in Rizhao, according to the
National Development and Reform Commission.  “Supply is weighing on  market sentiment  as demand remains
tepid,” Lv Xiaohua, analyst at Everbright Futures Co., said by
phone from Shanghai today. “Worries about iron ore prices also
depressed sentiment.”  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $138 a dry
ton yesterday, the lowest since April 8, the Steel Index Ltd.
data show. Iron ore prices may average $125 a ton in the fourth
quarter, compared with a previous estimate at $130 made in
January, Morgan Stanley said in a report today.  The average  spot price  for rebar dropped 0.3 percent to
3,584  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
