Japan’s  government bonds  rose,
sending 10-year yields to a nine-year low, amid expectations the
central bank will increase debt purchases to support the
economy.  Benchmark bonds advanced for a second day before Shinzo
Abe, the front-runner to become the next prime minister, and
incumbent Yoshihiko Noda debate policies tomorrow ahead of a
general election next month. Japanese shares have fallen from a
six-month high and the yen has strengthened as the world’s
third-largest economy is forecast to be entering a recession.  “I expect to see 10-year yields drop below 0.7 percent,”
said  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst at Mizuho Securities
Co., one of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at sovereign
debt sales. “Everybody knows that the government and the
central bank have to boost stimulus to exit deflation and weaken
the yen.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 1 1/2 basis
points to 0.715 percent, the lowest since June 2003, as of 4:35
p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 0.8 percent security
maturing in September 2022 added 0.138 to 100.778 yen.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery advanced as
much as 0.18 to a nine-year high for a lead contract of 144.80
today.  The  Topix index  of Japanese shares dropped 1.3 percent to
771.39 today after reaching 787.74 on Nov. 26, the highest since
May 2. The yen jumped as much as 0.5 percent to 81.72 per
dollar, rekindling concern a stronger local currency will hurt
earnings at domestic exporters.  Recession Forecasts  Japan ’s gross domestic product will probably shrink 0.4
percent in the three months ending Dec. 31 after a 3.5 percent
decline in the third quarter, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Two-straight quarters of
contraction would meet the technical definition of recession.  Abe, who was the prime minister for a year through
September 2007, said yesterday that the  Bank of Japan (8301)  isn’t
taking responsibility for the real economy. He called for adding
a mandate to spur inflation as part of any changes to the law
governing the central bank.  The BOJ aims for annual inflation of 1 percent and
currently buys securities including government bonds through its
66 trillion-yen ($806 billion) program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
