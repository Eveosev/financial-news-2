China ’s money-market rate climbed
most in four weeks on speculation cash supply will tighten as
banks hoard funds to meet month-end  capital requirements .  The People’s Bank of China today gauged demand for seven-
and 14-day reverse repurchase-contracts before an auction
tomorrow, according to a trader required to bid at the sales.
Preparatory work for starting sovereign debt futures is
“basically complete,” the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing Jiang Yang, vice chairman of China Securities
Regulatory Commission.  “The rising repo rates shows banks are probably concerned
about the month-end cash supply,” said Wang Huane, a senior
bond trader at Qilu Bank Co in Jinan, capital of the eastern
Shandong province.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, touched a four-week high of 3.40 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center, and today’s 51 basis point gain is the
biggest since Oct. 29. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points to 3.37 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.1 percent government bond due September
2015 dropped two basis points to 2.98 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
