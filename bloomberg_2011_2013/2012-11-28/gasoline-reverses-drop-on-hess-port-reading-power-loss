Gasoline rose, reversing a decline
near the close of floor trading after Hess Corp. said its Port
Reading,  New Jersey , refinery lost power yesterday.  Futures rebounded as Hess said the 70,000-barrel-a-day
refinery was shut, just a week after returning to full
production for the first time since  Hurricane Sandy . Prices
slipped 1.8 percent earlier after the Energy Department reported
that gasoline stockpiles rose the most in four months last week.  “Knocking out Port Reading is a reminder that coming back
from Hurricane Sandy is going to take some time,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for December delivery rose 0.18 cent to settle at
$2.7339 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The more
actively traded January contract slipped 0.79 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.6877. December gasoline and heating oil futures
will expire Nov. 30.  Inventories of the motor fuel rose 3.87 million barrels to
204.3 million barrels last week, the highest level since the
week ended Aug. 3.  Gasoline demand  declined 5.3 percent to 8.43
million barrels a day, 3.9 percent below a year earlier.  “We have refineries returning from maintenance and we
continue to see year-on-year declines in gasoline demand,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Demand has slipped for two weeks after jumping 7.2 percent
in the seven days ended Nov. 9 as wholesalers restocked after
Hurricane Sandy disrupted production and distribution in the
Central Atlantic.  Lower Demand  “Gasoline stocks were also buoyed by a return to a more
normal and depressed level of implied demand,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP
Paribas SA in  London  and Gareth Lewis-Davies, an oil market
strategist at the bank, said in a research note. “Support for
gasoline is likely to weaken as stocks build seasonally from
current normal levels.”  The largest increase in gasoline stockpiles was in the U.S.
East Coast, or PADD 1 region. Inventories rose 1.25 million
barrels to 47.4 million. All refineries the area had resumed
normal production after Hurricane Sandy until Hess’s  Port
Reading  plant shut.  “You will continue to build seasonally, and in Padd 1 as
these refineries are coming back,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consultant
in London.  Distillate supplies , including heating oil and diesel, fell
800,000 barrels to 112 million last week, the lowest level since
May 2008. Demand tumbled 8.7 percent to 3.84 million barrels a
day, after rising the prior week to the highest level in 11
months.  East Coast  Stockpiles in the East Coast, or PADD 1 region, rose 1.92
million barrels to 36.4 million, after dropping the week before
to the lowest level since May 2008. Inventories are 36 percent
below year-earlier levels.  December-delivery heating oil fell 0.14 cent to settle at
$3.008 a gallon, after touching $2.9745. The more actively
traded January contract slipped 0.38 cent to $3.0209.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  fell 0.4
cent to $3.415 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. The pump
price reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
