Walt Disney Co., the world’s largest
entertainment company, raised its annual dividend by 25 percent,
joining other companies boosting their payouts ahead of an
expected tax-rate increase next year.  The 75-cent-a-share payment will be made on Dec. 28 to
shareholders as of Dec. 10, the Burbank, California-based
company said yesterday in a statement. The previous 60-cent
 annual dividend  was paid to investors in January.  The early payment allows Disney investors to sidestep a
possible increase in the tax rate, which is set to rise as high
as 39.6 percent from 15 percent with the year-end expiration of
Bush-era tax cuts. Disney’s yield of 1.5 percent remains below
the 2.2 percent average of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
can climb more, said Michael Foss, a portfolio manager.  “They still have room to move that dividend up over time,
even with all their growth initiatives,” said Foss, a Disney
investor at Brown Advisory in Baltimore. The company reported
holding 1.77 million Disney shares as of Sept. 30., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Disney was expected to raise its dividend to 70 cents,
based on Bloomberg Dividend Projections. The company posted
record revenue and profit in the fiscal year ended Sept. 29,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger said.  Fiscal Cliff  “Fiscal 2012 was another great year for the  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) , creatively and financially,” Iger said in the statement.  Disney gained 0.7 percent to $49.52 at 10:25 a.m. in New
York. Through yesterday, the shares had climbed 31 percent this
year.  The company will pay out about $1.3 billion with the
dividend. The Steven P. Jobs Trust, the company’s largest
shareholder, will receive about $103 million, based on data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 75-cent payment is more than twice
the 35 cents given out in 2009.  President  Barack Obama  and Congress are negotiating a deal
to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, more than $600 billion in
automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to begin Jan. 1.
In addition to raising dividends and paying them sooner to beat
the tax increase, companies are also declaring special
dividends.  More than 70 companies in the Russell 3000 stock index have
announced a one-time cash payment to shareholders since
September, up from about 15 in the year-earlier quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than a dozen said
they acted due to pending tax increases.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s largest retailer, earlier
this month moved the payment of its fourth-quarter dividend to
Dec. 27 instead of the previously scheduled Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
