Hydro Tasmania , the energy company
owned by  Australia ’s island state, is studying a plan to build a
A$2 billion ($2.1 billion) wind farm to provide power to the
national market and help reduce  carbon emissions .  Construction of the proposed 600-megawatt TasWind project
on Tasmania’s King Island would begin in 2017, with full
operation expected to start in 2019 if the company gains
community support and concludes the wind farm is viable, Hydro
Tasmania said today in an e-mailed statement.  Hydro Tasmania plans to transmit the power to the national
 electricity market  through an underwater cable stretching across
the Bass Strait to Victoria state, the company said.  The project would produce about 2,400 gigawatt hours of
energy, or more than 5 percent of Australia’s 2020 goal of
41,000 gigawatt hours, Hydro Tasmania said. Australia is moving
toward a target of getting 20 percent of its electricity from
renewable energy sources by the end of the decade.  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) ’s 420-megawatt Macarthur wind farm in
Victoria, at a cost of about A$1 billion, is expected to be the
largest in the southern hemisphere when it is fully operating
early next year, according to the Sydney-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
