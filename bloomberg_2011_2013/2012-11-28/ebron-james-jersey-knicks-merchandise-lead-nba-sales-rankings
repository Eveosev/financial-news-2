LeBron James  regained the top spot
in the National Basketball Association’s ranking of top-selling
jerseys, with New York Knicks’ merchandise now the most popular.  James, who led the Miami Heat to an NBA title in June, took
the lead from injured Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose, who
hasn’t played this season, the NBA said in a news release. The
 rankings  are based on sales at the league’s New York store and
on  NBAStore.com  from April through Nov. 26.  The league didn’t release sales figures.  Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant was second,
followed by Los Angeles Lakers guard  Kobe Bryant , Knicks forward
 Carmelo Anthony  and Rose.  James, the three-time NBA Most Valuable Player, has held
the top spot in jersey sales three times. Bryant, who has won
five championships with the Lakers, has led the list six times.  The Knicks jumped one spot in total merchandise sales to
the No. 1 ranking, passing the Bulls, who fell to fourth. The
Heat were second and the Lakers third. The Boston Celtics were
fifth and the Thunder sixth, followed by the Brooklyn Nets, who
moved to the new Barclays Center from Newark, New Jersey, to
begin this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
