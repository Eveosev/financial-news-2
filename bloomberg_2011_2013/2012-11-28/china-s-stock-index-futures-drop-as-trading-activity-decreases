China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its lowest level since 2009, as trading
activity slumped. Materials producers and property developers
led losses.  Citic Securities Co. dropped among brokerages as regulatory
data showed the number of stock  trading accounts  that made
transactions last week was the lowest since at least January
2008, excluding holidays. Zhongjin Gold Co., the country’s
third-largest bullion producer, lost 3.3 percent as the metal’s
price slid. Poly Real Estate Group Co. dropped the most in two
months after the Xinhua News Agency reported a leading think
tank recommended expanding a property tax.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.9 percent to 1,973.52
at the close, its lowest level since Jan. 16, 2009, as eight
stocks dropped for each that rose. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 1
percent to 2,129.16. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost
1.5 percent in Hong Kong. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
declined 1.6 percent in New York yesterday.  When the Shanghai index first hit 2,000, “it was 10-to-12
years ago and now we’re back at square one,” Hao Hong, Bank of
Communications Co.’s managing director of research, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. “Now we’re well below
2,000 and people will be looking for the next support level,
which could be 5-to-10 percent below here.”  The  Shanghai  Composite closed below 2,000 for the first
time since 2009 yesterday. The gauge broke above 2,000 in July
2000 and tripled to 6,092.06 on Oct. 16, 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1991. It’s fallen 10 percent
this year, heading for a third straight annual loss, as the
economy slowed for seven quarters.  Stock Valuations  Shares worth 33.1 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) changed hands
in the measure on Nov. 26, the least since Nov. 7, 2008. The
Shanghai index trades at 9.4 times estimated profit for 2012,
compared with the 17.7 average multiple since Bloomberg began
compiling the  data  in 2006.  Citic Securities,  China ’s biggest listed brokerage,
declined 1.4 percent to 10.25  yuan .  Haitong Securities Co. (600837) , the
second largest, retreated 1.6 percent to 8.26 yuan.  China’s money-market rate climbed most in four weeks on
speculation cash supply will tighten as banks hoard funds to
meet month-end capital requirements.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, touched a four-week high of 3.40 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center, and today’s 51 basis point gain is the
biggest since Oct. 29.  Economic Signs  Investor interest in mainland China-traded shares has
fallen even as data showed signs of a recovery in the world’s
second-largest economy. Industrial companies’ profit grew 20.5
percent in October, the statistics bureau said yesterday, while
factory output and exports both rose last month by the most
since May.  Fourth-quarter industrial output may be higher than in the
third quarter as the impact from growth policies becomes more
apparent, the Shanghai Securities News said today, citing an
unidentified Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
official.  The National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing are due to release a manufacturing
index for this month on Dec. 1. The Purchasing Managers’ Index
probably rose to 50.8 from 50.2 in October, according to the
median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
number of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  Property Stocks  Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489)  lost 3.3 percent to 15.08 yuan. Spot gold
fell as much as 0.2 percent today to the lowest level this week.  A measure of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite fell
2.2 percent today, the most in two months. Poly Real Estate,
China’s second-largest developer, dropped 3.5 percent to 11.01
yuan. China Vanke Co., the biggest, lost 1.4 percent to 8.34
yuan.  China should expand its pilot property tax reforms beyond
Shanghai and Chongqing and impose the tax on homes featuring
more than 40 square meters per person, according to a report
released yesterday by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  Policy makers have taken steps this year to revive
confidence in the $2.6 trillion stock market. China Securities
Regulatory Commission Chairman Guo Shuqing has reduced
transaction fees on equity trades, urged listed companies to pay
more cash dividends and changed how initial public offerings are
priced. The government also more than doubled allotments under
the qualified foreign institutional investor program in April to
$80 billion.  More Measures  “To reverse the situation, regulators need to work out
more support measures,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The Shanghai index will probably
fall another 10 percent before reaching a bottom.”  JiuGuiJiu Co. (000799) , whose liquors have been found to have
excessive levels of plasticizers, tumbled by the 10 percent
daily cap for a fourth straight day to 31.22 yuan. The company
said it didn’t halt total production and continues some liquor
production process as normal.  China isn’t a currency manipulator under U.S. law, though
the yuan “remains significantly undervalued” and needs to rise
further, the Treasury Department said in a statement
accompanying its semi-annual currency report to Congress
yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 13
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 0.8 percent to $37.05
in New York yesterday.  Carson Block  Carson Block  said it’s become too difficult to short
Chinese equities in the U.S. as bets on stock declines drop by
50 percent from a year ago.  Block, known for his allegations that Chinese companies
traded in North America engaged in accounting fraud, said in an
interview yesterday that he’s lost interest in betting against
the stocks because the government helps protect them. Short
interest in the 83 biggest Chinese firms listed in New York has
dropped to an average 2.61 percent of the total outstanding,
from 5.22 percent a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg and the
U.K. researcher Markit show.  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which
compiles corporate records in China, didn’t immediately respond
to faxed questions seeking comment today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
