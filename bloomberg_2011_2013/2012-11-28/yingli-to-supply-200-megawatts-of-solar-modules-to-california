Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) ,
China’s third-biggest module maker, said unit Yingli Green
Energy Americas will provide 200 megawatts of solar modules
under its biggest supply contract to southern California.  The modules will be used for LS Power Group’s Centinela
solar energy facility, scheduled for commercial operation in
mid-2014, Yingli said today in a statement. LS Power is a
developer of power generation and transmission projects.  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  will provide engineering, procurement and
construction services for the solar farm, with power generated
from the project to be purchased by San Diego Gas and Electric
through 20-year electricity purchase agreements.  Baoding-based Yingli said it has capacity to make 2,450
megawatts of solar modules annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
