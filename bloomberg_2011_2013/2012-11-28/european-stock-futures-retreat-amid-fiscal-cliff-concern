European stocks  were little changed
as investors assessed conflicting reports about the progress of
U.S. budget negotiations aimed at avoiding automatic tax
increases and spending cuts from coming into force next year.  Celesio AG (CLS1)  and  Metro AG (MEO)  both dropped more than 2.5 percent
after Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH said it will reduce its stakes in
the companies.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  lost 1 percent as the life
insurer took a larger-than-estimated writedown for its German
brokerage. Nestle, which accounts for 3 percent of the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , gained 1.2 percent after saying it will form a
joint venture with Hutchison China Meditech Ltd.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.1 percent to 273.15 at the close of
trading. The equity benchmark erased an earlier decline of as
much as 0.6 percent as Republican House Speaker  John Boehner 
said he was optimistic that Congress and President  Barack Obama 
will reach a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff of $607 billion of
automatic tax increases and spending reductions from coming into
effect in January.  “It’s great that Boehner’s making reassuring comments, and
investors are crossing their fingers Congress will follow
through with a deal,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in London. “If they can agree in
principle on the broad issues and leave some of the negotiations
for next year, that in itself would be a big step forward.”  Boehner told reporters in  Washington  that politicians will
continue their discussions “sooner rather than later” to avoid
the so-called fiscal cliff.  Fiscal Cliff  Erskine Bowles, the co-chairman of Obama’s 2010 fiscal
commission said it was unlikely the president and Congress will
reach an agreement by the end of this year. “I’m really
worried,” Bowles told reporters in Washington. “I believe the
probability is we’re going over the cliff.”  The benchmark  S&P 500 (SPX)  fell 0.5 percent yesterday as Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said Democrats and Republicans have
made little progress in negotiations over how to avoid the
fiscal cliff at the end of the year.  Reid, speaking to reporters in Washington, said that
following a Nov. 16 White House meeting, Republicans backed away
from their openness to considering new  tax revenue  as part of
the budget.  Sales of new houses  in the U.S. fell 0.3 percent in October
to a 368,000 annual pace, a Commerce Department report showed.
Economists in a Bloomberg  survey  had projected sales would
increase 0.3 percent to a 390,000 annual pace. They climbed 0.8
percent in September.  National benchmark indexes retreated in 11 of the 18
western-European markets. France’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.4
percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 added less than 0.1 percent.
Germany’s DAX advanced 0.2 percent.  Celesio, Metro  Celesio retreated 2.6 percent to 12.94 euros after Haniel,
sold 100 million euros ($129 million) of stock in the drug
wholesaler. The closely held German investment company sold
about 7.9 million shares at 12.60 euros apiece.  Metro declined 3.7 percent to 21.32 euros as Haniel said it
will reduce its stake in  Germany’s largest retailer  to 30
percent from 34.2 percent within 18 months. Haniel also plans to
raise about 150 million euros by selling non-strategic assets to
help reduce net borrowing below 2 billion euros.  Swiss Life  Swiss Life decreased 1 percent to 124 Swiss francs as
Switzerland’s biggest life insurer said it wrote down the value
of its AWD Holding AG unit by 576 million francs ($619 million).
That exceeded the average estimate of 463 million francs,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company forecast “reduced net profit in the double-
digit millions” in 2012 and cut its targeted return on equity
to between 8 percent and 10 percent over the next three years
from between 10 percent and 12 percent. In 2011, Swiss Life
posted a  profit  of 605 million francs. The stock jumped 15
percent last week.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  lost 1 percent to 2.54 euros. The mobile-phone
maker’s  American Depository Receipts (NOK)  lost 5.7 percent in  New
York  yesterday after Kantar Worldpanel ComTech reported that
Apple Inc.’s iPhone more than doubled its U.S. market share to
48 percent over the 12-week period ended Oct. 28.  OAO MegaFon slipped 2 percent to $19.60 on its first day of
trading in London after Russia’s  second-largest mobile-phone
operator  raised $1.7 billion in the biggest initial offering by
a Russian company in three years. MegaFon sold the stock at $20
apiece, at the bottom of an estimated range of $20 to $25.  Raiffeisen Drops  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  retreated 5 percent to
31.51 euros after eastern  Europe ’s second-biggest lender
reported third-quarter net income of 141 million euros. That
missed the  average analyst estimate  of 148 million euros,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  dropped 4.1 percent to 1.09 euros after
Moody’s Investors Service said it will review the ratings of
 Italy’s fourth-biggest bank  by assets for a downgrade. The
rating company cited concern about low internal capital
generation. It added that asset quality may further weaken.  Nestle climbed 1.2 percent to 60.60 francs after forming a
joint venture with Chi-Med to develop gastro-intestinal
treatments based on traditional Chinese medicines. Nestle Health
Science and Chi-Med will each own half of Nutrition Science
Partners Ltd., the companies said in a statement today.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  surged 9.1 percent to 62.6 euro
cents. The lender said  Allianz SE ,  Americo Amorim , Banque
Federative du Credit Mutuel and Union Europea de Inversiones
have exercised their rights to buy new shares in a capital
increase. The shares also advanced as Spain’s central bank
approved restructuring plans for the country’s rescued lenders
including Bankia SA.  Bankia’s shares slumped 9.3 percent to 96.1 euro cents. The
bank and three other Spanish nationalized lenders won European
Commission approval for government bailouts, enabling them to
recapitalize next month.  The VStoxx Index, which measures volatility on the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 50 Index, slid 2.5 percent to 17.26, its
lowest level since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
