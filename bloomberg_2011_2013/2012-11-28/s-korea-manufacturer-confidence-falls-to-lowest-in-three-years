South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell to the lowest level in more than three years as
gains in the won threaten to slow a rebound in exports and the
country prepares to vote for a new president next month.  An  index  measuring expectations for December fell to 67
from 70 for November, the lowest since April 2009, the  Bank of
Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul  today. A reading below 100
indicates that pessimists outnumber optimists.  Asia ’s fourth largest economy has shown improvement before
the Dec. 19 election, with overseas sales rising for the first
time in fourth months in October. At the same time, the won is
the best performing Asian currency in the second half of the
year, weighing on sentiment in a country where exports make up
about half of the economy.  A measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies 
dropped to 65 from 67 in November, today’s report showed. The
survey was conducted between Nov. 15 and Nov. 22 with responses
from 1,458 manufacturers and 1,062 non-manufacturers.  South Korea’s industrial production probably rose 1 percent
in October from a year ago after a 0.7 percent increase in
September, according to a Bloomberg News  survey  before the data
release tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
