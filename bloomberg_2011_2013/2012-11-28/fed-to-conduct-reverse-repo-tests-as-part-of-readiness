The Federal Reserve will conduct
tri-party reverse repurchase agreements tomorrow to test one of
the tools for an eventual withdrawal of the central bank’s
unprecedented monetary stimulus.  The operations, part of a series announced in 2009, don’t
represent any change in monetary policy, according to a Federal
Reserve Bank of New York  statement  today.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to the counterparties that act as counterparties to the central
bank.  Policy makers led by Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke have been
developing ways to eventually withdraw the cash they pumped into
the financial system to combat the deepest recession since the
1930s. Along with raising the overnight bank lending rate, Fed
officials have said they may use tools including reverse repos
to withdraw or neutralize cash in the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
