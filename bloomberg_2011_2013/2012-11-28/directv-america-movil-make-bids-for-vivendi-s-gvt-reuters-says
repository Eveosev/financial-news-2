DirecTV and America Movil SAB
submitted preliminary bids of more than 6 billion euros ($7.76
billion) to acquire  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Brazilian Internet unit GVT,
Reuters said, citing unidentified people familiar with the
matter.  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)  and a group of private-equity funds
also submitted preliminary bids, the  news agency  said today,
citing the people. The offers were below the 7 billion euros
Vivendi had sought, Reuters said.  While  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  didn’t submit a bid, the company
may do so after a Dec. 6 board meeting in which it will discuss
GVT, the report said. Vivendi plans to have final bids by
January, it said.  Vivendi’s press office didn’t answer phone calls from
Bloomberg after normal business hours. An America Movil press
official declined to comment to Bloomberg. Darris Gringeri, a
spokesman for  DirecTV (DTV) , and Hanne Wolf, a spokeswoman for Liberty
Global, didn’t immediately return phone messages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
