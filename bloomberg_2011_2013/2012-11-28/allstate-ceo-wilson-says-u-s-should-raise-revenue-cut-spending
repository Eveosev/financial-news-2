Tom Wilson, chief executive officer
of  Allstate Corp. (ALL) , told CNN that U.S. lawmakers should pursue
tax increases and spending cuts to resolve the so-called fiscal
cliff.  “It needs to be fixed because it’s good for the economy
and our businesses,” Wilson said today in an interview on the
news channel. “If it’s not fixed, the people that are going to
get hurt the worst are the poor and the elderly.”  Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, is the largest
publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
