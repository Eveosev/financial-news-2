Polish day-ahead electricity  dropped
for the first time this week as the country was set to cut
exports of power and increase imports from  Sweden .  Next-day power in Poland fell 7.5 percent to 178.38 zloty
($56.16) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Electricity flows via the undersea cable from Sweden were
set to be at a maximum of 600 megawatts for most of the day
tomorrow. Less Polish power was scheduled to be sent to the
Czech Republic, Germany and  Slovakia  in the early hours of
tomorrow amid declining prices in the neighboring countries,
data from Warsaw-based grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia slid 12 percent to 48.35 euros ($62.45) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. The day-ahead contract in Hungary settled 11
percent lower at 48.53 euros a megawatt-hour.  Polish baseload power for 2013 fell to a record 170 zloty a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
