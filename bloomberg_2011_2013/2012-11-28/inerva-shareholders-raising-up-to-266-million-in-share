Minerva SA (BEEF3)  and the  Vilela de Queiroz
family  that controls the Brazilian meatpacker are raising as
much as 556.9 million reais ($266 million) in a  share sale  to
fund its expansion and shore up finances after debt surged.  The Barretos, Brazil-based beef producer and its
shareholders are selling as many as 50.6 million shares at 11
reais apiece, according to information on the Brazilian
securities regulator’s website today. Shares were sold at a 4.3%
discount from today’s closing price of 11.50 reais.  Minerva, Brazil’s third-largest beef producer by market
value, is seeking to expand its beef slaughtering capacity in
Brazil,  Uruguay ,  Paraguay  and Colombia and boost output of
ready-to-eat meat products, it said Nov. 21. About 65 percent of
proceeds of the sale will be used to “reinforce the cash
position,” it said.  The company’s total  debt jumped  81 percent in two years to
2.61 billion reais at the end of the third quarter, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Minerva was founded in 1992 and is controlled by VDQ
Holding SA, a company owned by the Vilela de Queiroz family.
Minerva owns 12 plants in  Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay with
capacity to slaughter 11,480 cattle a day.  Before Minerva, companies raised 10.8 billion reais in
share sales in Brazil this year, according to data on the
securities regulator’s website. That compares with 19.2 billion
reais in 2011.  The new shares start trading Nov. 30. Banco BTG Pactual SA
is coordinating the sale along with Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC
Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley and Banco do Espirito Santo SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
