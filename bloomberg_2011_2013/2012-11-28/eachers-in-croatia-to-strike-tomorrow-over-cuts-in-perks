Croatia’s teachers at primary,
secondary schools and universities, will hold a one-day strike
tomorrow against the government’s plan to reduce their benefits.  Teachers hope the strike will change the government’s Sept.
17 decision to cancel collective contracts that stipulate
benefits for public workers, Vilim Ribic, head of the teachers’
union, told state TV late yesterday.
