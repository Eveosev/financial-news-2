Colombia won’t recognize the right
of an international court in The Hague to rule in territorial
disputes after the court awarded Nicaragua sovereignty over
waters surrounding seven Colombian islands in the Caribbean.  “We’re withdrawing from the Bogota pact,” Interior
Minister Fernando Carrillo said in an interview today, referring
to the 1948 agreement that set up the arbitration system.  Territorial and maritime borders should be set by treaties
and not court rulings, President Juan Manuel Santos also said
today, according to en e-mailed statement from his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
