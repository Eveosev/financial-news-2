Chile’s Congress approved the 2013
budget proposal, raising spending by 5 percent above  inflation 
and potentially adding to pressure on the central bank to raise
 interest rates  as the current account gap widens.  The bill will now go to President Sebastian Pinera for
final approval after a clause on regulations for vaccinations
was removed, the government’s Budget Office said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  Authorities will be tempted to expand expenditure more than
planned ahead of elections in November 2013, and as the economy
is forecast to grow 4.8 percent, economist Jorge Selaive said.
With state spending stimulating growth, the onus falls on the
central bank to moderate internal demand and narrow the current
account gap, he said.  “ Monetary policy  will have to be more restrictive because
fiscal policy is being very expansive,” Selaive, chief
economist at  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI) , said by phone from
Santiago Nov. 26. “The central bank will have to start taking
charge of this current account deficit.”  Chile had a current account gap equivalent to 7.4 percent
of gross domestic product in the third quarter, compared with a
2.7 percent deficit in the second quarter and 0.3 percent
surplus in the first. Imports grew 2.5 percent in the third
quarter from the year before, while exports fell 3.4 percent.  Fiscal spending will rise 6.3 percent in 2012 as the
economy expands a little faster than 5 percent, Budget Office
Director Rosanna Costa told reporters Oct. 30. Public spending
expanded 3.3 percent in 2011, when GDP climbed 6 percent.  Policy makers have kept their benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 5 percent for 10 straight months following a cut in
January that surprised economists. Analysts surveyed yesterday
by the central bank expect borrowing costs to remain at 5
percent through next year before rising to 5.25 percent by
December 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
