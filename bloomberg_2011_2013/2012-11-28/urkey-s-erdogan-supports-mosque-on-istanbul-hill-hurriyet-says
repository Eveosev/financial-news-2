Turkey’s Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said he was pleased with the design of a mosque planned
for Istanbul’s highest hill,  Hurriyet newspaper  said today,
citing the premier.  The Islamic house of worship will be built on top of the
Camlica hill by the Bosporus Strait, said Hurriyet. Turkey’s
main secular opposition  Republican People’s Party  has previously
said it regards the move as part of an attempt by the Islamic-
rooted government to put a religious stamp on daily life in
Turkey.  Erdogan, meanwhile, also confirmed plans yesterday to build
a mosque in downtown Taksim Square, which is frequented by
tourists visiting Istanbul, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
