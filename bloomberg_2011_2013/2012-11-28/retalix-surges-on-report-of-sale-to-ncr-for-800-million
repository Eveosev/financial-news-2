Retalix Ltd. (RTLX) , the Israeli maker of
supermarket software, soared the most since its initial public
offering in 1998 after daily Calcalist reported that  NCR Corp. (NCR) 
is in talks to buy the company for $800 million in cash.  Ra’Anana, Israel-based Retalix surged 35 percent to $29.50
by 3:20 p.m. in New York before trading in the shares was
halted, pending news. Retalix shares traded in  Tel Aviv  added
0.4 percent to close at 84.84 shekels, or $22.05.  NCR, the Duluth, Georgia-based maker of automated teller
machines and payment systems, will pay $30 to $31 per share for
Retalix in a transaction that is expected to be signed in the
next couple of days, Calcalist  reported  on its website, without
saying where it got the information. The offering price presents
a 37 percent premium to yesterday’s close.  Calls and e-mails made after hours to Retalix’s offices in
Israel weren’t returned. Mark Scott, an NCR spokesman, didn’t
immediately return a phone call and e-mails.  To contact the reporter on this story:
