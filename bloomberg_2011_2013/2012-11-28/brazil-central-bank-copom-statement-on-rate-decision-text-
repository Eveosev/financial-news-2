(Corrects to say voting for decision in fourth paragraph of
story published Nov. 28.)  Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom decided unanimously to keep the Selic rate at
7.25 percent p.a., without a bias.  Considering the balance of risks for inflation, the
recovery of domestic activity and the complexity surrounding the
global environment, the committee understands that the stability
of monetary conditions for a sufficiently prolonged period of
time is the most adequate strategy to guarantee the convergence
of inflation to target, even if not in a linear fashion.  Voting for this decision were the following board members:
President Alexandre Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Luiz Edson Feltrim and
Sidnei Correa Marques.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
