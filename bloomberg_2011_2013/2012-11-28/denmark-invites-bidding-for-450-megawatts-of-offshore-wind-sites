Denmark will invite bidding to build
450 megawatts of offshore wind parks at six sites as the country
seeks to replace coal-fired plants with renewables.  The offshore turbines will generate enough power for half a
million homes when operational by 2020, the Danish Ministry of
Climate, Energy and Building said today in a statement.  Offshore wind is a key part of an agreement the government
and opposition parties signed March 22 to replace half of the
nationâ€™s coal use with renewable sources over the next eight
years. They also agreed to increase the share of wind power to
50 percent of total generation from 28.2 percent last year.  Citizens will be able to buy stakes of as much as 20
percent in the projects and local companies will also be
encouraged to buy shares, according to the statement.  Sites at Bornholm, Smaalandsfarvandet, Sejeroe Bugt, Saeby,
Vesterhav Syd and Vesterhav Nord have been selected. Turbines
will be installed at least 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from land.  An extra 50 megawatts of wind power will be allocated for
testing new offshore turbines, with producers receiving 0.70
kroner (12 U.S. cents) a kilowatt-hour. That allocation will be
separate from the broader bidding, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
