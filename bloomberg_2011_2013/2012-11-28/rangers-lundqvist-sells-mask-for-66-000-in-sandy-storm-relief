A facemask worn by  New York  Rangers goaltender  Henrik Lundqvist  sold for a record $66,000 at auction, with proceeds going to  Hurricane Sandy  relief efforts.  The mask received 25 bids during the 20-day auction, which concluded Nov. 25 at  SteinerSports.com . The winning bid, from Rangers fan Molly Heines of New York, surpassed the previous record of $24,655 in June 2011 for a mask worn by ex-Los Angeles Kings goaltender Rogie Vachon, who retired in 1982.  “To be able to donate this amount to people that really need it right now is great,” Lundqvist said in a statement. “This money will hopefully be able to make a real difference for some families who were directly affected by this storm.”  Sandy, the largest Atlantic storm on record, struck Oct. 29, flooding  New York City ’s subway system and leaving more than 2 million residents in the state without power. New York and  New Jersey , which experienced massive flooding and outages, will cooperate in requesting a combined $78 billion in federal aid for recovery efforts.  Other notable National Hockey League goalie masks that have been auctioned include one from Gerry Cheever for $21,405 in March 2006 and one from Bernie Parent for $21,000 in April 2004, according to  GameUsedMasks.com .
