Italy  sold 7.5 billion euros ($9.7
billion) of six-month Treasury bills, the maximum set for the
auction, at the lowest yield on a similar note in more than two
and a half years.  The Treasury in Rome today sold the 182-day bills at 0.919
percent, the lowest since April 2010 and down from 1.347 percent
at the last auction on Oct. 29. Investors bid for 1.65 times the
amount of bills offered, up from 1.52 times last month. Italy
returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of as much as 6
billion euros of five and 10-year bonds.  “From a pricing perspective, Italy has overcome the euro-
zone crisis,” said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in  London . “Italy is by no means out of the
woods and has become a tale of two halves: an increasingly
resilient and externally driven bond market and an economy in
deep recession amid mounting political uncertainty.”  Italy’s 10-year  yield  declined 6 basis points to 4.67
percent at 12:07 p.m. in Rome, the lowest since June 2011. That
left the difference with comparable-maturity German debt at 328
basis points.  Falling Yields  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros of zero-coupon bonds yesterday
at the lowest yield on a similar bond since October 2010.  The country’s bond yields have fallen since European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said in July that the
Frankfurt-based institute would do what’s needed to keep the
euro and announce in September a bond-buying program for nations
in financing stress.  Italy needs to uphold Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s pledge
to shore up public finances in order to enjoy investor
confidence even after elections due by April, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest
Economic Outlook report this week.  The Paris-based OECD also said that Monti’s efforts to
reduce the deficit won’t allow Italy to start trimming the euro
region’s second-biggest debt next year and that “further fiscal
tightening in 2014 would be necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
