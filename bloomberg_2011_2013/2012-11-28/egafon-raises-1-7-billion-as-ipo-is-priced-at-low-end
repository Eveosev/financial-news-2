OAO MegaFon (MFON) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, fell in its first day of trading after
raising $1.7 billion, signaling investor skepticism toward
emerging-market wireless assets amid a slowing economy.  The stock  fell  as much as 2.8 percent and closed down 2
percent at $19.60 in London. MegaFon sold stock at $20 each, at
the bottom of its estimated range of $20 to $25 in the biggest
initial offering by a Russian company in three years.  MegaFon competes with Russia’s largest mobile operator, OAO
Mobile TeleSystems, and smaller rival VimpelCom for subscribers
in a market where most people already have wireless handsets.
IPOs of companies in Europe this year have seen average returns
of 8.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  MegaFon had postponed an IPO marketing campaign in October,
raising investor speculation the demand may have trailed
expectations amid  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis. The same
month, lender OAO Promsvyazbank called off its IPO on the last
day of the sale, saying offers it was getting for shares to be
listed in London didn’t reflect “fair value” for the bank.  “MegaFon’s price decline today shows that the demand level
wasn’t strong enough,” said Alexander Golovtsov, who helps
manage $2.8 billion at Moscow-based UralSib Asset Management.  Price Decline  Global stocks declined for a third day on concern budget
talks to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff have made little progress,
with the  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  losing 0.4 percent.  “MegaFon is declining today with the rest of Russian
stocks as global investors are concerned with the fiscal crisis
in the U.S. and reduce their exposure to  emerging markets ,”
 Luis Saenz , head of equity trading at BCS Financial Group, said
by phone from London. “MegaFon is a great company, while the
history of Russian IPOs shows it’s often cheaper to pick shares
from the secondary market after the offering.”  MegaFon’s shares could rebound in the next week on the
prospect of its inclusion in the  MSCI Russia Index (MXRU)  because of
the company’s size and liquidity in the stock, Saenz said.  Excluding MegaFon, IPOs in Europe, the  Middle East  and
 Africa  this year raised $10.6 billion, less than a third of what
companies did in the same period in 2011, Bloomberg data show.  Network Expansion  The IPO is part of a shareholder agreement reached in
April with  Alisher Usmanov , the Russian billionaire who controls
MegaFon, to resolve disputes between Stockholm-based investor
 TeliaSonera (TLSN)  AB and the venture’s local owners. Usmanov will keep
a stake of about 55.8 percent and TeliaSonera will retain a 29
percent holding, Moscow-based MegaFon said in a statement today.  MegaFon and TeliaSonera sold a combined stake of about 15
percent in the IPO, which is the biggest by a Russia company
since  United Co. Rusal (486) ’s sale almost three years ago. MegaFon
will use its proceeds to repay or refinance debt and to expand
its network.  MegaFon said the IPO gave it a value of about $11.1
billion. That valuation excludes the shares it holds in its
treasury. The size of the IPO offering excludes the so-called
overallotment option to cover extra demand, MegaFon said.  The sale comes on the heels of an offering by another phone
carrier, Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG, which raised 1.5
billion euros ($1.94 billion) in Europe’s largest IPO this year.  “Selling shares at the bottom of the range still could be
considered a success because the company was late coming to the
market and the market conditions weren’t favorable for any IPO
of this size,” said Evgeny Golosnoy, an analyst at IFC Metropol
in Moscow. “The  price range  was quite high, and even its low
end implied almost no discount to established peers.”  Russia Competition  Russian mobile market will grow about 5 percent this year
to $27.6 billion and is set to expand at the same pace through
2015, said Anton Pogrebinsky, an analyst at research firm AC&M
Consulting in Moscow. The share of non-voice services, including
data transmission, is set to increase from 20 percent this year
to 30 percent in 2015, he said.  “While MegaFon may grow faster than the market, the sector
has matured and the peak of its rapid growth is in the past,”
Pogrebinsky said.  Russia’s mobile penetration was 161 percent at the end of
September, according to AC&M, meaning there are more mobile-
phone connections than people. MegaFon had 62.8 million users in
Russia at the end of the third quarter compared with MTS’s 70.7
million subscribers and 56.2 million customers using VimpelCom
in Russia, according to AC&M.  TeliaSonera, Sweden’s largest phone company, helped set up
MegaFon in 2002 when the Nordic company was created in a merger
with Finland’s biggest fixed-line operator and they combined
their Russian assets. Governance and strategy disputes with
Russian partners later plagued the venture.  As part of a shareholder settlement in April, when
billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s Altimo cashed out of the operator
and Usmanov boosted his ownership, MegaFon agreed to pay the
higher of 50 percent of net income or 70 percent of cash flows
in dividends.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and OAO Sberbank managed MegaFon’s share
sale, with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
VTB Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
