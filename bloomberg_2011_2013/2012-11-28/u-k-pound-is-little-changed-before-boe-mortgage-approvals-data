U.K. government bonds rose, with 10-
year yields falling the most in two months, after Bank of
England Deputy Governor  Charles Bean  said the central bank
hasn’t ruled out further asset purchases to boost the economy.  Gilts advanced along with Treasuries and German bunds amid
speculation U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach agreement on
avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts
and tax increases, boosting demand for the safest assets. The
pound weakened against most of its major counterparts.  Bean’s comments are “supportive for the gilt market,”
said Craig Veysey, head of fixed income at Sanlam Private
Investments Ltd. in  London , a unit of Sanlam Group, which
oversees $72 billion. “We don’t think just because the Monetary
Policy Committee decided not to push ahead with more
quantitative easing at their last opportunity, they’re not going
to do some more in future.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time after
falling as much as 10 basis points, the  most  since Sept. 26. The
rate declined to 1.75 percent, the  lowest  since Nov. 19. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 climbed 0.725, or 7.25
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,600) face amount, to 99.81.  U.K. bonds “can be relatively well-supported into year-
end,” Veysey said in an interview with Linzie Janis on
Bloomberg TV’s “Countdown.”  ‘Even More’  Bank of England  policy makers voted 8-1 at their November
meeting to refrain from expanding the 375 billion-pound asset-
purchase program to cap borrowing costs and spur growth.  “We haven’t closed the door forever on further asset
purchases and it would be incorrect to say that we’ve decided
they’re ineffective at the current juncture,” Bean said in an
interview with  Bloomberg News  published today. “The bang for
buck might be a bit less now than it was in 2009. That doesn’t
mean to say that you don’t want to do any more of it, it just
means that to get the same effect, actually you have to do even
more than before.”  U.K.  gross domestic product  rose 1 percent in the three
months through September, matching an earlier estimate, a
government report showed yesterday.  U.S. lawmakers are trying to reach agreement to avert $607
billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts from taking
effect at the beginning of 2013. U.S. Senate Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  said yesterday he was “disappointed” in the lack of
progress in the discussions.  Gilts’ Return  Gilts returned 2.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.4 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 2.6 percent.  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5996 after rising to
$1.6056 yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 2. Sterling was
little changed at 80.78 pence per euro.  Economists say a Bank of England report tomorrow will show
 mortgage approvals  increased for a fourth month in October.
Lenders granted 51,500 mortgages last month, up from 50,024 in
September, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Sterling has gained 1.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 2.4 percent and
the dollar fell 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
