Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, named Howard V. “Rick” Richardson to its board of
directors, bringing the total to 16.  Richardson is a retired partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in a statement.
Richardson, who worked at the accounting firm for more than
three decades, will join the board’s audit and examination
committee, Wells Fargo said. He starts on Jan. 1.  “Richardson has extensive financial, accounting, bank
regulatory, and risk-management expertise, as well as valuable
experience assisting financial services companies navigate
complex operating environments,” Stephen W. Sanger, the board’s
lead director, said in the statement.  Richardson is the  third director  named in the last 18
months, joining two former U.S. Cabinet secretaries. Federico Pena, who led the transportation and energy departments for
President Bill Clinton, was added to the Wells Fargo board last
November and Elaine Chao, George W. Bush’s labor secretary,
joined in July 2011. Wells Fargo is run by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Stumpf, 59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
