German inflation slowed in November
as energy prices retreated and the sovereign debt crisis curbed
economic growth.  The inflation rate in  Europe ’s largest economy, calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, declined to 2 percent
from 2.1 percent in October, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. That’s in line with the median forecast of
23 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey . In the month, prices
fell 0.1 percent.  Oil prices  have dropped about 11 percent this year as a
cooling global economy damps demand. Europe’s debt crisis is
also hampering German economic growth, leaving companies with
less room to raise prices. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development yesterday cut its forecasts for
German expansion to 0.9 percent this year and 0.6 percent in
2013.  “Inflation remains very tame in  Germany , although the
country remained relatively resilient to the ongoing slowdown,”
said Annalisa Piazza, an economist at Newedge Strategy in
London. “Inflation is certainly not a major worry for policy
makers at the current juncture.”  The  European Central Bank  aims to keep inflation in the 17-
nation euro region just below 2 percent. The euro-area rate will
decline to 2.4 percent this month from 2.5 percent in October,
according to another survey of economists. That report is due on
Nov. 30.  Non-harmonized German inflation slowed to 1.9 percent in
November from 2 percent in October, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
