Serbia  is considering Russia’s offer
to renew its  air force  with jets made by state-owned  United
Aircraft Corp. JSC (UNAC) , Defense Minister Aleksandar Vucic said.  The offer came in response to Serbia’s request in 2010 and
the government is considering it now because “we are interested
in increasing our military power,” Vucic told reporters in
Belgrade today, after meeting with Russian Deputy Premier  Dmitry
Rogozin  and United Aircraft Chairman Mikhail Pogosyan. He didn’t
specify the type or the number of aircraft.  Vucic said the defense industry cooperation may also
include production of 57-millimeter and 155-millimeter caliber
ammunition, while Russian manufacturers may also provide chassis
and other parts for armored vehicles Serbia plans to produce for
its own army and for buyers in Bangladesh and Kenya.  “We both have the will and the money to invest in
Serbia,” said Rogozin, whose country backs Serbia in not
recognizing its breakaway province of Kosovo as an independent
state. “We support Serbia not only because we are friends but
because we insist on the principle of territorial integrity.”  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet of Socialists, former
nationalists and technocrats, in office since July, has
increasingly turned to Russia for economic ties and financial
assistance, as the country’s plans to join the European Union
depend on improved ties with Kosovo, which unilaterally declared
independence in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
