Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said U.S. businesses
haven’t been hurt by taxes and have benefited from declining
rates in the past few decades.  “Corporate taxes have not been a problem for corporate
America,” Buffett, 82, said today in an interview on CNBC.
“The biggest beneficiary of reductions in tax rates in the last
30 or 40 years has been corporations, and the biggest increase
has been in the payroll tax.”  Buffett, the world’s fourth-richest man, is pressing for
higher taxes on the wealthy as U.S. lawmakers consider ways to
avoid the fiscal cliff, which would impose more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts starting in January.
President  Barack Obama  has proposed lowering tax rates for some
businesses while reducing tax deductions.  “We’re raising dramatic amounts from the middle class,”
Buffett said, citing the payroll tax. “It’s the most regressive
tax.”  A reduction in the payroll tax to 4.2 percent from 6.2
percent percent is scheduled to expire at the end of the year.
The tax is capped, so high earners only pay it on a portion of
their wages.  “I’m paying practically no payroll tax,” Buffett said.
“I pay it on my salary of $100,000.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
