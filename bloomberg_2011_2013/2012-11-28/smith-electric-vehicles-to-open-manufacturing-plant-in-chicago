Smith Electric Vehicles Corp., a
maker of battery-powered commercial trucks, will build a factory
in Chicago.  The company’s decision was influenced by the city’s $15
million voucher program to encourage companies to switch their
fleets from diesel to all-electric vehicles, according to a
 statement  today from the office of Chicago’s Mayor  Rahm Emanuel .
Chicago will be Smith’s third U.S. location.  Smith expects to announce the location of the plant “when
the incentive and development packages tied to the site are
complete,” the Kansas City, Missouri-based company said in the
statement. A message left for Katie Morgan, a spokeswoman at
Pinkston Group representing Smith, wasn’t immediately returned.  Smith says its vehicles have lower operating costs than
diesel-powered trucks. Its customers include Coca-Cola Co.,
 PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
