Gerard Lyons  resigned as chief
economist at  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  to take on a new role
outside the finance industry.  “After 13 years I have decided to move on,” London-based
Lyons said in a telephone interview today. “I’ve been delighted
to contribute to the bank’s success, build a strong research
team and to have had a long track record of forecasting
success.”  He declined to say what his new position would be, saying
he will announce it next month.  At  Standard Chartered , Lyons, 51, oversaw a team that was
ranked as the top global forecaster in 2011 and 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lyons also devised the ‘‘super-cycle” to describe how the
world economy may be entering a period of long-term growth that
lifts all economies. Such a phenomenon would be only the third
since the Industrial Revolution and would drive bond yields and
commodity prices higher, he said in reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
