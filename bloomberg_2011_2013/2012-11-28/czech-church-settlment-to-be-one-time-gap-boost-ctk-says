The Czech Republic’s settlement with
churches for property confiscated by the Communist regime will
be a one-time increase in the 2012 fiscal deficit, the  CTK 
newswire reported, citing Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  The parliament approved this month a bill under which
churches will get back property valued at about 75 billion
koruna ($3.8 billion) and receive payments totaling 59 billion
koruna spread over 30 years, CTK said. The bill helps settle
claims for property confiscated by the state during the
Communist regime from 1948 to 1989.  European Union methodology requires that the entire cash
part of the settlement be included in this year’s budget balance
even though payments will be made in the future, according to
Kalousek. As a result, this year’s deficit will be about 5
percent of economic output, he said, compared with the
ministry’s previous estimate of 3.2 percent gap.  The rating agencies aren’t considering this budget
accounting operation as a deviation from the government’s fiscal
strategy, the newswire quoted the minister as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
