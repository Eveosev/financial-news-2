Apple Inc. (AAPL)  won a Dutch sales ban on
some of  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s older Galaxy tablets and
smartphones after a Netherlands court ruled in a patent lawsuit.  Samsung’s Galaxy products using certain versions of  Google
Inc (GOOG) ’s Android operating system infringe an Apple patent
describing a way to navigate images in a photo gallery, Judge
Peter Blok said today.  Samsung last year tweaked a feature on the smartphones to
bypass a Dutch injunction. Today’s ban concerns products that
are still on the market with the old patent-infringing feature.  The two companies continue to clash over the intellectual
property behind the $219 billion smartphone market, even after
Apple settled all its lawsuits with  HTC Corp. (2498)  earlier this
month. Samsung is trying to hit back after a California court
ruled in August it had to pay $1.05 billion for copying Apple
products.  Samsung must pay Apple a penalty of 100,000 euros
($129,000) every day it violates the ruling, the Dutch court
said. Samsung also has to tell Apple how much profit it made
from sales of infringing Galaxy products since June 2011. A
separate court procedure will determine how much of that profit
Samsung must pay Apple.  The ruling is the latest in a long line of disputes in
courts across the globe as the rivals fight for dominance in the
smart phone and tablet-computer markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
