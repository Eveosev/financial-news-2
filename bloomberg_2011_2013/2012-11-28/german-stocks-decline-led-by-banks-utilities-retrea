German stocks  advanced for a second
day, extending a three-week high, as U.S. Speaker of the House
John Boehner said he is “optimistic” budget talks with
President Barack Obama will continue.  Bayer AG (BAYN) , the maker of drugs and chemicals, gained 1
percent. Continental AG added 1.4 percent.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  slid
2.5 percent after a report that it may get as little as 1
billion euros ($1.29 billion) from the sale of its Steel
Americas unit.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.2 percent to 7,343.41 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt, erasing an earlier decline. The equity
benchmark has  rallied 23 percent  from this year’s low on June 5
as the  European Central Bank  approved an unlimited bond-buying
program and euro-region finance ministers eased the terms of aid
for Greece. The broader HDAX Index gained 0.1 percent today.  “Now that the Greek headlines are moving to the back
burner, the U.S. fiscal-cliff debate is taking center stage,”
Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and  fund manager 
at Clairinvest in Geneva, wrote in an e-mail. “Markets will
remain hostage to a decision, with volatility rising for the
next few weeks.”  The DAX earlier fell as much as 0.9 percent as Erskine
Bowles, the co-chairman of Obama’s 2010 fiscal commission, said
it’s unlikely the president and Congress will reach a deal by
the end of this year.  Little Progress  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said Democrats and
Republicans have made little progress in negotiations over how
to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of the year.  Reid, speaking to reporters in Washington late yesterday,
said that Republicans backed away from their earlier openness to
considering new  tax revenue  as part of a deal to prevent $607
billion of budget changes. The  Congressional Budget Office  has
said a failure to avoid the fiscal cliff could lead to a
recession and a jobless rate of about 9 percent, compared with
the October rate of 7.9 percent.  A report today showed sales of new U.S. houses unexpectedly
declined in October. Sales dropped 0.3 percent to a 368,000
annual pace following a revised 369,000 rate in September. The
median estimate of 74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 390,000 sales pace.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX companies was 20
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bayer increased 1 percent to 70.05 euros, the highest level
in six weeks.  Continental, Europe’s second-largest auto-parts maker,
added 1.4 percent to 82.47 euros, a two-month high.  ThyssenKrupp Slips  ThyssenKrupp dropped 2.5 percent to 15.62 euros. Germany’s
largest steelmaker may get 2 billion euros to 4 billion euros
for its Americas unit, and in the worst-case scenario, only 1
billion euros, Sueddeutsche said.  Celesio AG (CLS1)  slumped 2.6 percent to 12.94 euros after Franz
Haniel & Cie. GmbH sold 100 million euros of stock in the drug
wholesaler. The closely held German investment company sold
about 7.9 million shares at 12.60 euros apiece.  Metro AG (MEO)  dropped 3.7 percent to 21.32 euros as Haniel said
it will reduce its stake in Germany’s largest retailer to 30
percent from 34.2 percent within 18 months. Haniel also plans to
raise about 150 million euros by selling non-strategic assets to
help reduce net borrowing below 2 billion euros.  Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  fell 1.9 percent to 32.28 euros. Stephan
Leithner, Deutsche Bank’s head of compliance, said the lender
has set aside reserves for possible financial damages over
banks’ alleged manipulation of London Interbank Offered Rate.  Separately, Deutsche Bank was sued by a trustee over claims
that some securities sold by a unit of the bank were backed by
home-mortgage loans taken out by fraudulent borrowers.  DB Structured Products Inc.’s pool of more than 1,500
mortgages included more than 320 that were defective,  HSBC Bank
USA , acting as trustee, said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-biggest lender, lost 1.3
percent to 1.35 euros. A gauge of banking shares was the biggest
drag on the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
