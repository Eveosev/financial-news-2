Kevin Pietersen, who was left out of
 England ’s cricket squad after sending “provocative texts” to
opposing teams, was returned to the one-day international team
for the five-match series against  India .  Pietersen was dropped by England for texting South African
players during England’s loss, but returned to the Test side for
its current India tour. He won’t take part in the Twenty20
matches, the England and Wales Cricket Board said in an e-mailed
statement.  “We are constantly looking to manage the workload of
players as effectively as possible and this winter is no
different,” national selector Geoff Miller said in the
statement. “There are number of players who are being rested
for parts of the winter program. This will enable them to take
part in fitness and conditioning programs in preparation for a
busy 2013.”  The ODI series starts Jan. 11 in Rajkot. The two-match
Twenty20 series is Dec. 20 and 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
