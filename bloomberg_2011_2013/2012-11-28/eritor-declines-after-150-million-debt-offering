Meritor Inc. (MTOR) , a maker of axles and
brakes for trucks and buses, fell the most in seven weeks after
the company proposed a $150 million convertible debt offering,
raising investor concerns that the shares would be diluted.  Meritor dropped 7.6 percent to $3.89 at 11:51 a.m. in New
York after reaching $3.83, for the  biggest intraday decline
since  Oct. 10. The shares had dropped 21 percent this year
through yesterday.  Meritor said in a statement today it plans to offer notes
due 2026 convertible into stock and may grant purchasers $22.5
million more of debt. The Troy, Michigan-based company had 96.5
million shares outstanding as of Nov. 7.  “I would guess it is dilution from the convertible
offering,”  David Leiker , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in
 Milwaukee , said in an e-mail of today’s decline in Meritor
shares.  Convertible debt under certain conditions can be converted
by the holder into the company’s stock, increasing the number of
shares outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
