Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
insurer that last month agreed to buy a Chilean pension
provider, fell the most in the  KBW Insurance Index (KIX)  after giving
a 2013 outlook that fell short of some estimates.  Principal dropped 3.9 percent to $26.26 at 10:16 a.m. in
New York, the most on the 24-company index. The stock has
advanced 6.8 percent this year.  The insurer’s forecast was “sobering and disappointing,”
John Nadel, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., wrote in a
research note today.  Principal said earnings may be $881 million to $944 million
next year, compared with Nadel’s  estimate  of $1 billion in
operating income, as low interest rates weigh on results. The
 Des Moines , Iowa-based insurer is counting on growth in emerging
markets after last month reaching a $1.5 billion deal to buy
Chile’s  AFP Cuprum (CUPRUM)  SA.  “It was, indeed, disappointing that Principal acknowledged
that its earnings may be flat next year,” Eric Berg, an analyst
at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note. “It wasn’t
exactly what we wanted to hear.”  Berg maintained an outperform rating, citing the company’s
five-year outlook for “rapid growth.” He reduced his price
target to $37 from $39.  Principal said it will probably spend $400 million to $600
million on  buybacks , dividends and acquisitions in 2013, after
committing to $2.1 billion in outlays this year. The insurer
authorized $300 million of repurchases in 2012 and boosted its
quarterly  dividend  to 21 cents a share from 18 cents in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
