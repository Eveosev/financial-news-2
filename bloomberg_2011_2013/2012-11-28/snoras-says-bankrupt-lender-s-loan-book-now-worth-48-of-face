Bankas Snoras AB, the Lithuanian
lender declared bankrupt a year ago, said its administrator
values outstanding loans at 48 percent of their face amount.  The bank’s gross loan book value was 3.4 billion litai
($1.3 billion) on Nov. 1, including more than 1 billion litai
lent to related parties, the insolvent Vilnius-based bank  said
on its websit e today. The estimated net value of the loan
portfolio after impairment was 1.6 billion litai, it said.  Courts had approved 6.2 billion litai of creditor claims
against Snoras as of June 26, bankruptcy administrator Neil
Cooper said in a  report  this month. Once Lithuania’s third-
biggest lender by deposits, Snoras is suing its former owners
Vladimir Antonov and Raimondas Baranauskas in  London  for 492
million euros ($634 million) on claims they forged documents and
fixed accounts to siphon money out of the bank. Both men deny
the claims and are fighting them.  As of Oct. 31, Snoras had recovered 1.3 billion litai of
cash for creditors by collecting loan payments and selling
assets, the bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
