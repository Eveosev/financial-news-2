Treasuries advanced after the U.S.
sale of five-year notes drew the highest demand in eight years
from direct bidders amid concern Congress faces headwinds in
resolving the fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their orders with the Treasury, purchased 15.9 percent of the
notes, the most since September 2004. The Federal Reserve said
seven of 12 districts reported concern about the outlook for
2013, in part, due to the uncertainty regarding a possible
political stalemate on the deficit that could lead to automatic
spending cuts and tax increases at the start of the new year.  “The fiscal cliff is helping to develop that safe-haven
bid for Treasuries,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income
trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “There’s still the uncertainty around
that and that’s underlying.”  The yield on the benchmark  10-year note  fell one basis
points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 4:59 p.m.
in New York after touching the least since Nov. 20, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in
November 2022 gained 2/32, or $0.63 per $1,000 face amount, to
99 31/32.  The  yield  on the current five-year note fell one basis
point to 0.63 percent. Thirty-year bond yields rose one basis
point to 2.80 percent after falling as much as four basis
points.  Ten-year  yields  dropped earlier today as Erskine Bowles,
co-chairman of President Barack Obama’s 2010 fiscal commission,
estimated there is a one-third probability of a budget deal by
the end of this year.  Investor Demand  The five-year notes sold today drew a yield of 0.641
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.649 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers,
which are required to bid at U.S. debt auctions.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 45.4 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 41.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders have purchased an average of 10.8 percent at
the past 10 auctions.  Five-year notes have returned 2.3 percent this year
compared with the 2.5 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-
year securities rose 9.2 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall advanced 9.8 percent.  Today’s offering was the second of three this week totaling
$99 billion. The government will sell $29 billion in seven-year
securities tomorrow. Yesterday’s auction of $35 billion in two-
year notes yielded 0.295 percent produced 4.07 times the amount
of bids than debt sold, matching a record for U.S. coupon
securities.  Yield Curve  The difference between the yields on two and 10-year notes,
the so-called yield curve, narrowed to 1.34 percentage points,
the lowest in almost two weeks.  A yield curve plots the rates of bonds of the same quality,
but different maturities. It steepens when yields on shorter-
maturity notes fall, those on longer-dated bonds rise, or both
happen simultaneously. The gap typically narrows when investors
anticipate a slower recovery as they demand less compensation in
anticipation of limited inflation.  President  Barack Obama  said at the White House that “My
hope is to get this done before Christmas.” U.S. House Speaker
John Boehner earlier said he was “optimistic” budget talks
with Obama would continue.  Price Swings  Volatility in Treasuries dropped yesterday to the least in
five years. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which
measures price swings based on options, declined to 51.7, the
lowest level since May 2007. It hit a 2012 high of 95.4 basis
points. Volatility climbed to 264.6 basis points in October 2008
as the financial crisis intensified.  “The Fed buying in the market has been a lot of the reason
why volatility has decreased,” said Thomas Roth, senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “They have obviously pushed rates to levels that obviously
are artificial. There’s no new news out of  Europe  and there has
been a couple of headlines on the fiscal cliff. It all adds up
to taking people out of the market and they are sitting on the
sidelines for now.”  The Fed bought $1.85 billion of Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to November 2042 today, according to the Fed Bank
of New York’s  website . It also purchased $4.6 billion of
securities due from November 2018 to November 2020, the website
shows.  Quantitative Easing  The next release of the tentative outright Treasury
operation schedule will be at 2 p.m. on Nov. 30. The Fed is also
selling shorter-term Treasuries from its holdings and buying
those due in six to 30 years, under a program scheduled to end
next month.  The central bank is seeking to put downward pressure on
yields, after buying $2.3 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-
related bonds since 2008 in two rounds of quantitative easing,
or QE. It said Oct. 24 it would extend its stimulus by
purchasing $40 billion of home-loan securities a month until the
labor market improves “substantially.”  The U.S. economy expanded at a “measured pace” in recent
weeks as gains in consumer demand and housing were tempered by a
slowdown in manufacturing and the impact of  hurricane Sandy , the
Fed said today in its Beige Book survey, which is based on
reports from the Fed’s 12 district banks.  The Fed said seven of 12 districts reported “either
slowing or outright contraction in manufacturing” as some
contacts “expressed concern about the outlook for 2013, in
part, due to the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the fiscal
cliff.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
