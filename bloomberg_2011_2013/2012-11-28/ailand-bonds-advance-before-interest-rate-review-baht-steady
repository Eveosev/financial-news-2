Thailand ’s 10-year government bonds
advanced, pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost three
weeks, after foreign funds boosted holdings of the nation’s debt
before the central bank reviews interest rates today.  Overseas investors  bought  $318 million more sovereign notes
than they sold yesterday, the most since Oct. 30, according to
Thai Bond Market Association figures. They pulled $38 million
from local shares, exchange data show. The central bank will
leave borrowing costs unchanged after cutting last month,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Imports climbed 22 percent in
October, the biggest increase in seven months, an official
report showed this week.  “Investors want to put money in to countries where
domestic demand is strong,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher
at the Japan Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “They still
prefer bonds to stocks as external demand is still fragile.”  The yield on the 3.65 percent bonds due December 2021 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.37 percent as of
8:42 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest level since Nov. 8.  The Bank of Thailand will keep its benchmark  interest rate 
at 2.75 percent today after lowering it by a quarter of a
percentage point in October, according to 16 of 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Three predict a 25-basis-point reduction.
The decision is due at 2:30 p.m. in Bangkok.  The baht traded at 30.70 per dollar, compared with 30.69
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, was unchanged at 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
