Armenia vaccinated thousands of
cattle, sheep and  goats  against anthrax after an outbreak of the
disease in Gegharkunik province in the country’s east, an alert
to the World Organization for  Animal Health  showed.  The disease killed six cattle in the region, the first
outbreak since July 2007, Armenia’s Ministry of Agriculture
wrote in the  notification  sent to the Paris-based OIE and
published on the group’s website today.  Anthrax was found on a farm on Oct. 26 and a second farm in
the same region two days later, according to the notification.
The ministry said 2,626 cattle, 3,496 sheep and goats, 17 horses
and 176 pigs were re-vaccinated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
