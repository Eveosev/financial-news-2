Gold futures fell the most in three
weeks as pessimism on a U.S. budget resolution eroded demand for
commodities.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for February
delivery tumbled 1.5 percent to settle at $1,718.80 an ounce at
1:38 p.m., the biggest drop for a most-active contract since
Nov. 2. In the first 30 seconds of floor trading, 7,700
contracts traded, according to PVM Futures Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
fell as much as 1.4 percent, erasing this year’s gain. Erskine Bowles, the co-chairman of President  Barack Obama ’s 2010 fiscal
commission, said that a deal with Congress to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff is unlikely by the end of this year.  “There’s ‘risk-off’ trading, and behind that is talk of
the fiscal cliff becoming more of a reality than people had
thought,” Harry Denny, a broker at Hoboken, New Jersey-based
PVM, said in a telephone interview. “The fiscal-cliff
resolution has everyone a little cautious.”  An estimated 437,259 futures contracts traded as of 2:26
p.m. Total volume rose to a record 484,721 on May 29. Through
yesterday, the daily average was 176,000 this year. Floor
trading starts at 8:20 a.m.  The most-traded gold options yesterday were bets on further
price drops. Exchange data show 9,573 put options traded, giving
owners the right to sell at $1,700 on the Comex by January. That
compares with 461 contracts a day earlier. Each contract is for
100 ounces. The next-most-traded contracts were January puts
giving owners the right to sell at $1,690 and at $1,695.  Put Options  The increase in put-options trading contributed to today’s
slump,  Dave Lutz , the head of exchange-traded fund trading and
strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a
telephone interview.  The decline in futures was also fueled by algorithmic-
trading programs, said Carlos Perez-Santalla, a broker at PVM.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  climbed
5.1 metric tons to a record 2,612.1 tons yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. This month, the  U.S. Mint  has sold
75,500 ounces of American Eagle gold  coins , the most since
January, data on its website show.  Gold has advanced 9.7 percent this year, heading for the
12th straight annual gain. The price reached a record $1,923.70
on Sept. 6, 2011, as global  interest rates  remained low,
enhancing the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment.
Debt woes in the U.S. and  Europe  also triggered demand for a
haven from slumping currencies.  ‘Counter-Intuitive’  The decline in futures “is counter-intuitive with
everything else that is going on in the economy,”  Ross Norman ,
the chief executive officer of Sharps Pixley Ltd., a brokerage
in  London , said in a note.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$33.77 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest decline since Nov. 16.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 0.4 percent to settle at $1,611.70 an
ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$675.20 an ounce. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 3.5
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
