Russia will consider taxing
individuals who earn more than 1 million rubles ($32,200) a year
from financial holdings to narrow  income inequality , Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov said.  “We could collect tax on additional income from wealthy
citizens who have larger bank deposits and more investment
income using such a mechanism,” Siluanov told reporters today
in Moscow. The ministry is drafting proposals, he said.  Russian politicians have discussed raising levies on the
rich in a country where 12.5 percent of the population earn
incomes below the subsistence level.  Vladimir Putin , campaigning
for the presidential election last year, proposed a luxury tax
in a speech at a congress of the ruling United Russia party,
calling it a duty on “vanity” purchases made at the expense of
investment.  Small-time investors should be exempt from taxes on bank
deposits, dividends and  capital gains  up to a certain level to
help create a domestic base of long-term money, Siluanov said at
a conference organized by the Vedomosti newspaper in Moscow.  The level at which people are considered “large
investors” remains to be decided, Siluanov said. The ministry
is preparing proposals on taxing income from securities at the
same level as bank deposits, he said. Bank deposits are now
taxed only if the  interest rate  is higher than the central
bank’s refinancing rate plus 5 percentage points, according to
the minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
