The  New York  Giants added running
backs Ryan Torain and Kregg Lumpkin a day after Andre Brown was
placed on injured reserve with a broken leg.  The Giants were left with Ahmad Bradshaw and rookie David
Wilson as their only running backs after Brown fractured his
left fibula during the Giants’ 38-10 victory against the Green
Bay Packers on Nov. 25.  With one roster spot opened by Brown’s injury, the Giants
made further room by waiving offensive lineman Selvish Capers,
the team said yesterday.  Torain, 26, played one National Football League season with
Denver after being drafted by the Broncos in 2008 and had two
more with the Washington Redskins. In his rookie year, he broke
his elbow in August and tore his anterior cruciate ligament four
days after his first professional start on Nov. 2.  Torain didn’t play in 2009 and signed with  Washington  on
Sept. 4, 2010. He was waived by the Redskins on Dec. 27 after
playing in eight games with four starts, rushing for 200 yards
and a touchdown and catching six passes for 23 yards.  He has career totals of 1,011 yards and six touchdowns on
238 carries. He also has 24 receptions for 148 yards and two
scores.  Lumpkin, 28, was waived by the Green Bay Packers in 2010,
two years after he signed as a free agent. He moved to the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, where he played 11 games in 2010 and all 16
games the following year.  The Seattle Seahawks signed Lumpkin as a free agent on
March 13. In the preseason, he led the Seahawks with 40 rushing
attempts, producing 160 yards and a touchdown. His contract
ended Sept. 18.  Lumpkin’s career totals are 33 carries for 124 yards and 45
receptions for 325 yards with no touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
