Palm oil  declined on speculation
that record inventories in Malaysia may expand this month, while
a failure to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff in the U.S.
raised the risk of a global recession.  The contract for February delivery lost as much as 1
percent to 2,386 ringgit ($781) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and traded at 2,390 ringgit at 3:36 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures are headed for a third monthly decline.  Inventories reached 2.51 million tons in October, according
to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Shipments fell 1.8 percent to
1.28 million tons in the first 25 days of November from a month
earlier, Intertek said on Nov. 26. Senate Majority Leader  Harry
Reid  said yesterday Democrats and Republicans have made little
headway in negotiations over how to avoid a year-end deadline
that would trigger automatic tax rises and spending cuts.  “Sentiment is weak,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd., referring to the fiscal-cliff concern and
its possible impact. Investors were also waiting for clear
signals on inventories and exports from Malaysia, she said.  Soybean oil for delivery in January lost 0.7 percent to
50.04 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
January delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $14.47 a bushel.  Palm oil for May delivery fell 1 percent to close at 6,740
yuan ($1,082) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for the same month was little changed at 8,576  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
