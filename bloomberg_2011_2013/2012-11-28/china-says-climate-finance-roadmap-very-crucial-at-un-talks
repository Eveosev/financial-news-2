China said it’s “very crucial” for
developed nations to provide a roadmap sketching out how they’ll
reach a target of providing $100 billion a year in aid for
climate projects, the nation’s envoy at UN talks said.  Su Wei , who represents China at United Nations climate
talks, said finance is “very important” to the success of the
meeting in Doha.  “It is an obligation for developed countries under the
convention to provide adequate resources in order that
developing countries” can adapt to  climate change , he said in
an interview in Doha today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
