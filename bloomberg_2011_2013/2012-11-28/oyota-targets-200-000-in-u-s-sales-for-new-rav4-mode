Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest
carmaker, forecast U.S. sales this year will surpass 2 million
vehicles for the first time since 2008, helped by deliveries of
the Camry sedan and Prius hybrid.  Combined sales of Toyota, Lexus and Scion brand vehicles
are poised to exceed the 1.9 million units the company had
initially targeted for 2012,  Bob Carter , Toyota’s U.S. senior
vice president, said in an interview yesterday at the Los
Angeles Auto Show. Deliveries of the Camry, the top-selling car
in the U.S. for 10 years in a row, could “kiss 400,000 this
year,” he said.  Toyota is increasing its reliance on the U.S., the
company’s biggest market, as sales shrink in Japan and in  China .
U.S. deliveries of Toyota, Lexus and Scion models have risen 30
percent this year through October, more than double the
industrywide 13.8 percent increase.  Toyota, which saw U.S. sales peak at 2.62 million vehicles
in 2007, rose 0.9 percent to 3,505 yen at 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo
trading. The shares have gained 37 percent this year, the most
among  Japan ’s biggest three biggest carmakers.  Total deliveries of 2 million units this year would be a 22
percent increase from 2011, while Camry sales of 400,000 units -
- last reached in 2008 -- would represent a 30 percent increase.  New RAV4  Separately, Toyota is targeting RAV4 deliveries to rise 18
percent to 200,000 units next year from about 170,000 in 2012,
Bill Fay, group vice president of U.S. sales, said yesterday at
the Los Angeles Auto Show. The new sport-utility vehicle, which
goes on sale in early January, is available only with a 2.5-
liter, 4-cylinder engine and won’t have an optional V-6 engine,
he said.  “Primary competitors are everybody in that small SUV
segment,” Honda’s CR-V, Ford’s Escape and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ’s
CX-5, Fay said. “I’m not so sure there’s going to be a V-6 left
in that segment,” as competitors move away from larger engines,
he also said.  Sales of the current RAV4 jumped 36 percent this year
through October as Toyota accelerated production at the
Woodstock, Ontario, plant after a slowdown last year related to
Japan’s earthquake and tsunami. Honda’s CR-V, revamped last
year, is the top-selling SUV in the U.S. with sales up 30
percent to 233,586 through October, followed by Escape at
219,907.  The new RAV4 delivers an estimated 24 miles (39 kilometers)
per gallon in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway, Fay said.
That’s up from 22 city/28 highway mpg for the current version
and compares with the CR-V’s 23 city/31 highway mpg, according
to the U.S.  Energy Department .  The new RAV4 “is a sleeker, modern vehicle that competes
much better with rivals in a small SUV segment whose market
share has nearly doubled in the last 10 years,” said Jessica Caldwell, industry analyst for Edmunds.com, an automotive
pricing and data website based in  Santa Monica ,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
