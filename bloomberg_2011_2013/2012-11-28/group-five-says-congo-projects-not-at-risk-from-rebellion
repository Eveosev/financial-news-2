Group Five Ltd. (GRF) , a South African
construction company, said a rebellion in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo would not jeopardize its building projects
in the mineral-rich African nation.  Renegade fighters captured the DRC border city of Goma on
Nov. 20 after ending an unofficial three-month ceasefire. The
group is made up of soldiers who mutinied in April and is headed
by General Bosco Ntaganda, who is wanted by the  International
Criminal Court  for  war crimes .  “We have operated in dangerous places before,” Group Five
Chief Executive Officer Mike Upton said at a media briefing in
Johannesburg today. “We have no issues from the DRC at the
moment.”  Group Five, based in Johannesburg, is building copper,
cobalt and gold mines near the DRC southern city of Lubumbashi
and in the northeast on behalf of mining companies, Upton said.
The company’s closest projects to Goma are 400 kilometers (248
miles) to 500 kilometers away.  The projects are not at risk from rebels, according to Guy
Mottram, the company’s risk officer. Group Five has refreshed
its emergency and evacuation plans in the Congo in the event the
situation worsens, Mottram said.  The DRC’s rebels, known as M23, said today they’re
preparing to withdraw from Goma as the U.S. pressed  Rwanda ’s
government to help end the crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
