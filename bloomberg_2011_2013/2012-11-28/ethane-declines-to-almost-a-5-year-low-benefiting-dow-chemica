Ethane, a component of natural gas,
fell to the lowest price since at least January 2008 at a Texas
distribution hub, benefiting companies such as  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) 
that use it to make ethylene and related plastics.  Ethane dropped 2.3 percent to  $26.125 cents  a gallon at
Mont Belvieu as of 11:35 a.m.  New York  time, according to
Liquidity Partners data. It has declined 68 percent this year.  Dow and other U.S. chemical producers have gained a
“massive competitive advantage” from cheap gas as hydraulic
fracturing boosts output from shale formations, George Biltz,
the company’s vice president of energy and climate change, said
today in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. Dow
is “happy” about the current ethane cost, he said, declining
to say whether the low price is sustainable.  Cheap gas has spurred more than $80 billion of announced
U.S. manufacturing investments, including $4 billion by Dow,
Biltz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
