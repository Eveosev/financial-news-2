Argentina ’s government this week
will send Congress a proposal to re-open the country’s debt
swap, newspaper Cronista Comercial reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino is planning to change the
so-called lock law and allow investors who didn’t participate in
a 2010 debt restructuring to obtain similar terms if they swap
defaulted bonds, Cronista said.  Argentina filed a motion asking for a stay on a Nov. 21
U.S. court ruling that said holders of defaulted debt claiming
$1.33 billion should be paid all of the principal and interest
they are owed.  A formula that offered holdouts the same terms as investors
who accepted the 2010 restructuring would be a “remedy” that’s
consistent with Argentine law and the government could present
that proposal to Congress, according to the court filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
