Contractors told  Southern Co. (SO)  that
two nuclear reactors it’s building near Augusta, Georgia, may
not come online until early-to-mid 2017 and 2018, about a year
later than planned.  Southern, based in Atlanta, hasn’t agreed to those later
start dates and maintains the reactors can begin producing power
by November 2016 and November 2017, Mark Williams, a spokesman
for Southern’s Georgia Power utility, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  “They are working on a schedule that is a little behind
the one we’re working on,” Williams said. “We’ve not agreed to
amend that and are still in discussions with them.”  The construction schedule for the $14-billion project isn’t
the only point of contention between  Georgia  Power and
Westinghouse Electric Co., maker of the reactors. The partners
sued each other Nov. 1 over at least $900 million in added costs
that resulted when federal regulators took six months longer
than anticipated to approve reactor design changes in 2011,
delaying construction.  Because of the dispute, Georgia Power, the state’s largest
utility, hasn’t yet formally asked regulators to increase costs
or approve a later commercial start of the first nuclear
reactors to be licensed in the U.S. since the Three Mile Island
accident in 1979.  The Georgia utility told state regulators in an Aug. 31
report that the design certification delay would probably push
the reactors seven months behind the original April 2016 and
April 2017 start dates.  The latest in-service dates proposed by Westinghouse and
 Shaw Group (SHAW) , the project’s managers, were first made public when
David L. McKinney, vice president of nuclear construction
support for Southern Nuclear Operating Company, testified
yesterday before the Georgia Public Service Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
