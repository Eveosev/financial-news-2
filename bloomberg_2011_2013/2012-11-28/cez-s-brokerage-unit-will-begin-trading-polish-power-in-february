CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
utility, set up a brokerage that will start trading Polish power
in February, a company official said today.  The unit will initially trade power from the group’s Polish
plants, said Witold Pawlowski, general director of the Warsaw-
based CEZ Trade Polska and the head of the new brokerage, CEZ
Towarowy Dom Maklerski Sp zoo.  “We’re expanding to offer  brokerage  services to clients,
including utilities,” Pawlowski said by phone from Warsaw.  Poland ’s financial regulator KNF yesterday issued the
approval for the brokerage. Power producers in Poland have been
obliged since 2010 to sell their output at auctions or exchanges
via licensed brokers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
