The offices of Steinway & Sons Swiss
dealers were raided as part of an antitrust probe into piano
purchases at the Zurich University of the Arts.  Evidence indicates that there may have been agreements on
sales territories and prices for Steinway pianos, the Swiss
Competition Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.
Imports of pianos from neighboring countries may have been
impeded or prevented, the watchdog said. The probe was started
yesterday.  “Tip-offs from the Canton of Zurich and further
investigations brought evidence to light which suggested undue
restrictions on competition,” the Bern-based commission said.
“In particular this regards agreements concerning the
foreclosure of sales territories and prices for instruments from
Steinway & Sons, Hamburg.”  The Zurich building department in April published a tender
for pianos and grand pianos for the university. Offers were due
by June 29 and the instruments are to be delivered in July 2013,
according to the  tender document .  Steinway spokeswoman Sabine Hoepermann in Hamburg declined
to immediately comment on the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
