Natural gas futures declined for the
third time in four days as forecasts for mild weather next week
signaled reduced demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped as much as 3.8 percent as forecasters including
MDA Weather Services predicted above-normal temperatures for
most of the lower 48 states over the next 10 days. Unusually
cold weather helped reduce a  supply glut  this month. The
December contract expires today.  “The weather is moderating so it’s wearing a little bit on
the market,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president of energy
trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in Miami. “We’ve got an
expiring contract today, that could be part of it.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 12.7 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $3.642 per million British thermal units at 1:34
p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 8.3
percent from a year ago.  The January futures contract dropped 12.6 cents to $3.766
per million Btu.  Volume was 175,317 contracts at 12:32 p.m. in electronic
trading, up 36 percent from about 129,000 at the same time
yesterday.  Gas has slumped 7.4 percent since rising to 13-month
intraday high of $3.933 on Nov. 23 as revised forecasts showed a
warmer start to December.  Warm weather building up over the next five days in the
western two-thirds of the U.S. will spread to the East Coast
next week, according to MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  Rising Temperatures  The low temperature in  New York City  on Dec. 7 will be 45
degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Chicago ’s low
will be 8 above normal at 33 degrees.  Heating demand in the 48 contiguous states will be 34
percent below normal from Dec. 4 through Dec. 8, data from
Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , show. About half of
U.S. households use gas for heating.  Gas stockpiles  probably fell by 7 billion cubic feet last
week to 3.866 trillion cubic feet, based on a median of 19
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
change for the week is a decline of 18 billion. Supplies rose by
2 billion the same week last year, according to the department.  U.S.  inventories  totaled 3.873 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Nov. 16 after rising to a record 3.929 trillion two
weeks earlier, according to the Energy Department, which is
scheduled to release its weekly stockpile report tomorrow.  A supply surplus to the five-year averages fell to 4.5
percent in last week’s report after ballooning to 61 percent in
March.  Walter Zimmerman, chief technical strategist at United-
ICAP, a brokerage in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , said gas futures
will slide to the $2.30 area by early February, based on a 20-
year average decline of 40 percent that begins around the late
November Thanksgiving holiday. “It is seasonally the most
dangerous time to be long natural gas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
