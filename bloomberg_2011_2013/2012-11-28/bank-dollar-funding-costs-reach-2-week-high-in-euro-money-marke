The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose to the highest two weeks, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 29.7
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m.
in  London  from minus 28 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 28 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose. The difference between Euribor and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.4
basis points from 11.4 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was unchanged at
0.072 percent. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was 6.6 basis
points.  Lenders decreased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 242 billion euros from 245 billion
euros on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
