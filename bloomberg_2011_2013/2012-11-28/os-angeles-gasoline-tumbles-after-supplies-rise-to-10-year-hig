Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  dropped
to a four-month low against futures as oil refineries boosted
production and supplies of the motor fuel in the region jumped
to the highest level for this season in 10 years.  Gasoline stockpiles on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, increased 3.6 percent to 30.6 million barrels
last week, the highest level for that period since 2001, Energy
Department data show. California-blend gasoline, or Carbob,
supplies were at the highest for last week in four years, the
state Energy Commission said.  Carbob in Los Angeles slid 11.5 cents to a discount of 4.25
cents a gallon against futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:20 p.m.  New York  time, the lowest level since July
20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in
San Francisco dropped 10.25 cents to 14.25 cents a gallon under
futures.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  said Nov. 26 that its Los Angeles area
refinery started a new vacuum tower that’s expected to increase
the plant’s gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production.  Phillips
66 (PSX)  said Nov. 26 that its own  refinery  near Los Angeles had
finished planned maintenance.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles fell 2.25
cents to 0.75 cent a gallon over Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at 2 cents a gallon
below futures.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  repaired a pipeline at the 240,000-barrel-a-
day Richmond refinery near  San Francisco  that was shut Nov. 24
after a leak, Derek Jansen, a company spokesman in Richmond,
said by e-mail today.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  reduced feed to a unit at the
Martinez refinery in Northern California after a release on Nov.
24, Kimberly Windon, a Shell spokeswoman in Houston, said by e-
mail today. She declined to provide the status of the unit.  Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in  Portland ,  Oregon , jumped 7.5 cents to a discount of
13 cents a gallon against gasoline futures, its highest level
since Nov. 14. Low-sulfur diesel  there  slipped 1 cent to 5.5
cents a gallon over heating oil futures.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s 234,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point refinery in
