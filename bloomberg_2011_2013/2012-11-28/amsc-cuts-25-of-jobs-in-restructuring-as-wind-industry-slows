American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
U.S. maker of wind-turbine components, fired 25 percent of its
global workforce as part of a restructuring effort that will
save $10 million a year as the wind industry slows.  Charges related to the job cuts and office consolidations
will result in a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of about $24
million, or 46 cents per share, the Devens, Massachusetts-based
company said today in a statement.  AMSC was expected to lose 34 cents in the quarter ending
Dec. 31, the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Financing and cash flow among wind farm developers and
turbine manufacturers have been constrained,” Chief Executive
Officer Daniel McGahn said in the statement. That has “impacted
growth plans” for some customers.  Sales in the current quarter will exceed $20 million, the
company said. AMSC dropped 8.3 percent to $2.54 at the close in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
