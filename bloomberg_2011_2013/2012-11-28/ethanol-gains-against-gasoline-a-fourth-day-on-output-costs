Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline, narrowing the motor fuel’s premium for a fourth day,
on speculation that a recent gain in corn prices signals higher
production costs.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline contracted
to 28.79 cents a gallon, the least since Nov. 8, from 29.41
cents yesterday, based on December futures prices. The
difference has averaged 63.04 cents this year.  Corn, the primary feedstock used to make ethanol in the
U.S., was unchanged after gaining 2.5 percent the past three
sessions, on concern that demand for the grain will increase as
drought in the U.S. Great Plains erodes wheat crop conditions.  “We’ve got a negative trend in the energies and a little
positive on grains and ethanol,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.446 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest settlement price since Oct. 11. The futures have
climbed 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York rose 2.5 cents,
or 1 percent, to $2.525 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
increased 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.425, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 2 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.475 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.58.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline for December delivery gained 0.18 cent to $2.7339
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 23, a seven-week
high, Energy Department data show.  Corn for March delivery was unchanged at $7.64 a bushel in
 Chicago . The price earlier rose to $7.675.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 32 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
