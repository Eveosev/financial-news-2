China said actions by the U.S. to
combat global warming are “not adequate” to date and that it
hopes President  Barack Obama  will make more of an effort on the
issue in his second term.  “We had high expectations at the very beginning of his
first term,”  Su Wei , China’s lead negotator at United Nations
climate talks in Doha, said in an interview today. “Of course
we understand the various constraints of domestic policy. We
very much hope the U.S. will be back on track on climate policy
and turns those policies into real actions.  ‘‘The actions were not adequate’’ to date, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
