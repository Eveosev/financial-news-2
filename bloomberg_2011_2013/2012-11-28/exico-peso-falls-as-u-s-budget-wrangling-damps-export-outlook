Mexico ’s peso rose for the first
time in three days as U.S. lawmakers said they are optimistic
that they can reach a budget agreement, boosting the economic
outlook for the Latin American country’s top trading partner.  The currency gained 0.4 percent to 12.9896 per  U.S. dollar 
at 2:22 p.m. in Mexico City after reversing an earlier decline
of as much as 0.3 percent. The peso is up 7.3 percent this year,
the best performance among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts.  President  Barack Obama  and U.S. lawmakers are under
pressure to reach a compromise to avoid $607 billion in spending
cuts and tax increases set to take effect in January. The peso
reversed earlier losses as Republican House Speaker  John Boehner 
told reporters he’s optimistic budget talks can “avert this
crisis sooner rather than later.” Obama said he hopes a deal
can be reached before Christmas. Mexico sends about 80 percent
of its exports to the U.S.  “Everything is being driven by headlines on the prospects
of a deal getting done,” Alex Silva, who manages and advises on
about $800 million of emerging-market assets, including the
peso, at Silva Capital Management, said in a telephone interview
from  Chicago .  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2022 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.52 percent. The price
increased 0.05 centavo to 107.24 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
