China Petrochemical Corp., the
nation’s biggest refiner, plans to seek about $1.5 billion in an
initial public offering of its engineering unit, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The IPO of Sinopec Engineering (Group) Co. may start in
 Hong Kong  in the second half next year, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec Group, is injecting part
of its oilfield services business into the unit, which was set
up this year, they said.  Citic Securities Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG are
among banks arranging the offering, the people said. A Beijing-
based spokesman for Sinopec couldn’t be reached to comment on
the plan.  The Wall Street Journal reported the IPO plan earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
