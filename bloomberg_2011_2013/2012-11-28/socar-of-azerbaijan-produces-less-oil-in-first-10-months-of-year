State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , or
Socar, pumped less oil and natural gas in the first 10 months of
the year as production from the BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
field dropped.  The Baku-based company, a partner in the Caspian Sea field
known as ACG, produced 6.9 million metric tons of oil in the
period, a decline of 2.2 percent from a year earlier, according
to data published today on its website. Gas output fell 3.4
percent to 5.7 billion cubic meters.  ACG production shrank 12 percent in the first half of the
year, prompting Azeri President Ilham Aliyev to accuse BP of
making “grave mistakes” at the field, which accounted for 78
percent of the nation’s output last year. BP has since replaced
regional executives and promised to bring in experts from around
the world to address the “technical challenges” at ACG.  Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the former Soviet
Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, saw total crude production
fall 7.7 percent to 36 million tons in the 10 months, the State
Statistics Committee said this month. Production of marketable
gas increased 6.8 percent to 14.4 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
