Cartier Wind Energy, a joint venture
of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  and  Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. (INE) ,
completed Canadaâ€™s largest wind farm in eastern Quebec.  The 211.5-megawatt Gros-Morne wind farm uses 141  General
Electric Co. (GE)  1.5-megawatt turbines and sells electricity to
Hydro-Quebec under a 20-year contract, Fairfield, Connecticut-
based GE said today in a statement.  The project in the Gaspesie region has enough capacity for
about 20,000 homes. An initial phase of the project with 100
megawatts of capacity was completed one year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
