Chile’s peso weakened as copper
declined on concern U.S. authorities have made little progress
in talks to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 481 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago after falling 0.5 percent.
International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market cut
bets against the currency to a six-month low of $6.8 billion on
Nov. 26, according to central bank data published today.  The peso and copper pared losses as U.S. President  Barack
Obama  and Speaker of the House John Boehner fueled optimism
lawmakers will be able to avert a so-called fiscal cliff. Copper
for March delivery dropped 0.6 percent on the Comex in  New York 
to $3.531 a pound after earlier falling 1.6 percent.  “The dollar has appreciated versus yesterday on external
factors,” said Matias  Madrid , the chief economist at Banco
Penta in Santiago. “Copper’s falling because there’s
uncertainty around the fiscal agreement in the U.S.”  Minutes published by the central bank today showed that
bankers didn’t consider raising or lowering the 5 percent target
lending rate in November. Chile’s central bank has left the  rate
unchanged  since January, helping to support an 8 percent
appreciation of the currency this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
