The  San Francisco 49ers  will start
Colin Kaepernick at quarterback over  Alex Smith  in this week’s
 National Football League  game against the St. Louis Rams.  Kaepernick has started the past two games since Smith
suffered a concussion on Nov. 11, passing for 474 yards, three
touchdowns and one interception in wins over the Chicago Bears
and New Orleans Saints.  Kaepernick, a second-round pick in the 2011 draft, got the
start last week against the Saints even though Smith had no
concussion symptoms and was medically cleared to play.  49ers coach  Jim Harbaugh  said today he’s again decided to
start Kaepernick over Smith, a former No. 1 overall pick who had
a 19-5-1 record as a starter the past two years.  “All these decisions are difficult and you think through
them the best you possibly can,” Harbaugh said at a news
conference. “Alex is a class act all the way. He’ll prepare as
he’s the starter and that’s what we’d expect. He’ll be ready to
go in and contribute to this football team.”  The 49ers have the second-best record in the  National
Football Conference  at 8-2-1 and lead the NFC West.  Smith, 28, has completed 70 percent of his passes this
season for 1,731 yards, 13 touchdowns and five interceptions.
Kaepernick has completed 32 of 48 passes the past two games
while also rushing for 37 yards and a touchdown.  “We have two very good quarterbacks,” Harbaugh said.
“It’s a unique situation. You have two guys who can win for
you, have won for you and who deserve it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
