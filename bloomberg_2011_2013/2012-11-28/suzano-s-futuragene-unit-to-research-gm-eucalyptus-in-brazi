FuturaGene Ltd. U.K., held by  Suzano
Papel & Celulose SA (SUZB5) , will study genetic-modification technology
with the Brazilian government’s agricultural-research agency as
the Latin American country seeks to boost eucalyptus yields.  Their first project will involve inserting an aluminum-
tolerance gene into eucalyptus in areas affected by metal
toxicity in the soil, FuturaGene said today in a statement.
Inserting genes into trees can increase yields for clean-power
generation or for making pulp and paper.  “Agro-forestry is a key weapon in fighting climate change
and driving socioeconomic development,” Stanley Hirsch, chief
executive officer at FuturaGene, said in the statement. The
research will improve plant resilience, the capacity to restore
degraded land and species’ climate adaptation, he said.  FuturaGene and the Brazilian agency, Empresa Brasileira de
Pesquisa Agropecuaria, will also research other tree species in
the country and elsewhere, according to the statement.
FuturaGene was bought by Suzano in July 2010.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
