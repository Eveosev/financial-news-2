Louisiana  State University football
coach Les Miles will receive a contract extension and a raise
after the Tigers’ season-ending bowl game.  Miles, 59, has a record of 85-20 in eight seasons at LSU
and led the  Tigers  to a national championship in 2007.  “Les Miles is one of the premier coaches in the country
and has LSU in contention for championships year in and year
out,” Director of Athletics Joe Alleva said yesterday in a
statement posted on LSU’s website.  LSU has a 10-2 record this season, including a 6-2 record
in  Southeastern Conference  games. It has not yet been determined
in which postseason bowl game the Tigers will play.  Details of Miles’s new contract are still being negotiated,
the school said. The announcement of the extension and raise
came after Miles said he had “very preliminary” conversations
about coaching at conference rival  Arkansas .  “I can tell you I very much respect those Razorbacks,”
Miles said at a campus news conference in  Baton Rouge , Louisiana.
“But I am an LSU head coach and will be an LSU coach as long as
I can be.”  The  Times-Picayune said on its website  that Miles’s current
salary is about $3.75 million per season.  “Our intent was to address his contract following this
year’s bowl game, but speculation about other job opportunities
accelerated our process,” Alleva said. “We have accomplished
the important step of securing Les Miles as our head coach for
the long-term good of the program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
