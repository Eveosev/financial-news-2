The Financial Stability Oversight
Council, a group of regulators created to prevent another
financial crisis,  will meet  in a closed session Dec. 3,
according to the U.S. Treasury Department’s  website .  The Treasury didn’t release an agenda or list of topics for
the meeting, which will be held 11 days before  Mary Schapiro , a
council member, leaves her post as chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The council on Nov. 13 approved a draft
recommendation to the SEC spelling out three ways to overhaul
the money-market mutual fund industry.  While Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner , the council’s
chairman, has said the SEC is best-positioned to address money
funds, he has also said the council might intervene and subject
funds to Federal Reserve oversight if the SEC fails to act.  The council, or FSOC, also decides which non-bank financial
companies are systemically important. In the last two months it
has decided to consider whether American International Group
Inc., Prudential Financial Inc. and General Electric Co.’s
finance arm should be designated as posing a potential risk to
the financial system if they were to fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
