Virtu Financial LLC is preparing a
cash takeover offer for  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  of about $3 a
share, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Virtu plans to assert in talks with Knight that the offer
is more attractive than the bid announced earlier today by Getco
LLC because it is for all of Knight’s  shares  and is more likely
to be completed, according to two people familiar with the
matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. The proposal would be financed by capital contributed
by Virtu’s owner, the private-equity firm Silver Lake Management
LLC, and a loan commitment led by Credit Suisse Group AG, one of
the people said.  Chris Concannon, an executive vice president at Virtu,
didn’t respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment. The plans
were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  Getco proposed a transaction in which it merges its
operations with Knight, and buys half of the Knight shares not
already held by Getco at $3.50 apiece in cash, leaving outside
investors with the remaining listed stock. The proposal would be
financed by $950 million from a “large financial institution,”
Getco said.  Knight’s stock rose 15 percent to $3.40 as of 12:52 p.m. in
New York after surging 19 percent in the previous two sessions,
the biggest rally since 2008. The company was bailed out by six
financial companies in August after losing more than $450
million in a trading malfunction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
