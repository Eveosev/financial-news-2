Seamless Distribution AB (SEAM) , a Swedish
maker of payment solutions for mobile phones, fell as much as 19
percent after saying it plans to sell shares to fund the global
expansion of its new payment system.  Seamless shares tumbled 18 percent to 18 kronor, the
biggest slide in almost a year, at 10:42 a.m. in Stockholm
trading. The stock has jumped 77 percent so far this year,
giving the Stockholm-based company a market value of 464 million
kronor ($69 million).  “For Seamless, this is now about taking as big of a market
share as possible during this time when the world is starting to
move to mobile payments on a large scale,” it said in a
statement today.  The share sale is worth 100 million kronor and Chief
Executive Officer Peter Fredell and Kinnevik New Ventures AB
have agreed to purchase new shares. Shareholders have the right
to subscribe to one new share for 16 kronor each for every four
shares currently owned. The subscription period is Dec. 7 to 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
