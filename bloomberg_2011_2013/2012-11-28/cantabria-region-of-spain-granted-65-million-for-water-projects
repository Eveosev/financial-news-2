The Cantabria region of northern
Spain was granted a 50 million-euro ($65 million) loan by the
European Investment Bank to help finance water and sewage
infrastructure projects.  The funds from the Luxembourg-based EIB, a lending arm of
the European Union, are meant to increase the reliability and
efficiency of water supplies in coastal areas of the northern
province and improve wastewater management, the bank said.  “Against a background of water shortages, these schemes
will have clear environmental benefits, contributing to the
efforts to adapt to climate change and meet water demand,” it
said in a statement. “The sanitation investments will also help
to reduce pollution by improving the quality of discharges into
surface and coastal waters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
