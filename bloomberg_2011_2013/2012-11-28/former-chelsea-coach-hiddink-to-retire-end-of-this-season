Former Chelsea and Holland manager
Guus Hiddink will retire at the end of this season, he told
Dutch state television.  “No, I don’t think I’ll be working here next season,”
Hiddink, 66, told NOS, when asked if he’d continue as manager of
Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala next year. “I still have a lot
of energy going to work on the football pitch every day. But
there comes a time when you have to be careful that you don’t
repeat yourself, and that people say ‘here he comes again.”’  Hiddink, who began his soccer career as a player for Dutch
club De Graafschap in 1967, led  PSV Eindhoven  to the European
Cup title in 1988. He also managed Fenerbahce, Valencia, Real
Madrid and Real Betis and was interim coach at Chelsea in 2009
when the team reached the semifinals of the  Champions League  and
won the F.A. Cup.  He signed a 1 ½-year contract in February with Anzhi, which
is second in the Russian league this season.  Hiddink, born in Varsseveld in the Dutch countryside, was
also successful as a national coach, twice reaching the
semifinals of the  World Cup . He led Holland to the last four in
France in 1998 and repeated the feat with co-host  South Korea 
four years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
