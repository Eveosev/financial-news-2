France ’s 10-year government bonds
advanced for a fourth day, erasing the decline that followed
Moody’s Investors Service’s removal of the nation’s Aaa rating
less than two weeks after the downgrade.  The  yield  on the 10-year securities dropped eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 2:54 p.m.
London time, compared with a closing yield of 2.07 percent on
Nov. 19, before Moody’s cut France’s credit grade. The rate
climbed to as high as 2.19 percent on Nov. 22.  France’s bonds have returned 8.9 percent since a similar
downgrade by Standard & Poor’s in January, more than double the
rest of the global government bond market, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The yield premium, or spread,
investors demand to hold French 10-year securities instead of
benchmark German bunds narrowed to 69 basis points, from as much
as 153 basis points in January.  “I don’t think that credit issues are a driver right
now,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at
Societe Generale SA in Paris. “If you’re looking at a spread
that’s only 100 basis points over bunds, it’s likely that
ratings are not that big an issue.”  Moody’s cut France’s credit rating one level to Aa1 and
maintained its negative outlook, citing a worsening economic
growth outlook. S&P lowered the rating by one level to AA+ from
AAA on Jan. 13.  Since the January downgrade, global sovereign bonds
returned 4.1 percent through yesterday, according to the Bank of
America indexes. German bonds advanced 3 percent in the period,
while U.K. gilts and U.S. Treasuries handed investors 2.3
percent, the indexes show.  About half the time, government bond yields move in the
opposite direction suggested by new ratings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg in June on 314 upgrades, downgrades and
outlook changes going back to 1974.  To contact the reporters on this story:
