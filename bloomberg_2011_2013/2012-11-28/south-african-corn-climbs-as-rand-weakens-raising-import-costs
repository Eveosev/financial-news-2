South African white-corn futures
rose after the rand weakened against the dollar, making grain
imports more expensive. Yellow corn and wheat also increased.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract,
gained 1 percent to 2,524 rand ($285) a metric ton by the close
in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in July, rose
1.5 percent to 2,409 rand a ton.  The rand declined for the first time in five days after
South African Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  said economic
growth is likely to remain low. It depreciated 0.3 percent to
8.8696 per dollar at 2:19 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Wheat for March delivery increased 1.4 percent to 3,840
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
