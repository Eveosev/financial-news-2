Acciona SA (ANA) ’s water unit and the EMT
construction group won a 56 million-euro ($72 million) contract
for a drinking water treatment plant to improve potable water
supplies in the Rabat-Casablanca region.  Acciona Agua said today that its first water contract in
 Morocco , about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Rabat in Oum Azza,
will boost its operations in the North African nation and help
supply fresh water to an area of 5 million inhabitants.  The Alcobendas, Spain-based company said construction will
take about 27 months. Acciona Agua’s other Africa contract was
to build a desalination plant in Fouka, Algiers, which became
fully operational in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
