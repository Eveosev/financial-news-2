The  Gaza Strip , where a conflict
between  Israel  and the Palestinian group Hamas left about 175
people dead this month, will receive a grant from the World Bank
to help improve the region’s water and sewage conditions.  The $6.4 million World Bank grant in one of the most
crowded areas where there’s a “critical deterioration of the
Gaza water system” will be augmented by $11.1 million in
financing from the  Islamic Development Bank , the Washington,
D.C.-based organization said in a statement.  “We are concerned about the lack of clean water supply and
the deterioration in the quality of water resources in the Gaza
Strip, one of the most densely populated areas on Earth,”  World
Bank  West Bank and Gaza director Mariam Sherman said. The
population of Gaza is 1.6 million.  Gaza’s groundwater is over-utilized, badly contaminated and
‘‘the over-drafting of the sole aquifer is causing a decline of
the groundwater table and a deterioration of water quality,’’
the World Bank said. ‘‘Most sewage is returned to lagoons, wadis
and the sea. The area is now choked with untreated sewage,
threatening Palestinian health and life as well as remaining
water resources and the environment.’’  The funds will help construct water tanks to collect and
blend water from different sources to improve the quality and
efficiency of Gaza water and wastewater and to connect major
well fields supplying Gaza’s middle and southern areas, it said.
Water distribution networks will also be upgraded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
