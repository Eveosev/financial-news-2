Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) , a Canadian
copper and zinc producer, said it rejected a C$4.86 billion
($4.9 billion) unsolicited offer from  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM)   The C$70-a-share offer in cash and stock was made Nov. 25,
Toronto-based Inmet said today in a statement. That followed an
Oct. 28 bid of C$62.50 from Vancouver-based First Quantum that
was also rejected, Inmet said.  Inmet said its board and legal and financial advisers
reviewed the offer and decided it isn’t in the best interests of
the company’s investors.  First Quantum rose Nov. 12 amid speculation that it held
informal takeover talks with Inmet, the U.K.’s Daily Mail
reported at the time, without citing anyone. First Quantum is
being advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Jefferies Group
Inc., the U.K. newspaper said.  Inmet is developing the $6.2 billion Cobre Panama copper-
mining project in the Latin American nation. The current plan is
for Cobre Panama to produce 160,000 metric tons of ore daily,
rising to 240,000 tons by the 10th year of operation, Inmet said
in August. Inmet last year terminated a C$3.3 billion bid for
Canada’s  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN)   The value of the First Quantum deal was calculated based on
the 69.4 million shares of Inmet that were outstanding as of
Oct. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
