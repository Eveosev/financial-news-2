(Corrects coaching record in fifth paragraph.)  Brazil ’s last World Cup-winning
coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will return to lead the national
soccer team following the dismissal of Mano Menezes.  Scolari, 64, was in charge when Brazil beat Germany 2-0 to
secure a record fifth title in Japan in 2002, and will return,
newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo said, without citing anyone. The
Brazilian soccer federation fired Menezes on Nov. 23, and said
it will hold a press conference tomorrow. Federation spokesman
Rodrigo Paiva declined to confirm that Scolari would take over.  The change in management comes as Brazil, usually among the
world’s top teams, has fallen behind regional rivals Argentina,
Uruguay and Colombia to stand 13th in world soccer ruling body
FIFA’s rankings. Speculation about Menezes’s future grew after
the team failed to win a gold medal at the London Summer
Olympics and was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the  Copa
America  a year earlier. South America’s most-populous country
will host the  World Cup  in 2014.  Scolari coached the Portuguese national team before taking
lucrative assignments with Chelsea of England’s Premier League
and Uzbekistan’s Bunyodkor. The man popularly known as “Big
Phil” was fired Sept. 13 by Palmeiras following poor results.  Rich Contracts  The former Palmeiras coach has had some of the richest
contracts in soccer management. Media reports said he earned 13
million euros ($17 million) a year in Uzbekistan while his time
at Chelsea was worth more than 16 million pounds ($25.6 million)
even though he lasted only seven months of a four-year contract.
Chelsea has since changed the way it pays severance to managers
fired by billionaire owner  Roman Abramovich .  Menezes, an ex-coach of Corinthians, took over on July 24,
2010, after  Carlos Dunga ’s squad lost in the quarterfinals of
the World Cup in  South Africa .  Scolari won 18 out of 24 games he oversaw during his one-
year spell in charge of the national team between 2001 and 2002.
Menezes, in his almost 2 1/2 years, recorded 21 wins in 33
games. His last game was a 2-1 loss to Argentina Nov. 21.  The country is set to host the next World Cup from June 12
to July 13, 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
