British Airways (IAG)  said it will offer
inflight movies, television and movies for the entire period
that passengers are on its long-haul planes after previously
pulling the plug during takeoff and landing.  The U.K.  Civil Aviation Authority  has approved the change,
which becomes effective this weekend, BA said in a statement.
Carriers have generally blanked screens until after takeoff,
following announcements and for 15 to 20 minutes before landing.  The switch will allow for as much as one hour of extra
viewing and will be particularly appealing to families traveling
with children, Frank van der Post, the London-based carrier’s
director of brands and customer experience, said in the release.  BA’s most popular inflight movies last year were The
Avengers, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Prometheus, Dark Knight
Rises and  Snow White  and Huntsman. Now part of International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA, its predecessor British Overseas
Airways Corp. first screened films on  Boeing Co. (BA)  707 flights to
Moscow and  Tokyo  in 1970 using cinema screens and projectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
