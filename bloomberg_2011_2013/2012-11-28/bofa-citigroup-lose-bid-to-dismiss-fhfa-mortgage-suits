Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  are among banks that lost bids to dismiss lawsuits filed by
the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  over mortgage bonds sold to
 Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac .  U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in  Manhattan  denied
requests by the banks, along with  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  and
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , to throw out the cases, according to
decisions filed today.  The banks are among more than a dozen financial
institutions, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , that were sued by the FHFA last year over
losses on about $200 billion in mortgage securities sold to
mortgage finance companies  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac.  Cote previously ruled that cases against other banks could
proceed. In today’s decisions, she said she was adopting the
reasoning of the earlier rulings.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Citigroup spokeswoman
Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment on the rulings.
Representatives of HSBC and  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  didn’t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment on the rulings.  The cases are Federal Housing Finance Agency v.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , 11-06195; Federal Housing Finance Agency v.
Citigroup Inc., 11-06196; Federal Housing Finance Agency v.
Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc., 11-06200; Federal Housing
Finance Agency v. HSBC North America Holdings Inc., 11-06189,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
