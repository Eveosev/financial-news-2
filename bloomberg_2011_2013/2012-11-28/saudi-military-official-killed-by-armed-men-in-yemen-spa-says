Gunmen killed a Saudi Arabian
military official in Yemen after he left his house with a
bodyguard, the Saudi Press Agency said, citing an unidentified
official with the kingdom’s Ministry of  Foreign Affairs .  The Yemeni bodyguard of Saudi Sergeant Khalid al-Onizi was
also killed in the attack by two gunmen in the capital Sana’a,
the official  SPA  said.  This was the second assault on a Saudi official in Yemen
this year. In March, unidentified gunmen kidnapped Abdullah al-
Khalidi, Saudi Arabia’s deputy consul in the Yemeni port city of
Aden. In August, Al Jazeera television reported that he was
released by suspected al-Qaeda militants.  Last month, a U.S. embassy security official in Sana’a was
shot and killed by an unidentified gunman. Yemen, which borders
Saudi Arabia and Oman, has been battling militants from al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula with U.S. military support.  Saudi Arabia , the Arab world’s biggest economy, helped
broker an accord to end popular unrest that led to Ali Abdullah Saleh stepping down as president in November last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
