Roman Sledziejowski, owner of a
 Brooklyn  brokerage that catered to Polish immigrants, was
accused by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of
defrauding three customers of more than $4 million.  Sledziejowski told his clients at TWS Financial LLC between
June 2009 and August 2012 to wire money to a separate company,
promising to invest in a Polish bank and vodka company, the
regulator said today in a  statement . He also transferred money
without their consent and covered it up with fake account
statements, Finra said.  The brokerage, whose name is short for Trade Wall Street,
operated from a storefront with a large sign and an eagle logo
on Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood.
Sledziejowski and the clients involved were all natives of
 Poland , according to Finra. TWS misused about $4.8 million of
customer money and returned $1.5 million, Finra said.  Robert Knuts, Sledziejowski’s lawyer at Park & Jensen LLP,
said in a telephone interview that he hadn’t had time to review
the accusation yet. A phone message left at Trade  Wall Street ’s
office wasn’t returned immediately. Finra said TWS has applied
to withdraw its broker-dealer status.  To contact the reporter on this story:
