Online spending rose 17 percent on the Monday after Thanksgiving, one of the busiest days of the year for Internet retailers, as tablets and smartphones let customers shop anytime and anywhere.  Consumers spent about $1.46 billion on so-called Cyber Monday, compared with $1.25 billion a year ago, making it the heaviest online spending day in history, research firm  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  said in a statement today. U.S. retail e-commerce spending reached $16.4 billion in the first 26 days of the holiday season, a 16 percent increase from the same time last year.  The convenience offered by mobile devices, especially tablets, is boosting sales for online retailers such as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  Consumers are no longer waiting for Black Friday to shop and they’re starting as early as Thursday evening, which will help  Internet sales  reach $43.4 billion this  holiday season , or 10 percent of U.S. retail spending, excluding gas, food and cars, according to ComScore.  “Mobile commerce as a whole has clearly gone beyond what it’s traditionally been, which is something primarily for the research phase,” Clark Fredricksen, vice president at researcher EMarketer Inc., said in an interview. “Tablets are the key driver in terms of the sales element. They’ve extended the length of the shopping day.”  More than 18 percent of shoppers used a mobile device to access a retailer’s website on Cyber Monday, an increase of 70 percent over 2011, according to a Nov. 27 report from International Business Machines Corp. Mobile sales almost doubled, making up 13 percent of total Web-based purchases, the company said.  Mobile Sales  Amazon’s sales on Cyber Monday  increased  42 percent from a year earlier, while EBay’s rose 55 percent, according to ChannelAdvisor Corp., which provides services to third-party sellers on e-commerce sites.  EBay mobile sales volume more than doubled on Cyber Monday, compared with the previous year, and PayPal’s payment volume almost tripled, Johnna Hoff, an EBay spokeswoman, said in an e- mail. Consumers worldwide shopped most frequently from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.  New York  time, the company said.  For EBay, Sunday was the biggest mobile-shopping day, providing evidence that consumers are using mobile devices to debunk the tradition of splurging most on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  “Our success on Black Friday and Cyber Monday was surpassed on Sunday when we experienced the biggest mobile transacted volume day of the year, as shoppers continue to embrace an anytime, anywhere mobile shopping experience,” Steve Yankovich, EBay’s vice president of mobile, said in the e-mail.  Amazon’s Kindle  Physical retailers are trying to offer comparable online and mobile sales to e-commerce companies, instead of focusing primarily on drawing customers into stores, Fredricksen said.  Other retailers also saw revenue increases.  Rakuten Inc. (4755) ’s Buy.com saw sales surge 28 percent over the previous year, with spending via mobile devices up 128 percent, according to Bernard Luthi, Buy.com’s chief operating officer. The most popular item by unit volume was a refurbished  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  Nook Color e-reader. The top five also included the  Super Fly Sock Monkey  and a rechargeable wine-bottle opener.  Cyber Monday was the biggest day ever for Amazon’s Kindle e-readers and tablets, and sales more than doubled from last year during the holiday shopping weekend after Thanksgiving, the company said in a  statement . Wayfair LLC, which sells home goods on its website, said revenue increased 60 percent to $6.4 million on Cyber Monday, and mobile shopping soared 76 percent.
