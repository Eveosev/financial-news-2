RIT Capital Partners Plc, the U.K.
investment trust led by Jacob Rothschild, said it earned a
profit of more than 30 percent from the initial public offering
of  Brazil ’s  Banco BTG Pactual SA. (BBTG11)   Half of the stake in BTG “was made available at the time
of the company’s IPO, at a profit in excess of 30 percent,” RIT
said in its half-yearly statement today. It didn’t disclose
further details.  The trust also said it’s “seeking out opportunities in the
financial sector” following an investment in private-equity
firm Corsair Capital in July. RIT said it increased its
exposure to U.S. technology companies, as well as gold given
central banks’ monetary loosening.  BTG, the Brazilian bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves ,
sold a stake of about 16 percent in December 2010 to a group of
investors that included the Rothschild family and  Italy ’s
Agnelli family, which controls automaker Fiat SpA. The investor
group paid $1.55 billion, Fitch said in a report. BTG listed in
Brazil earlier this year.  RIT had about 1.84 billion pounds of assets ($2.94 billion)
as of Sept. 30, down from 1.92 billion pounds in March, it said
in the statement. RIT said in March that Edmond de Rothschild
Group would become a shareholder of the company.  “Across our public equity portfolio, we continue to seek
investments that will be driven by fundamentals rather than
government actions alone,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
