Eight members of the  HRT Formula One
team , the bottom-ranked squad which is up for sale, were
involved in a fight after returning from the season-ending race
in Brazil, a police official said.  Officers were called after the employees confronted a team
executive yesterday at the team’s Madrid headquarters, according
to a statement from the police.  Those involved included British mechanics who were picking
up their final pay after not having their contracts renewed, the
 El Mundo newspaper  reported on its website. The team’s owner
Thesan Capital SL released a statement on Nov. 12 saying the
squad is up for sale.  The police said the fight ended when officers arrived and
no one was arrested.  To contact the reporters on this story:
