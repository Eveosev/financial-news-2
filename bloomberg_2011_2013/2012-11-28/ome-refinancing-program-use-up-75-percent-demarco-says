About 700,000 homeowners refinanced
their mortgages through the U.S. government’s Home Affordable
Refinancing Program in the first nine months of this year, an
increase of 75 percent over all of last year, the overseer of
 Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac  said today.  “It is possible that the program could reach nearly a
million borrowers, or more, by the end of this year,” Edward J. DeMarco, acting director of the  Federal Housing Finance Agency ,
said in a speech to the Exchequer Club in Washington.  Use of HARP, which applies to loans backed by Fannie Mae
and  Freddie Mac (FMCC) , surged after its rules were changed this year
to encourage lender participation. The government-sponsored
enterprises have financed more than 1.7 million loans through
the program since it began in 2009.  HARP is intended to help borrowers who owe more than their
homes are worth. More than 40 percent of HARP refinances in the
first nine months of 2012 went to such underwater borrowers,
DeMarco said. A quarter of the 90,000 loans refinanced through
HARP in September were for mortgages that exceeded the value of
the underlying homes by at least 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
