Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said the government will make decisions on foreign-
investment guidelines and on whether to approve “a couple” of
proposals including Cnooc Ltd.’s $15.1 billion bid for Canada’s
 Nexen Inc. (NXY)  in “the near future.”  “We intend obviously to make decisions on a couple of
particular matters along with some more general guidance to the
marketplace; we intend to do that in the near future,” Harper
said at a press conference in Ottawa today where he is meeting
Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto.  Canada is reviewing the sale of Calgary-based Nexen and an
appeal of Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s rejected C$5.2 billion
($5.24 billion) bid for  Progress Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ)  The
country’s foreign takeover law says that transactions must have
a “net benefit” to the country to win approval, and the
government is also working on a broader set of investment
guidelines.  Harper’s response didn’t name Petronas directly today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
