The European Food Safety Authority
said conclusions in a French study about toxicity of genetically
modified corn were not scientifically sound, repeating findings
from an initial review last month.  “Serious defects” in design and methodology mean the
study led by researcher Gilles-Eric Seralini does not meet
acceptable scientific standards, and there’s no need to re-
