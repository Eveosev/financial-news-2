Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
driving the 10-year yield to a four-day low, on concern failure
to reach an agreement on the U.S. budget will jeopardize a
global recovery.  The world economy will fall back into recession if the so-
called fiscal cliff isn’t avoided, the Paris-based Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report
yesterday. Democrat and Republican lawmakers have made little
progress in avoiding the $607 billion spending cuts and tax
increases, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said yesterday.  “The fiscal cliff creates uncertainties in the market,”
said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc.
in Taipei. “It’s going to remain as a major concern for
investors.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
fell one basis point to 1.132 percent in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.2 percent to NT$29.175 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, dropped 10 basis points to
3.3 percent.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was 0.383 percent,
compared with 0.385 percent yesterday, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
