South Africa’s economic growth will
probably continue to slow in the fourth quarter as the impact of
mining strikes filters through the economy, Deputy Central Bank
Governor  Daniel Mminele  said.  “The negative impacts of the  strike action  on growth have
not fully fed through and we are likely to see further weakness
in the quarter ahead,” Mminele said, according to a copy of a
speech he gave today posted on the  Reserve Bank ’s  website .
“Both business and  consumer confidence  are far from robust and
it is unlikely that the demand side of the economy will provide
much support.”  South Africa’s Reserve Bank held the benchmark lending rate
at 5 percent last week as inflation remained near the top of the
bank’s target of 3 percent to 6 percent, limiting policy makers’
ability to stimulate the economy. Gross domestic product
expanded at an annualized 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the
slowest pace since the 2009 recession, the statistics office
said yesterday.  Walkouts at gold and platinum mines this year have cost the
economy more than 10 billion rand ($1.1 billion) in lost output
and will probably shave about 0.5 percentage point off growth,
according to estimates by the National Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
