Inflation slowed in three German
states and held steady in three others in November.  Inflation rates declined in Hesse, Brandenburg and Baden-
Wuerttemberg and were unchanged in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Saxony and Bavaria, reports from the states’ statistics of
offices showed. In the month, consumer prices fell in all six
states.  Economists predict that pan-German inflation, calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, will slow to 2 percent
from 2.1 percent in October, according to the median of 23
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . The Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden is due to publish that report, based on data
from the six states, at 2 p.m. today.  Oil prices  have declined about 11 percent this year as a
cooling global economy curbs demand.  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis is also damping German economic growth, leaving companies
with less room to raise prices. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development yesterday cut its forecasts for
German expansion to 0.9 percent this year and 0.6 percent in
2013.  “ Germany  is in the enviable position of having neither an
inflation nor a deflation problem,” said  Carsten Brzeski , an
economist at ING Group in Brussels. “Inflation will probably
stay around 2 percent for the foreseeable future.”  The  European Central Bank  aims to keep inflation in the 17-
nation euro region just below 2 percent. The euro-area rate will
decline to 2.4 percent this month from 2.5 percent in October,
according to another survey of economists. That report is due on
Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
