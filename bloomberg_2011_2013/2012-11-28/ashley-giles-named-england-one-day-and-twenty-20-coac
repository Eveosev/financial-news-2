Former  England  cricket international
 Ashley Giles  will become the team’s one-day international and
Twenty20 head coach, the  England and Wales Cricket Board  said.  Giles, 39, will be responsible for the day-to-day
management of the England sides for limited overs competitions,
while reporting to England Team Director  Andy Flower , the ECB
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, will start his
job next year when he’ll lead England on its tour of India and
 New Zealand  in January and February. He last played for England
in a Test in Australia in 2006, and retired from playing a year
later because of a hip injury.  “The change in structure will provide a more efficient and
sustainable use of coaching resources, ensuring that both
coaches have an opportunity to prepare thoroughly for each
series as well as interacting more regularly with other
important areas of England cricket,” the ECB said.  The move relieves Flower of some travel and provides the
team director “more time to plan for forthcoming series and
tournaments and also have a more realistic and sustainable work
life balance,” ECB managing director Hugh Morris said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
