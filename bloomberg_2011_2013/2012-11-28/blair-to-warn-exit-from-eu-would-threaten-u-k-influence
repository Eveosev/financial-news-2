Former Prime Minister  Tony Blair 
will warn today against a U.K. exit from the European Union,
saying such a move would lead to a loss of British influence
internationally.  In a speech in central  London  at 9.30 a.m., Blair will say
that Britain might leave the EU, only to spend 20 years trying
to get back in, according to details of the speech released by
his office. He’ll say that the case for British involvement is
even stronger than it was when the EU’s predecessor was first
founded after World War II.  “Then the rationale was peace,” Blair will say. “Today
it is power. Then it was about a continent ravaged by war in
which  Germany  had been the aggressor and Britain the victor.
Today it is about a world in which global geopolitics is
undergoing its biggest change for centuries.”  Blair argued for U.K. engagement in the EU throughout his
decade in office from 1997 as the head of a Labour Party
government. The current Conservative premier,  David Cameron ,
also supports membership, while saying it’s time to renegotiate
terms and that the results of that renegotiation should be put
to a referendum.  One Conservative lawmaker, Michael Fabricant, proposed an
electoral pact on Nov. 26 with the U.K. Independence Party,
based on a pledge on a full “in-out” referendum on British
membership of the EU. Cameron’s office rejected the suggestion.
UKIP, which seeks an exit from the EU, has no lawmakers in the
House of Commons, though it’s currently attracting the support
of about 8 percent of respondents in opinion polls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
