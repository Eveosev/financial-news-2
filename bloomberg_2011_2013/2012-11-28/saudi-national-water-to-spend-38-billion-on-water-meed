Saudi National Water Co. plans to
spend $38 billion on water projects over the next 16 years, the
 Middle East Economic Digest  reported, citing Nasser al-Amiri,
the company’s treated sewage effluent department chief.  The investment plans include an average of $600 million a
year for treated sewage projects and $1.5 billion on related
water and wastewater works in Riyadh, Jeddah and Mecca over the
next four years, the London-based publication said, citing al-
Amiri’s comments at a conference.  Saudi Arabia, the largest user of desalinated water, is
expanding its water facilities to meet increasing demand in the
kingdom. The Saline Water Conversion Corp. awarded companies led
by Shanghai Electric Group Co. and Samsung Engineering Co. a
11.3 billion-riyal ($3 billion) contract to build a desalination
plant on the Red Sea coast in  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
