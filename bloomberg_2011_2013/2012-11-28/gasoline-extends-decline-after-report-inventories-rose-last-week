Mercantile Exchange . Prices were $2.699 before the reportâ€™s
release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Distillate supplies, which include heating oil and diesel,
declined 800,000 barrels to 112 million in the seven days ended
Nov. 23, according to department data. Analysts estimated a
500,000-barrel increase, according to the survey.  December-delivery heating oil fell 2.37 cents, or 0.8
