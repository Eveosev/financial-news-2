OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s biggest oil
company, opened a new fuel storage in the country after
investing about 26 million euros ($34 million) at the site.  The facility, located in the southern Romanian Isalnita
village, will have a capacity of 11,000 cubic meters and will
boost Petrom’s new total storage capacity to 46,000 cubic
meters, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We are confirming our commitment to continue to improve
our operations through a modern terminal network, which fully
supports the distribution stations,” Neil Anthony Morgan, a
member of Petrom’s management board in charge with refining and
marketing, said in the statement. “We’ve invested 87 million
euros in the construction of three new storage facilities so
far.”  Petrom is also counting on 27,000 cubic meters fuel storage
in Jilava village, near Bucharest, and on a 8,000 cubic meters
storage in Brazi, in southern  Romania , according to the
statement.  Petrom, majority owned by Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , said on Feb. 22
that it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in the Black
Sea well which it is exploring together with a unit of  Exxon
Mobil Corp.. (XOM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
