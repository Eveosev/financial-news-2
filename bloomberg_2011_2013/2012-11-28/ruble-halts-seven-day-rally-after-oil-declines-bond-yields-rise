The ruble snapped a seven-day rally
as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, fell. Yields on ruble-
denominated bonds rose.  The Russian currency weakened 0.5 percent against the
dollar to 31.1750 by 7 p.m. in Moscow. An index of five-year
government bond yields advanced 11 basis points to 6.79 percent,
the biggest gain since Oct. 23.  Oil slid more than 1 percent to $86.01 per barrel in  New
York  amid signs of rising supplies in the U.S. and concern that
lawmakers are struggling to reach agreement on how to address
the deficit of the world’s biggest crude consumer. U.S. Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he was disappointed with
progress made in congressional budget talks over $607 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in January. Crude
and natural gas account for about 50 percent of Russian
government revenue.  “Oil is a driver,” Michael Workman, the head of fixed-
income trading at Moscow-based Otkritie Financial Corp., said by
e-mail today. “People are being more cautious as concern over
U.S. budget talks drags on. There is less risk on and more
watching at the moment.”  The ruble weakened 0.3 percent versus the central bank’s
euro-dollar target basket and depreciated 0.1 percent against
the euro to 40.1880.  The Finance Ministry today sold 13.5 billion ruble ($434
million) in five-year notes, so-called OFZ bonds, at an average
yield of 6.8 percent, the lower end of its guidance range. The
total demand for 15 billion rubles of debt on offer reached 28.4
billion rubles at the top end of the ministry’s 6.8-6.85 percent
guidance, it said in a statement.  ‘Liberalization’  “Market sentiment remains strong ahead of Euroclear
settlement,” Dmitry Dudkin, head of fixed-income analysis, at
UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The effect
of liberalization is undoubtedly positive for the market.”  Russia plans to broaden access to the local  debt market  for
foreign investors through settlement systems such as Euroclear
Bank SA later this year.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6050 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.4840 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose one basis point to 194,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
