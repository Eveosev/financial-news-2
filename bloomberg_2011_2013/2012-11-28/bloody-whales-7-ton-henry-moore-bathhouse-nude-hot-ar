Blood-red paint gushes, splashes and
drips in the new Barnaby Furnas paintings at Marianne Boesky
gallery in  Manhattan ’s Chelsea district.  “If Wishes Were Fishes” has a feverish energy, down to
the paint-smeared fingerprints on the canvases.  The New York-based Furnas feeds off historical and
religious imagery -- bleeding whales, seagulls in flight and ax-
wielding men in top hats.  The scenes allude to “Moby-Dick” and the Bible’s Jonah
while incorporating elements of the artist’s earlier series,
including his flood paintings and historic battles.  Particularly effective are “The Whalers,” a 12-by-16-foot
whale-slaughter scene, and “Jonah in the Belly of the Whale,”
depicting the prophet as a glowing-eyed creature lying as if
entombed.  Prices for paintings range from $70,000 to $300,000;
drawings start at $18,000. The show runs through Dec. 21 at 509
W. 24th St.; +1-212-680-9889;

transforms twisted steel rebar from schools that collapsed
during a 2008 earthquake in  China  into an elegant installation.  On the floor, the rusty metal, arranged in a rectangular
area of 14-by-26 feet, coils and curves like a three-dimensional
version of Brice Marden’s calligraphy painting.  On the nearby wall, a digital print of exactly the same
dimensions depicts the junk on the floor from above.  During the flooding caused by  Hurricane Sandy , the metal
ended up under the water, experiencing its second natural
disaster in less than five years.  The show is accompanied by an 18-minute video showing the
area affected by the earthquake and the metal extracted from the
disaster sites and brought to Chelsea.  The installation is $925,000. “Forge” runs through Dec.

made several trips to the coal country in China’s Shanxi
province.  More than 40 gelatin silver prints he shot during his
travels are now at the  Churner and Churner  gallery.  Hung in small groups around the gallery’s perimeter, these
8-by-10-inch images depict telling moments of real life: a local
opera singer painting her face white, a group of old men playing
checkers, workers taking a break, and two monks chanting in a
smoky room.  You see a circus tent, a bathhouse full of naked men, a
room corner with a Mao portrait, a man walking along railway
tracks with smoke stacks billowing in the background.  The diffused light in the images gives them a retro look;
were it not for the Asian faces, they could have easily been set
in mid-century America.  The photographs are $6,000 each. “Deep Sea Diver” runs
through Dec. 15 at 205 10th Ave.; +1-212-675-2750;

outdoors. This month, you can see seven huge works by the
British artist (1898-1986) inside the Gagosian gallery. They
look a bit cramped.  The largest of these biomorphic, semi-abstract
configurations weighs seven tons. The smallest is half a ton.  Cast in bronze, most pieces allude to the human body, some
more directly than others, as Moore moved back and forth between
figuration and abstraction. While you can decipher a woman’s
torso in one 1979 sculpture, an earlier piece resembles an array
of spindles.  “Late Large Forms” runs through Jan. 19 at 522 W. 21st
St.; +1-212-741-1717;  http://www.gagosian.com .  Muse highlights include  Ryan Sutton  on dining,  Mark Beech
