Syncrude Sweet oil strengthened to
its highest level in more than a month against the U.S.
benchmark as Syncrude Canada Ltd. was said to have cut November
production by 300,000 barrels after an equipment failure.  The joint-venture company, which operates the largest oil
sands mine in  Alberta , cut production to 8.6 million barrels
from 8.9 million after an equipment failure at a crusher,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  Cheryl Robb, a Syncrude spokeswoman, and Alison Trollope, a
spokeswoman for Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., Syncrude’s largest
owner, declined to comment.  Syncrude Sweet for December delivery rose $1.75 a barrel to
trade at a $2.25 discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate
crude, according to Net Energy Inc., a physical oil broker based
in Calgary.  Syncrude Sweet is a light synthetic oil produced from oil
sands bitumen. Syncrude Canada Ltd.’s 350,000-barrel-a-day
upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta, produced an average of
320,500 barrels a day in October.  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. owns 36.7 percent of Syncrude
Canada Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd. 25 percent and Suncor Energy Inc.
12 percent. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., Nexen Inc., Murphy
Oil Corp. and Mocal Energy Ltd. each own stakes of less than 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
