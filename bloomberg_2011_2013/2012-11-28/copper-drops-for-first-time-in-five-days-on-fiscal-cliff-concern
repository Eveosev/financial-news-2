Copper fell for the first time in
five days as the dollar extended gains against the euro on
concern U.S. budget talks made little progress. Metals retreated.  The contract for delivery in three months fell 0.5 percent
to $7,769 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 4:48 p.m.
in Tokyo. The metal touched $7,828.75 yesterday, the most
expensive since Nov. 2.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  told reporters he was
disappointed with the lack of progress in congressional budget
talks. Concern about the fiscal cliff of $607 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts overshadowed data showing demand for
capital goods increased, while home prices and  consumer
confidence  rose.  “Concern over the U.S. fiscal cliff was the key factor
that weighed on metals,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at
Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. “Positive U.S.
economic data was lending support, limiting a further drop.”  Reid said Republicans backed away from earlier openness to
considering new  tax revenue . The  Congressional Budget Office  has
said the economy could fall into a recession if a deal isn’t
struck to avoid more the tax increases and spending cuts that
come into effect should Congress fail to agree on a budget.  March futures declined 0.4 percent to $3.523 a pound on the
Comex in New York. Futures for March delivery closed little
changed at 56,180  yuan  ($9,022) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
