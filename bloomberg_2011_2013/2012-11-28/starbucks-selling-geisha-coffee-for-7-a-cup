Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  has started selling
a specialty coffee that costs $7 for a 16-ounce “grande” cup,
making it the company’s priciest brew, as customers demand more
premium products.  The Costa Rica Finca Palmilera coffee costs $40 for a half-
pound bag and $6 for a 12-ounce “tall” cup, Lisa Passe, a
Starbucks spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. It’s made from a rare,
difficult-to-grow varietal called Geisha. The new coffee is
available at only 46 locations in the U.S. Northwest with
expensive Clover brewing machines.  “We have loyal reserve customers who are interested in any
opportunity to try something as rare and exquisite as the Geisha
varietal,” Passe said. “We are now offering more reserve
coffees than ever before because of customer demand.”  Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-shop operator,
competes in specialty coffees with companies such as Chicago-
based  Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea Inc . and  Portland , Oregon-
based  Stumptown Coffee Roasters , which rely on “single-origin”
and “direct trade” coffee to sell to discerning customers.  Starbucks Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  has added
products such as instant coffee, energy drinks, juice, a single-
serve brewer and food to sell in the company’s shops and in
grocery stores.  Starbucks rose 2.3 percent to $51.37 at the close in  New
York . The Seattle-based company’s shares have advanced 12
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
