The yen may reverse a weakening
trend against its U.S. counterpart if it appreciates beyond its
nine-day high, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , citing
technical indicators.  The Japanese currency fell 3.9 percent against the dollar
over seven days beginning Nov. 14 before the greenback failed to
break a key resistance level from 82.50 to 83.20,  Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote
yesterday in a note to clients. If the dollar depreciates versus
the yen through a support level from 81.40 to 81.70, it will
test a breakout area at 80.60. That would be the yen’s highest
level since Nov. 15.  “That would imply that there’s a shift going on for yen in
general,” Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst
with JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a telephone interview. “It
would suggest that the underperformance we’ve seen over the last
few weeks is likely over and we’d likely see the yen strengthen
against the dollar if we break those levels.”  Japan ’s tender gained 0.1 percent to 82.08 per dollar
yesterday in  New York  after earlier reaching 81.69, its highest
level since Nov. 21.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, while support is an area where
there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
