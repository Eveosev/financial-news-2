General Motors Co. (GM) ’s joint venture
with  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  and Wuling Motors, which builds mini-
commercial vehicles, will construct a third manufacturing plant
in  China  and increase production capability to 2 million
annually at the end of 2015.  The first phase of the facility is scheduled to start
construction next year in Chongqing, according to a statement
yesterday on GM’s website. That phase will cost 6.6 billion  yuan 
($1.06 billion), the company said. The plant will have the
capacity of 400,000 vehicles and engines annually, GM said.  China is GM’s largest market by vehicle sales. The company
through a different joint venture with SAIC also sells Buick and
Chevrolet cars in China and its competitors in the country
include  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and Nissan Motor Co.  In addition to commercial vehicles, the Wuling joint
venture began selling a Chinese car brand called Baojun in 2011.
GM didn’t say which vehicles will be built at the new factory.
The project is pending government approvals, Detroit-based GM
said. The SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture already operates
factories in Liuzhou and Qingdao. The venture sold 1.29 million
vehicles last year.  Shares of GM gained 1.1 percent to $25.28 at the close
yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
