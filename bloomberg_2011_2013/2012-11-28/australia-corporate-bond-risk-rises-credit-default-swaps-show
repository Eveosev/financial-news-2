The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Australia  from non-payment climbed, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased one basis point
to 133 basis points as of 12:04 p.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The measure is set
for its first increase since Nov. 16 after closing at a eight-
month low yesterday, according to CMA prices in New York.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell half a basis point to
170.5 as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The index, which has ranged from 168.5 to 229.5 since June 30,
is headed for its lowest since July 4, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 113 basis points
as of 8:46 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge has ranged from 112.4 basis points to
175.3 basis points this half, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
