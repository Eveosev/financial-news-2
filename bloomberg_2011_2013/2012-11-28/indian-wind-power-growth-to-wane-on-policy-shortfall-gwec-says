India ’s wind-power installations
will probably fall at least 37 percent this year as a lack of
grid connections, land-acquisition delays and an insufficient
regulatory framework hamper growth, according to a report.  The country is likely to install less than 1,900 megawatts,
down from a record 3,000 megawatts in 2011, the Global Wind
Energy Council said today in its India Wind Energy Outlook 2012.  Investors are building fewer wind farms in the world’s
third-largest wind market after two government incentives
expired in March. Turbine makers are unlikely to offset the drop
in demand by boosting exports as  China , the U.S. and  Europe  have
also slowed, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  India’s New and Renewable Energy Minister Farooq Abdullah
has asked the government to reinstate the incentives as the
country works toward clean-energy targets, he said today in
Chennai. India has a goal to generate 30 gigawatts of power from
renewable sources by 2017, up from 26 gigawatts, Abdullah said.  The country installed 851 megawatts of wind capacity in the
six months through September, compared with 1,403 megawatts a
year earlier, according to data from the Indian Wind Turbine
Manufacturers’ Association in Chennai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
