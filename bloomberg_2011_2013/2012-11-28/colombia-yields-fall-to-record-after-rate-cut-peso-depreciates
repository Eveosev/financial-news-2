Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose,
snapping nine days of declines, as investors speculated the
rally which drove yields to a record low wasn’t sustainable.  The yield on the 10 percent debt due in July 2024 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6 percent,
according to the central bank. It fell to 5.97 percent
yesterday, the lowest since the securities were first issued in
2009.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent on Nov. 23, surprising
all except two of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Yields on
the bonds due in 2024 have fallen 9 basis points since the
announcement.  “After so many days of declines, this was expected,” said
Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage in
Bogota. Still, “fundamentals remain the same and there is still
room for further gains across the curve.”  The peso advanced for the first day in five, gaining 0.1
percent to 1,823.35 per  U.S. dollar . The currency has
appreciated 0.5 percent in November and risen 6.3 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
