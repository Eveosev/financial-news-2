Indonesia  and the  Philippines  are
set to cut rice purchases next year, increasing competition
among exporters amid rising global supplies, according to two
executives in importing countries.  Indonesia, the largest buyer in 2011, will probably reduce
 imports  to about 1.5 million metric tons from 1.7 million tons
this year, said Mohammad Ismet, a consultant at the United
Nations in Jakarta who formerly worked at Bulog, the state food
agency. The government of the Philippines, the biggest importer
until 2010, may end overseas purchases, said Rex Estoperez, a
spokesman for the National Food Authority.  Rice traded in  Chicago  gained 1 percent this year compared
with a 36 percent jump in wheat and a 17 percent rally in corn.
Rice export prices, tracked by the United Nations, declined 3.6
percent in the 12 months to October, as shippers including
 India ,  Vietnam  and  Pakistan  competed for market share, curbing
food costs and preventing a global food crisis.  “Abundant supplies and prospects for good production have
resulted in high global stocks and lower prices,” Ismet, who
worked at Bulog for 31 years before joining the UN’s Food &
Agriculture Organization, said in an interview in Singapore
yesterday. “That trend will continue as Thailand releases state
stockpiles.”  Record Output  Global milled rice production will rise to an all-time high
of 486 million tons in 2012, increasing inventories to a record
170 million tons, the FAO said in a  report  this month. Opening
stockpiles for 2012-2013 will climb to the highest in a decade,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  While  Thailand  has agreed to supply Indonesia with as much
as 1 million tons a year, that volume may not be purchased
because Thai rice is more expensive than that from Vietnam,
Ismet said. Indonesia has a similar agreement with Vietnam and
Thailand will need to cut prices to win contracts, he said.  The  25-percent broken rice  that’s typically bought by
countries like the Philippines was priced at $420 a ton in
Vietnam in October, compared with $565 in Thailand, $410 in
India and $395 in Pakistan, according to FAO  data .  “It’s the competition that’s pushing prices lower,” said
Estoperez of the state-run National Food Authority, which bought
a record 2.45 million tons in 2010, making it the top purchaser.
“NFA is not buying next year, and the government will decide
the volume of private imports in the next few weeks.”  Imports by the Philippines will probably drop to 100,000 to
150,000 tons in 2013, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala said
in October. Inbound shipments this year reached 500,000 tons,
Estoperez said in an interview in  Singapore  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
