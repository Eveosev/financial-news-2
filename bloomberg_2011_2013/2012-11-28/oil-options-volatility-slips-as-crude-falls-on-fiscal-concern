Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures slipped on concern that budget talks in
Congress won’t progress.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.27 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:23 p.m., down from 27.93 percent
yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil fell 69 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $86.49 a barrel on the Nymex, the third consecutive decline.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration is negotiating with
a divided Congress to forestall a $607 billion combination of
automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to begin Jan. 1.
The  Congressional Budget Office  has said that failure to reach
an agreement may push the economy into a recession next year.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $80 puts, which rose 3 cents to 28 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,585 lots at 3:34 p.m. February $75 puts were the
second-most active, with 1,278 lots exchanged as they increased
4 cents to 39 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 64 percent of the
88,619 contracts traded.  February $105 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 4,192 contracts. They fell 8 cents to 20 cents a
barrel. January $80 puts increased 2 cents to 25 cents on volume
of 4,092 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
46,454 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, unchanged at
