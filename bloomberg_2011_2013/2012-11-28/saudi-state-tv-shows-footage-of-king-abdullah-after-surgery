Saudi state television showed images
of King Abdullah meeting with senior government officials today
after he underwent back surgery in  Riyadh  on Nov. 17.  The king was shown with Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz,
the heir to the throne, Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal
and other senior princes and officials. A day after the
operation, the Royal Court said the surgery was “successful.”  The king’s medical condition raised questions about the
line of succession in the world’s largest oil exporter as the
Middle East goes through unprecedented political change.
Abdullah appointed Mohammed bin Nayef as Saudi Arabia’s interior
minister, marking the first time the job has passed to the
younger generation. The king hasn’t named a second deputy
premier since the death of Crown Prince Sultan in October 2011.  “The king might now announce who the number three will
be,” said Theodore Karasik, director of research at the
Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai.  King Abdullah has tried to keep Saudi Arabia free from the
unrest that swept through the Arab world last year, leading to
civil war in  Syria  and frequent protests in Saudi neighbor
Bahrain. He’s also fighting high unemployment and a threat from
al-Qaeda.  The king was born in Riyadh in 1924, the 13th son of Abdul
Aziz, according to the website of the Saudi Embassy in
 Washington . His heir-apparent, Salman, was born in 1935.  To contact the reporter on this story:
