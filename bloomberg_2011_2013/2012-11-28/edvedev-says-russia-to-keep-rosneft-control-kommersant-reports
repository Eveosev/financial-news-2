Russia has made no final decision on
selling the government’s stake in OAO  Rosneft (ROSN) , the country’s
largest oil producer, Kommersant reported, citing Prime Minister
 Dmitry Medvedev  as saying in an interview.  “Everything except the control packet could be sold
fearlessly, taking into consideration the situation on the
market,” Medvedev said, according to Kommersant.  The government may need 20-25 percent of Rosneft shares to
control the company if the remaining shares will be
“dispersed” and in “significant free float,” he said.  Russia approved a privatization plan Jun. 7 that called for
the government to sell its entire stake in Rosneft by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
