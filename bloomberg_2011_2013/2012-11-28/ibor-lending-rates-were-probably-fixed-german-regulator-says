Banks probably fixed the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, said Raimund Roeseler, chief
of banking supervision at German financial regulator BaFin.  Probes are continuing into the alleged manipulation,
Roeseler said before a parliamentary hearing in Berlin today.  Regulators from Canada to  Switzerland  are investigating
whether more than a dozen banks including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Barclays,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  were colluding
to rig Libor, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of
securities, or hiding their true cost of borrowing.  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  resigned in July after the
bank admitted to manipulating the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
