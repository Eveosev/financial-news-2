Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s biggest maker of  wind turbines , started
work on a 165.5-megawatt wind farm in the Australian state of
New South Wales as its home market faces a supply glut.  The company will supply 17 1.5-megawatt turbines and 56
2.5-megawatt turbines to the Gullen Range project, Goldwind said
today in an e-mailed statement, without disclosing financial
details. The venture will be its biggest overseas wind farm.  Goldwind is expanding in Australia and the U.S. as demand
slows at home. China, whose wind-turbine manufacturers are
responsible for 40 percent of the world’s output, will see a 20
percent decline in annual installations to 16.4 gigawatts this
year, according to researcher Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Goldwind said in June it will deliver four turbines to the
Georgia Mountain wind farm in the northwestern U.S. state of
 Vermont .  Transgrid is designing and building the grid networks for
the Australian project, scheduled for completion by December
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
