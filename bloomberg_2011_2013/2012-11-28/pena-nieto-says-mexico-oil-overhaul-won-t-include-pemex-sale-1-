Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto said he wants some private investment in the country’s
energy industry without the sale of state-run companies such as
Petroleos Mexicanos.  “I have publicly talked about  Mexico ’s need to open
ourselves up to the participation of the private sector in the
energy sector, however this doesn’t mean privatizing state run
companies,” Pena Nieto told reporters today in Ottawa, in
translated remarks.  “I hope that this will happen with investments in Pemex
but we can’t postpone the benefits that Mexicans deserve to get
through energy development,” he said.  Pena Nieto said he will propose a law so “that without
privatizing state run companies it would be possible to have
greater participation of the private sector in the development
of infrastructure in order to develop our energy potential in
Mexico.”  In his first year as president, Pena Nieto will overhaul
the energy industry either through constitutional changes or by
loosening oil regulations, Ildefonso Guajardo, a top economic
adviser for Pena Nieto said in an interview last month.  Pena Nieto, who rules out any kind of privatization for
Pemex during his term, has said private or foreign companies
will be crucial to accelerate the growth in Mexico’s energy
industry.  The administration will pass an energy bill in Congress
that will give Pemex greater financial freedom, Senator David Penchyna, head of the Mexican Senate’s energy committee, told El
Universal newspaper. The changes will be discussed in the next
legislative session, he said in the report published on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
