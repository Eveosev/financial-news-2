The U.S., the world’s largest
soybean exporter, may double shipments of the oilseed to  Russia 
after eliminating some trade barriers with the country.  The U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 16 passed
legislation that would allow President  Barack Obama  to grant
permanent normal trade relations with Russia. The U.S. won’t be
able to take full advantage of Russia’s joining the  World Trade
Organization  in August until the legislation is approved by the
U.S. Senate and Obama.  “For nearly 80 days now, all of the other 155 members of
the WTO have been able to fully access Russia’s market
liberalizations, but U.S. businesses cannot,”  Danny Murphy ,
first vice president of the American Soybean Association and a
soybean farmer from Canton,  Mississippi , said in an e-mail
yesterday. “For nearly 80 days now, U.S. business has had no
voice in the WTO’s rule-based system to engage Russia regarding
any of its policies that may be inconsistent with the
obligations it has undertaken as a WTO member.”  In the 2011-12 marketing year, the U.S. shipped 30,000
metric tons of soybeans and 25,000 tons of soybean meal to
Russia, he said. The Senate may consider the legislation in the
next week or two, and if it passes, exports may double, he said.  Soybeans for January delivery fell 0.5 percent to $14.4225
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 6:33 p.m. in Moscow.  Import Duties  As part of WTO, Russia agreed to eliminate its import duty
on soymeal in 2014 from 5 percent, Tamara Pashchenko, deputy
managing director of  Russia’s Oil and Fats Union  in Moscow, said
by phone yesterday. The Oil and Fats Union members account for
85 percent of vegetable oil production in Russia. There is no
import duty on soybeans, she said.  “Russia’s soybean market is expanding because of a growing
consumption by livestock farms,” Dmitry Rylko, general director
of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, said by phone
from  St. Petersburg  yesterday.  The country’s pork production increased 53 percent over
seven years to last year and poultry output more than doubled,
according to the Moscow-based National Meat Association.  Russia is importing soybeans mostly from Brazil and
 Argentina , where prices are lower than in the U.S., Rylko said.
Russia’s soybean and soymeal production is increasing
“aggressively” and will start competing with imports soon, he
said. “Our U.S. colleagues may find it not so easy to penetrate
the Russian market given these factors,” he said.  Russia’s soybean production will increase to 1.8 million
tons this marketing year, more than double the 744,000 tons it
was in 2008-09, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates. Imports are expected to be 800,000 tons, 4.4 percent
lower than five years ago, the USDA data show.  Soybean meal output is forecast to rise to about 2 million
tons, or 69 percent more than in 2008-09, while imports drop 23
percent to 370,000 tons, the data show. U.S. soybean exports
were 37.1 million tons in the 2011-12 season, making the country
the largest shipper, according to the USDA. This year,  Brazil 
will be the largest at 37.4 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
