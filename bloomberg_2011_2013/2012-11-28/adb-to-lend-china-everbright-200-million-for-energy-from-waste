The  Asian Development Bank  agreed to
provide four loans of as much as $200 million to  China
Everbright International Ltd. (257)  for agricultural and municipal
waste-to-energy projects in China.  The projects are expected to consume 7,300 tons of waste
each day, generating about 1,240 gigawatt-hours of electricity
annually by 2016, ADB said in a Nov. 26 statement on its
website.  The loans will be given to China Everbright Biomass Energy
Investment Ltd. and China Everbright Environment Energy Ltd.,
units of China Everbright International, ADB said. The terms of
the loans werenâ€™t disclosed.  China aims to install as much as 8 gigawatts of
agricultural biomass capacity and 3 gigawatts of waste-to-energy
by 2015, promoting developers to venture into the sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
