Egyptian security officials clashed
with about 200 protesters near Cairoâ€™s  Tahrir Square , firing
tear gas at the crowd hours after more than 200,000 secularists
and activists denounced a decree by President Mohamed Mursi
affording himself new powers.  Protesters dodged the haze of gas, while a police van
rushed toward the demonstrators before stopping suddenly and
reversing in a plaza near the U.S. Embassy in the Egyptian
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
