Philippe Altuzarra is returning to
 London  after running  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Paris office for
three years to serve as advisory director, a person with
knowledge of the move said.  Altuzarra will be succeeded in Paris by Pierre Hudry and
Christian De Haaij, investment banking co-heads of France,
Belgium and Luxembourg for Goldman, the person said, asking not
to be identified as an announcement has not been made public.  As advisory director, Altuzarra will give strategic
guidance to international advisers in  Europe  and help cover
clients in the region.  The 62-year-old banker joined Goldman in 1993 from Havas,
after earlier posts at France’s finance ministry and its Japan
embassy. He is a graduate of the Ecole nationale
d’administration, which produces many of  France ’s senior
officials and executives.  Altuzarra, who is a partner at the bank, was first tapped
to co-run Goldman’s Paris office in 2000, a role he held until
2006, when he was succeeded by Jean Raby and appointed to the
international advisory group in London. He returned to Paris in
2009 to co-run the office there with Laurent Lellouche, who
remains head of Goldman’s operations in France.  A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
Altuzarra’s move, which was reported earlier by WanSquare, a
French news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
