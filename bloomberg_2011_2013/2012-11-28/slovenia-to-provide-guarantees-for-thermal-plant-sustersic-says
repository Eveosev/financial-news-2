Slovenia will “shortly” provide
state-guarantees of 440 million euros ($567 million) for the
upgrade of thermal plant Termoelektrarna Sostanj d.o.o., Finance
Minister Janez Sustersic said.  “We have come to the point to be able to say that the
guarantee contract will be approved shortly,” Sustersic told
reporters in the capital Ljubljana today. “This won’t happen
overnight and it will take some time, but it ultimately will be
approved.”  The upgrade for the plant in the town of Sostanj in
northern Slovenia may cost as much as 1.3 billion euros and is
the country’s biggest energy investment.  Alstom SA (ALO)  of France is
providing the equipment. Loans for the project have been pledged
by the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
