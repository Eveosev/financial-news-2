Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  Chief Executive Officer
 Andrew Mason , responding to reports that the board is discussing
a possible leadership change, said he’d fire himself if he
wasn’t suited to the task.  “It would be weird if the board wasn’t discussing whether
I’m the right guy to do the job, and it’s their chief
responsibility to ask that question,” Mason said at a New York
conference organized by Business Insider. “It’s actually more
noteworthy if the board wasn’t discussing whether I’m the right
guy for the job.”  “When you’re creating a new category there are going to be
bumps along the road,” he said. “If I ever thought I wasn’t
the right guy for the job I’d be the first guy to fire myself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
