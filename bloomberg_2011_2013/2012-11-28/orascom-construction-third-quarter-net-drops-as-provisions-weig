Orascom Constructions Industries (OCIC) 
third-quarter net income declined 31 percent, meeting analyst
estimates, as  Egypt ’s largest publicly traded business booked
provisions on several projects. The shares tumbled.  Profit in the period declined to $126.8 million from $182.9
million a year earlier, primarily due to a “seasonal slowdown”
in the construction group’s work and “provisioning on several
projects,” the Cairo-based builder and fertilizers maker  said .
The mean estimate of six analysts was for a profit of $127
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OCI said it expects “strong demand” for its fertilizers
to continue due to record incomes for farmers in the U.S. and a
rise in demand for crops, especially corn and wheat.  OCI’s shares  fell 6.7 percent to 216 Egyptian pounds at
1:02 p.m. in Cairo, heading for the lowest close since January.
That pares this year’s gain to 6.9 percent, compared with an
increase of 34 percent for the  EGX30 (EGX30)  Benchmark Index.  The company, which is facing tax-evasion accusations on the
2007 sale of its cement unit to  Lafarage SA (LG) , said its auditors
and tax advisers have presented all the necessary documentation
to the authorities. OCI argues capital gains tax did not exist
at the time of the sale, so the law should not be applied
“retroactively.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
