Slovakia approved the sale of most
of its surplus United Nations carbon-dioxide permits to Spain as
the government attempts to raise revenue to cut the country’s
budget deficit.  A Cabinet meeting in Bratislava today authorized selling to
Spain all of Slovakia’s spare Assigned Amount Unit representing
up to 27 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to
the government’s website. A second option would be selling to
Spain permits covering 22 million tons of greenhouse gas
emissions, with the rest going to  Austria .  The statement didn’t specify the purchase price.
Environment Minister Peter Ziga said on Nov. 7 the price will
probably be less than 1 euro per ton, in line with the market
level.  AAUs were distributed to nations based on the Kyoto
Protocol, which set limits on greenhouse-gas emissions for the
period 2008 to 2012. A global economic slowdown since 2008
caused industrial production to stagnate, boosting the supply of
spare permits. Slovakia has surplus allowances worth about 27
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
