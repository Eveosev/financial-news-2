     Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average halting a four-day rally, on concern
U.S. lawmakers are making little progress on budget talks to
avert the so-called fiscal cliff and after a technical indicator
signaled the market may be overheating.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28 percent of its
sales in  North America , dropped 2.3 percent. Alps Electric Co.,
a maker of electronic parts that gets about 74 percent of its
revenue outside  Japan , dropped 6.7 percent after the yen
strengthened.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  led shipping lines
lower after delaying expansion of its commodity-transport fleet.  The Nikkei 225 slid 1.2 percent to close at 9,308.35 in
Tokyo after yesterday closing at the highest level since April.
The broader Topix Index dropped 1.3 percent to 771.39, with more
than four stocks declining for each that rose.  “There’s definitely signs of short-term overheating as
stocks have risen fast over the past two weeks,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a  fund manager  who helps oversee about 65 billion yen
($795 million) in Japanese equities at T&D Asset Management Co.
“I’m concerned about the fiscal cliff in the short-term.”  The Topix advanced 8.2 percent through yesterday from Nov.
14, when Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called for a Dec. 16
election, causing the yen to drop on speculation the opposition
may win and call for more monetary easing.  Stocks fell after the  14-day relative strength index  for
the Topix reached 70.6 yesterday, climbing above the 70
threshold that some traders say signals a drop. The yen has
rebounded against the dollar since reaching its seven-month low
on Nov. 22.  ‘Moving in Lockstep’  “A major driver behind the recent rally was that a weaker
yen would boost exporter earnings, while the economic outlook
got revised downward,” Matsumoto at T&D said. “As the yen
stops falling, hopes for better earnings wane, too. The currency
and stocks are moving in lockstep.”  The yen rose against all 16 of its major peers. The
currency touched 81.77 per dollar, the strongest since Nov. 20
and 0.5 percent lower than yesterday’s close. A stronger yen
cuts the overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Alps Electric  Alps Electric fell 6.7 percent to 501 yen to lead declines
on the Nikkei 225.  Pioneer Corp. (6773) , which gets 49 percent of its
sales outside Japan, slid 5.9 percent to 191 yen.  The Topix traded at 0.9 times book value compared with 2.1
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  declined 0.1 percent. The measure
fell 0.5 percent yesterday, after Senator Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said “little progress” has been made in talks to avert
the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of automatic spending cuts
and tax increases that will occur unless a budget compromise is
reached. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said the situation increases global recession risk.  Exporters to the U.S. fell, with Mazda dropping 2.3 percent
to 125 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that
depends on the Americas for 23 percent of its sales, fell 2.1
percent to 1,805 yen.  Shippers Drop  Shipping lines fell the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups after Kawasaki Kisen, Japan’s No. 3 shipper, said it will
postpone an expansion of its commodity-vessel fleet as a global
glut in transport capacity cuts cargo rates.  Kawasaki Kisen lost 4.6 percent to 103 yen.  Nippon Yusen
K.K. (9101) , Japan’s leading shipping line, dropped 4.5 percent to 169
yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  declined 4.9 percent to 196 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 2.9
percent to 17.67, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Sakurada Co. plunged 92 percent to 1 yen, the biggest drop
on the Topix, after the construction company announced
bankruptcy proceedings.  Hulic Co. dropped 12 percent to 571 yen as the realtor
plans to raise as much as 37 billion yen in a public share sale,
according to a filing with the  Finance Ministry  showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
