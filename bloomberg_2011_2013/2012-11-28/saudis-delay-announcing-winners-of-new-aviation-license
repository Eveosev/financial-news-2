Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for
Civil Aviation, or GACA, said it postponed announcing which
airlines won a license to operate domestic and international
flights from the kingdom until the end of the year.  GACA said in an e-mailed statement today that it needed
more time to choose the best bids. Fourteen companies applied
for the license after GACA announced it on Jan. 21.  The Saudi air regulator shortlisted Bahrain’s Gulf Air and
 Qatar Airways  among seven bidders including  China ’s  Hainan
Airlines. (600221)   To contact the reporter on this story:
