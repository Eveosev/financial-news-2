The Jacksonville Jaguars were
awarded defensive end  Jason Babin  off waivers, a day after he
was released by the Philadelphia Eagles.  Babin, 32, made the Pro Bowl last season after recording 18
sacks for the Eagles. He had 5 1/2 sacks this season and was cut
following the teamâ€™s seventh straight loss to allow younger
defensive linemen to get more playing time.  Babin had signed a five-year, $28 million contract with the
Eagles in July 2011, according to ESPN. The Jaguars are 2-9 this
season and have allowed the second-most yards in the National
Football League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
