Oi SA (OIBR4) , Brazil’s third-largest
telecommunications company, affirmed 2012 earnings forecasts as
Treasurer Bayard Gontijo said the credit-rating reduction by
Moody’s Investors Service last month was unjustified.  The company’s leverage is within guidance provided to
investors, Gontijo, who is also the company’s director of
investor relations, said in telephone interview from New York.
Oi is comfortable with its current level of debt and doesn’t
foresee any challenges next year when it will move to refinance
less than 10 percent of its outstanding obligations, he said.  “Investors are still comfortable with the credit risk of
the company,” Gontijo said. “I do not see any reasons for any
kind of doubts or questions about the quality of the credit.”  Oi became  Brazil ’s third-largest mobile-phone provider by
revenue in the second quarter and retained that ranking in the
third quarter, according to a presentation to investors made
when the company announced its results for the three months
ended in September. Moody’s cited an increase in Oi’s gross
debt-to-earnings ratio over the past 2 1/2 years and regulators’
push for additional investment when it cut the company’s rating
to the lowest investment grade on Oct. 30. Moody’s assigned a
negative outlook to the rating.  Oi  forecasts  net revenue of 28.9 billion reais ($13.8
billion) this year and earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of 8.8 billion reais.  The company’s benchmark notes due 2022 fell 0.08 cent to
103.28 cents on the dollar at 5:48 p.m. in New York, pushing the
yield up one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.29
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares
have declined 26 percent this year in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
