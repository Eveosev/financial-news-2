Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  will cut
passenger capacity 1.6 percent next year, the first reduction
since 2009, as it contends with slowing international travel
demand and introduces smaller planes.  The  carrier  has already pared frequencies on some North
American and European routes, Finance Director Martin Murray
said in e-mailed reply to Bloomberg News questions today. It is
also retiring Boeing Co. 747-400s earlier than planned and
replacing them with 777-300ERs, he said.  The carrier is boosting its focus on short-haul routes and
premium-economy cabins as the global economic slowdown saps
demand for premium-class long-haul flights to cities including
New York. The airline also last week told  staff  it was stepping
up cost-cutting measures because of the inter-continental
slowdown, a cargo slump and higher fuel prices.  The long-haul capacity reduction “implies a lack of
confidence as well as a repositioning of the company’s
strategy,”  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. (UOBK)  analyst K. Ajith and
Eugene Ng said in a note today. “The focus towards short-haul
is fraught with risk, especially given that various low-cost
carriers have expanded in the region.”  Lower Estimates  Ajith and Ng cut their 2012 earnings estimate to a HK$425
million ($55 million) loss from a HK$329 million profit. The
airline lost HK$935 million in the first half. The  analysts 
lowered their target price to HK$12.60 from HK$12.80, while
keeping a sell rating.  The capacity cut is “a slight surprise,” Bank of
Communications Co. analyst Geoffrey Cheng said in a note. He cut
his earnings estimates and target price for the airline, while
maintaining neutral rate.  The  airline  rose 0.4 percent to HK$13.92 in Hong Kong
trading today, while the Hang Seng Index declined 0.6 percent.
Cathay has risen 4.5 percent this year,  trailing  an 18 percent
gain for the benchmark.  The carrier will boost cargo capacity 12 percent next year,
as it adds new  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-8 freighters. It received three of
the planes in October and two more will arrive next year, the
UOB-Kay analysts said. Cathay is beginning to see an upturn in
cargo, particularly in North America, and it will be able to
slow capacity growth if needed, they said.  On the passenger side, the airline will receive 14 new
wide-body planes next year while retiring six Boeing 747s.
Cathay faces the risk of making a loss from shedding the 747s,
Ajith and Ng said.  This year, the airline increased passenger capacity 4.1
percent through October. Its cargo capacity, as measured by
available ton kilometers, was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
