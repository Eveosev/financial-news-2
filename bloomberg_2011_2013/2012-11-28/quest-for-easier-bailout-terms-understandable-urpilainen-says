Ireland and  Portugal  would be
justified in seeking easier terms on their bailouts after
 Greece ’s borrowing costs were lowered and its loan maturities
extended, Finnish Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said.  “It’s understandable that they feel they should have this
help on equal terms,” Urpilainen told reporters in Helsinki
today. “If they make requests, we must consider them
separately.”  Euro-area finance ministers yesterday drew up a debt-relief
agreement for Greece that reduced the rates on bailout loans,
suspended interest payments for a decade, gave it more time to
repay and engineered a buyback of its bonds. The country was
also cleared to receive a 34.4 billion-euro ($44.7 billion) loan
installment next month.  The ministers from the 17 nations sharing the single
currency will meet again on Dec. 3 in Brussels before convening
with their counterparts from the 27-member European Union a day
later. National approvals for the Greek deal will take until
Dec. 13, the Finnish  Finance Ministry  said, according to a
statement handed out at today’s briefing.  “Other euro members can create the prerequisites for
Greece to pull out” of the crisis, Urpilainen said. “The rest
is up to Greece.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
