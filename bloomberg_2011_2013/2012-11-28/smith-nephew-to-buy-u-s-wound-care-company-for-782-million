     Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -–  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/) ,  Europe ’s biggest
maker of artificial hips and knees, agreed to buy closely held
 Healthpoint Biotherapeutics  for $782 million in cash to expand
offerings of wound-care treatments.  The acquisition of  Fort Worth , Texas-based Healthpoint will
enable Smith & Nephew to enter the $1 billion market for
“bioactive” wound healing, the London-based company said in a
statement today. Healthpoint will generate sales of about $190
million in 2012 and is growing at a “double-digit” percentage
rate, Smith & Nephew said.  “Strategically, it reinforces our advanced wound
management division by giving us a strong position in the fast-
growing area of bioactive wound care treatment,” Smith & Nephew
Chief Executive Officer Olivier Bohuon said in the statement.
“It brings material revenues from a fast-growing product range,
an attractive pipeline, and commercial and R&D capabilities upon
which we will build.”  The purchase will be “broadly” neutral to Smith &
Nephew’s adjusted earnings per share next year, and will add to
profit after that, the company said.  Healthpoint makes Santyl, an ointment to remove dead tissue
in wounds.  Deutsche Bank AG advised Smith & Nephew, and BofA Merrill
Lynch and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised Healthpoint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
