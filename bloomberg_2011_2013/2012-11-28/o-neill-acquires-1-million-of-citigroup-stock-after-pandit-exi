Citigroup Inc. (C)  Chairman  Michael O’Neill  acquired $1 million of the lender’s stock about a month
after the ouster of Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit.  O’Neill, 66, purchased 28,200 shares through a trust at an
average price of $35.52 each, the New York-based bank said today
in a regulatory filing. He owned 59,513 shares after the
transaction, including deferred stock tied to compensation, the
filing shows. Edward Skyler, a Citigroup spokesman, declined to
comment on the stock purchase.  The board of directors, which O’Neill has led since April,
ousted Pandit last month after concluding he mismanaged
operations, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.
Michael Corbat, 52, who succeeded Pandit, 55, is conducting a
review of how the company is run.  Citigroup, the third-biggest  U.S. bank ,  climbed  3 cents to
$35.07 in New York. The shares have  jumped  33 percent this year,
outpacing the 23 percent gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
