Mick Davis, chief executive officer
of  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , sold $10.7 million of option shares due to
expire in February after  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  won approval
from the European Union and shareholders to acquire the company.  Davis sold 661,590 shares at 10.22 pounds ($16.30) each on
Nov. 27, the biggest thermal coal exporter said in a statement
today. He paid 1.82 pounds apiece for the shares under an option
plan, granted in February 2003, Xstrata said. Davis made a
profit of 5.5 million pounds from the sale before U.K. tax.  Glencore, the world’s biggest publicly traded commodities
supplier, and Xstrata said last week they expect the plan to
create the fourth-largest mining company to be completed by year
end. Davis was prevented from exercising his options since
November 2011, according to the statement by Zug, Switzerland
based Xstrata.  “This prohibited period ended following the conclusion of
the Xstrata shareholder meetings on Tuesday, 20 November 2012
and the announcement by the European Commission on Thursday, 22
November 2012 that it has cleared under the E.U. Merger
Regulation the proposed acquisition of Xstrata by Glencore,”
Xstrata said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
