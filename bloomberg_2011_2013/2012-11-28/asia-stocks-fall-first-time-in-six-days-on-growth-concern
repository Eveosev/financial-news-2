Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
benchmark index headed for its first loss in six days, as the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said
failure to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff in the U.S. would
increase the risk of a global recession.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest iron ore
exporter, dropped 1.9 percent in Sydney, leading losses among
companies with earnings closely tied to economic growth.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , which gets about a quarter of its sales in the U.S., fell
2.1 percent.  Hulic Co. (3003)  tumbled 12 percent after the Japanese
real-estate operator said it plans a share sale.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.6 percent to 123.03 as
of 7:29 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two stocks falling for each
that rose. The gauge rose 13 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 through yesterday as central banks added stimulus to spur
growth and data showed a slowdown in China may be ending.  “Most investors are still cautious to bearish in terms of
their outlook, and certainly in terms of their positioning,”
said  Markus Rosgen , chief Asian strategist at Citigroup Inc. in
Hong Kong. “As far as the markets are concerned here in Asia,
increasingly people feel less about Greece and more about the
fiscal cliff.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.2 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.7 percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  slid 0.2 percent, the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.9
percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.6 percent.
Singapore’s Straits Times Index was little changed, while
Taiwan’s Taiex Index both rose less than 0.1 percent.  Budget Negotiations  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The  S&P 500  declined for a second day yesterday, losing
0.5 percent, as concern about progress in Washington budget
negotiations overshadowed a European agreement on aid for
indebted Greece and a better-than-forecast report on U.S.
durable goods.  As the administration of President  Barack Obama  prepares to
negotiate a budget agreement with Republicans in Congress, the
OECD urged “smooth” implementation of tax increases, spending
curbs and a higher debt ceiling in the medium term.  “If the fiscal cliff is not avoided, a large negative
shock could bring the U.S. and the global economy into
recession,” the Paris-based OECD said in its Economic Outlook
report released yesterday.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said that following a
Nov. 16 White House meeting, Republicans backed away from
earlier openness to considering new  tax revenue  as part of a
year-end deal to avert $607 billion in tax increases and
spending reductions set to begin in January, known as the fiscal
cliff.  Miners Fall  Miner  Rio Tinto  lost 1.9 percent to A$56.70 in Sydney,
while Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest
producer of the metal, slid 1.5 percent to HK$3.26 in  Hong Kong .
Copper prices in London fell for the first time in five days.
Raw-materials shares posted the largest decline among  10
industry groups  on the MSCI Asia Pacific index.  Exporters retreated. Komatsu, the world’s second-largest
maker of construction and mining equipment, slid 2.1 percent to
1,805 yen in Tokyo.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and
clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., retreated 0.5 percent to
HK$12.34 in Hong Kong. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer,
fired a supplier that made apparel at a Bangladesh factory where
more than 100 people died in the country’s deadliest ever blaze
at a garment facility.  Share Sale  Hulic slumped 12 percent to 571 yen in Tokyo after the
real-estate company said it will raise as much as 37 billion yen
($415 million) selling shares.  Japanese shippers fell after Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.,
Japan’s third-largest shipping company, said it will postpone an
expansion of its commodity-vessel fleet due to a global glut
cutting cargo rates. Kawasaki Kisen lost 4.6 percent to 103 yen,
Nippon Yusen K.K., the biggest, dropped 4.5 percent to 169 yen
and  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  declined 4.9 percent to 196 yen.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Ltd., a property company in the
southern Chinese city, rose 6 percent to HK$11.64 after Deutsche
Bank AG said the company is among its top picks.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  traded at 13.9 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.5 times for the  S&P 500 Index  and
12.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Trading volumes in Hong Kong and Japan were 12 percent and
7.5 percent respectively below the 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
