A Chinese village official accused
of accumulating personal assets of more than 2 billion  yuan 
($321 million) denied online reports that he had some 80 homes
and 20 cars, the official Xinhua News Agency said.  “Among the eight properties that were made public online,
five to six are mine,” Zhou Weisi said in an interview with
Xinhua published today. He acknowledged that he has more than 10
cars, including Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.  Zhou, a vice director in the Nanlian neighborhood of
Shenzhen’s Longgang district, was suspended and put under
 investigation yesterday , Xinhua reported. It said the suspension
came after reports of his wealth on the Internet “triggered
public outrage.”  Vice President  Xi Jinping  acknowledged the threat posed by
graft when he took over as head of  China ’s Communist Party
earlier this month, saying the party could “perish” unless
leaders address corruption and social unrest, according to
remarks reported by the People’s Daily newspaper.  Zhou, chairman of a trade and development company, said his
property was accumulated by his business, Xihnua reported. Phone
calls to the Longgang district supervisory bureau and the
Nanlian committee office went unanswered today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
