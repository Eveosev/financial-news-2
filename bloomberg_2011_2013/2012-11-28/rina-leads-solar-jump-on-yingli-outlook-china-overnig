Chinese solar stocks climbed in  New
York  after  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  said it expects panel
sales to surge this year on the back of rising domestic demand.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-largest maker of solar
panels, drove gains in the  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of
the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S., which added 0.5
percent to 91.93 yesterday, after falling in the previous two
days. Yingli, whose chief executive officer said yesterday that
it will become the world’s biggest panel supplier in 2012,
gained the most in nine months.  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU)  sank to the
lowest level since Sept. 6 as analysts  predict  the online video
company will post an eighth quarterly loss in results due today.  Chinese solar companies have reported losses since the
second quarter of 2011 as the industry was plagued by
overcapacity and as  Europe ’s debt crisis prompted governments to
trim or eradicate subsidies for alternative energy. Yingli’s
panel shipments this year will rise by as much as 37 percent
from 2011, the company said in a statement yesterday, as CEO
Miao Liansheng said demand in  China  is “growing rapidly.”  “Trina and Yingli appear to be the biggest survivors
because they have the lowest costs than some other brands in the
industry,” Aaron Chew, a senior analyst at Maxim Group LLC,
which rates both stocks hold, said by phone in New York
yesterday. “These two still have several hundred-million
dollars of cash, and even though they are burning a lot of
capital, they have years before they have to face the music.”  China ETF Rises  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S. was little changed at a four-
day low of $36.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8
percent to 1,409.93 after comments by Speaker of the U.S. House
of Representatives John Boehner and President  Barack Obama 
fueled speculation an agreement can be reached over the budget
impasse.  The China-US measure defied declines in mainland stocks,
with the  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index of domestic shares slipping
0.9 percent to 1,973.52 yesterday, the lowest level since Jan.
16, 2009.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  fell 1.2
percent to 10,399.16 in the steepest decline since Nov. 15.  Trina, based in Changzhou, China, surged 21 percent to
$2.81, the biggest advance in 10 months. Trading volumes were
almost four times the three-month daily average, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The company had $600 million of cash and cash equivalents
as of Sept. 30,  according to  a Nov. 20 earnings statement. Trina
reported a fifth consecutive net loss for the quarter ended in
September and cut its 2012 shipment forecast to as low as 1.55
gigawatts from a previous target of at least 1.75 gigawatts.  ‘Best Balance Sheet’  Trina “has the best balance sheet among all of the Chinese
peers and they can hold their breath longer,” Maxim’s Chew
said.  Yingli, China’s fourth-largest solar producer, surged 13
percent to $1.62, the steepest rally since Feb. 9, after it
reported net revenue of $355.9 million for the third quarter,
compared to the median analyst estimate of $353.9 million.  The Baoding, China-based company’s Yingli Green Energy
Americas unit will provide 200 megawatts of solar modules to LS
Power Group’s Centinela solar energy facility, scheduled for
commercial operation in mid-2014, according to a Nov. 27
statement. LS Power is a developer of power generation and
transmission projects.  LDK, Suntech  JA Solar Holdings Co. jumped 7.7 percent to 70 cents
yesterday in New York after reporting a wider-than-estimated net
loss of 30 cents per ADR for the period from July to September.
Quarterly sales for the Shanghai-based maker of solar cells were
$260.9 million,  beating  the mean estimate of $230.4 million.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  climbed 10 percent to $1.07, the highest
close in two weeks. Jiangsu, China-based  Suntech Power Holdings
Ltd. (STP) , the world’s largest solar-panel maker, gained 3.7 percent
to 89 cents, the biggest advance since Nov. 12.  Focus Media Holdings Ltd., a Chinese digital advertising
company, rose 3.2 percent to $24.53 in New York, gaining for the
first time in three days.  The company said after U.S. markets closed on Nov. 27 that
third-quarter adjusted net income was $94.6 million, or 71 cents
per ADR, exceeding the 70-cent average of analysts’ estimates.
Focus Media said fourth-quarter adjusted net income will be
between $93 million and $98 million.  Youku Tudou  American depositary receipts of Youku Tudou dropped 2.8
percent to $16.73, the lowest level since Sept. 6. The Beijing-
based company, which completed a merger with smaller competitor
Tudou in August, owns China’s most-popular video websites.  Youku Tudou may report an  adjusted net loss  of 46 million
 yuan  ($7.4 million) for the third quarter after markets close
today, according to the average of five analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the eighth quarter of
losses since Youku Tudou’s initial public offering in December
2010. It posted a loss of 29.3 million yuan in the three months
to June 30.  Thirty-day volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US gauge
dropped to 19.67 yesterday, from 19.89 on Nov. 27 and compared
with this year’s average of 22.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
