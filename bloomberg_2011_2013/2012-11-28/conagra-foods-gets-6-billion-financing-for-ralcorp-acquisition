ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) , a maker of
packaged foods, obtained $6 billion of financing commitments to
help pay for its purchase of  Ralcorp (RAH)  Holdings Inc.  Bank of America Corp. has committed $4.5 billion in bridge
financing and a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan,
according to a regulatory filing today.  ConAgra, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has agreed to buy
Ralcorp for $5 billion. The deal is valued at about $6.8
billion, including debt, the companies said yesterday in a joint
statement distributed by Business Wire.  ConAgra said in the regulatory filing that it may issue
other long-term debt or equity, or combination of both, to
reduce borrowings under the bridge by the time the merger is
completed.  Bridge loans usually mature in one year and are often used
as backstops to bond offerings or longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
