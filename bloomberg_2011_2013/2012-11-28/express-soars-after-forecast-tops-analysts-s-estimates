Express Inc. (EXPR)  gained the most in more
than a year after the clothing retailer’s lowered annual profit
forecast topped analysts’ estimates.  The shares advanced 8.9 percent to $14.15 at the close in
New York, for the biggest one-day increase since September 2011.
The  stock  has dropped 29 percent this year, while the Russell
2000 Index is up 9.8 percent.  Full-year profit excluding certain items will be $1.47 to
$1.53, down from a prior forecast of $1.69 to $1.79, according
to a statement from the Columbus, Ohio-based operator of more
than 600 stores. The average of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was $1.40.  Express has changed its sweater offerings and set a clearer
pricing strategy after what it called a disappointing third
quarter. The company said that an improvement in communicating
promotions to customers contributed to a record performance on
Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and
the unofficial start to the  holiday shopping season .  “We remain cautious on the overall performance of the
fourth quarter given that the majority of the holiday season
lies ahead,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Weiss
said in the statement.  The company reported a 5 percent decline in same-store
sales in the third quarter ended Oct. 27 and said it expects
such sales to fall in the “low single digits” in 2012,
compared with a 6 percent increase in 2011.  Same-store sales are based on stores open at least a year.  Options Trading  Option traders are anticipating lower volatility in
Express’s share price than they were at the beginning of the
month. The company’s three-month implied volatility, one measure
of potential future price swings, has declined about 25 percent
since reaching 69 on Nov. 5. That was the highest reading in at
least 2 1/2 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO)  rose the most in six months
after the teen-apparel chain boosted its annual profit forecast
and reported a 10 percent increase in same-store sales for its
fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 27.  The stock gained 7.1 percent to $20.77, the most since
May 21. Shares of the Pittsburgh-based operator of more than
1,000 stores in  North America  have gained 36 percent this year.  American Eagle’s three-month implied volatility has dropped
about 15 percent since Nov. 15, when it reached 40. That was the
highest since Aug. 10.  Full-year earnings excluding some items will be $1.38 to
$1.40,  compared  with a prior forecast of $1.33 to $1.36, the
company said in a statement. The average of analysts’ estimates
was $1.37.  Momentum in the third quarter carried “into the fourth
quarter and record results over Thanksgiving weekend,” CEO
Robert Hanson said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
