U.S. ethanol production fell to a
five-week low last week, an Energy Department report showed.  Output dropped 1 percent in the seven days ended Nov. 23 to
803,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since Oct. 19. It was
the third consecutive decline. Stockpiles slid 3.1 percent to
18.3 million barrels.  Imports surged to 27,000 barrels a day from 6,000 the
previous week, the department said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, a seven-week high.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 0.7 cent to
$2.445 a gallon at 11:26 a.m.  New York  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The futures are up 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
