Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
biggest drugmaker, rebounded from the lowest level in almost six
months after its U.S. partner,  Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) , applied
to register a drug discovered by Richter.  The shares rose 0.3 percent to 35,665 forint, paring its
decline this month to 12 percent. The benchmark BUX stock index
in which Richter has a 19 percent weighting fell 1 percent
today.  Forest submitted a new drug application to the U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration  for cariprazine for the treatment of
schizophrenia, Richter said in a statement to the Budapest Stock
Exchange today.  The application to register Cariprazine is “positive” as
it will soothe concerns on potential delays for the drug’s
launch, Gergely Gabler, a Budapest-based analyst at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote today.  Equilor today started coverage of Richter at buy rating and
a 12-month price target of 44,900 forint, according to a
separate research report.  Richter plunged 6.1 percent in the past four sessions as it
is the only Hungarian stock to be removed from the MSCI Inc.’s
 Hungary  Index as part of a semi-annual review of the gauge’s
members, effective Nov. 30, according to a statement on MSCI’s
website on Nov. 14. The shares have retreated 12 percent since
the announcement.  “We expect the selling pressure to ease in the coming days
as we believe that market participants have almost completed
portfolio rebalancing,” Gabler wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
