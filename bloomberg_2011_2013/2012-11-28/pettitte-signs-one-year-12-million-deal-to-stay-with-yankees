Pitcher  Andy Pettitte  signed a $12
million deal to remain with the  New York Yankees  in 2013,
according to his agent.  Pettitte, a 40-year-old left-hander, will rejoin the
Yankees for his 18th Major League Baseball season, the team
announced yesterday in an e-mail. The club didn’t release
financial details.  The contract contains the salary plus $2.5 million in
potential awards bonuses, Pettitte’s agent, Jim Murray of Excel
Sports Management, said in a telephone interview.  Pettitte, who retired for the 2011 season, returned this
year and went 5-4 with a 2.87 earned run average in 12 starts,
pitching his first game on May 13 and missing more than two
months of the campaign after being hit on the ankle by a ball in
late June.  Other than a 2004-06 stint with the  Houston Astros ,
Pettitte has played his entire career in New York, posting a
245-142 record with a 3.86 ERA. His win total is 51st on the MLB
career list and second among active pitchers behind 50-year-old
 Jamie Moyer , who has 269.  The Yankees remain in negotiations with 43-year-old relief
pitcher  Mariano Rivera , whose 608 saves are the most in major
league history, according to the New York Post. Rivera missed
most of last season after tearing a knee ligament while catching
fly balls before a May game. He hinted during spring training
that the season might be his last, then vowed to return after
the injury.  The Yankees last week re-signed 37-year-old pitcher Hiroki Kuroda to a one-year contract.  To contact the reporters on this story:
