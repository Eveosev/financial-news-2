Gasoline in the  New York  Harbor and
 Gulf Coast  declined as U.S. inventories rose by the most since
July, with the East Coast leading the gain.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the U.S. added 3.9 million
barrels to 204.3 million in the week ended Nov. 23, the biggest
increase since July 20, the Energy Department reported today.
Supplies were forecast to add 900,000 barrels, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Inventories on the East Coast, which grew for a  second
week , are at the lowest seasonal level since at least 2003,
according to department data compiled by Bloomberg. Stockpiles
grew by 1.25 million barrels to 47.4 million, the biggest
advance in a month and the largest in the five regions.  Reformulated gasoline  to be blended with ethanol in the New
York Harbor declined by 0.5 cent to 5 cents above futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:20 p.m.  Conventional gasoline 
on the Gulf Coast fell 0.75 cent to a discount of 18.25 cents.  Motor gasoline inventories on the U.S. Gulf Coast increased
by 902,000 barrels to  74.8 million . Distillate supplies fell
2.06 million to 34.9 million, the biggest drop since April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
