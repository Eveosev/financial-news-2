Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest
lender, was sued by a trustee over claims that some securities
sold by a unit of the bank were backed by home-mortgage loans
taken out by fraudulent borrowers.  DB Structured Products Inc.’s pool of more than 1,500
mortgages included more than 320 that were defective,  HSBC Bank
USA (HSBA) , acting as trustee, said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan.  “Borrowers lied, with or without the knowledge of the loan
originators themselves, concerning how much money they owed, how
much money they made, whether and where they worked, and where
they lived,” HSBC claimed. “A handful of instances of such
inaccuracies is perhaps to be expected. Hundreds of instances of
borrower dishonesty is not.”  HSBC seeks unspecified damages and said Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank must buy back the breaching loans under its
agreements with the trustee.  Duncan King , a Deutsche Bank spokesman in  New York , didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message left after regular
business hours yesterday.  The case is Deutsche Alt-A Securities Mortgage Loan Trust
v. DB Structured Products Inc., 12-cv-8594, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
