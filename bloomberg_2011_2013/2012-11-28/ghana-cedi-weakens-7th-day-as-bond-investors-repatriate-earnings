Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a seventh
day, the longest losing streak in more than eight months, as
bond investors bought dollars to transfer coupon payments.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9075 a dollar as of 1:21 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level will be the lowest
since Sept. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are seeing depreciation today on some bond coupon
payments that offshore guys are trying to repatriate,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank
Ltd., said by phone today. “Dollar sales were just adequate to
meet the normal daily demand that we get on the market.”  The cedi has depreciated 14 percent against the dollar this
year, the third-worst performing African currency, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
