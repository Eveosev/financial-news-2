Ed Miliband called on his U.K.
opposition Labour Party to hold a special conference early next
year to approve new rules on union affiliation, part of a drive
to distance the party from organized labor.  Police are investigating whether Unite, Britain’s largest
labor union, tried to fix the selection of a Labour candidate
for Parliament. The party leader is seeking to use the crisis,
which caused the resignation of his campaigns chief, Tom Watson,
to loosen links with unions, which currently provide the bulk of
its funding.  Miliband proposed earlier this month that, rather than
every union member being automatically affiliated to Labour
unless they opt out, individuals should have to opt in to
supporting the party. That would give Labour access to their
contact details, information unions currently refuse to share.
Miliband said he wants his party to ratify his plans at the
conference.  “The changes we are embarked upon are about this -- about
rooting our party in every part of Britain, including the
workplaces of Britain,” Miliband said in a speech in  London 
today, according to extracts published by his office. “We want
to open up our policy making, clean up the lobbying industry and
take the big money out of politics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
