West Texas Intermediate fell from a
16-month high as an unexpected drop in purchases of existing
homes and weaker-than-expected corporate earnings raised concern
that the  U.S. economy  will stall, curbing fuel demand growth.  Prices slid 1.1 percent as  sales  of previously owned houses
fell 1.2 percent to a 5.08 million annualized rate in June, the
National Association of Realtors said. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a 5.26 million pace.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) ’s
second-quarter  profit  and revenue trailed analysts’ estimates.
WTI’s 14-day relative strength index fell below 70 for the first
time in 21 days, and WTI’s discount to Brent widened.  “The market is falling off and the data isn’t
supportive,” said  Kyle Cooper , Houston-based director of
commodities research at IAF Advisors. “Earnings are going to be
important for oil. Prices are overvalued. I don’t think it
should be above $100.”  WTI for August delivery, which expired today, slid $1.14 to
settle at $106.91 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The volume of all futures traded was 1.8 percent below the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:20 p.m. The contract
settled at $108.05 July 19, the most since March 2012. The more
actively traded September futures were down 93 cents at $106.94.  WTI-Brent  Brent for September settlement gained 8 cents to end the
session at $108.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 20 percent below 100-day average.
The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI widened to $1.21
from 20 cents on July 19. The gap reached $23.44 a barrel in
February. WTI rose to 8 cents above Brent in intraday trading.  The number of houses for sale at the end of last month was
the fewest for any June since 2001 as rising prices depleted the
number of cheaper houses on the market.  The U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country,
accounted for about a fifth of world’s consumption in 2012,
according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant chain, fell the
most in nine months on the earnings. The company has faced a
U.S. consumer environment where  unemployment  has been stuck
above 7.5 percent since December 2008. McDonald’s said economic
weakness would hurt results for the remainder of the year.  “Worse-than-expected earnings are raising economic
concerns and demand worries,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Fuel Demand  Gasoline  consumption  in the U.S. dropped 6.1 percent in the
week ended July 12 to 8.73 million barrels a day, the Energy
Information Administration said on July 17.  Total petroleum use fell in June to the lowest level for
the month in 16 years, the  American Petroleum Institute  said on
July 18. Petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, dropped 1
percent from a year earlier to 18.7 million barrels a day, the
least for the month since 1997, the industry-funded API said.  WTI’s 14-day relative strength index had been above 70 for
11 days through July 19, the longest stretch since 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some traders see a
reading above 70 as a sell signal. The index fell to 68.9 today.  Oil climbed earlier after finance ministers from Group of
20 nations said they will pursue “carefully calibrated and
clearly communicated” policy moves so that the U.S. and  Japan 
don’t cause cross-border damage when they start rolling back
stimulus. The statement followed a two-day meeting in Moscow.  G-20 Statement  “One of the supportive elements that we have is the G-20
and their statement about the economy,” Flynn said.  The G-20 heeded calls from emerging-market countries to
guard against shockwaves when U.S. growth is secure enough for
the  Federal Reserve  to cut back on its bond buying, according to
the statement.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  opened the door to a delay in
reducing the central bank’s bond-buying program on July 18,
saying in his semiannual testimony to Congress last week that it
will depend on data that economists say are falling short of the
Fed’s own forecasts. The Fed’s $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases “are by no means on a preset course,” he said.  Money managers increased net-long positions on WTI, or
wagers that prices will climb, by 8 percent to 304,383 futures
and options combined in the seven days ended July 16, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly report
on July 19. That’s the highest level since April 2011.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 22.2 percent, compared with 21.5 percent on July
19, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 538,539
contracts as of 3:20 p.m. It totaled 801,653 contracts July 19,
22 percent above the three-month average. Open interest was 1.85
million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
