Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) ,  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD) ’s African mobile-phone operator, agreed to sell 1,149 phone
towers in Tanzania to an infrastructure company backed by
investors including  George Soros .  The wireless carrier, South Africa’s largest, will obtain a
24.5 percent stake in the tower company, Helios Towers Tanzania,
as part of the deal, according to a statement from Helios today.
No financial details were disclosed. Helios Towers Tanzania is a
unit of Helios Towers Africa.  Infrastructure disposals can help wireless carriers reduce
costs and focus on customer services and marketing.
Johannesburg-based Vodacom, seeking to boost earnings as revenue
from domestic voice connections falls, will lease back the
towers from Helios.  The deal expands Helios’s network to 4,700 towers across
the continent and more than doubles its presence in Tanzania.
Investors in  Helios Towers Africa  include billionaire Soros’s
Quantum Strategic Partners, Albright Capital Management LLC, RIT
Capital Partners Plc and International Finance Corp.  The agreement is valued at about $75 million, the Financial
Times reported today, without saying where it got the
