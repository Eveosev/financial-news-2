The  United Arab Emirates , the
second-largest economy in the  Middle East , fought off a series
of cyber-attacks later traced to Egypt.  The July 19 attacks targeted governmental websites, the
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said today in a
 statement  on it website. The country’s computer emergency
response team managed to neutralize the danger and fix the
problem with “minimal damage caused,” it said. The targeted
sites were not identified in the statement.  The U.A.E. and other Gulf countries, including  Saudi
Arabia , are increasing efforts to defend against cyber attacks
after a series of network infiltrations. Saudi Arabia in
December blamed unidentified people based outside the kingdom
for a cyber-attack against state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
aimed at disrupting production from the world’s largest exporter
of crude oil.  “We confirmed that the attempts started in  Egypt  and
acting accordingly, we contacted the concerned authorities in
Egypt to coordinate our efforts on this matter,”  Mohamed al-Ghanim , the director general of the authority, said in the
statement. “We agreed to provide the Egyptian authorities with
a list of IPs which started the attack.”  The U.A.E. pledged $3 billion in aid to Egypt after the
country’s military deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi on
July 3. The U.A.E. has cracked down on its own Islamist groups,
sentencing 69 people to jail for establishing secret cells to
seize power, according to a federal court judgment cited by the
state-run news agency WAM on July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
