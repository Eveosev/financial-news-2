Swiss stocks  were little changed,
after the benchmark Swiss Market Index declined last week, as
 UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  advanced.  UBS added 3.4 percent after Switzerland’s largest bank said
that profit probably increased in its second quarter. Julius
Baer rose 5.5 percent after posting a first-half profit.  The  SMI (SMI)  climbed 0.1 percent to 7,933.83 at 10:01 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark retreated 0.7 percent last week as
a report showed German investor confidence unexpectedly
declined. The broader Swiss Performance Index also gained 0.1
percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 79 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A report at 10 a.m. New York time may show  U.S. house sales 
climbed in June to the highest level since November 2009. Sales
of previously owned properties rose to a 5.25 million annualized
pace from 5.18 million in May, according to the  median forecast 
of 65 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  UBS gained 3.4 percent to 18.20 Swiss francs, its highest
price since March 2011, after reporting second-quarter net
income of 690 million Swiss francs ($734 million) in preliminary
results. The lender also said it reached an agreement in
principle with the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency to settle
claims related to residential mortgage-backed security offerings
from 2004 to 2007. UBS publishes its full results for the  second
quarter  on July 30.  Julius Baer  soared 5.5 percent to 41.98 francs even after
posting a 30 percent drop in first-half profit. Switzerland’s
third-biggest wealth manager said  net income  fell to 114 million
francs as it raised the estimate of the cost of integrating the
Merrill Lynch businesses acquired from Bank of America Corp.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-largest bank,
added 1.7 percent to 28.39 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
