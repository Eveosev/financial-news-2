Agroton Public Ltd. bonds and shares
declined as Standard & Poors cut the company’s debt rating to
“selective default” after the Ukrainian farming and food
production firm failed to pay interest on its debt.  The yield on $50 million of bonds due July 2014 jumped 27
basis points to 77.87 percent at 1:29 p.m. in Warsaw, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Warsaw-listed  shares  dropped 1.2
percent to 1.61 zloty after falling 33 percent last week. That
compares with an initial public offering price of  27 zloty  in
November 2010.  The Luhansk, Ukraine-based producer, said in a July 16
filing that it is unable to pay coupon as it cannot withdraw
cash from its account with the Bank of Cyprus. S&P cut Agroton
to “selective default” from CCC, and withdrew the ratings “at
the issuer’s request,” it said in a statement after markets
closed on July 19.  “Agroton’s decision not to pay the interest on the 2014
notes follows further deterioration in the company’s operating
environment in 2013,” Anton Geyze, a credit analyst at S&P in
Moscow, said in a statement on July 19. “We continue to believe
that Agroton’s information flow and transparency remain subpar,
and we assess company’s management and corporate governance as
‘weak’ under our criteria.”  Agroton proposed on July 17 to extend the bond’s maturity
to 2019, postpone the coupon payment and cut it to 8 percent
from 12.5 percent. The bondholders will vote on the proposals on
Aug. 8. Fitch Ratings downgraded Agroton on July 17 to C from
CCC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
