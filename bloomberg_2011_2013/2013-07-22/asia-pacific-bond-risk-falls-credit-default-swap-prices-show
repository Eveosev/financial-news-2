The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 128 basis points
as of 9:07 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
benchmark has plunged 24.4 basis points this month, according to
Deutsche Bank and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2 basis points to 90.5
basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The benchmark is set for the lowest close since May
28, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 4 basis points
to 115 basis points as of 9:43 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The gauge has fallen 34.5
points from its highest level this year reached on June 24,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
