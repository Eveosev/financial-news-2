Barclays Plc (BARC)  gained regulatory
approval to merge its African operations with  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ,
the South African bank in which it owns a controlling stake.  Absa will begin trading under Barclays Africa Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg on Aug. 2 after regulators in countries including
Kenya, Botswana and Ghana approved or waived the deal, the bank
said today in a statement. The lender will retain the Absa name
in South Africa.  “Africa remains a core focus for growth in Barclays’s
global strategy,”  Maria Ramos , Absa’s chief executive officer,
said on a conference call with reporters. “This is very much
part of fulfilling on that mandate.”  Barclays, Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets, and Absa
announced the transaction in December and had to delay an
earlier to plan to complete it in the first half of the year
because of regulatory delays. Barclays will increase its stake
in Absa to 62.3 percent from 55.5 percent in return for merging
its operations across Africa with the Johannesburg-based lender.  The shares received by Barclays will be worth about 18.3
billion rand ($1.9 billion), the companies said in December.
Barclays’s businesses in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius,
Seychelles, Tanzania,  Uganda  and Zambia and its Barclays Africa
regional office will move to Absa as part of the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
