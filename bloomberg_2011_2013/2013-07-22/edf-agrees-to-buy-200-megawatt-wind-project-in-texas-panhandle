The U.S. unit of French utility
 Electricite de France SA  agreed to buy a 200-megawatt wind
project in the Texas Panhandle. Terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  Construction on the Hereford Wind Project is expected to
begin this year about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of
Lubbock, according to a statement today from San Diego-based EDF
Renewable Energy.  Starting construction in 2013 will qualify the project for
the production tax credit for power produced from clean sources,
which was renewed for one year on Jan. 1.  EDF also has an option to acquire additional phases of the
project, which may eventually expand to 500 megawatts. Chicago-based  Lincoln Renewable Energy LLC  is developing the wind farm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
