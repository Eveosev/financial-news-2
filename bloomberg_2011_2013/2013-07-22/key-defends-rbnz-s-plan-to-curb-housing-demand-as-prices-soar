New Zealand ’s central bank is right
to consider new tools to curb housing demand, including limits
on low-deposit mortgages, Prime Minister John Key said.  “All tools have to be considered,” Key said in notes for
a speech in Hamilton today. “Absent of any other alternative,
then rapidly increasing  house prices  may see the  Reserve Bank 
raising interest rates.”  Limiting lending on deposits of as little as 5 percent of
the purchase price will hurt first-home buyers, who are
struggling to save bigger downpayments as New Zealand house-price inflation accelerates. Prices rose 7.6 percent in June
from a year earlier, the fastest gain since early 2008,
according to Quotable Value New Zealand.  “Higher  interest rates  would put upwards pressure on the
Kiwi dollar, which would hurt exporters,” Key said. And higher
borrowing costs are “certainly not in the best interests of
first-home buyers,” he said.  Key has previously said the central bank should consider
exemptions for first-home buyers. Even with limits on high loan-to-value ratios introduced, “ interest rates  may ultimately rise
anyway,” he said.  More New Zealanders can afford a house if economic
fundamentals are right, people can get a job, and interest rates
are affordable, Key said.  “This is a debate about getting the balance right between
ensuring people have the opportunity to buy a home, and ensuring
we don’t have problems with the banking system, with all the
negative economic impacts that would entail,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
