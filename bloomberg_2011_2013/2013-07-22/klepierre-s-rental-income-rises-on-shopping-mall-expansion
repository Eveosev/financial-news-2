Klepierre SA (LI) , Europe’s second-largest publicly traded mall operator, said first-half rental
income rose 2.8 percent after it opened two shopping centers and
extended three others.  Pretax earnings excluding one-time charges, known as net
current  cash flow , increased to 1.02 euros a share from 99 cents
a year earlier, the Paris-based company said in a statement
after the market closed today. The landlord is about 29 percent
owned by  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG)  and has a market value of
about 6.6 billion euros ($8.7 billion).  Klepierre said it’s on target to raise 1 billion euros from
asset sales by the end of 2013 after reaching agreements to sell
more than 201 million euros of real estate from January. It has
sold 900 million euros of real estate since the start of 2012
and plans to dispose of more office properties as it focuses on
shopping malls.  “Despite a sluggish consumption environment and
exceptionally unfavorable weather conditions,” sales by the
company’s retail clients were unchanged in the six months
through June from a year earlier, the company said.  Net asset value fell to 32.4 euros a share from 34 euros at
the end of last year, according to the statement. Total revenue
increased 2.1 percent to 546 million euros. Shopping center
revenue was up 4.1 percent. Total rental income climbed to about
500 million euros from 486.1 million euros a year earlier.  The company manages or owns properties valued at about 16.2
billion euros. Klepierre is up about 10.6 percent this year
compared with an 8.3 percent rise in the value of the FTSE EPRA
 Europe  REITs Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
