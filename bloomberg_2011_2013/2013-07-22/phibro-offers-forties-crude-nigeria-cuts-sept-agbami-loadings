Total SA failed to buy North Sea
Forties crude while Phibro, a unit of Occidental Petroleum
Corp., didn’t manage to sell the same cargo of the blend it
offered on Friday.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, will export seven
cargoes of Agbami grade in September, one less than in August,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.
Shipping schedule for Bonny Light hasn’t been issued yet.  North Sea  Total didn’t manage to buy Forties for loading from Aug. 13
to Aug. 17 at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window.  Phibro failed to sell cargo F0803 for Aug. 13 to Aug. 15 at
85 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed. The company
offered the same cargo on July 19 at an 80-cent premium.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $107.85 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.38 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $106.95 at the same time today, a discount of 90
cents to September.  The Dunlin Alpha host production facility is scheduled for
a 45-day halt from Aug. 25, said John Wiseman, general manager
of Fairfield Energy’s Dunlin Area, in an emailed response to
questions today. The scheduled maintenance will take
approximately 12,000 barrels a day of production offline.  Crude from the area feeds into the Brent stream. The
shutdown is scheduled alongside maintenance at Abu Dhabi
National Energy Co.’s North Cormorant and Eider fields, which
feed about 11,000 barrels a day into the Brent blend.  Mediterranean/Urals  Petraco SpA was bidding for 80,000 metric tons of Urals at
85 cents a barrel above Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.  Eni SpA failed to sell CPC Blend at a premium of 85 cents
to Dated Brent for loading Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 also from Augusta.
The cargo’s volume is 85,000 metric tons.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold two 100,000 ton cargoes of Urals
crude for loading from Primorsk. Eni bought one cargo for Aug. 6
to Aug. 7 loading and BP Plc bought the Aug. 8 Aug. 9 lot,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The
cargoes were said to have sold at a premium of about 50 to 55
cents to Dated Brent, two of them said.  West Africa  Nigeria plans to export five cargoes Brass River, four Akpo
and Usan, three cargoes of  Escravos, Amenam, Antan and Erha,
two cargoes of Okono and Yoho and one each of Abo, Okwori and
Pennington in September, according to loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News. Cargo sizes range from 250,000 barrels to 1
million barrels.  September shipments of  Chad ’s Doba crude will fall to two
cargoes, one less than Aug., a loading program shows. The
cargoes are 950,000 barrels each.  To contact the reporters on this story:
