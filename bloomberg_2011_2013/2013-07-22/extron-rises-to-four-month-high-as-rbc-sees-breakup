Textron Inc. (TXT)  rose to a three-month
high after Royal Bank of Canada said the maker of aircraft, golf
carts and auto parts is a potential breakup target for activist
investors.  The  shares  climbed 1.5 percent to $28.96 at 4:03 p.m. in
New York, the highest closing price since April 16. Textron has
gained 17 percent this year, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 19 percent.  Textron may be worth $42 a share in a breakup, 45 percent
more than today’s close, Robert Stallard, an RBC analyst in New
York, wrote in a note today. Activist investors have pressured
industrial companies such as Ingersoll-Rand Plc, pushed by Trian
Fund Management LP’s  Nelson Peltz  to spin off its security unit,
and Timken Co., which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to assess
options for its steel division after Ralph Whitworth’s
Relational Investors LLC backed a split.  “Activist investing is on the increase,” Stallard, who
rates Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron outperform, said in
the note. “We think Textron looks a far more viable candidate
for restructuring than some other public companies.”  Textron’s four industrial divisions, which represented
24 percent of sales last year, could attract buyers from  Stanley
Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  to Deere & Co., he said. For aircraft units
Bell Helicopter and Cessna, which accounted for 60 percent of
 revenue , potential acquirers include Boeing Co. and General
Dynamics Corp., according to the note.  Textron had no comment on the RBC note, Dave Sylvestre, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
