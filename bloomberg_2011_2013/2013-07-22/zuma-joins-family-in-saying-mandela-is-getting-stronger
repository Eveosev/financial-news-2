Nelson Mandela ’s health is improving
and he’s getting stronger after spending more than six weeks in
the hospital to treat a recurring lung infection, according to
the government and his family.  Mandela is getting “stronger and stronger everyday,”
Mandla, his grandson, said in an e-mailed statement today.
“Former President Mandela is still in a critical condition in
hospital but shows sustained improvement,” President  Jacob Zuma  
said in a separate statement after visiting him.  Mandela turned 95 last week in a Pretoria hospital where he
has been treated since June 8. The former president spent 27
years in prison for his opposition to white, minority rule,
including 18 years on Robben Island where he contracted
tuberculosis. This is his fourth, and longest, stay in the
hospital since December.  Mandela won the Nobel Peace prize in 1993 and became the
nation’s first black president a year later when his  African
National Congress  won elections. He stepped down in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
