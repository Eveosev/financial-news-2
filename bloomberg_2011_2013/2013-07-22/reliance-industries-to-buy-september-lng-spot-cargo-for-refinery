Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  is seeking
to buy a spot cargo of liquefied natural gas for delivery in
early September at India’s Hazira terminal, said a company
official.  The operator of the world’s biggest oil refinery complex
will buy the shipment for delivery between Sept. 1 to Sept. 4
for use as feedstock at its Jamnagar refinery and power
generators, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  The company’s price target for the LNG cargo is $14.50 per
million British thermal units and it has contacted a few
suppliers for offers, the official said.  The 5 million ton-a-year  Hazira  terminal is owned by  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Total SA. (FP)  Reliance, which imports spot LNG
via Hazira, has no long-term supply contracts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
