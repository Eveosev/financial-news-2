MultiPlan Inc. sold $750 million of
bonds that allow the health-care cost-management company
acquired by BC Partners Ltd. and Silver Lake in 2010 to pay
interest with extra debt.  MultiPlan issued so-called payment-in-kind notes due 2018
with an 8.375 percent coupon through its MPH Intermediate
Holding unit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds
yield 707 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
and the coupon would increase by 75 basis points if paid with
additional debt, the data show.  The notes, along with a $100 million addition to a term
loan, will help fund a shareholder payout, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be
identified, citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. The
bonds are ranked CCC+ by Standard & Poorâ€™s.  The securities add to the $6.52 billion of similar-type
debt already sold in dollars this year, on pace to exceed the
$8.1 billion of such bonds issued in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg based on debt with a composite credit
rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
