Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said he will testify in parliament to address allegations he
accepted illegal payments from a party slush fund.  Rajoy will appear by the end of this month or the beginning
of August, he said at a press conference in Madrid today. The
ruling  People’s Party  has been using its majority to block
opposition requests for Rajoy to answer questions since El Mundo
newspaper reported the allegations earlier this month.  El Mundo reignited debate over payments to PP officials,
publishing photographs of a handwritten ledger provided by the
party’s former treasurer, Luis Barcenas, which it said showed
payments to the premier. Rajoy allegedly received illegal
bonuses while serving as a minister between 1997 and 1999, the
newspaper said at that time. He has denied the reports.  “This is the right moment for me to clear up some doubts
that many citizens have,” Rajoy told reporters. “I want to
give my version in the parliament.”  Opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said last week
he’ll propose a no-confidence vote should Rajoy refuse to appear
before the chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
