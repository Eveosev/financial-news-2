Wild cousins of 32 crops including
wheat and sugarcane could add as much in $196 billion of value
at the farm-gate level by boosting yields and resilience,
according to research by PWC for Kew Royal Botanic Gardens.  The current value to farm crops from higher productivity
and disease and stress resistance derived from wild relatives is
now estimated at $42 billion for 29 of the world’s most
important food crops and $68 billion when corn, soybeans and
sugarcane are included, PWC wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Kew has set up the Millennium Seed Bank partnership to
prepare for future climate change, and aims to store seed from
25 percent of the world’s plants suitable for saving by 2020.
Between 60,000 to 100,000 plant species face a threat of
extinction, according to Kew.  “Adapting agriculture to climate change is one of the most
urgent challenges of our time,” Ruth Eastwood, coordinator for
Kew’s Crop Wild Relatives Project, was cited as saying in the
statement. “Crop wild relatives are already being used to make
improvements to our food crops right now, but they are
underutilized.”  The current value of wild crop relatives was derived from
the economic benefit over the useful economic life cycle of
traits in farm crops, according to PWC. Potential value is
derived from future improved crops.  The annual gross production value of the seed bank’s 29
priority crops was $581 billion in 2010, climbing to $950
billion with the including of corn, soybeans and sugarcane,
according to PWC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
