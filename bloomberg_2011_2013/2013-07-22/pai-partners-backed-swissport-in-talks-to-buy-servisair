Aviation luggage-handling service
company Swissport International Ltd. is in exclusive talks to
buy baggage-handler  Servisair  for an undisclosed sum, the
companies said in an e-mailed statement.  The purchase of Servisair, owned by Paris-based maintenance
and recycling group  Derichebourg SA (DBG) , would be the latest
transaction by Swissport since it was purchased by private-equity firm PAI Partners SAS in November 2010.  Swissport, which is based in Glattbrugg, Switzerland,
announced in March it would buy the majority of the ground-handling operations from Nordic airline SAS Group AB. In
September 2012, it purchased Flightcare Spain and Flightcare
Belgium from Madrid-based FCC Versia SA.  The acquisition of Servisair would add about 15,000 people
to the companyâ€™s 40,000 employees, Swissport said in the
statement today.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and Sycomore Corporate Finance SAS acted as
financial advisers to Swissport and PAI with Societe Generale SA
and  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  advising Derichebourg, a spokeswoman for Paris-based PAI Partners said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
