The  New York Jets  signed first-year
quarterback Geno Smith, leaving two members of the National
Football League team’s 2013 draft class unsigned.  The Jets announced the signing today as rookies reported to
training camp on their Twitter page without providing terms of
the contract. The deal is probably for four years and $5
million, the Newark Star-Ledger reported, citing the NFL’s
rookie wage scale. New York has signed all its 2013 draft picks
except the two first-round selections -- cornerback Dee Milliner
and defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson.  The second quarterback taken in this year’s draft and a
preseason favorite of oddsmakers to win the league’s Offensive
Rookie of the Year award, Smith is in “open competition” for
the team’s starting job, coach  Rex Ryan  said last week in an
interview with ESPN Radio.  Smith, a second-round pick who is represented by rapper Jay
Z’s new Roc Nation Sports agency, was a four-year starter at
 West Virginia University , passing for 11,662 yards and 98
touchdowns in his college career.  He will compete during training camp with  Mark Sanchez , New
York’s starter for the past four seasons. Sanchez, 26, was
benched at the end of last season and has committed an NFL-high
52 turnovers the past two years.  Jets quarterbacks and rookies reported today to the team’s
practice facility in  Florham Park , New Jersey, for their
conditioning tests, according to the team website. Training camp
for all players begins July 25 in Cortland, New York.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
