Some Broadway freshmen struggled last week, as sweltering temperatures proved a tough environment in which to open all-new shows.  The musical comedy “ First Date ,” in previews ahead of an Aug. 8 opening, sold $350,000 of tickets, according to the trade association the Broadway League. With star Zachary Levi (television’s “Chuck”) out for the week due to a prior commitment, the show was down 14 percent from the first week of previews.  But that was great relative to “ Soul Doctor ,” about the life and music of the charismatic spiritual leader Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, which took in $110,000 in five previews, less than a quarter of its potential. It opens Aug. 15.  “Annie” slumped without television star  Jane Lynch  as Miss Hannigan, down 16 percent to $956,000, its lowest in five weeks.  “Motown” enjoyed its second-best week on record, selling $1.5 million. Too bad the Motor City, which filed for  bankruptcy protection  on July 18, can’t benefit from the SRO business.  Also near records were “Matilda” and “Kinky Boots,” propelling Broadway to $23.6 million in sales overall, up 2 percent.  Christopher Durang’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” packed in audiences and presumably profits, rising 3 percent to $684,000. Producers said on July 1 that investors recouped their $2.8 million investment.  Two not-so-new summer offerings were strong out of the gate. “ Forever Tango ,” in its third Broadway incarnation, sold $430,000, up 43 percent in its second week. And “ Let it Be ” did $399,000 in its first week, featuring hits by a band  Paul McCartney  played with before Wings.  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on opera and  Richard Vines  on dining.  To contact the reporter on this story: Philip Boroff in  New York  at  pboroff@bloomberg.net .
