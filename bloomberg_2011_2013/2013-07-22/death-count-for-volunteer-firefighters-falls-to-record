The number of volunteer firefighters
who died in the line of duty declined to a record in the U.S.
amid efforts to improve the fitness of emergency personnel.  On-duty volunteer firefighter deaths fell to 30 last year,
from 35 in 2012 and more than 75 in 1977 and 1978, the National
Fire Protection Association said today in a  report  on its
website. The overall firefighter fatality count, including paid
personnel, was 64 last year, the second-lowest on record, with
only 2011 having a smaller total.  “In 2012 we had the lowest number of cardiac-related
deaths that we’ve seen since we started doing the study in
1977,” Rita Fahy, manager of fire database systems for the
research and analysis division of the NFPA, said in a video on
the association’s website.  Last year was the fifth straight in which sudden cardiac
deaths declined as governments  promote  exercise and warns
firefighters about the risk of tobacco use. Such fatalities fell
to 27 in 2012, down from averages of 60 in the 1977-to-1986
period and 44 in the 1990s.  The category of overexertion, stress and medical issues
remained the most common source of death, followed by a group of
causes that includes motor-vehicle crashes. Firefighters who
died on duty in 2012 ranged in age from 17 to 79, with a median
age of 49, according to the NFPA.  The deadliest single incident for firefighters was the
 crash  of a North Carolina Air National Guard plane in South
Dakota, which killed four while combating a wildfire. An  Arizona 
wildfire this year claimed the lives of 19 members of an elite
firefighting unit in the worst loss of U.S. emergency workers
since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
