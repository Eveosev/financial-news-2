Prince William  and his wife Kate thanked the hospital staff who delivered their first child yesterday, though they’ve yet to announce a name for the boy who becomes the third in line to the British throne.  Kate, known formally as the Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to the boy at 4:24 p.m. yesterday at the private Lindo Wing in the state-run St. Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London. The child weighed 8 pounds, 6 ounces (3.8 kilograms).  “We would like to thank the staff at the Lindo Wing and the whole hospital for the tremendous care the three of us have received,” the parents said in a statement issued by their  office in Kensington Palace  today. “We know it has been a very busy period for the hospital and we would like to thank everyone -- staff, patients and visitors -- for their understanding during this time.”  Hundreds of photographers and reporters from around the world are outside the hospital, waiting for a first glimpse of the couple and the baby or for possible visitors. The BBC and Sky News television are carrying almost uninterrupted coverage of the event, which dominated this morning’s British newspapers.  Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, visited the hospital this afternoon, staying for about an hour.  ‘So Thrilled’  “He’s absolutely beautiful, they’re both doing really well and we’re so thrilled,” Carole told the assembled press as they left. Asked if they could reveal the name of the new prince, she replied: “Absolutely not.”  William, known as the Duke of Cambridge, was present for the birth. “We could not be happier,” he said in a statement released through the Press Association newswire later in the evening. The duke and duchess stayed overnight in the hospital.  Three people stand between the baby and the throne:  Queen Elizabeth II , who is 87; her eldest son Charles, the Prince of  Wales , 64; and William, 31. William married Kate, who’s also 31, in April 2011.  “It’s a Boy” was the headline in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, while the tabloid Sun renamed itself “The Son” and devoted its first nine pages to pictures and reports.  Royal gun salutes were fired this afternoon at the Tower of London and in Green Park, close to  Buckingham Palace , to mark the birth. Such salutes are given for the arrival of every British prince or princess. The Honourable Artillery Company fired 62 rounds at 10-second intervals at the Tower, while the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery staged a 41-round salute in Green Park, using World War I-era guns.  Queen ‘Delighted’  The duchess was taken to St. Mary’s yesterday morning in the early stages of labor. She and her husband entered through a private door, avoiding the main entrance.  “The queen and Prince Philip are delighted” by the birth, the monarchy announced on its Twitter feed.  Born into a life of instant fame and privilege --  Queen Elizabeth  owns two palaces, two castles and assorted houses and has an annual budget of 36 million pounds ($55 million) -- the newest arrival will have a privileged upbringing, though he will still attend school, according to royal commentator  Hugo Vickers .  “This child will live an extraordinary life meeting some of the most famous and fascinating people, yet the royal family has learned to give its children as normal an upbringing as possible,” Vickers, who has been writing and broadcasting on the royal family for more than 35 years, said in an interview. “This boy is born to be king but he may have a whole lifetime ahead of him first. He may reach 60 and not become monarch.”  ‘Very Excited’  Prince Charles, visiting the village of Bugthorpe in Yorkshire today, told broadcasters he’s “thrilled and very excited.”  William and Kate observed tradition by announcing the news of their baby by having a courtier affix a proclamation to an easel in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace, the queen’s central London residence. In keeping with the times, the news was also posted on Twitter.  When she wed Prince William in 2011,  Kate Middleton  became the first woman from outside royalty or the aristocracy to marry so close to the throne for 350 years in a ceremony watched on television by 2 billion people worldwide.  After the birth, William will return to work as a military helicopter pilot once he’s taken the two weeks’ paternity leave to which British fathers are entitled.  Kensington Palace  An apartment for the duke, the duchess and their new son is being readied at Kensington Palace in central London.  As a child Prince William was allowed to study away from the attention of cameras, with an understanding reached by the royal family and the press to give him time to mature and make mistakes in private. Still, the infant will grow up to be one of the most photographed children in the world.  To survive the inevitable attention, the new baby “will need to have a steadfast character and be aware of his place in history but not let it overwhelm him,” Vickers said. “Prince Charles always said there was never one moment when he realized he would be king, but that it was a gradual dawning on him that he had to behave better than everyone else.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Kitty Donaldson in  London  at  kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net ; Thomas Penny in London at  tpenny@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at  jhertling@bloomberg.net
