Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and
Technology Co. ,  China ’s second-largest construction equipment
maker, accepted more product returns at the end of 2012 as some
clients had difficulties making payments in a slowing economy.  The product return rate rose to 4.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations based on a company
 filing  to the Shenzhen stock exchange today. That compares to a
return rate of 0.27 percent in the first quarter of last year.
Zoomlion accepted 461 million  yuan  of returns in the fourth
quarter, compared with sales of 9.42 billion yuan.  “In the second-half of 2012, given the continued downturn
of the construction machinery industry, the operation rate of
construction machineries substantially dropped and settlement by
customers became more difficult,” the company said in a
separate statement.  The full-year return rate was 1.79 percent, up from 0.8
percent in 2011, Zoomlion said. The company made the statement
to clarify reports that questioned its sales figures, it said,
without identifying the reports.  The company’s  shares  fell 1.2 percent to close at HK$5.07
in Hong Kong trading before the statement today. The city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
