Canola futures rebounded from an 18-month low in Winnipeg on speculation that rising demand will
leave inventories tighter than expected in  Canada , the world’s
largest producer and exporter.  About 123,668 metric tons of the oilseed were crushed in
the week ended July 17, up 6.9 percent from a week earlier, the
Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said July 19. While
domestic canola output will rise 6 percent this year, the ratio
of stockpiles to use will drop to 2 percent from a 10-year
average of 7 percent, the government estimated last month.  “I don’t think there’s enough canola to service this
industry going forward,” Allan Johnston, president of
Johnston’s grain brokerage, said in a telephone interview from
Welwyn, Saskatchewan. “There’s such a demand for it.”  Canola futures for November settlement rose 0.6 percent to
settle at C$519.70 ($502.66) a ton at 1:34 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching $510.60, the lowest
for the most-active contract since Jan. 12, 2012. The November
contract has tumbled 9.2 percent since the end of May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
