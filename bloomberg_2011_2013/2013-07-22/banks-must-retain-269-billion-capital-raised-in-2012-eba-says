European Union banks must hold on to
the 204 billion euros ($269 billion) of capital they raised last
year, the European Banking Authority said today.  The capital should be used to prepare for the
implementation of Basel III standards in 2014, the EBA said.
“Preserving capital in European banks is essential for
maintaining the flow of lending to the real economy,” Andrea Enria, chairman of the EBA, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
