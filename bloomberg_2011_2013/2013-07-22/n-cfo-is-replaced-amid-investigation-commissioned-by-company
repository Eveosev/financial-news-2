MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  Chief Financial
Officer Nazir Patel resigned and was replaced by Brett Goschen
amid an investigation at Africa’s largest wireless operator.  Patel “does not wish his continued employment with the
company to prejudice the company in respect of certain
allegations made against him, which are subject to an ongoing
investigation which had been commissioned by the company,” MTN
said in a statement today.  Patel left the company yesterday and was immediately
replaced with Goschen, who was chief executive officer of MTN’s
Nigeria unit and previously led Ghana operations. MTN didn’t
immediately respond to calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
