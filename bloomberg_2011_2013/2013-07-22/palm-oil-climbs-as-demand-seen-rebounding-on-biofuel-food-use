Palm oil  advanced on speculation
that demand may rebound this half as gains in crude oil boost
the use of vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock.  The contract for delivery in October gained 0.7 percent to
close at 2,272 ringgit ($715) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures lost 5.4 in the past two weeks, extending
losses in the past year to 24 percent. Palm for local physical
delivery in August was at 2,335 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  West Texas Intermediate crude rose for a fourth day on
declining stockpiles. While palm production will pick up from
this month, demand will also expand because of festivals in the
main importing countries, said Yusof Basiron, chief executive
officer of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. Demand from large
consuming countries like China and India will probably increase,
Yusof said in a presentation for an online seminar today.  “One of the reasons that is pushing demand for palm oil is
biodiesel,” said Sim Han Qiang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte. in Singapore. “When crude  oil prices  go up, there’ll be
high demand for biodiesel.”  Increased blending requirements in the Americas and
Indonesia’s foray into biodiesel as a major producer will create
demand for biofuel feedstock, Yusof said.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December climbed 0.6 percent to
45.57 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in November rose 0.2 percent to $12.7675 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.4 percent to
close at 5,616  yuan  ($914) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , after closing on July 19 at the lowest price for the
most-active contract since July 2009. Soybean oil advanced 0.5
percent to end at 7,256 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
