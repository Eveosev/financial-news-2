OPEC, excluding  Iran , made $982
billion from exporting oil in 2012, the most in 38 years of
data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration  reported  today.
It forecast that sales will drop in 2013 and 2014.  Net oil-export revenue by the 12-member organization
climbed 5.4 percent last year from 2011, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Sales will tumble by
4.3 percent to $940 billion this year and by 3.9 percent to $903
billion next year, the agency said.  Demand for OPEC’s crude will slip by 300,000 barrels a day
next year to 29.6 million barrels, or 2.6 percent less than the
group is pumping now, OPEC said July 10 in its first set of
forecasts for 2013. Exports to  North America  face growing
competition from a surge in production from shale basins in the
U.S. and  Canada . U.S. crude  output  reached 7.35 million barrels
a day at the end of April, up 17 percent from a year earlier.  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s largest producer, earned 32 percent of
the 2012 total, or $311 billion, the EIA said.  The agency excluded Iran, OPEC’s second-biggest producer a
year ago which is now in sixth place as sanctions aimed at
stopping the Islamic republic’s nuclear program have hindered
its ability to export crude. A European Union ban on the
purchase, transport, financing and insurance of Iranian oil went
into effect July 1, 2012.  Iran Sanctions  Iran wasn’t included because of “the difficulties
associated with estimating Iran’s earnings, including its
inability to receive payments and possible price discounts Iran
offers its existing customers,” the EIA said.  After adjusting for inflation with 2005 dollars as a
constant, OPEC’s revenue increased by 3.2 percent to $835
billion in 2012, the EIA said.  According to a monthly oil-market report from the Paris-based  International Energy Agency  earlier this month, OPEC
members pumped 30.61 million barrels a day in June compared with
30.98 million barrels in May. That level exceeds a target of 30
million that the group reaffirmed at its last meeting on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
