Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. telephone company, is boosting its FiOS
Internet speeds to 500 megabits a second, faster than  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s speediest service and half that of Google Inc.’s.  Verizon aims to attract consumers and small businesses to
its FiOS Quantum fiber-optic services, became available
yesterday in parts of every FiOS market. Customers that combine
Internet with TV or telephone service will pay $309.99 a month,
or $329.99 for a package of all three services.  The phone company, based in  New York , is promoting speed as
a competitive advantage for people willing to pay top dollar.
Comcast, the largest broadband provider, exceeded Verizon last
year with a service promising 305 megabits-a-second speed for
$299.95. Last quarter, Verizon added 161,000 FiOS Internet
customers for a total of 5.8 million.  The new service is for people in offices who share
connections and for families who do a lot of movie downloads,
said Fowler Abercrombie, a manager of the FiOS development team
in Irving, Texas.  Google (GOOG)  debuted a 1-gigabit  Internet service  called Google
Fiber in the Kansas City, Missouri, area last year starting at
$70 a month. Earlier this year Google announced Austin, Texas,
and Provo, Utah, as the next two communities to get the high-speed service. Verizon doesn’t provide service in those cities.  “We can support up to 10-gigabit on our network,” said
Abercrombie. “We’re watching the market to see where it goes
next.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
