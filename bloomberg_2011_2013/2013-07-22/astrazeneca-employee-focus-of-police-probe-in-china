AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s biggest
drugmaker after  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , said an employee is the
focus of a “local police matter” in Shanghai as China probes
drugmakers on pricing and allegations of bribery and corruption.  Police in the Huangpu branch of the Shanghai Public
Security Bureau visited AstraZeneca’s operations there regarding
a sales representative, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. There is “no reason” to believe that the individual
case is related to any other investigations, the London-based
drugmaker said.  China is intensifying its probe of Glaxo, also based in
London, on suspected economic crimes. Four senior executives
have been detained in the investigation, which involves 3
billion yuan ($489 million) of travel and meeting expenses and
trade in sexual favors,  China ’s Public Security Ministry said
July 15.  “AstraZeneca adheres to high ethical standards in the
pharmaceutical industry, and does not tolerate any illegal or
unethical conduct in our business activities,” the company
said. “All AstraZeneca China employees and third parties on
AstraZeneca’s behalf are required to strictly comply with these
guidelines in the conduct of business.”  Other foreign companies may also be involved, Gao Feng,
head of the economic crimes investigations unit of China’s
Public Security Ministry, told reporters at a July 15 briefing.
While authorities haven’t named any other companies,  UCB SA (UCB)  said
last week that its Chinese operations were visited by local
authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
