ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, the German
broadcaster controlled by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and Permira Advisers LLP,
fell from a 12-year high after Liberum Capital Ltd. said the
country’s advertising market may weaken before an election.  ProSiebenSat.1 dropped as much as 5.9 percent to 33.34
euros, the steepest intraday decline since Feb. 14, and was
trading down 4.5 percent at 3 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the
company at 7.41 billion euros ($9.75 billion). Volume exceeded
the three-month daily trading average by 63 percent. The stock
cost 35.44 euros at the close on July 19, the highest price
since February 2001.  Germany ’s federal parliamentary ballot is scheduled for
Sept. 22. Advertising companies  Interpublic Group of Cos.  and
 Omnicom Group (OMC)  predicted last week that there will be “some
pressure” in Germany’s market in advance of the vote, Ian Whittaker and Lisa Hau, London-based analysts at Liberum, said
in a research report today.  “Advertisers are concerned about the macroeconomic
picture, and don’t like the uncertainty before elections,”
potentially discouraging them from paying to promote products,
Whittaker said by phone.  The analysts reduced their  recommendation  on ProSiebenSat.1
stock to hold from buy, as the stock is at about their fair-value estimate of 35 euros.  ProSieben, which mainly competes with publisher Bertelsmann
SE’s broadcasting unit  RTL Group SA (RTL)  in Germany, reported first-quarter sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates as German
television-advertising revenue increased. Sales at the Munich-based company rose 13 percent to 563 million euros in the three
months through March, ProSieben said in May.  The company holds its annual shareholders meeting tomorrow
in Munich, followed by an extraordinary session at which owners
of the company’s preferred stock will vote whether to convert
those shares into registered voting common stock.  As the common stock is held mostly by KKR and Permira, the
firms will probably “sell down their stake, presumably through
market placings,” Whittaker and Hau said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
