The  Bundesbank  said the German
economy, Europe’s largest, is set to slow after a rebound in the
second quarter of the year.  “Signs of a slowdown in economic growth are increasing”
in line with expectations, the Frankfurt-based central bank said
in its monthly report today. “The assessment that the German
economy expanded strongly in the second quarter after a weather-related weak start to 2013 is being confirmed by current
indicators. Important contributions to growth in the second
quarter should come from industry and construction.”  While the Ifo institute’s measure of German business
confidence increased for a second month in June and unemployment
unexpectedly declined, factory orders, industrial production and
exports slumped in May.  Germany ’s overseas sales are being
curbed as the 17-nation euro region, its biggest trading
partner, struggles to emerge from recession and growth slows in
 China , its third-biggest export destination.  The Bundesbank last month lowered its growth projection for
2013 to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent, and cut its 2014 outlook
to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent. The economy expanded 0.1
percent in the three months ended March.  The Federal Statistics Office will publish its initial
estimate of gross domestic product for the second quarter on
Aug. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
