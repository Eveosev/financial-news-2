Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
Chinese solar manufacturer involved in bankruptcy proceedings,
is supplying panels for a 30-megawatt power plant in Mexico.  Martifer SGPS SA’s solar unit expects to complete the Aura
Solar plant next month, according to a statement today from
Wuxi, China-based Suntech. Construction began in March.  Gauss Energia, based in Mexico City, is developing the
solar farm near La Paz, at the southern end of  Baja California .  “With Mexico’s excellent sunlight and strong renewable-energy demand, we expect to see excellent growth of PV in the
region,” E.L. McDaniel, managing director of Suntech America,
said in the statement.  Suntech extended a forbearance agreement last month with
holders of bonds that went unpaid earlier in March. The company
was the world’s biggest panel maker in 2011 by shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
