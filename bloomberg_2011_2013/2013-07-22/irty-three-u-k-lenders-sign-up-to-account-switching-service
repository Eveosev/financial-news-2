Thirty-three U.K. lenders including
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  agreed to
allow customers to switch their checking accounts between
lenders in seven days.  From September, financial institutions will redirect
payments and deposits for customers moving their account to
another bank, the Payments Council said in a statement today.
Customers will be refunded any charges should the process go
wrong, according to the body, which is funded by the industry.
Moving accounts can take as long as 30 days at present.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is pushing for
greater competition in the industry and considering whether to
force banks to give up control of the payment system. Britain’s
four largest lenders have about 75 percent of the checking
account market, the  Office of Fair Trading  said in January.  “Creating the Current Account Switch Service has involved
massive systems changes on both a central and individual
institution level,” Adrian Kamellard, chief executive officer
of the Payments Council, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
