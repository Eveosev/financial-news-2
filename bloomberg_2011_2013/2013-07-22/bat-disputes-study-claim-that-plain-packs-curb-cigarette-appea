British American Tobacco (BATS) ’s
Australian unit has disputed the findings of a cancer charity’s
study that plain packaging lowers the appeal of cigarettes and
increases the desire to quit.  Australia ’s introduction of plain packaging legislation has
had “no noticeable impact on legal tobacco sales in the first
six months,” BAT Australia spokesman  Scott McIntyre  said in an
e-mailed statement today. “Smokers are still purchasing
cigarettes just as they were before it was introduced.”  Australia became the first country to enforce plain tobacco
packaging on Dec. 1. All cigarettes in the nation must be sold
in uniform packs with the brand name relegated to the bottom
quarter of the package on a brown background. The U.K.
government this month postponed plans to introduce plain packs,
saying it needs more time to assess the effects in Australia.  The  study , funded by Cancer Council Victoria, surveyed 536
smokers during the rollout of the plain pack legislation in
November, when branded packs were still on sale.  “Our consumer purchasing figures are based on six months’
worth of sales data since plain packs have been the only
available cigarettes in the market,” BATA’s McIntyre said.  He didn’t provide sales figures to back the claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
