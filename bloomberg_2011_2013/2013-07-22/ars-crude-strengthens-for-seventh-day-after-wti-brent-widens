Mars Blend crude on the spot market
strengthened versus West Texas Intermediate for a seventh
straight day as the U.S. benchmark lost ground to its European
counterpart.  European Brent’s premium to WTI widened to $1.21 a barrel
from 20 cents on July 19, based on September contract
settlements, after falling to an 8-cent discount during intraday
trading. Mars, a medium, sour crude from the Gulf of Mexico,
competes with foreign crudes priced against Brent for space in
U.S. refineries.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI grew by 20 cents to $1.25 a
barrel at 2:16 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The crude has strengthened every trading day since July 11, when
it reached a 30-month-low of $1.25 a barrel below WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 85 cents to a premium
of $5.85 a barrel more than WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet weakened
by 25 cents to a $6.25-a-barrel-premium.  Poseidon’s premium gained by $1.10 to 85 cents a barrel
versus WTI, while Thunder Horse’s lost 50 cents to $5. Crude
from the Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at a 50-cent-a-barrel discount.  Bakken crude priced in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened by
$1 to a discount of $4 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
