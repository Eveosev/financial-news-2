Bank of Nova Scotia  hired Mark Quaglia, who left  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in September, to sell
structured securities.  Quaglia started at the Scotia Capital USA Inc. unit of the
Toronto-based bank this month focusing on institutional sales of
structured notes and other securities, he said in a telephone
interview from his office in New York. He reports to Tim Andrews, a managing director.  Quaglia held a similar sales role as director of hedge fund
derivatives and structured products at Deutsche Bank. He was
most recently a consulting attorney for derivatives and
financing deals at New York-based law firm Cadwalader Wickersham
& Taft LLP, he said.  Joe Konecny, a spokesman for Bank of  Nova Scotia , confirmed
the hiring.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
