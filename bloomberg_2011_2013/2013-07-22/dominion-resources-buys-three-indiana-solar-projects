Dominion Resources Inc. (D) , the owner
of  Virginia ’s largest utility, bought three solar projects under
construction in Indiana with 28.6 megawatts of capacity that
will increase the amount of energy produced from sunlight in the
state more than fivefold.  The company bought the Indy Solar I, Indy Solar II and Indy
Solar III projects from developer Sunrise Energy Ventures LLC
and will sell electricity to AES Corp.’s Indianapolis Power &
Light under a 15-year contract, Richmond, Virginia-based
Dominion said today in a statement. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed.  Indiana has less than 7 megawatts of solar capacity
installed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the U.S.
Energy Department’s  National Renewable Energy Laboratory .  The plants south of Indianapolis will begin producing power
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
