South African white corn futures
declined to the lowest level in a week after the rand
strengthened for a second day, making imports of the grain
cheaper.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.9 percent to 2,340 rand ($238) a metric ton,
the lowest since July 15, by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in September
was down 0.3 percent to 2,207.60 rand a ton.  The rand gained against the dollar as heads of the world’s
biggest economies said they’ll pursue policies that won’t spook
markets when the U.S. and  Japan  start rolling back monetary
stimulus. The rand was last at 9.8102 per dollar.  “The rand was rather strong today,” Andrew Fletcher, an
independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free State province, said
by phone.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 0.1 percent to 3,350
rand a ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
