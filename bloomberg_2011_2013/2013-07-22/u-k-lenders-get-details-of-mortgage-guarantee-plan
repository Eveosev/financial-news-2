Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne , who often attacks the opposition  Labour Party  for
creating an “economy built on debt” under the previous
government, will today give details of how the current
administration will guarantee riskier mortgages to boost growth.  Under the “Help to Buy” program, the Treasury will back
mortgages of as much as 95 percent of a property’s value for
first-time buyers on homes valued at as much as 600,000 pounds
($920,000). The initiative, which has drawn a warning from the
 International Monetary Fund  for its potential to stoke  home
prices , was described as “moronic” by Societe Generale SA
global strategist  Albert Edwards  last month for encouraging
Britons to add to high debt levels.  Osborne will attempt to deal with some of the criticism by
pointing out that borrowers will have to pass stress tests and
not have had any court judgments for debt against them in the
three years before they take the loan. They’ll also have to sign
a document saying this is their only property.  “The mortgage guarantee will support an increase in high
loan-to-value mortgages for people who can’t afford large
deposits, and it will also boost housebuilding,” Osborne said
in an e-mailed statement. “As of today, lenders have the detail
they need to go away and get ready for next January’s launch.”  Mortgage lenders will have to pay a fee for the guarantee,
set at a level that will encourage them to participate, the
Treasury said. Osborne will meet some of their representatives
for breakfast today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
