Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.â€™s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, sold a U.K.
office park and a Frankfurt distribution facility for a total of
285 million pounds ($435 million) as the company cuts debt.  Segro sold IQ Winnersh in Reading,  England , to a joint
venture between Oaktree Capital Management LP and  Patrizia
Immobilien AG (P1Z)  for a net initial yield of 5.8 percent, the
company said in a statement today. The sale of the 118,200 the
square-meter (1.27 million square-foot) property for 245 million
pounds will be completed at the end of July.  Chief Executive Officer David Sleath said in November 2011
that Segro would sell 1.6 billion pounds of real estate to help
repay debt and focus on more profitable properties. Disposals
this year will reach 437 million pounds when the IQ Winnersh
deal is completed, the company said today.  The U.K. asset was sold at 12 percent above the December
2012 valuation, according to the statement. The Frankfurt office
and warehouse park fetched 46 million euros ($60 million), the
company said in a separate announcement. The site was previously
occupied by Neckermann, the mail order company that filed for
insolvency in July 2012. It was sold for 4.3 million euros below
the December 2012 valuation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
