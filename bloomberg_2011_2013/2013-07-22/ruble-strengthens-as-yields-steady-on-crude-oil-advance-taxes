The ruble strengthened, extending
last week’s gains, as crude rallied and companies paid mineral
extraction taxes.  The currency rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar to 32.251
by 1:23 p.m. in Moscow after a 1 percent advance last week. The
yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 was steady at
7.58 percent.  Oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, rose for a fourth day,
adding 0.4 percent to $108.44 per barrel in  New York . The tax
period in the world’s biggest energy exporter continues until
the end of the week. The payments support the currency as
companies convert export revenue into rubles.  “Taxes along with strong oil continue to support the
ruble,” Alexander Muhlberger, head of foreign-exchange trading
at BCS Financial Group, said by phone from Moscow. “Taxes are a
major factor for the Russian currency.”  The ruble climbed last week as investors speculated that
the  Federal Reserve  will keep stimulus measures in place,
boosting appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers that the central bank’s $85
billion of monthly bond purchases “could be reduced more
quickly or expanded” depending on the pace of recovery in the
U.S.  The ruble was little changed at 36.857 against the dollar-euro basket and 42.4695 against the euro. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
Emerging Currencies Index climbed 0.2 percent to 91.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
