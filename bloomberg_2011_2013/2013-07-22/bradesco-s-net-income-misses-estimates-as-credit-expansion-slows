Banco Bradesco SA,  Latin America ’s
No. 2 bank by market value, said second-quarter profit rose 4
percent, missing analysts’ estimates as loan growth slowed and
expenses increased.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, climbed
to 2.98 billion reais ($1.33 billion) from 2.87 billion reais a
year earlier, the Osasco, Brazil-based lender said in a
statement today. That missed the 3.07 billion-real  estimate  of
six analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Lending at Bradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, has slowed as  Brazil ’s economic growth
cooled. The nation’s economic activity index fell 1.4 percent in
May, the biggest decline since December 2008, and economists
have cut their growth estimate nine straight times, according to
the latest central-bank survey.  Lending increased 10 percent to 402.5 billion reais, down
from a 14 percent expansion a year earlier and 12 percent in the
previous three months. Bradesco cut its 2013 estimated range for
loan growth to 11 percent to 15 percent, from 13 percent to 17
percent, according to the statement. Administrative and
personnel expenses rose 4.3 percent to 6.77 billion reais in the
second quarter from a year earlier.  Bradesco  fell  13 percent this year, compared with a decline
of 6.7 percent for Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Latin America’s No.
