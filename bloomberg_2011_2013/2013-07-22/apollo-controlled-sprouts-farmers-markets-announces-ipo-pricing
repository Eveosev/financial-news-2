Sprouts Farmers Markets LLC (SFM) , the
U.S. grocery chain controlled by  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) ,
said it will sell 18.5 million shares in an initial public
offering, valuing the company at as much as $296 million.  Sprouts will use proceeds from the offering to repay about
$247.6 million in debt, it said today in a statement. The stock
will sell for an estimated $14 to $16 a shares, Sprouts said.
The Phoenix-based retailer applied in May for an IPO, and plans
to become a Delaware corporation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
