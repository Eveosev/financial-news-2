The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, as previously disclosed by the non-governmental
regulator of brokerages, began releasing more information about
trading in government-backed mortgage securities.  Finra began releasing trade-by-trade data on specified pool
transactions through its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine,
or Trace, the regulator said today in an e-mailed statement.
Along with figures on Small Business Administration-backed
securities, new disclosures will cover $18 billion in average
daily trading.  Finra has been expanding Trace to securitized debt after
the opacity of trading in securities including  home-loan bonds 
without government backing contributed to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression in 2008.  The regulator, which operates from  Washington  and  New York ,
last year decided against reporting specified-pool trades with
unique identifiers known as CUSIPs, choosing instead a protocol
that describes the bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
