India ’s 10-year bonds fell after
posting their biggest weekly loss since 2009 as the nation’s
central bank raised two interest rates to steady the currency.  Primary dealers bought 24 percent of bonds at a government
debt sale to raise 150 billion rupees ($2.5 billion), according
to a Reserve Bank of India statement on July 19. The RBI sold
only 21 percent of its target the previous day in an open-market
auction meant to drain cash from the banking system, and it
rejected all bids at a treasury-bill sale after raising the
marginal standing facility and the bank rate to 10.25 percent
from 8.25 percent. The key repurchase rate was left unchanged.  “The central bank is clearly aiming to raise short-term
rates,” said Arvind Chari, a senior fund manager at Quantum
Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. “The market’s expectations of a
rate cut have been pushed back significantly.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose two
basis points to 7.96 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate surged
41 basis points last week, the most for a benchmark 10-year
government note since December 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 59.4225 per dollar today,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. A
weaker currency makes imports costlier and threatens to spur
gains in India’s  consumer prices , which have stayed close to 10
percent for more than a year. RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left
the repurchase  rate  unchanged at 7.25 percent at a June 17
policy meeting, citing inflation risks. The rupee reached a
record low of 61.2125 per dollar on July 8.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was down one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, at 8.64 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate surged 110 basis points
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
