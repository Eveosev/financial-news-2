Cattle futures declined as U.S.
feedlots added heavier animals to their herds, signaling
increased beef production. Hog prices rose.  About 1.04 million head of cattle weighing 700 pounds
(317.5 kilograms) or more were placed into feedlots last month,
up 18 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a  report  on July 19 after the close of
regular trading.  “These heavyweight placements will give us more beef” in
the three months ending Nov. 30, said Dennis Smith, a senior
account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“At some point after that, you’ll begin to see production drop
off.”  Cattle futures for October delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$1.25625 a pound at 10:13 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through last week, the price dropped 4.6 percent this
year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement advanced 0.3
percent to $1.52725 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.5 percent to 85.4
cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
