Corn fell for the third time in four
sessions after rain in parts of the Midwest improved prospects
for crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.
Soybeans rose, while wheat dropped.  As much as 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) of rain fell in
parts of the Midwest in the past 72 hours, helping the corn crop
as it enters the critical pollination stage, Commodity Weather
Group LLC said in a report today. An additional 1.5 inches is
forecast in the next five days. Prices fell 1.7 percent last
week on speculation that wet weather will boost yields.  “Good rains have fallen in some areas,” Greg Grow, the
director of agribusinss for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said by telephone. “It appears the market is looking
at the forecast, and it’s supportive to potentially good corn
yields in many areas.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
settle at $4.98 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The contract has dropped 17 percent this year after the
U.S. government forecast record domestic production.  Soybeans futures for November delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$12.885 a bushel in Chicago. The price gained as the Department
of Agriculture has forecast U.S. stockpiles will fall to 125
million bushels by Aug. 31, the lowest in nine years, Grow said.  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$6.5975 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
