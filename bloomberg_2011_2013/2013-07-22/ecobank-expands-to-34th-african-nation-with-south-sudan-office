Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
lender that operates in more African countries than any other,
said it started operations in South  Sudan , it’s 34th nation on
the continent.  The local affiliate of the Lome, Togo-based bank opened on
July 10 and offers financial products and services to
individuals, businesses and institutions, Ecobank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Founded in 1985, Ecobank has expanded across Africa and
into France, with representative offices in Beijing, Dubai,
Johannesburg, London and Luanda,  Angola . Its assets totaled
$19.6 billion at the end of March.  “We are very excited to have obtained the authorization of
South Sudanese authorities to operate in this country, which
holds a huge potential for financial intermediation,” Chief
Executive Officer Thierry Tanoh said in the statement. “Our
presence in four of its six bordering countries, namely Kenya,
Uganda, the  Democratic Republic  of Congo and the Central African
Republic, is a unique advantage to contribute to the development
and integration of  South Sudan ’s young republic.”  South Sudan seceded from Sudan in July 2011 and took three-quarters of the formerly united country’s crude output of
490,000 barrels a day.  Ecobank’s  shares  trading in Nigeria were unchanged at 14.75
naira as of 11:23 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. Ecobank
stock has increased 31 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 189.2 billion naira ($1.2 billion). The 10-member Nigerian Stock Exchange Banking 10 Index has climbed 25
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
