Gold gained the most in more than a
year on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain U.S.
economic stimulus, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as
a store of value. Silver also surged.  Bullion rose 1.3 percent last week, capping the first back-to-back weekly gains since May, after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  indicated that it’s too early to decide whether to
begin scaling back  bond purchases  in September. Existing home
sales in the U.S. fell 1.2 percent in June, the National
Association of Realtors said today.  “Bernanke’s statement has a put a bid under gold,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “Also, the weak housing
data confirms the fact that stimulus is here to stay for some
time.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 3.3 percent to
settle at $1,337.30 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain since June 29, 2012. Earlier, the metal
reached $1,340.50, the highest for a most-active contract since
June 20.  Prices have dropped 20 percent this year, wiping $57
billion from the value of gold  exchange-traded product holdings ,
after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
and amid concern that the Fed may slow the pace of the stimulus.  Dollar Drops  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, dropped to the lowest since June 20
as  Bill Gross , the co-chief investment officer at Pacific
Investment Management Co., said he expected the Fed won’t
tighten policy before 2016.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators increased their
net-long  position  by 56 percent to 55,535 contracts by July 16,
the highest since June 4, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Short contracts fell the most since
November after reaching a record the previous week.  Silver futures for September delivery gained 5.4 percent to
$20.509 an ounce in New York, the most since April 25. Earlier,
prices rose to $20.575, the highest since June 20.  An ounce of gold bought as many as 66.6 ounces of silver on
July 19 in  London , the most since August 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 1.2 percent to $1,448 an ounce, after
touching $1,456.40, the highest since June 14.  Palladium futures for September delivery gained 0.1 percent
to $750.45 an ounce. Trading was 45 percent below the average in
the past 100 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
