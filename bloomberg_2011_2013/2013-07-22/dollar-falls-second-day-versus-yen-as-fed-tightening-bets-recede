The dollar fell for a second day
versus the yen on speculation that the Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  won’t rush to increase  interest rates  after the
U.S. central bank winds down its bond-buying stimulus program.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index  approached the lowest level in a
month after the Beijing News reported that China’s premier  Li
Keqiang  said 7 percent growth is the minimum possible, damping
demand for the safest assets. The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced for a third day as rising commodity prices and
a drop in volatility gave support to the higher-yielding assets.
Indonesia’s rupiah fell the most since 2011.  “The market is getting used to the idea that tapering is
not tightening,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “The main message is
accommodation and that’s a bearish factor for the dollar.”  The U.S. currency fell 0.2 percent to 99.44 yen at 9:14
a.m.  London , rising from 99.15 yen, the lowest level since July
17. It was little changed at $1.3196 per euro after yesterday
touching $1.3218, the weakest since June 21. The yen gained 0.1
percent to 131.25 per euro.  Home prices  in the U.S.  rose  0.8 percent in May, following
a 0.7 percent advance the previous month, which was the smallest
increase since January, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  will
report today, according to economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Housing Market  Previously owned home sales in the U.S. slid 1.2 percent in
June to a 5.08 million annualized rate, the National Association
of Realtors reported yesterday. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 5.26 million pace.  “The housing market is directly linked to the job market,
and Bernanke says hiring must improve before the Fed can reduce
stimulus,” said  Yuji Saito , the director of foreign-exchange at
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in Tokyo. “The Fed has succeeded in
convincing markets there’s going to be quite some time between
the end of tapering and the start of policy tightening,”
pushing the dollar lower against the yen, he said.  The Bloomberg Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 other major currencies, was little changed at
1,027.72 after falling yesterday to the lowest level since June
20. The index rose after Bernanke said in June the central
bank’s bond purchases may slow this year and stop in mid-2014.
It reached 1,056.33 earlier this month.  Fed Purchases  The Fed buys $85 billion of debt each month as part of its
quantitative-easing stimulus to cap borrowing costs, a program
that tends to debase the dollar. It has held the benchmark
interest-rate target unchanged at between zero and 0.25 percent
since 2008 to support the economy.  The dollar has risen 4.5 percent this year, matching the
gain in the euro and lagging behind only the Swedish Krona among
10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen is the worst performer, having dropped
10 percent.  The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to 92.57 U.S.
cents. New Zealand’s currency gained 0.3 percent to 79.89 U.S.
cents after earlier touching 80.09, the highest since June 19.  One-month volatility for the kiwi versus the  U.S. dollar 
touched 11.5 percent, a level unseen since May 16. The
equivalent rate for the Aussie dropped to as low as 11.1
percent, the least since May 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
