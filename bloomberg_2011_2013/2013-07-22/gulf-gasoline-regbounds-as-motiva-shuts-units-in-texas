Gulf Coast  gasoline rebounded from
the largest discount in more than three weeks after Motiva
Enterprises LLC shut units at the nation’s biggest refinery.  The 600,000-barrel-a-day  Port Arthur, Texas, plant  shut
down some units on July 19 because of “adverse weather
conditions,” said Destin Singleton, a Houston-based spokeswoman
for the refinery. She did not provide details on specific units.  A fluid catalytic cracker remains shut for repairs at
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s refinery in  Port Arthur , said  Bill Day , a
San Antonio-based company spokesman.  The plant  has the capacity
to process about 310,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB , on the Gulf
Coast strengthened 1.75 cents to a discount of 25.5 cents a
gallon below New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:19 p.m.
The differential widened to a  discount  of 27.5 cents on June 19
after a government report showed regional gasoline stockpiles
rose to a five-month high.  Gasoline inventories  in the area, known as PADD 3, rose
2.06 million barrels to 78.2 million in the week ended July 12,
the highest level since Feb. 8., the Energy Information
Administration reported last week.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West  Texas 
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 51 cents to
$14.01 a barrel. The same spread for  Light Louisiana Sweet oil 
slipped 9 cents to $7.35 a barrel, a fourth consecutive drop,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
