Corpbanca, the Chilean lender
controlled by billionaire Alvaro Saieh, snapped a three-day
losing streak after saying its exposure to Saieh’s grocery, SMU
SA, is within legal limits and doesn’t pose a risk to capital.  The shares increased 1.2 percent to 5.25 pesos at 11:45
a.m. in Santiago, after falling by 5.4 percent in the three
previous sessions. The benchmark Chilean IPSA index retreated
0.1 percent today.  Corpbanca,  Chile ’s fourth-largest non-state-owned bank,
said in an e-mailed statement late on July 19 that exposure to
SMU accounts for 0.2 percent of loans, and that it complies with
local laws governing lending between related companies. The
 shares  had fallen last week to the lowest since July 2010 amid
speculation that Saieh could redeem shares or borrow from his
banking group to help fund a planned $500 million capital
increase at SMU.  “Corpbanca is clarifying its exposure to SMU, and that is
giving some relief to the market,” Gustavo Catalan, an analyst
at  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI) , said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
