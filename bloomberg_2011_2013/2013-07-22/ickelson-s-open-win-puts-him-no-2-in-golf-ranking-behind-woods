Phil Mickelson  moved to No. 2 in the Official World Golf  Ranking  after winning his first British Open title yesterday, moving past Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy. Tiger Woods holds the top spot,  Mickelson, a 43-year-old American, birdied four of the final six holes to pull away to a three-shot win over Sweden’s Henrik Stenson at Muirfield in Gullane, Scotland. A month ago, he lost a final-round lead at Merion Golf Club outside Philadelphia and finished second for a record sixth time in the  U.S. Open .  The world rankings are determined through a two-year system. Players accumulate points based on the strength of a tournament’s field, with golf’s four major tournaments awarding the most points.  Woods, 37, leads all players with 12.64 average points per tournament, Mickelson is second with 8.63, followed by McIlroy’s 8.61.  Mickelson shot 5-under par 66 yesterday, matching the low round of the tournament, to finish at 3-under 281. The victory, his fifth major title, paid Mickelson 945,000 pounds ($1.44 million).  Lee Westwood  and fellow Englishman  Ian Poulter  tied for third with Masters Tournament champion  Adam Scott  of Australia at 1 over. Woods was among three players in sixth at 2 over.
