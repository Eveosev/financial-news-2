Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL)  soared the most in more
than a year amid bets  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  will revive a bid
to buy the 13.6 percent stake it doesn’t already own in the
Dubai-based mortgage provider.  The shares rallied 15 percent, the most since March 2012,
to 1.33 dirhams at the close in Dubai. About 9.4 million shares
traded, 8.3 times the three-month daily average. Tamweel was the
biggest gainer in percentage terms on the  DFM General Index (DFMGI) ,
which increased 0.2 percent. The yield on Tamweel’s $300 million
5.154 percent sukuk fell 3 basis points to 3.4 percent at 2:04
p.m. in Dubai, taking its July drop to 102 basis points.  Dubai Islamic may reopen a tender offer of 10 of its shares
for every 18 Tamweel shares held to achieve 100 percent control
before delisting the company, Jaap Meijer, Dubai-based director
of equity research at Arqaam Capital Ltd., said in e-mailed note
to clients yesterday. That offer would amount to a 71 percent
upside, he said. Tamweel shares gained 3.6 percent yesterday.  The second offer would most likely take place “through an
unchanged 10:18 swap, to insure equality among target
shareholders,” Meijer said. Arqaam said it raised Tamweel to
buy on expectations Dubai Islamic will relaunch its offer.  Dubai Islamic, the biggest Shariah-compliant lender in the
United Arab Emirates, raised its Tamweel stake from 58 percent
earlier this year. Shares of the mortgage company, which slumped
21 percent last month, have underperformed the DFM General Index
in 2013, increasing 17 percent compared with the broader
measure’s 57 percent advance.  “A few buyers have embraced the idea that the Securities
and Commodities Authority will force DIB to reopen the tender
offer,”  Julian Bruce , head of institutional trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
