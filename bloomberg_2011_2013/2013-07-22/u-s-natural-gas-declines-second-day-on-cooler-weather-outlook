Natural gas futures slid the most in
more than three weeks in New York as meteorologists predicted
moderating temperatures that would reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas declined 3 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , forecast mostly normal or cooler-than-average weather in the lower-48 states through Aug. 5 after a
heat wave in the Northeast last week. The high in New York on
July 28 may be 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 3 less than
usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.   “A lot of the heat we saw blanket the Northeast is going
to be moderating over the next couple of weeks,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is starting to give back
gains.”  Natural gas for August delivery fell 11.2 cents to settle
at $3.677 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The drop was the biggest since June 27.
Trading volume was 23 percent below the 100-day average at 3:03
p.m. Prices have climbed 9.7 percent this year and rose 4
percent last week.  The discount of August to October futures widened 0.7 cent
to 1.4 cents.  August $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.4 cent higher at 0.6 cent per
million Btu on volume of 853 at 3:41 p.m. Puts accounted for 53
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in September was 31.25 percent at 3:30 p.m.,
compared with 31.01 percent on July 19.  CFTC Report  Net-long wagers on four U.S. natural gas contracts declined
for a seventh week, dropping 5,738 futures equivalents, or 2
percent, to 278,848, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data released July 19. It was the lowest level since
the week ended March 12.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  The high in  Chicago  on July 28 may be 82 degrees
Fahrenheit, 2 lower than average, AccuWeather data show. Power
generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according
to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “It does not look like the call on natural gas for
weather-related power generation is going to be very strong
through early August and possibly beyond,” said Dominick Chirichella,  senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York, in  a note to clients today.  Gas Production  Lower-48 state  natural gas output  climbed to a five-month
high in April as wells were brought online in the Northeast,
Texas and  New Mexico , government data showed last month.  Gross gas production in the contiguous states rose 0.8
percent to 73.24 billion cubic feet a day, the most since
November, from a revised 72.67 billion in March, the EIA’s
monthly  EIA-914  report showed June 28.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. increased
for the fourth consecutive week, rising by seven to 369, the
most since April 19, Baker Hughes Inc. data showed June 19. The
total has dropped 14 percent this year.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
