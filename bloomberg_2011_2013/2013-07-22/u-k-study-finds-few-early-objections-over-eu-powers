The first results of a study by
British civil servants of whether the European Union has too
much power found that most respondents view the division of
responsibilities with national governments as about right.  The “ Balance of Competences Review ” being conducted by
the Foreign Office is supposed to provide a basis for Prime
Minister David Cameron’s renegotiation of British membership,
leading up to a referendum in 2017 on leaving or staying in the
28-member bloc.  The first six reports, published in London today, cover the
single market, health, development cooperation and humanitarian
aid, foreign policy, animal health and welfare and food safety,
and taxation. Another 26 are due before the end of 2014. While
the U.K. invited all its fellow members of the EU to take part,
only Italy and  Bulgaria  put in formal submissions.  “They’re all fairly descriptive of the situation,” said
Christopher Howarth, a London-based senior analyst at Open
Europe, which campaigns for the EU to intervene less in national
politics. “At some point people will have to make decisions and
actual value judgments, which these reports don’t have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
