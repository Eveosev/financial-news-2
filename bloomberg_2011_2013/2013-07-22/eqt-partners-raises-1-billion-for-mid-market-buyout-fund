EQT Partners AB, Scandinavia’s
largest leveraged-buyout firm, raised about 820 million euros
($1 billion) for its first fund dedicated to buying controlling
stakes in small companies, two people with knowledge of the
talks said.  The firm held a first close on the fund at the end of June,
allowing it to start spending the money while continuing to
raise additional pledges to bring to its 1 billion-euro target,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are confidential.  The team, led by partner Jan Stahlberg, will buy majority
stakes of 25 million euros to 75 million euros in companies,
targets that fall outside the remit of its 4.75 billion-euro LBO
fund, a pool it raised in 2011 that focuses on larger deals.  The fund is Stockholm-based EQT’s first since it combined
its Asian investment group with its expansion capital team,
which took minority stakes in high-growth European companies, at
the start of the year. Unlike those earlier funds, the new pool
will invest in both  Europe  and  Asia  and take majority stakes.  About half the money raised came from wealthy families, the
people said. Officials at EQT declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
