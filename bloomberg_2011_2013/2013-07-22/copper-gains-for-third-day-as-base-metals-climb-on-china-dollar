Copper rose for a third day as the
dollar fell against most major peers, and as China moved toward
market-set lending rates. Zinc, lead, nickel and tin also gained.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange advanced as much as 1 percent to $6,985 a metric ton
and was at $6,978 at 10:27 a.m. in Shanghai. Metal for delivery
in November on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 1.2 percent to
50,130  yuan  ($8,169) a ton.  The U.S. currency extended back-to-back weekly drops
against the euro as Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill
Gross  said he expects the  Federal Reserve  won’t tighten policy
until 2016 at the earliest. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week
said it’s “too early” to decide on timing for tapering bond
purchases. The People’s Bank of China ended a floor on borrowing
costs previously set at 30 percent below the benchmark as the
government tries to boost growth in the long run by establishing
a more efficient financial system.  “The weakness in the dollar, coupled with growth-supportive measures in China, are lending support to copper,”
said Wang Jun, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co.  Copper for delivery in September on the Comex rose 0.6
percent to $3.1575 a pound. Net-short positions, or wagers on
falling Comex prices, held by funds fell to 15,673 futures and
options as of July 16 from 26,284 a week earlier, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
