Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest
cement-maker, said Chicago-based asset manager Harris Associates
LP acquired shares in the Swiss company and now owns a stake
worth about 654 million francs ($696 million).  Harris notified that it owned 3.04 percent of Holcim’s
shares July 19, the Jona-based cement-maker said today in a
 statement . That makes it the third largest shareholder behind
billionaire Thomas Schmidheiny and Eurocement, the Russian
cement-maker controlled by Filaret Galchev.  Schmidheiny owns a 20.1 percent stake while Eurocement has
10.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Holcim
doesn’t have further details of the purchase by Harris
Associates, Peter Stopfer, a spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
