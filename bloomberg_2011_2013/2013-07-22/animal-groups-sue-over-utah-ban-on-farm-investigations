Animal rights groups sued Utah’s
governor to challenge a state law they say is unconstitutional
because it criminalizes the collection of evidence of animal
abuse on factory farms.  The 2012 law creates the crime of “agricultural operation
interference” in an attempt to thwart undercover investigations
of agricultural operations, including slaughterhouses, in
violation of free speech and due process rights, according to a
complaint filed in federal court in  Salt Lake City  today.  The suit, filed by the Animal Legal Defense Fund and People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, names Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert and John Swallow, the state’s attorney general, as
defendants and seeks to prevent enforcement of the law.  Agricultural industry executives have pushed the law to
“silence the undercover investigations and corresponding media
coverage that contribute to public debate about animal treatment
and  food safety ,” according to the complaint.  Nate McDonald, a spokesman for Herbert, declined to
comment. Paul Murphy, a spokesman for Swallow, said he couldn’t
comment because his office hasn’t seen the complaint yet.  The case is Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Gary R. Herbert,
13-cv-00679, U.S. District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake
City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
