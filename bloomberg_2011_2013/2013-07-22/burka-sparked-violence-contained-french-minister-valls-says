French Interior Minister  Manuel Valls  said violence that rocked a Paris suburb for two nights
after a police check of a fully veiled woman is now under
control.  Protests that led to the  burning  of 20-odd cars, serious
injury to a teenager and a handful of arrests were triggered by
a July 18 identity check of the woman in a burka, a head-to-toe
veil worn by Muslim women, and the subsequent arrest of her
husband in Trappes, a town southwest of Paris.  Valls deployed police reinforcements over the last two days
in an effort to restore order and avoid a spread of rioting
similar to those that rocked Paris suburbs for weeks in the
autumn of 2005.  “The situation is now contained,” he said today on RTL
radio. “From the moment someone doesn’t respect the laws of the
republic, there’s a problem. We can’t be afraid to apply the
law.”  Wearing veils that cover the face has been illegal in public
spaces in  France  since former President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
instituted a law banning the practice two years ago. At 10
percent of the population, France has the highest proportion of
Muslims in  Europe .  The riots in 2005 were sparked by the electrocution of two
teenagers who being chased by the police and not linked to
burka-wearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
