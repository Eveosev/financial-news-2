Chariot Oil & Gas Ltd. (CHAR) , a U.K.
energy company in  Namibia , led declines among explorers in the
African country after a competitor’s well failed to find crude.  Chariot fell as much as 14 percent to 16.5 pence in London
trading, the lowest intraday price since September 2009.  Serica
Energy Plc (SQZ) , also operating in Namibia, dropped 5.4 percent.
 Tower Resources Plc (TRP)  retreated 7.7 percent.  The Murombe-1 well, drilled by  Brazil ’s  HRT Participacoes
em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) , will be abandoned after proving dry, partner
Galp Energia SGPS SA said yesterday in a statement. It’s a
further setback for explorers off Namibia, where 18 wells in
past decades have failed to find commercial deposits of crude.  Chariot traded at 17.25 pence as of 11:06 a.m. London time.
Galp rose 1.7 percent to 11.975 euros in Lisbon. HRT hadn’t yet
traded today in Brazil.  Namibia has attracted attention from the world’s biggest
oil companies, with  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Repsol SA (REP)  snapping up assets on a
bet that its coastal shelf may mirror that of Brazil across the
Atlantic Ocean, where the Lula discovery in 2007 was the
Americas’ biggest offshore find in three decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
