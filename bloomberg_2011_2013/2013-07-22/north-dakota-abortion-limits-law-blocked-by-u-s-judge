North Dakota ’s law barring abortions
if a fetal heartbeat is detected was blocked by a federal judge
who called the measure “a blatant violation” of U.S.  Supreme
Court  rulings.  U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland in Bismarck, North
Dakota, granted an order today temporarily blocking the law. He
said the lawsuit to overturn the statute by the state’s only
abortion provider was likely to succeed because the Supreme
Court has ruled no state may ban abortions that take place
before the fetus could survive outside the mother’s body.  The statute, scheduled to take effect on Aug. 1, makes it a
crime for doctors to terminate a pregnancy after six weeks of
gestation unless there’s a medical emergency. The suit was
brought by MKB Management Corp., which runs a womens’ clinic.  “The state of North Dakota has presented no evidence to
justify the passage of this troubling law,” Hovland said in his
ruling. “The state has extended an invitation to an expensive
court battle over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant
violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all
women.”  Hovland gave attorneys in the case 30 days to let him know
whether to schedule a trial on the merits of suit.  North Dakota officials argued that a woman’s right to an
abortion isn’t absolute and the state has an interest in
protecting the life of the unborn.  Liz Brocker, a spokeswoman for North Dakota Attorney
General Wayne Stenehjem, had no immediate comment on the ruling.  The case is MKB Management v. Burdick, 13-cv-71, U.S.
District Court, District of North Dakota (Bismarck).  To contact the reporter on this story:
