Maisons du Monde SAS, the French home-furnishing chain in talks to be bought by private-equity firm  Bain Capital  LLC, plans to open its first German store in November, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The chain, which already delivers online in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, plans to set up the outlet in the Rhine River city of Koblenz, the people said, declining to be identified because the information isn’t public yet.  An official for Maisons du Monde wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Maisons du Monde founder and Chief Executive Officer Xavier Marie opened the chain’s first store in  Bordeaux , France, in 1996. The company now has 220 outlets its home country as well as  Belgium ,  Italy , Luxembourg and  Spain , and delivers in 12 nations, according to its website. The retailer sells items such as wooden dinner tables for 449 euros ($590) and leather sofas for 1,399 euros.  Apax Partners LLP and LBO France took control of Maisons du Monde in 2008 in cooperation with Marie. Bain Capital is in exclusive talks to buy the company from those investors and Nixen Partners SAS, the private-equity firms said on June 20. The business had sales of 500 million euros last year, more than double the 230 million euros reported in 2007, according to the companies.
