Euro-area government debt swelled in
the first quarter, driven by  Italy  and the five countries
receiving international aid amid Europe’s fiscal crisis.  State debt in the 17-nation euro zone rose to 92.2 percent
of gross domestic product from 88.2 percent in the first three
months of 2012, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today.  Intergovernmental lending in the context of the financial
crisis increased to 2.1 percent of GDP from 1.2 percent in the
year-earlier period, Eurostat said.  The euro-area economy, which has contracted for  six
straight quarters , probably stagnated in the three months
through June and will return to growth this quarter, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The International
Monetary Fund forecasts the euro economy to shrink 0.6 percent
this year.  Government debt in  Greece , the recipient of two bailout
programs since the crisis broke out there in 2009, soared to
160.5 percent of GDP from 136.5 percent in the year-earlier
period, according to today’s report.  Italy had the second-highest first-quarter debt level in
the euro area at 130.3 percent of GDP, up from 123.8 percent a
year earlier, Eurostat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
