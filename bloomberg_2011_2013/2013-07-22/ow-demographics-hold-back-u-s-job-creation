The U.S. unemployment and
underemployment picture isn’t as extreme as the statistics I
discussed yesterday would indicate.  Labor-force participation rates  tend to drop as people age
and retire or otherwise leave the workforce. For the postwar
generation, born between 1946 and 1964, this has resulted in a
downward trend in the total participation rate, which was 63.5
percent in June, compared with 67.4 percent in early 2000, but
it doesn’t account for all of the decline.  Participation rates of younger people, though they are
declining, tend to be higher than for senior citizens. For 16-to 24-year-olds, the rate has declined sharply since 2000 as
slow economic growth, limited jobs and rising  unemployment rates 
have encouraged them to stay in school or otherwise stay out of
the  labor force . The participation rate jumps with age, from
about 55 percent for the 16 to 24 group, to 80 percent or higher
for those in the 25 to 34, 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 groups. Yet
even for these demographics, the participation rate is
declining, and unemployment rates have risen on balance since
2000.  Because of early retirement, the labor-force participation
rate for 55- to 64-year-olds, about 65 percent, is lower than
for the three younger age groups. Participation among 55- to 64-year-olds has been mostly unchanged in recent years, even though
unemployment for this cohort has increased on balance.  Stock Market  The unemployment rates for 65- to 75-year-olds and for the
75 and older have also risen, but their participation rates have
climbed since the late 1990s because they have been forced to
work longer than they had planned. Many in these age groups have
been poor savers and were devastated by the collapse in stocks
from 2007 to 2009 and after the 2000-to-2002 decline, two of
only five drops of more than 40 percent in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index since 1900.  In addition, older Americans were affected by a collapse of
more than 30 percent in  house prices , which wiped out the equity
that many had counted on for retirement. Even with the increase
in house prices in the last year, 20 percent of home mortgages
remain more than the homes are worth.  Furthermore, increasing life spans mean many older people
are able to work longer, curtailing job opportunities for
younger people.  The rising participation rate for older people is a
relatively rare break in a downward trend: In the 1880s, 78
percent of men 65 and older worked; in 1990, that figure was
16.3 percent. It bounced back to 22.1 percent in 2010.
Interestingly, when Social Security was enacted in 1937, the
life expectancy for American men was about 65 --- the required
age for drawing benefits. Now,  life expectancy  is 76.3 for men
and 81.1 years for women, but the eligibility age to collect
full benefits has risen to only 67.  Nevertheless, the U.S. now ranks only 17th in life
expectancy among developed countries. And that’s true even for
wealthier, college-educated Americans. The U.S. is plagued by
high rates of obesity and diabetes, heart and  lung disease , as
well as drug-related deaths and sexually transmitted diseases,
infant mortality, injuries, homicides and teen pregnancies. A
study in the Journal of the  American Medical Association  found
that though people are living longer, they’re also experiencing
more years living with disabilities.  The primary reason for the shorter U.S. life expectancy,
however, is the high mortality of men under 50 because of
accidents and violence. Also, women’s life expectancy gains have
fallen behind those of other  rich countries . The U.S. spends
more on health care than many other advanced countries, but lags
in effectiveness. Nevertheless, Americans who live past 75 have
higher life expectancies than people in many other similar
countries.  Participation Rates  The participation rates for older people are relatively
low, 26.6 percent for 65- to 74-year-olds and 8.4 percent for
those over 75, but they are rising. Also, the share of the
population over 55 is climbing; the first of the postwar babies
turned 65 in 2011. So, younger people have higher but falling
participation rates, while those for older Americans are lower
but rising. The decline in the total participation rate is
partly due to demographics -- the aging of the population -- and
partly due to other factors, principally the poor job markets in
the last two decades.  In the 1970s and 1980s, the participation rate was hyped by
more working women (a trend that’s diminishing) and the  baby
boomers  were entering the prime working ages of 25 to 54. The
oldest members of this group entered this category in 1971, but
by 1989, they had all been absorbed into the workforce. In 2001,
the oldest of the boomers turned 55, and in 2019, they will all
be out of their prime participation rate years.  The average participation rate for the 25- to 54-year-olds
has been in the 80 percent to 85 percent range since 1991, while
for 16- to 24-year-olds and 55- to 64-year-olds, it was 55
percent, and it was less than 30 percent for those 65 and older.  Considering that the oldest boomers started to enter the
65-plus age bracket in 2011 and the youngest members are only
49, I expect the age-related effects of the labor force
participation rate to continue to decline as more and more
boomers retire. That means we could see the total participation
rate drop below 60 percent in the next 20 years, compared with
63.5 percent today and 67.4 percent in early 2000.  Those still working would have a lot more retirees to
support through Social Security and Medicare, and by producing
the goods and services the older folks still consume. This
effect of an aging population is a serious concern for all
developed countries, but most significantly for  Japan , where
people live longest and there is no immigration.  Immigration Policy  In contrast, the U.S., along with Canada and  Australia , is
relatively open to immigrants, and because these new arrivals
tend to be younger, they help support retirees. Note that the
ratio of working-age people to retirees is dropping in all Group
of Seven countries, but is moving toward much lower levels in
Japan (to 1.5 by 2040, according to the  United Nations ) and
Europe (below 2 in many instances) than in the U.S. (2.9 by
2040) and Canada (2.5).  Nevertheless, labor-force participation rates for older age
groups will continue to increase in coming years as the baby
boomers are forced to reconcile their low retirement savings
with increased life spans and rising medical costs.  Social
Security  and Medicare will probably provide less of a safety net
as Congress is forced to deal with rising entitlement costs.
This is already evident from the rising participation rates for
those 55 and older in recent years.  My company’s research shows that from February 2000 to June
2013, demographics accounted for 2.5 percentage points of the 4-point decline in the overall participation rate, from 67.4
percent to 63.5 percent.  About 1.6 percentage points of the decline in the total
participation rate was due to nondemographic reasons by young
and middle-aged people. Many younger people have been in
college, especially since the recession began in 2007. There has
been a rise in enrollment of both 14- to 24-year-olds and 25- to
34-year-olds in college and graduate schools since then.  But with college tuition and fees continuing to rise, and
with costs for private schools exceeding public ones, many
students are opting for public colleges, as discussed in my July
2012 Bloomberg View columns.  Yet many recent college graduates with soft majors like
sociology from all but the top schools find themselves with huge
student debt and can only find low paying jobs, if any.  About half of recent graduates are working in jobs that
don’t require a college education, and surveys show that the
income of those who are unemployed or underemployed in the first
few years after graduation never catches up with those who
immediately found well-paid positions.  Many young people and their parents may decide that
financially straining for a college degree that leads to high
debt and grim job prospects is a poor choice. They may decide
that junior college-apprenticeship programs leading to skilled
trades such as computerized machine operations or plumbing are
better matches for their abilities and promise much higher
incomes.  At that point, the number of people who are out of the
labor force for nondemographic reasons may fall. Meanwhile, many
young and middle-aged people have simply dropped out or taken
part-time jobs.  (A. Gary Shilling is a Bloomberg View columnist and
