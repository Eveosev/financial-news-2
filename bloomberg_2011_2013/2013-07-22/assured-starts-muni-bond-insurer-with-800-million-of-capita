Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) , the bond-insurer downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service in January,
created a new unit to back the debt of U.S. states and cities.  Municipal Assurance Corp. was started with $800 million of
cash and securities contributed by two other Assured units and
an agreement with those subsidiaries to reinsure $103 billion of
muni bonds that allowed it to set up reserves of $709 million of
unearned premium, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured said in a
statement today.  The new unit was graded AA+ by Kroll Bond Rating Agency,
that firm’s second-highest ranking, and two steps lower at AA-by Standard & Poor’s, the ratings companies said in separate
statements. Municipal Assurance will guarantee “lower-risk
categories” in the U.S. public finance market, Kroll said in
its statement.  Moody’s cut its ratings on Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.
two levels to A2, its sixth-highest rating, from Aa3 in January.
Another unit, Assured Guaranty Corp., was lowered three steps to
A3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
