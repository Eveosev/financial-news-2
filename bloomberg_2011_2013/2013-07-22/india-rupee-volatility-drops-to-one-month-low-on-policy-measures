Volatility in  India ’s rupee fell to
a one-month low on speculation steps by the central bank to
boost returns on local-currency assets will be offset by the
country’s slowing growth and record current-account deficit.  The  Reserve Bank  of India’s move last week to raise two of
its  interest rates  while keeping the main repurchase rate
unchanged doesn’t signal a shift toward a tightening bias,
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in Moscow on July
20. The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade widened to
4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year ended March 31,
as the economy grew at 5 percent, the slowest pace in a decade.  “Despite the RBI’s measures, headroom for rupee
appreciation is not significant given India’s current-account
deficit and weaker growth,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at
DBS Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 43 basis points,
or 0.43 percentage point, to 11.37 percent, the lowest level
since June 20, as of 9:49 a.m. in Mumbai. The rate reached 13.64
percent on July 9, the highest since May 2012.  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 59.4238 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reversed an earlier decline on July 19 to close 0.6
percent stronger on speculation the RBI sold dollars, according
to two traders with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
named as the information isn’t public.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards strengthened 0.5 percent
to 60.63 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore
non-deliverable contracts rose 0.1 percent to 60.6. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
