Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
South Africa’s second-biggest builder, apologized for colluding
on contracts for work including 2010 soccer World Cup stadiums
and said a $31 million fine is too harsh.  “Of the projects we successfully tendered on, our gross
profit was far less than the 309 million-rand ($31 million)
penalty,” Murray & Roberts Chief Executive Officer Henry Laas
said in a letter published by the Sunday Times. “This penalty
would be severe in normal times, and given the difficult market
conditions, it is all the more acute.”  The Competition Tribunal today confirmed fines for 13 of 15
companies. Decisions for the remaining two,  Aveng Ltd. (AEG) , South
Africa’s biggest builder by market value, and Giuricich Bros
Construction (Pty) Ltd, are still pending awaiting more
information, the Pretoria-based tribunal said in an e-mailed
statement. Murray & Roberts,  Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon Ltd. (WBO)  and
12 other construction companies faced record collective fees of
1.46 billion rand for contract rigging.  Documents from the Competition Commission show that seven
companies colluded to rig a profit margin of 17.5 percent on six
stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. They met twice, in 2006
or thereabouts, according to the documents.  The seven-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction and Building
Materials Index  has declined 1.2 percent this year, compared
with a 4.2 percent gain in the 166-member FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index.  Murray & Roberts  shares  rose 2 percent to 25.76 rand at the
close in Johannesburg, the highest since July 16, valuing the
company at 11.5 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
