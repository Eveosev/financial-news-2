Egon Durban, the Silver Lake
Management LLC partner leading the firm’s investment in the
$24.4 billion buyout of  Dell Inc. (DELL) , canceled an appearance at
Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference today.  Daniel Leonard, a spokesman for Time Inc., the owner of
Fortune magazine, said that Durban had backed out of the
conference starting today in Aspen, Colorado. Durban was
scheduled to be on a panel today with Patrick Whitesell, the co-chief executive officer of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment
LLC, to discuss Silver Lake’s investment in the talent agency.  Durban scrapped the trip after deciding that it wasn’t
appropriate to make a public appearance so close to the July 24
shareholder vote on the buyout, said a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be named because the matter was
private. Durban is trying to avoid creating distractions ahead
of the vote, as he keeps in touch with the firm’s proxy
solicitors on developments, said the person.  Silver Lake, which is undertaking the buyout with founder
 Michael Dell , has no plans to sweeten its offer of $13.65 a
share to sway investors, according to that person. Dell, based
in  Round Rock , Texas, is the third-largest maker of personal
computers. A representative for Silver Lake didn’t immediately
reply to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
