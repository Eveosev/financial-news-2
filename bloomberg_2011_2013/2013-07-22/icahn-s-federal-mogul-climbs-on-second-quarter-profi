Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML) , the auto-parts
maker controlled by billionaire  Carl Icahn , surged the most in
more than four years after returning to a profit in the second
quarter and investor Mario Gabelli boosted his stake to more
than 5 percent.  The shares climbed 31 percent to $13.95 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 30, 2008. The
Southfield, Michigan-based companyâ€™s stock has increased 74
percent this year, compared with a 24 percent rise for the
 Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)  Federal-Mogul was the biggest gainer in the
 index  today.  Icahn owns  81 percent  of the maker of auto parts, including
Anco wiper blades and Champion spark plugs. Federal-Mogul is
closing factories, mostly in North America and Western Europe,
and moving work to lower-cost locations such as Mexico, China
and  Poland  by 2015.  Federal-Mogul reported before the start of regular trading
that second-quarter net income totaled $56 million, or 57 cents
a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $59 million, or 60
cents. Revenue rose 5.8 percent to $1.77 billion from a year
earlier. Gabelli, in a regulatory filing just before the close,
said he raised his stake to 7.52 million shares, or 5.01
percent. Gabelli held a 3.14 percent stake as of March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company also said today it completed a shareholder
rights offering on July 9 that generated $500 million in
proceeds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
