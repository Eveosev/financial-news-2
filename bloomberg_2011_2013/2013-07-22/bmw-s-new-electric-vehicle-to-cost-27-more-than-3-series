Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  will
offer the i3, the luxury-car maker’s first electric vehicle,
starting at $41,350 in the U.S., 27 percent more than the base
version of the best-selling 3-Series sedan.  The car will cost 34,950 euros ($46,000) in Germany, where
it will be available as of November, the Munich-based company
said in a statement today. Buyers in the U.S. will also have to
pay a $925 transport fee for the car.  BMW, the world’s biggest maker of  luxury vehicles , will
show the model for the first time on July 29 at simultaneous
events in New York, London and Beijing. BMW has invested 600
million euros in production facilities for the car, including
building a new factory in  Moses Lake , Washington, that makes
carbon fiber for the passenger cell.  By designing the vehicle specifically for electric power,
BMW is seeking to gain an edge over fellow German carmakers.
Currently, an electric version of  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Smart two-seater
is the only available battery-powered vehicle from a German
manufacturer.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  plans to start marketing the E-Golf
hatchback by the end of the year.  BMW will offer additional services such as at-home charging
stations and car sharing to ease concerns about the limited
range of the vehicle. The company plans to sell the i3 through
the Internet, sales people that visit customers in their homes
and through select dealers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
