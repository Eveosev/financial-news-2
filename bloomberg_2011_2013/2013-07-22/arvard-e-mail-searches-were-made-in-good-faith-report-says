Harvard University’s searches of its
resident deans’ e-mail accounts to find the source of leaks to
the media were conducted in “good faith,” according to a
report by an outside lawyer.  Harvard officials who performed and authorized the searches
were trying to protect student confidentiality and were “faced
with inadequate university policies” for electronic privacy,
according to a report released today from Michael Keating of the
Foley Hoag LLP law firm.  Harvard officials were concerned that confidential
information had leaked to the student newspaper from the
university’s Administrative Board, a disciplinary body, related
to a cheating scandal that involved about 125 students. Evelynn
Hammonds, the former dean of the undergraduate college who
authorized the e-mail searches, stepped down after an outcry.  The report confirms that “that the individuals involved in
the searches were acting in good faith, in a manner they
believed to be consistent with applicable policy and with a
guiding responsibility for safeguarding student
confidentiality,” and the disciplinary process, Harvard
President Drew Faust said today in a  statement  on the university
website.  The report underlines the necessity for Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Harvard, the oldest and richest U.S.
college, to update its policies for electronic communication
security, Faust said. She has appointed a task force to develop
new guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
