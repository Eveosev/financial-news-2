Fotowatio Renewable Ventures B.V, a
solar developer, has been offered a power-purchase accord with
Uruguay’s state utility to develop a 50-megawatt solar park.  The developer, backed by U.S. investor Denham Capital
Management LP, was offered the 30-year deal with Administracion
Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas, FRV said today in
an e-mailed statement. The park will be built in the northern
Uruguayan town of Salto next year once permits are secured.  Uruguay began its first tender for large-scale photovoltaic
plants on May 27 seeking to support as much as 200 megawatts of
projects to diversify its generation. The plants, requiring a
total of about $400 million of investment, will be paid $91.5
per megawatt hour generated. The rate is the world’s lowest for
solar power, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  FRV, based in Amsterdam, has developed solar projects with
more than 350 megawatts and operates plants in Spain and  Italy .
Denham bought a majority stake in the company in March 2012,
agreeing to invest $190 million in solar projects in markets
such as  Australia ,  South Africa  and  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
