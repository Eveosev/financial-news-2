Japan ’s bonds rose, sending 10-year
yields to the lowest in two months, after Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s ruling coalition solidified control of parliament in
elections yesterday and as central-bank operations to buy the
securities from the market boosted demand.  The five-year rate fell to the lowest in six weeks after
the  Bank of Japan  offered to buy 650 billion yen ($6.5 billion)
of government debt in two batches today. The leading bond
futures contract rose to the highest since May. Abe’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  of Japan and its New Komeito ally now have 135
of the 242 seats in the upper house, according to estimates by
state broadcaster NHK.  “The upper house election result was largely expected, so
the reaction in the  bond market  was rather muted,” said Takuma Sugawara, a senior JGB strategist in Tokyo at Societe Generale
SA, one of the 23 primary dealers obliged to bid at government
debt auctions. “Bonds extended gains after the BOJ bond-purchase operations.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.785 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in Tokyo, the
lowest since May 14, according Japan Bond Trading Co., the
country’s largest inter-dealer debt broker. The 0.8 percent
security maturing in June 2023 added 0.183 yen to 100.137. Ten-year futures rose 0.20 to 143.64 after earlier reaching 143.72,
the highest for leading contracts since May 10.  The five-year yield slid 1 1/2 basis points to 0.27
percent, the lowest since June 10. The 30-year yield slid one
basis point to 1.825 percent.  The purchase of bonds maturing in 5 to 10 years drew bids
valued at 2.44 times the amount of debt that the BOJ offered to
buy, down from 3.45 at the previous operation for the tenors,
central bank figures showed. The buying of bonds with more than
10-years to maturity had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.98, lower
than the 3.93 at the prior operation.  The Ministry of Finance will auction as much as 1.2
trillion yen of 20-year bonds on July 25. Primary dealers often
reduce holdings of bonds ahead of sales in case prices decline
before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
