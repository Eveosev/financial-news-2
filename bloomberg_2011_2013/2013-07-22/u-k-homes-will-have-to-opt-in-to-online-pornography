U.K. Internet suppliers will have to
block access to pornography unless customers opt to receive it,
an effort to help parents stop children viewing unsuitable
material, Prime Minister  David Cameron  announced.  The premier said all new customers will automatically have
family-friendly filters installed, and existing customers will
be contacted and told they must say whether they want to turn
those filters on or off. Those who don’t reply will have the
filters activated.  Cameron urged search-engine providers such as  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  to “step up to the plate” and
stop providing results when people search for images of child
abuse.  “There needs to be a list of terms -- a blacklist -- which
offer up no direct search returns,” Cameron said in a speech in
London today. “There are some searches which are so abhorrent
and where they can be no doubt whatsoever about the sick and
malevolent intent of the searcher. I have a very clear message
for Google, Bing, Yahoo and the rest. You have a duty to act on
this -- and it is a moral duty.”  He said he wants  search engines  to report to him by October
on their progress.  “There’s lots of complicated and difficult questions that
have to be answered and that’s why we have to work with the
companies,” Cameron said on BBC Radio 2’s “Jeremy Vine Show”
today. “I know it’s hard but that’s not a reason for doing
nothing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
