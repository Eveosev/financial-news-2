Hezbollah is “too big to be
isolated,” a senior member of the Lebanese militant group said,
as the European Union weighed blacklisting its military wing.  Hezbollah “will stand firm” against the pressures, Sheik
Nabil Qawooq, deputy chief of the Iranian-backed group’s
executive council, said at a funeral in the southern Lebanese
village of Selaa, the official National News Agency said today.  EU foreign ministers today will debate a proposal to label
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah’s military wing a terrorist
organization. Britain led the push after the group was linked to
terror activity on European soil.  While no preliminary agreement has yet been reached, a
consensus has taken shape to do so, said an EU official, who
spoke to reporters in Brussels July 19 on condition of
anonymity. Last-minute objections by Lebanon’s government may
affect the debate, the official said. The U.S. and  Israel 
already list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.  The group, whose fighters are battling alongside Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, is also a major political player in
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has said it will ask the EU not
to add Hezbollah to the terror list, calling the group an
“essential component of Lebanese society.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
