Gasoline fell on speculation that
refinery shutdowns that boosted prices last week will soon be
resolved and production will increase.  Futures sank as much as 1.4 percent. August gasoline’s
premium to September narrowed, indicating less concern that the
outages would drain supplies. Futures rose three consecutive
weeks on speculation that upsets at plants along  North America ’s
East Coast might crimp  New York  Harbor supply. Crack spreads
narrowed.  “Gasoline is down on expectation that several of the
refinery issues in the Northeast will be resolved this week,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  August-delivery gasoline fell 3.87 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $3.0847 a gallon at 10:21 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  on trading volume that was 19 percent below the 100-day
average. Gasoline has gained 12 percent in July, the best
performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  August gasoline’s premium to September narrowed 1.96 cents
to 4.57 cents a gallon. Gasoline sank 3.95 cents versus August
ultra-low-sulfur diesel to 0.55-cent discount.  Speculative bullish  gasoline wagers  jumped by 19,244
futures and options combined, or 59 percent, to 51,737 contracts
in the seven days ended July 16, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s July 19 Commitments of Traders
report.  Issues Resolved  “Some of those refinery issues are going to get
resolved,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  “We had an awful lot of
length piled into the market. Some of it could be unwinding and
some of the gas-to-heat spread length is getting unwound.”  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed $1.36 to $21.77
a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent fell 86 cents to $19.51.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, were unchanged at $3.671
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery rose 0.08 cent
to $3.0902 a gallon on volume that was 8.7 percent below the
100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 28 cents to $22.13 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
declined 14 cents to $21.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
