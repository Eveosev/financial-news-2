The yen may rally to its strongest
level in almost five months versus the dollar after breaking a
key level of resistance, according to Bank of America Corp.  The Japanese currency will face a test in the 98.30-to-98.76 area after breaching initial resistance at 99.58 today,
according to  MacNeil Curry , chief rates and currencies technical
strategist in  New York  at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If the
yen increases past that resistance level, it may target 90.91,
Curry said. That would be its strongest level since February.  “As dollar-yen traded up towards 103, we started to see
signs of topping out, with an advance in stocks starting to look
a bit exhausted,” Curry said in a telephone interview. “The
upside for dollar-yen is limited. We could see a run down to the
93, potentially the 91 area.”  The yen increased 1.1 percent to 99.55 per dollar in New
York, after rising as much as 1.4 percent, the most since July
11.  Japan ’s currency has declined 10.2 percent this year, the
most among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar and the euro each
advanced 4.6 percent.  “We’re still bullish dollar,” Curry said. “But we’re in
a medium-term range-bound trading environment before the larger
yen-bear trend resumes.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
