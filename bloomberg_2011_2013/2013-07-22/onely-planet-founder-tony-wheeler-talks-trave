Tony Wheeler didn't invent the guidebook, but as the co-founder, with his wife, Maureen, of Lonely Planet, he has influenced through his books at least two generations of budget-minded, open-minded world travelers. The couple sold their stake in the publisher in 2011, but Tony remains involved in travel through the  Global Heritage Fund , a non-profit that works to preserve what Wheeler calls "second-level archeological sites" that often don't get the funding that iconic destinations like Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat can draw. He's also at work on a follow up to his 2010 book,  Bad Lands , a first-hand account of travels through some of the world's most dangerous and repressive countries. His new book,  Dark Lands , is a sort-of sequel about the perils of travel and will hit shelves in September. Seems even after Wheeler sold his powerhouse, he couldn't leave publishing altogether. We spoke to him recently about the Global Heritage Fund, his life post-Lonely Planet, and the reason he'll probably never take a cruise again. What's Global Heritage Fund hoping to accomplish? Global Heritage Fund looks after the second-level archeological sites. I went to one of their projects in Cambodia last year. Everybody goes to Angkor Wat; Global Heritage Fund has a project called  Banteay Chhmar  that's fabulous—but at the moment they're getting 500 tourists per year, about 10 a week, so it's just not the same. They asked me to join the board because they've got lots of archeologists and that sort of thing but with these sites you need tourists going to them as well. I'm the tourist. The idea being that, if more tourists visit, these sites can start to be self-sustaining? It's a bit like wildlife in Africa: If you don't have people coming to see the wildlife, you don't have any reason to protect that wildlife. I was in Zimbabwe about 12 months ago, and the places where tourism went downhill the most in recent years is where the most damage is happening to the wildlife. The places where some of the lodges and things carried on, there were still tourists there, there were still jobs there for safari guides, and so on. I think it's the same thing with these archeological sites. If you get tourists coming there every year, it's much more difficult for people to come in and steal things. If you don't have tourists, there isn't the incentive for local people to look after these things. Does someone like you, who has been to so many exotic places, have a bucket list? When did bucket list the word come along? I don't know! It was in a movie or something. Yeah, there was  that movie . I haven't seen it actually. I didn't know it was going to be called a bucket list later on, but in the early '90s I drew up 15 things I wanted to do, and I knocked off some of them right away. I finally did another of them last September, and that was the 14th. That was doing the Karakoram Highway, which goes up through Pakistan into China. My wife and I turned up in Pakistan just as  this whole business about the blasphemous movie kicked off . The third day we were there, 21 people were killed, Pakistanis in riots, it was crazy. But we had a really good time. Really? It doesn't sound like a good time. The road winds through the mountains and goes over this 16,000-foot pass down into China, and we would come into these little towns. You'd open the door to the hotel, and everybody is crowded around the television and on the television it's all "Death to America," "Kill the movie maker," and the riots. Then they'd see or hear the door closing, and they'd look at us and say "Oh, foreigners, come in. Would you like some tea?" So what was on the television and what they were doing were entirely different things. So we had a really interesting time. What's the best, hard-won travel advice you can share? Something's going to go wrong at all times; you might as well be prepared for it. You're always going to be having some new experience you preferred not to have. I cannot believe how many places I've been to that whatever they say is the prime scam, it happens. My wife had her bag snatched by a motorcycle rider in Sicily once; the guy just rode by and then there's her bag going down the street at 50 miles an hour. You know it's a classic Sicilian thing, like if you go to Sicily and don't have your bag snatched you almost feel like "Well, why didn't I get my bag snatched?" Any other bucket list items? Taking one of the Cunard ships across the Atlantic. Last May, I looked at the schedule and the Queen Mary was sailing out of New York on precisely the right day and my wife and I said "someone intended that." So we took the Queen Mary to Southampton. It's one of those things where I'm really glad I've done it—but I don't need to do it again. All these people would say "Oh, this is my 34th Cunard trip" and "I've been across the Atlantic with them 14 times." It's great for a week, but at the end of the week, I've done it. I don't ever need to do another cruise ship. The one thing that's still on my list: I've never done the Trans-Siberian Railway. But I'm doing that July this year. That's something I've always wanted to do. The other tourist thing I did in that region was going to see a space launch at Baikonur, and I tell you who was on the trip with us: Sergey Brin and Larry Page, so I spent three days with them. Do you recall who was flying into space that day? Richard Garriott. His father was a genuine NASA astronaut, and he always wanted to go up but he never joined NASA or anything—but he made a squillion dollars from computer games. Not only does it cost you about $20 million for two weeks up at the space station, but you also have to learn Russian, you have to be able to speak Russian, and you have to spend six months at the Cosmonaut training center in Moscow. We had a day at the training center, so we sort of saw what goes on there. When launch time came, there were a bunch of NASA guys there—there was a NASA astronaut onboard—and the NASA guys were saying, "Well if this were Cape Canaveral, we would be in a concrete bunker three miles away from this thing." We were standing out in a field with the rocket just right over there, and there was a sort of barbed wire fence and somebody said, "If you want to get a bit closer, just ignore the fence." When it went up, you let the dust hit you and you felt the heat. It was fabulous. The founders of Google were probably well behaved, but have you ever witnessed any boorish behavior from travelers? Yeah, but I think we all do it, don’t we? The ones that amuse me: the Germans have this terrible reputation for taking lounges around swimming pools and I’ve seen signs—they’re all in German—that say “you cannot book the pool lounger at dawn.” That’s the German bad travel habit and Australians get drunk everywhere and Americans are loud and the British are stuck up and the French, well, we all have something we do and if we don’t do these things, we’re a little bit disappointed that we don’t live up to our bad reputations. And the Chinese are getting a reputation as well. There was  a great article in  The New Yorker  about the American guy who joined the Chinese tour group . That was a fantastic article; I loved that. Do you have a favorite seat on an airplane? I’m really unhappy unless I get a window seat. I really want to look out. The worst thing is people who want to put their blinds down and watch the movie while there’s a volcano below and it’s erupting. I want to look out and see what’s happening. Are you going to be an in-flight Wi-Fi person when it becomes ubiquitous? Oh I hope not. I’m as guilty as the next person of constantly checking emails and being unhappy if I don’t know what’s going on—yet it’s a bad habit. I took this walk out in Colombia two months ago. You know, five days with no email. It was great. The only trouble is that at the end of the five days, the emails are all going to be there. Do you have a pre-flight ritual? “Passport. Where’s my passport?” Actually, I was going out to the airport in London yesterday with a taxi driver, and he asked me “Have you got your passport?” I asked him if he often had people who didn't, and he said a few times a year. It’s most often with really frequent travelers, people who, you know, have to suddenly go to New York tomorrow. It’s not the people taking the once-a-year trip; they remember. But if you’re flying 20 or 30 times a year, one of those 20 or 30 times you’re just going to forget. One of the things I’ve started doing—old age—is a checklist on my laptop. I open it the day before and look at what I need to take and what I don't need to take. Any other packing tips? No, it’s different every time. And let’s face it, that wonderful saying is still really good: “When you finish packing, open your bag again and take out half of what’s in there and then put twice as much money in your wallet." It still works? It still works. Does it feel like 40 years has passed since you started Lonely Planet? No, it’s one of those things where you can’t believe how fast time passes. It’s interesting that there are a lot of people who were starting off around the same time. Guide du Routard, their first book came out the same month as us. And Moon Publications; I’ve known Bill Dalton from the very beginning and he did his book, I think, six weeks ahead of us. So Moon Publications started the same year, so it’s their 40th anniversary as well. That was obviously the right time to do things. And it’s all been fun. More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
