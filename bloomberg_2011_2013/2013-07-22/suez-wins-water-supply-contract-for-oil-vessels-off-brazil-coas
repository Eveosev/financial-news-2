Suez Environnement (SEV) , the second-largest water company in Europe, won a supply contract for
vessels involved in offshore oil production in Brazil.  Degremont, Suez’s water-management subsidiary, was awarded
an engineering and procurement contract for four water-supply
units for Keppel FELS Brasil and its affiliates Lindel Private
Ltd. and Estaleiro BrasFELS Ltda.  The water-supply units, two of them seawater desalination,
will equip two floating production, storage and offloading or
FPSOs vessels ordered by Tupi BV, a subsidiary of state-owned
Petrobras Brasileiro SA, for offshore oil production in Brazil.
The other two are sulphate removal units that treat seawater to
make it suitable for water injection, helping avoid clogging
rock reservoirs and contributing to enhanced oil recovery, Suez
said today in a statement. No contract terms were disclosed.  Following the discovery of ultra-deep reservoirs 300
kilometers off shore,  Brazil  will become the sixth-largest oil
producer by 2020, said Remi Lantier, chief executive officer of
Degremont. With the contract, “Degremont proves its capability
to accompany Petrobras in its needs for innovative water
solutions for upstream oil and gas production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
