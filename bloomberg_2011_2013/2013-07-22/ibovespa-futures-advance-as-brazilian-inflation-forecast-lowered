Ibovespa  futures  rose as economists
covering  Brazil  reduced their forecasts for inflation, easing
concern that higher prices will sap the recovery in  Latin
America ’s largest economy.  Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, may move after its second-quarter earnings trailed
analysts’ estimates. Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo
SA  may be active after saying that it failed to find oil in a
well drilled in  Namibia .  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August rose 0.2
percent to 47,475 at 9:32 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real climbed
0.2 percent to 2.2417 per dollar. Consumer prices as measured by
the IPCA index will rise 5.75 percent this year, down from a
forecast of 5.80 percent a week earlier, according to a central
bank survey released today.  “The latest data available suggest that inflation is
slowing down a bit,” Gustavo Mendonca, who helps manage 1
billion reais as an economist at Saga Capital, said by phone
from  Rio de Janeiro . “It’s still a matter of concern for sure,
but a bit less than it was.”  The Ibovespa slumped 22 percent this year through July 19,
wiping out $236 billion from the  value  of Brazilian equities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s main equity
gauge trades at 11.8 times analysts’  earnings estimates  for the
next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 4.37 billion
reais on July 19, which compares with a daily average of 7.77
billion reais this year through July 18, according to data
 compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
