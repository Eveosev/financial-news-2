Zambia will allow emeralds mined in
the country to be auctioned abroad if companies wishing to do so
justify the move, the minister of mines said.  Gemfields Plc (GEM) ’s auction last week in Lusaka, the capital,
was the company’s most successful sale to date, proving the
country as a viable destination, Christopher Yaluma told
reporters today.  Yaluma’s predecessor Yamfwa Mukanga in April said the
government wanted all emerald auctions to take place in the
country. The move would “materially constrain” revenue from
Gemfields’ Kagem mine, the world’s biggest single source of the
gems, the company said at the time. The government has since
held talks with the company, which both sides described as
positive.  The company’s shares rose as much as 7.3 percent and were
trading 4.9 percent higher at 21.5 pence by 2:54 p.m. in  London .  “I’m not going to say I’m rigid” on auctions being held
outside  Zambia , Yaluma said. “If they come tomorrow and they
give us solid reasons as to why it should go out, we are not
going to be rigid.”  Gemfields’ Lusaka auction of higher-grade emeralds that
closed on July 19 generated sales of $31.5 million, and the
highest price by weight the company has achieved, it said in a
statement to the Regulatory News Service. All stones offered
were sold for the first time at the auction, Chief Executive
Officer Ian Harebottle said in an interview on July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
