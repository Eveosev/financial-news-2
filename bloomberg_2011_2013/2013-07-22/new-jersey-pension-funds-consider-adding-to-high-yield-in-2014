The  New Jersey  Division of
Investments, the manager of seven pension funds in the state
valued at $74.3 billion, plans to add as much as $500 million to
its high-yield portfolio next year.  The state pension fund with the second-highest revenue in
2012 may expand its high-yield holdings to more than $4 billion
from $3.5 billion in 2014, Tim Walsh, director of the division,
said in a telephone interview. It contributed an additional $100
million to investments in high yield in May, he said.  “We try to take advantage when things go down,” Walsh
said on July 16. “If we get a little concerned, we’ll take
money off the table.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold speculative-grade
bonds rather than  government securities  was 6.49 percentage
points on July 19, up from 5.98 percentage points on May 9,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. High Yield
Index. High-yield, high-risk debt is graded below Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard &
Poor’s .  New Jersey’s funds may also invest in floating-rate debt to
benefit from a potential rise in  interest rates , Walsh said.  “The floating rate is something that intrigues us,” he
said. “We have done a little bit in the past. I wouldn’t say
it’s significant by any means.”  Ten-year Treasury  securities  yielded 2.48 percent at 10:56
a.m. in New York, an increase of 72 basis points, or 0.72
percentage points, since the beginning of the year.  Target Allocation  The division increased its target high-yield allocation by
$1 billion since June 30, 2012, to 4.7 percent of the fund,
according to  minutes  from a July 11 meeting. It’s pared
investment-grade holdings by $4 billion since June 30, 2012, to
$10.1 billion, or 13.6 percent of the fund, the minutes show.  The Division of Investment will issue a request for
proposals to become one of its external high-yield advisers in
six to eight weeks, Walsh said. He said he hopes to have new
managers, who will oversee about $1.4 billion, by the end of
2013.  Contracts with current managers Logan Circle Partners LP,
Pacific Investment Management Co., Post Advisory Group LLC and
Nomura Securities International Inc. expired in June and they
can reapply, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
