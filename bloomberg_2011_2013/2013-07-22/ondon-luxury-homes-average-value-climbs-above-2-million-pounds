The average value of luxury homes in central  London  surpassed 2 million pounds ($3 million) for the first time in the second quarter as more purchasers competed for a smaller number of properties on the market, Marsh & Parsons Ltd. said.  Home values in prime locations from Chelsea to Kensington rose 9.3 percent in the 12 months through June, the London-based property broker said in a report today. The number of buyers seeking homes in the most expensive districts climbed 11 percent from three months earlier, while residences available for sale declined by 14 percent.  “The imbalance of supply and demand is pushing property prices higher in prime London areas,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Rollings said in a statement. “Property is changing hands in record time and for close to the asking price.”  Investors from overseas are buying London real estate to preserve wealth amid political and economic tension in their home markets, causing prices to rise more than most brokers expected. Knight Frank LLP, along with  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  and  Savills Plc (SVS) , last year forecast that prices would be little changed in 2013 after an 8.7 percent increase in 2012.  About 38 percent of prime central London properties are valued at or more than 2 million pounds, Marsh & Parsons said, without defining prime real estate. The company looked at homes in the central London neighborhoods of Chelsea, Kensington,  Notting Hill ,  Holland Park  and Pimlico to collect the data.  Marsh & Parsons is a unit of publicly traded  LSL Property Services Plc.
