Mitsui & Co. (8031) , Japan’s biggest iron
ore supplier, agreed to buy 30 percent of a U.S. gas pipeline
started by  Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI)  to benefit from an export boom in
fuel extracted from shale rock.  The project run by Kinder Morgan’s Sierrita Gas Pipeline
LLC will connect an existing pipeline link at Tucson, Arizona
with Sasabe on the Mexican border, a 100-kilometer (62-mile)
route that will cost about $200 million to build, Tokyo-based
Mitsui said in an e-mailed statement today. Kinder Morgan will
also sell a 35 percent stake in the pipeline to Mexico’s state-run oil producer  Petroleos Mexicanos , according to the Mitsui
statement.  The pipeline, which will transport about 200 million cubic
feet of gas a day, is due to begin operating by September 2014
after obtaining approvals from U.S. regulators, Mitsui said in
the statement. The Japanese trading company, which owns stakes
in U.S. shale gas production assets, is seeking to build a “gas
value chain,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
