Jaromir Jagr, the National Hockey
League’s active leader in goals and assists, has agreed to a
one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils, ESPN reported,
citing an person familiar with the agreement that it didn’t
identify.  The 41-year-old right wing scored 16 goals with the Dallas
Stars and Boston Bruins during the lockout-shortened 2012-13
season, his 19th in the NHL. He had no goals and 10 assists in
22 playoff games as the Bruins lost the Stanley Cup finals to
the Chicago Blackhawks four games to two.  Devils spokesman Mike Levine didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  Jagr, the league’s Most Valuable Player during the 1998-99
season, has 681 goals and 1007 assists in a career spent with
six different teams, including the Pittsburgh Penguins and  New
York  Rangers. He has led the NHL in scoring five times, most
recently in 2000-01 with the Penguins.  The Devils were 19-19-10 last year, missing the playoffs
for the third time in the last 23 seasons. The team scored 2.29
goals per game last year, third fewest in the 30-team league.  ESPN’s report comes two weeks after Devils left wing Ilya Kovalchuk, a three-time All-Star, retired from the NHL at the
age of 30 with 12 years and $77 million left on his contract.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
