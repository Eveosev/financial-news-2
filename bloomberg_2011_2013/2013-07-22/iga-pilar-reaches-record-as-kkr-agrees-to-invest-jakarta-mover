PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food (AISA) ,
 Indonesia ’s second-best performing food stock over the past
year, jumped to a record after KKR & Co. agreed to buy a stake.  Tiga Pilar  soared  6.3 percent to 1,530 rupiah ($0.2), the
highest close since its trading debut in June 1997. The stock
has increased 42 percent this year, surpassing the 8.4 percent
gain in the Jakarta Composite Index.  The deal “lends credibility to Tiga Pilar,” Wilianto Ie,
head of equity research at PT Nomura Indonesia, said by phone
today. The transaction also “reflects well on Indonesia. It
shows the country is still attractive to foreign investors.”  KKR would buy about 9.5 percent of Tiga Pilar, the company
and the private-equity firm said in a joint statement without
elaborating the terms of the agreement. The purchase will make
KKR the company’s second-largest shareholder.  The Jakarta Consumer Goods Index has climbed 33 percent
this year, the  top  performer in the Jakarta gauge after real
estate and construction stocks, as investors bet on higher wages
and strong growth in  consumer spending  in the world’s fourth-most populous nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
