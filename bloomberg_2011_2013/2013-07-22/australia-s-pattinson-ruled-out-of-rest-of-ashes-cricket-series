Australia  fast bowler James Pattinson will miss the rest of the Ashes cricket series against
 England  because of a stress fracture of the lower back.  Pattinson, who took seven wickets in the opening two
matches, complained of soreness in his hip and back at the end
of Australia’s 347-run loss in the second Test at Lord’s and
scans showed an early-stage fracture, Cricket Australia said.  “He will commence a rehabilitation program with the aim to
have him back for the Australian summer,” team doctor Peter
Brukner said in the statement.  The touring team, which fell to its sixth straight Test
defeat two days ago, said it has no immediate plans to call up a
replacement for Pattinson. Mitchell Starc, James Faulkner and
Jackson Bird are available as back-up to frontline seamers  Peter Siddle  and Ryan Harris.  The third of five Ashes Tests in England starts Aug. 1 at
Old Trafford, Manchester.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
