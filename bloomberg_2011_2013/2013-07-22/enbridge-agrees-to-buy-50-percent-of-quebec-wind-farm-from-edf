Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest
pipeline company, agreed to buy 50 percent of an 80-megawatt
wind farm in Quebec from French utility  Electricite de France
SA . Terms weren’t disclosed.  The Saint-Robert-Bellarmin Wind Project, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) east of  Montreal , went into operation in
October and delivers electricity to Hydro-Quebec under a 20-year
agreement, according to a statement today. EDF will operate and
maintain the wind farm, which powers about 18,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
