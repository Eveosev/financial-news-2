Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to their highest level in a
month, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 181,400 lots in
the week ended July 16, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The increase of 4,412
contracts, or 2.5 percent, is the third consecutive weekly gain
and brings net-longs to their highest level since June 18.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 406,710, an
increase of 1.7 percent. It’s the biggest net-short position
since January, 2011, the earliest available point for the data.  Brent rose 1.5 percent in the week to July 16 to $109.40 a
barrel, and traded at $108.35 as of 12:12 p.m. London time.  Swaps dealers  reduced net-long positions by 6 lots to
254,412 in the week to July 16, the smallest change in weekly
data extending back 2 1/2 years.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
rose a third week, by 32 percent to 55,607 contracts. That’s the
highest since March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
