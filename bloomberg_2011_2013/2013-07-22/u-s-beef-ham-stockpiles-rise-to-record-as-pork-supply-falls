Beef stockpiles and ham supplies
rose to record highs in June as pork inventories decreased by
4.7 percent from a year earlier.  Beef supplies rose 2.5 percent to 480.625 million pounds
from a year earlier, while hams rose 9.3 percent to 161.124
million pounds. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said both
were records.  Warehouses held 564.924 million pounds of pork on June 30,
down 4.7 percent from the same date a year earlier, the USDA
said. Pork inventories fell 14.3 percent from the end of May.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 2.045 billion pounds (927,758 metric
tons) of pork in the five months through May 30, down 13 percent
from the same period a year earlier, the latest USDA data show.
Pork output is forecast to increase 0.6 percent in 2013 and
climb 3.1 percent next year, the government has projected.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Lean-Hog Index, a measure
of cash prices used to settle futures, is down 2.8 percent from
a 22-month high on June 24.  As of June 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 12.8 percent from a year earlier
to 42.738 million pounds, according to today’s report.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of June were 2.8
percent larger than a year earlier at 664.084 million pounds,
the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
