Milling wheat futures fell to a 14-month low in Paris on signs world supplies will rebound as
Northern Hemisphere harvests start.  Global wheat production may be a record 704 million metric
tons, the Agricultural Market Information System said July 2,
raising its outlook from a previous forecast of 702 million
tons. Grain exports from the French Rouen port,  Europe ’s biggest
wheat-shipping hub, fell 79 percent in the week through July 17
from a week earlier, Seine River port figures show.  “Everybody in the world took the gamble that the U.S.
would have a strong focus on corn so they made a big commitment
to wheat,”  William Adams , a  fund manager  at Resilience AG in
Zurich, said by telephone. “The weather in Europe has been
pretty nice. It was a little cool while everything was
developing then we got some rain followed by some nice heat, and
that’s exactly what this crop needed.”  Milling wheat for November delivery fell 0.9 percent to
192.50 euros ($253.95) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe n Paris, the
lowest settlement for that contract since May 14, 2012. Prices
have dropped 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
