Sugar production is poised to
contract for the first time in five years just as consumption
expands to a record, diminishing a global glut that has kept
prices in a bear market since September.  Production will drop 1.8 percent to 178.5 million metric
tons in the marketing year starting Oct. 1 as demand rises 1.9
percent to 175 million tons, the London-based International
Sugar Organization estimates. Futures will rally as much as 13
percent to 18.5 cents a pound by March, the end of the season in
Brazil, the biggest producer, according to the median of 13
trader and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sugar plunged 54 percent since reaching a three-decade high
in 2011 as growers from Brazil to  Australia  and  Mexico  raised
output. The anticipated drop in production contrasts with
analysts’ estimates for record supply of soybeans, wheat, corn
and rice. Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia’s biggest investment
bank, says sugar demand will exceed supply by 2.5 million tons
in 2014-2015, the first shortfall in five years.  “The surplus is not going to last forever,” said  Abah Ofon , a Singapore-based analyst at Standard Chartered Plc who
expects an average of 20 cents a pound in the first quarter.
“There’s less incentive to increase  production . We’ll see a
drop in supply.”  Production Drops  Global per capita sugar consumption has grown to about 23
kilograms (50.7 pounds), from about 5.1 kilograms at the start
of the 20th century, according to Sucres et Denrees SA.  Israel 
eats the most at 66 kilograms per person and  Bangladesh  the
least at 8 kilograms, the Paris-based sugar trader says.  Raw sugar dropped 16 percent to 16.44 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York this year, the second-worst performing
agricultural commodity in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
raw materials, which gained 0.1 percent. The MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities advanced 11 percent and a Bank of
America Corp. index shows Treasuries lost 2.3 percent.  Beet will contribute most to the drop in output because
farmers need to replant it every year. Cane regrows for several
seasons. Farmers in  India , the 28-nation European Union and
 Russia  cut acreage as prices fell, said Leonardo Bichara Rocha,
a senior economist at the ISO. The group, whose members include
more than 80 countries, expects the surplus to narrow to 3.5
million tons next season, from a record 10 million tons.  The last time global output contracted was in 2008-2009,
the first of two consecutive years of deficits. Prices more than
doubled in 2009, gained 19 percent in 2010 and peaked at 36.08
cents a pound in February 2011.  Beet Growers  Beet-producing nations, which account for 19 percent of the
market, will cut output by 8.3 percent to 34.3 million tons next
season, Czarnikow Group estimates. The London-based company,
which traded 2.4 million tons of raw sugar last year,
anticipates a 300,000-ton gain in cane-derived supply to 148.5
million tons.  Prices may keep falling because Brazilian production
doesn’t usually peak until July or August. Futures may drop as
low as 14 cents to 15 cents, before rebounding to as much as
18.5 cents by March, said Paul Deane, an agricultural economist
at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Melbourne .  Brazilian output will expand about 2.5 percent to 41
million tons in the local marketing year that began April 1,
said Bichara Rocha. The Brazilian real, which weakened this
month to the lowest level against the dollar since 2009, is
spurring exports. Shipments increased 13 percent in May and 16
percent in June from a month earlier, government data show.  Thai Harvest  Thailand , the largest shipper after Brazil, will increase
output 10 percent to a record 11 million tons in the year that
begins in November, according to Thai Sugar Millers Corp.
Exports may rise as much as 6.7 percent to 8 million tons from
an estimated 7.5 million tons, the Bangkok-based group
forecasts.  Prices probably won’t exceed 18 cents this year because the
previous season’s record crops enlarged stockpiles that still
need to be consumed, Citigroup Inc. said in a July 15 report.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts global inventories
of 38.2 million tons at the end of 2013-2014, about 17 percent
higher than the average over the past five years.  The USDA predicts a 4.8 percent expansion in  global imports 
to a record 52.3 million tons as lower prices spur global
demand. Of the 20 biggest buyers, 17 will increase imports in
2013-2014, the department says.  Monsoon Rains  India, the largest grower after Brazil, will produce 23.5
million tons next season, or about 1.5 million tons less,
according to the median of estimates from four traders, five
millers and two executives compiled by Bloomberg.  That’s still more than originally anticipated by some
analysts. Kingsman SA had forecast 22.3 million tons and now
predicts 23 million tons to 24 million tons after heavier-than-expected monsoon rains. The Lausanne, Switzerland-based research
company is a unit of  McGraw-Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) ’s Platts.  Farmers in  China , the third-biggest consumer, will reduce
the cane area by about 2 percent to 1.75 million hectares (4.32
million acres), the USDA forecasts. Production in the U.S., the
third-largest importer, will drop 4.1 percent to about 7.84
million tons, the department estimates.  Millers in Brazil’s center-south, the main growing region,
will divert more cane than previously expected to boost ethanol
production after rains cut the crop’s potential to yield sugar,
according to Datagro Ltd., the Barueri, Brazil-based research
company. Millers will use 53.8 percent of the cane to make the
biofuel, from a previous estimate of 52.6 percent.  Biofuel Demand  The price of hydrous ethanol at the pump, the fuel used to
power  Brazil ’s flex-fuel cars, is 62.3 percent to 63 percent
that of gasoline, making it more attractive for consumers. That
should spur demand for the biofuel and encourage more cane to be
diverted away from sugar production, said Plinio Nastari, the
president of Datagro.  “Prices will encourage lower production throughout the
2013-2014 season,” said Tracey Allen, an analyst at Rabobank
International in Sydney. “With that we’re seeing the global
sugar surplus shrinking.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
