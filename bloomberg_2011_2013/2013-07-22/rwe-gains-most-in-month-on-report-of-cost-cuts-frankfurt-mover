RWE AG (RWE)  gained the most in three and
a half months in  Frankfurt  as Handelsblatt reported  Germany ’s
largest power generator plans to deepen cost reductions.  The Essen, Germany-based company advanced 2.6 percent, the
biggest jump since April 10, and the largest on the benchmark
Dax index of national stocks today. The utility, which closed at
23.045 euros in Frankfurt, plans an extra 500 million euros
($660 million) a year in cost cuts, according to the report.  “The market seems to be surprised by the level of
savings,” Sven Diermeier, an analyst at Independent Research
GmbH, said by phone from Frankfurt. “RWE has never ruled out
further cost cuts” and suggested prices might increase.  The company is studying the competitiveness of its  power
plants , said Lothar Lambertz, a spokesman at RWE Generation SE.
He declined to comment on the level of savings or possibility of
job cuts.  More than 10,000 megawatts of conventional capacity,
particularly at gas- and coal-fed power plants is under
“critical observation,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Terium
said last week in an interview with Manager Magazin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
