PacWest Bancorp (PACW)  agreed to purchase
 CapitalSource Inc. (CSE)  in a deal valued at about $2.3 billion to
create the eighth-largest commercial bank based in  California .
Shares of both companies surged.  CapitalSource investors will get about $11.64 in PacWest
stock and cash, 18 percent more than yesterday’s closing price,
the Los Angeles-based companies said in a statement. Each
CapitalSource share will be exchanged for 0.2837 PacWest share
and $2.47 in cash, according to the statement.  The combined bank would have about $15.4 billion in assets,
with 96 branches in California, the most populous U.S. state,
according to yesterday’s statement. PacWest Chief Executive
Officer Matt Wagner will lead the combined firm and James Pieczynski, CEO of the target company, will run the
CapitalSource unit.  “CapitalSource will give PacWest a more robust and diverse
lending presence,” Pieczynski said in the statement.  PacWest climbed 7.1 percent to close at $34.77 in  New York 
trading, the most since October 2011. CapitalSource gained 22
percent to $11.97.  The deal, expected to be completed in the first quarter of
2014, will boost PacWest’s presence in middle-market lending,
the companies said in a  presentation . The banks estimate the
transaction will add 18 percent to earnings per share in 2015.  Branch Closures  The transaction creates “excellent” merger-and-acquisition prospects for PacWest, and the bank probably will
make more deals, Wagner said today on a conference call. The
CapitalSource purchase would be PacWest’s biggest, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The lender most recently acquired
First California Financial Group Inc. in June for $196.3
million.  PacWest and CapitalSource have an overlap of about 15
branches, and some locations will be closed, PacWest Chief
Financial Officer Vic Santoro said on the call.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  provided financial advice to
CapitalSource. Jefferies Group LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Castle Creek Financial LLC advised PacWest. Wachtell Lipton
Rosen & Katz were legal counsel for CapitalSource, and Sullivan
& Cromwell LLP for PacWest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
