Baxter International Inc. (BAX) , the
worldâ€™s second-largest maker of dialysis products, won
conditional approval from European Union to buy Swedish
competitor Gambro AB to expand its kidney-equipment business.  To allay competition issues, Baxter agreed to divest its
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) business, which
serves patients suffering from acute  kidney failure , the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
