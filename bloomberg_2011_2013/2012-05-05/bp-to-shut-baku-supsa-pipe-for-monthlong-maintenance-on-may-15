BP Plc (BP/)  will shut an oil pipeline from
Azerbaijan’s Caspian coast to  Georgia ’s Black Sea coast for
planned maintenance on May 15, said Tamam Bayatli, a spokeswoman
for the U.K. energy producer.  The shutdown of the Baku-Supsa link, which will take about
a month, won’t affect production at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli,
also known as ACG, or the Shah Deniz gas fields, Bayatli said by
phone from today from Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital. Both projects
are operated by BP.  Crude exports will continue as normal via the Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan pipeline, or BTC, Bayatli said.  Azerbaijan, the third largest-oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, exported 6.4 million
metric tons of oil in the first quarter, down 7.3 percent from a
year earlier, the State Statistics Committee said on April 23.
Natural-gas exports grew 2.7 percent to 1.34 billion cubic
meters, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
