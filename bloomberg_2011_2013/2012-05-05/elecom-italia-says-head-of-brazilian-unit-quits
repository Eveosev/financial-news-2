Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  said Luca Luciani
stepped down as chief executive officer of its Brazilian unit
 Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , the country’s second-largest wireless
operator.  Luciani left the company and “gave up all his mandates,”
Milan-based Telecom Italia said in a statement today. Telecom
Italia Chief Financial Officer Andrea Mangoni will replace him
on a temporary basis, it said.  “The top team of Tim Brasil is tight-knit and Mr.
Luciani’s departure would be a blow, but it is a company with
very good bench strength,” Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at
Sanford C Bernstein, wrote in a note yesterday. “There are in
our view several executives within the company that would be
capable of stepping up.”  Milan prosecutors targeted Luciani in a probe of alleged
inflated Italian wireless client numbers, people familiar with
the investigation said in March 2011. Prosecutors investigated
whether Telecom Italia’s domestic wireless phone unit issued
more than 1.5 million false phone cards to inflate its client
numbers, according to the people.  Luciani hasn’t been charged with any crime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
