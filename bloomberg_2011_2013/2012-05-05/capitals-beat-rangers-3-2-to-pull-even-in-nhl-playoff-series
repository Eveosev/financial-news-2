The  Washington Capitals  beat the  New
York  Rangers 3-2 to even their National Hockey League second-
round playoff series at two games each.  Mike Green’s power-play goal with 5:48 left in regulation
time gave Washington the home win at the Verizon Center.  Alex Ovechkin  and Nicklas Backstrom also scored for the Capitals, the
seventh seed in the Eastern Conference.  Artem Anisimov and Marian Gaborik scored for top-seeded New
York, which won Game 3 in Washington 2-1 in triple overtime.  The Rangers will host Game 5 in two days before the best-
of-seven series returns to Washington on May 9.  Ovechkin gave the Capitals the lead on a slap shot with
7:17 left in the first period. Anisimov drew the Rangers even 70
seconds into the second period, but Washington went back in
front midway through the period after Backstrom beat Rangers
goaltender  Henrik Lundqvist  with a wrist shot.  Gaborik tied the score less than five minutes later when he
took a pass from Anisimov and sent a wrist shot past Braden Holtby.  Washington then won the game with New York’s Carl Hagelin
in the penalty box for slashing when Green took a pass from
Dennis Wideman and fired a slap shot by Lundqvist from the right
circle.  It was Washington’s 10th one-goal game in 11 this
postseason, while eight of New York’s 11 playoff games have been
decided by a goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
