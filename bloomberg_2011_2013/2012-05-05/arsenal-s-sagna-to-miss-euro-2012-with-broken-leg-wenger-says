Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna broke
his right leg in today’s Premier League game with Norwich and
will not play for  France  at the European Championship, manager
 Arsene Wenger  said.  Sagna left the field on a stretcher during the first half
of the 3-3 tie at the Emirates Stadium. The fullback suffered a
similar injury against Tottenham in October which required
surgery and sidelined him four months.  “It is a broken fibula, it is the same leg” Wenger said
on the club’s website. “It has not happened alone, he has been
kicked on the leg.”  France opens its Euro campaign June 11 against England in
Ukraine.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
