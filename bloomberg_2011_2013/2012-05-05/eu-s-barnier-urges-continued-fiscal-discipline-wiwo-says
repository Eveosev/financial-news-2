Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services chief, said Europe mustn’t sway from the
fiscal discipline espoused by Germany as French voters prepare
for tomorrow’s presidential election, WirtschaftsWoche reported.  Germany, as the single-biggest contributor to the European
Union, is right to insist on budgetary discipline from other
member states, the German magazine cited the French politician
as saying.  Europe’s fiscal pact, which French presidential challenger
 Francois Hollande  wants to renegotiate, needs to be ratified and
implemented as swiftly as possible, Barnier is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
