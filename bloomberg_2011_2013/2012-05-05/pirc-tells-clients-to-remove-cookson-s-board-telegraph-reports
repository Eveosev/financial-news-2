Consultants Ltd., a U.K. corporate governance adviser, said that
 Cookson Group Plc (CKSN) ’s entire board should be removed and its pay
policies opposed, the Telegraph said, citing a report sent to
its clients.  PIRC, which advises clients with 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.6
trillion) of assets, told investors that the directors of the
London-based materials technology company have been among “the
worst examples of poor stewardship of shareholder funds in
recent history,” the newspaper reported.  Cookson disputes much of the analysis contained within the
PIRC report, the newspaper reported, citing a statement from the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
