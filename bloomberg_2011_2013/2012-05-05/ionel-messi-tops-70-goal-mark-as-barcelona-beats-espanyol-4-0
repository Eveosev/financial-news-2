Lionel Messi  scored all the goals as
Barcelona routed Espanyol 4-0 in Spain’s La Liga to push his
season total to 72.  Messi opened the scoring with a 12th-minute free kick and
added a three most goals in the second half, two coming from
penalty kicks, in manager Pep Guardiola’s final home game at the
Nou Camp stadium. The Argentine has 50 league goals, five more
than Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo.  Messi, named the world’s best player for the third straight
year in January, this week broke the single-season European
record of 67 goals set by Bayern Munich’s Gerd Muller in 1972-73.  Ronaldo scored his 45th league goal, from the penalty spot,
as Real rallied to beat Granada 2-1. The champions got the
winning score in injury time when David Cortes put in Karim Benzema’s cross for an own goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
