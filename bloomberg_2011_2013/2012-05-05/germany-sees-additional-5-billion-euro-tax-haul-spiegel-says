Germany ’s total tax revenue for 2012
and 2013 will be about 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) higher
than estimated in November, Der Spiegel reported, citing
calculations by the Federal Finance Ministry.  The figures will be combined with estimates from Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, the Bundesbank and
leading German economic institutes to derive a final forecast
next week, the magazine said in an excerpt of a story to be
published on May 7.  Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble expects to raise 597
billion euros in federal, state and local taxes this year, and
618 billion euros in 2013, as the German economy and higher
wages boost the country’s tax receipts,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
