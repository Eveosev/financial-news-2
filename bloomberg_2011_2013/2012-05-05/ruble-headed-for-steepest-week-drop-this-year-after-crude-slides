The ruble weakened for a third day
against the dollar and yields on  Russia ’s local bonds rose after
a report showing slower-than-expected U.S. jobs growth triggered
crude oil’s biggest drop in almost five months.  The Russian currency lost 0.2 percent to 29.80 per dollar
by the close in Moscow, taking its weekly decline to 1.3
percent, the biggest this year. The country’s 28 billion rubles
($940 million) of local bonds due 2027 fell for a second day,
increasing the yield four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 8.31 percent.  Crude futures slumped 4 percent to $98.49 per barrel by
yesterday’s close in  New York , the biggest decline since Dec.
14. Labor Department figures showed payrolls climbed 115,000 in
April, the smallest gain in six months. Oil and gas together
contribute about 17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product
and 50 percent of state revenue, according to the government’s
estimates.  Russia’s markets were open today to replace a public
holiday on May 7.  The ruble was little changed at 39 per euro and 33.94
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. The
overnight  MosPrime rate  banks say they charge to lend to one
another in the Russian currency slipped 41 basis points to 5.57
percent, the biggest decline since April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
