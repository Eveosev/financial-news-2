German bunds advanced, sending the
nation’s borrowing costs to record lows, on speculation  Europe ’s
economic slump is deepening and exacerbating the region’s
financial crisis.  The nation’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields fell to
records after unemployment in the euro area rose in March and
manufacturing and services shrank for a ninth month in April,
stoking demand for German assets. Spanish and Italian bonds
advanced after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  left
open the option of further stimulus if the region’s economy
deteriorates further. French 10-year bonds gained for a second
week before the nation holds elections tomorrow.  “The data this week has been soft,” said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London.
“People are still happy to own German bonds, despite where
yields are, given the increasing uncertainty. Safety mentality
is still a factor.”  The German 10-year yield dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.59 percent at 4:41 p.m.  London  time
yesterday after earlier declining to a record 1.58 percent. The
1.75 percent bond due July 2022 traded at 101.515 percent of
face value. The benchmark yield fell 11 basis points this week.  The yield on  30-year bonds  slid to an all-time low 2.294
percent and bund futures climbed to an all-time high of 142.13
after a report showed the U.S. added fewer workers than forecast
in April.  Five-year rates  reached a record 0.546 percent.  Two-year yields  dropped to an all-time low of 0.066 percent
on May 2.  Industries Gauge  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries declined in
April to 46.7 from 49.1 in March, London-based Markit Economics
said yesterday. A reading of less than 50 indicates contraction.  The  unemployment rate  in the 17-nation euro area climbed to
10.9 percent, the highest in almost 15 years, in March, from
10.8 percent a month earlier, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said May 2.  The ECB kept its main refinancing rate at a record low 1
percent, as predicted by all 58 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. While policy makers didn’t discuss lowering  interest rates 
at a meeting in Barcelona, Draghi left open the option of
further stimulus if the economy continues to deteriorate.  Italian  10-year yields  fell for a second week to 5.46
percent from 5.64 percent on April 27. The yield on similar
maturity  Spanish debt  fell for a third week, slipping 13 basis
points to 5.75 percent.  French Elections  French bonds climbed, pushing  10-year yields  down 16 basis
points this week to 2.84 percent as five polls showed socialist
candidate  Francois Hollande  maintaining a lead over  Nicolas Sarkozy  before the May 6 vote in  France . Greek bonds due
February 2023 fell before the country holds its own elections,
with the yield rising three basis points from April 27 to 20.58
percent.  German debt has returned 1.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds rose 2.6 percent,
while  Italy ’s securities gained 9.8 percent.  Germany  will auction 5 billion euros of five-year notes on
May 9, while Italy and France sell bills next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
