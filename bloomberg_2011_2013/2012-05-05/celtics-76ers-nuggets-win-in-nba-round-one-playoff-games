Paul Pierce  scored 21 points to lead
the  Boston Celtics  to a 90-84 win in overtime against the
 Atlanta Hawks  in the first round of the National Basketball
Association playoffs.  In other games last night, the  Philadelphia 76ers  topped
the Chicago Bulls 79-74 and the Denver Nuggets defeated the Los
Angeles Lakers 99-74.  The Celtics and the 76ers each took a 2-1 lead in their

points and 13 rebounds and Rajon Rondo earned a triple-double
with 17 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.  Atlanta’s Joe Johnson hit a 26-foot 3-pointer to tie the
game at 80-80 with one minute, 23 seconds left in the game.
Trady McGrady missed a layup and Willie Green couldn’t connect
on a 21-foot jumper to win the game for the Hawks.  After Rondo’s driving layup and Garnett’s 17-foot jump shot

21-foot jumper to force the overtime.  The Celtics outshot the Hawks 10-4 in overtime to win. The
