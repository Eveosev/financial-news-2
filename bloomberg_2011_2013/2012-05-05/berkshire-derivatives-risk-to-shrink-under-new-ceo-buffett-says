Warren Buffett , who accumulated more
than $7 billion of liabilities on equity-index puts, said the
risk from derivatives at his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  will
decline under the company’s next leaders.  “I don’t think there’ll be much of a derivatives book”
under a new chief executive officer, Buffett, 81, said today at
Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “There are a few
operating businesses that will have minor positions.”  Buffett sold equity derivatives to undisclosed buyers for
$4.9 billion in 2006 and 2007, when markets were near
their peaks. Liabilities on the bullish bets climbed as stock
indexes declined. Buffett has hired former hedge fund managers
Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to eventually oversee the company’s
investments, including an equity portfolio valued at more than
$80 billion.  “It’s very unlikely that they do anything with
derivatives,” Buffett said of Combs and Weschler. “I wouldn’t
restrict them.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
