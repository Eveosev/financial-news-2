Warren Buffett , a member of Augusta
National Golf Club, said he would allow women to join if he were
in charge.  “I’m not telling the group at Augusta what to do, but if I
were running the club I’d have plenty of women,” Buffett,
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television following his company’s annual meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
