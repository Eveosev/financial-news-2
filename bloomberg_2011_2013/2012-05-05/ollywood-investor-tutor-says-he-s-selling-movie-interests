Construction executive Ronald Tutor, a
Hollywood investor who owns part of the Miramax film library,
said he’s days away from selling his movie interests.  The interests he’s selling don’t include Tutor’s Miramax
stake, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The sale could be executed
within 10 days, Tutor said yesterday on a  conference call  with
analysts who cover his  Tutor Perini Corp. (TPC)   “I’m probably a week to 10 days from executing, selling my
movie interests,” Tutor said on the call. “If for some reason
that, awful as it may sound, doesn’t go through, I’d probably
have another stock sale in June or July.”  Tutor’s film investments extend beyond Miramax, according
to the  Hollywood Reporter , which reported the planned sale
yesterday. His ventures include the Intermedia film library,
which includes the titles “Timecop,” “The Wedding Planner”
and “Basic Instinct 2,” the publication said.  Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for Tutor, declined to
comment.  Tutor is an investor in Filmyard Holding LLC, the entity
led by Colony Capital LLC that bought Miramax for $660 million
from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  in 2010. Since the acquisition, Miramax
signed licensing agreements valued at $325 million and
negotiated a $500 million refinancing to reduce borrowing costs,
Chairman Richard Nanula said in December.  Miramax, the studio founded by Bob and Harvey Weinstein in
1979, owns a 700-film library that includes “The English
Patient” and “Shakespeare in Love.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
