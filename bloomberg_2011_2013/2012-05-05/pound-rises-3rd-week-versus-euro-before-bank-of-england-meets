The pound rose for a third week
against the euro amid speculation the  Bank of England  will pause
its asset-purchase program next week, underpinning the
currency’s attraction as a haven from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Sterling climbed to a 22-month high versus the shared
currency before France and  Greece  hold elections tomorrow. The
pound reached the highest since August against the dollar after
the  Swiss National Bank  said it almost doubled its holdings of
the U.K. currency. The BOE meets on May 9-10 to debate whether
to announce additional bond purchases, or quantitative easing,
after the current 325 billion pound ($525 billion) program ended
this week. Gilts rose.  “The pound is a favorable alternative to the euro,” said
 Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at Morgan
Stanley in  London . “With QE paused in the U.K. for the time
being, sterling has room to rally, particularly against the
euro, with the elections likely changing the political
landscape.”  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent this week to 81.10 pence
per euro at 4:24 p.m. London time yesterday after reaching 81.03
pence May 3, the strongest since June 2010. Sterling fell 0.7
percent this week to $1.6151 after rising to $1.6302 on April
30, the highest level since Aug. 31.  The pound may advance to 78 pence versus the euro by year-
end, Stannard said.  France, Greece  French voters will chose between President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
and Socialist Francois Hollande, while Greeks are set to decide
on a new parliament. Euro-area data yesterday showed services
and manufacturing shrank last month by more than economists
forecast, increasing concern the debt crisis will worsen.  The Bank of England will keep its key rate at a record low
0.5 percent next week, according to all 61 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Policy makers will refrain from announcing
additional asset purchases, according to 43 of the 51
economists in a separate survey. The other eight forecast
an increase.  “The better performance of the pound was related to the
perception that the Monetary Policy Committee has become less
dovish,” Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in London, wrote yesterday in a note to clients.
“We have also been arguing that the accommodative policies of
the  Federal Reserve ,  Bank of Japan  and the SNB has most likely
been redirecting safe-haven flows in sterling’s direction.”  Swiss Holdings  The Swiss central bank boosted holdings of the U.K.
currency to 14.5 billion pounds last quarter from 7.5 billion
pounds in the previous three months, according to its foreign-
currency holdings report released April 30.  Sterling has appreciated 3.7 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 1.2 percent, and the euro climbed 0.8 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, this week to 2 percent. The 4
percent bond due in March 2022 gained 1.14, or 11.40 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 117.73.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction as much as 2
billion pounds of 30-year gilts on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
