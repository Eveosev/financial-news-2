Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor, the cholesterol
pill that generated about $10.7 billion in sales for the world’s
biggest drug maker in 2011, loses patent protection in the U.K.
this weekend, the Times reported.  Generic drugs companies can begin to copy the New York-
based company’s recipe for the tablet from tomorrow, the Times
said, without saying where it got the information. Lipitor lost
marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in November and Pfizer
reported this month that first-quarter profit fell 19 percent
after revenue from the drug declined because of generic
competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
