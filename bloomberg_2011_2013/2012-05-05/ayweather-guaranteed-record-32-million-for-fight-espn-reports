Floyd Mayweather Jr. has been
guaranteed a record $32 million when he steps into the boxing
ring tonight against Miguel Cotto, ESPN reported, citing the
Nevada State Athletic Commission’s executive director.  The guarantee, filed yesterday with the commission, is the
largest since  Mike Tyson  was guaranteed $30 million in the 1997
heavyweight championship bout in which he bit Evander Holyfield’s ear, Executive Director Keith Kizer told ESPN.  Mayweather is defending his junior middleweight title
against Cotto at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in  Las Vegas . Cotto
is guaranteed $8 million and both he and Mayweather will get a
share of the pay-per-view profits, the sports network said.  More than 1 million subscriptions at $59.95 each may be
sold for the Home Box Office pay-per-view boxing event, ESPN
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
