German Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter rejected the suggestion that  Europe â€™s permanent rescue
fund be used to bail out struggling banks, Boersen-Zeitung
reported, citing an interview.  Germany remains opposed to the idea, according to the
report. He also rejected the introduction of new debt-financed
growth plans and calls for Germany to sacrifice higher inflation
in the interest of easing the debt crisis, Boersen-Zeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
