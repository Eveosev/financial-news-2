Saudi Arabian shares fell the most in
more than two weeks after oil slipped below $100 a barrel for
the first time since February and a decline in U.S. job
additions fueled concern the country’s economic growth may slow.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  dropped 1.3 percent, the most
since April 15, to 7,450.26 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest petrochemicals
maker also known as Sabic, also declined the most since April
15.  Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the country’s largest lender by market value,
retreated 1 percent.  “Petrochemicals are leading declines because of the drop
in the price of oil and the U.S. jobs report, which fell below
expectations,” Turki Fadaak, head of research at Albilad
Investment Co., said by phone from Riyadh. “But we don’t expect
an extended retreat as fundamentals remain strong in the Saudi
market.”  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled $4.05 to $98.49 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since Feb. 7. The drop came after American employers
reported adding 115,000 jobs April, the lowest figure in six
months. Slowing  job creation  may make it difficult for consumers
to boost their spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the
world’s largest economy.  Still, Saudi companies, which started reporting first-
quarter financial results in April, have exceeded expectations.
Al-Rajhi is among five lenders which posted earnings that beat
estimates as lending increased in the Arab world’s biggest
economy.  Al-Rajhi dropped to 77.5 riyals, the lowest level since
April 16.  Sabic, the company with the  heaviest weighting  in Saudi
Arabia’s index at 11 percent, fell 1.7 percent to 101.5 riyals.
Profit was 7.27 billion riyals ($1.9 billion) in the first
quarter, beating the 6.64 billion-riyal average estimate of
seven analysts, the company said April 17.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
