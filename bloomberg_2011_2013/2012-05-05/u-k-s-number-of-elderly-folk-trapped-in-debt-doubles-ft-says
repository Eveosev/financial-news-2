The number of elderly people trapped
into debt in the U.K. has almost doubled in the past five years
and they risk loosing their life savings, the Financial Times
newspaper said.  More than 427,000 households with people aged over 70 are
already in financial trouble and have fallen at least three
months behind with repayments or are a target of some form of
debt collection, the report said, citing the Consumer Credit
Counselling Service. The number of people aged 66 or over who
have become insolvent has almost doubled since 2007, according
to accounting company RSM Tenon, the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
