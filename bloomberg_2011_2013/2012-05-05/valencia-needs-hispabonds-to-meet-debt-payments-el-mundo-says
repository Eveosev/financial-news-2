The Spanish region of Valencia will
need so-called hispabonds as soon as June or July to guarantee
its financial autonomy,  El Mundo  reported, citing unidentified
local government officials.  Valencia needs to sell the bonds, which it can do jointly
with another region, to meet debt payments and avoid having the
central government take over its finances, the newspaper said.
Other regions that may need the notes include Castilla La
Mancha, Catalonia and Balearic Islands regions, El Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
