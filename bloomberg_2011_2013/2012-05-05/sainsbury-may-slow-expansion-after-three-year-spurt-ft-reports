J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.â€™s third-
largest supermarket chain, may slow store openings after a
three-year surge to cut costs, the Financial Times said.  Sainsbury, which is due to report annual earnings next
week, is under pressure to temper growth, the newspaper said,
citing analysts. Sainsbury is expected to post pretax profit of
700 million pounds ($1.13 billion), compared with 665 million
pounds a year earlier, the FT said, citing analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
