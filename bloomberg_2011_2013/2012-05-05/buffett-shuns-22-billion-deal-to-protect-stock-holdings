Warren Buffett , who built  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  with stock picks before focusing on takeovers,
said he recently opted against a $22 billion acquisition because
he didn’t want to sell investments in marketable securities.  “We considered one here just a month or two ago, which we
would have liked to do,” Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and
chief executive officer, said today at the company’s annual
meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “I would have had to sell some
securities I didn’t want to sell.”  Buffett, 81, divested portions of Berkshire’s stock
 portfolio  to help fund his $26.5 billion acquisition of railroad
Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. Since then, he has spent
more than $15 billion on stocks, while assuring Berkshire
shareholders that he was seeking further takeovers.  “We wish we could have made it,” Buffett said of the deal
he opted against, without naming the target company.  Berkshire’s equity portfolio, which includes the largest
shareholdings of  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , surged 41
percent to $89.1 billion in the 12 months ended March 31. In
that period, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 6.2 percent
and Buffett built what has become a $13.1 billion stake in
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   To contact the reporters on this story:
