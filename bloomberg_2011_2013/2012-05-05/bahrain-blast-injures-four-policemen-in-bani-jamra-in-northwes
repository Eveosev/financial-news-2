A blast injured four on-duty policemen
in the northwestern Bahraini town of Bani Jamra, Chief of Public
Security Major-General Tariq Al Hassan said.  The explosion, caused by a homemade device with a remote
detonator, occurred at 12:33 a.m., Al Hassan said in an e-mailed
statement from Manama, the capital. One of the officers is in a
critical condition, while the others sustained serious wounds
and burns, he said.  Bahrain quashed a month of mass rallies last year by mostly
Shiite demonstrators demanding equal rights and political
representation. Small rallies still take place regularly in
Shiite neighborhoods, sometimes spilling into commercial areas
of Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
