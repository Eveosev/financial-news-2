Punch Taverns Plc (PUB)  may start talks with
creditors to restructure debt after the Summer Olympics, the
Financial Times said, citing an unidentified person familiar
with the situation.  Beer sales will probably rise in the U.K., where the
company has about 5,000 pubs, during the London Olympics and the
European football championships, the FT said. Punchâ€™s revenue
during the period will probably determine how much of a discount
creditors will have to accept on about 2.5 billion pounds ($4.04
billion) of bonds, the newspaper said.  A spokeswoman for Punch Taverns, Sophie Brand, declined to
comment on the FT report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
