Champion Borussia Dortmund set a
record for points in a season in German soccer’s Bundesliga,
while Cologne was relegated on the final day of the season.  Dortmund, which clinched its second straight title April
21, routed Freiburg 4-0 to finish with 81 points. Jakub
Blaszczykowski and Robert Lewandoski each scored twice as
Dortmund ended the season on a 28-match unbeaten run.  Cologne’s 4-1 home loss to runner-up  Bayern Munich  saw it
join Kaiserlautern in being relegated to Bundesliga 2 next
season. Hertha Berlin’s 3-1 win over Hoffenheim lifted it over
Cologne out of the relegation zone at the bottom of the
standings  Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s two goals helped third-place Schalke
beat Werder Bremen 3-2. Huntelaar led the league with 29 goals,
three more than Bayern’s  Mario Gomez .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
