Union Investment, the asset manager
that controls about 1 percent of Deutsche Bank AG’s share
capital, wants wider powers to be granted to the bank’s chairman
to improve corporate governance at  Germany ’s biggest lender,
 Euro am Sonntag  said, citing fund manager Ingo Speich.  More influence from designated Chairman  Paul Achleitner ,
who will succeed Clemens Boersig after the annual shareholder
meeting this month, would prevent potential friction as Deutsche
Bank introduces a dual management structure that will see
investment banker Anshu Jain and Germany head Juergen Fitschen
become co-chief executive officers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
