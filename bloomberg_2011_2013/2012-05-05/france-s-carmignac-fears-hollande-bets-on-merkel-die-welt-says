Edouard Carmignac, the founder of
French fund Carmignac Gestion, said a victory by presidential
challenger  Francois Hollande  tomorrow may hamper the reform
efforts that are necessary to spur France’s economy, Welt am
Sonntag reported.  Carmignac, who oversees funds including the 21 billion-euro
($27.5 billion) Patrimoine A fund, said  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
should make clear that Germany won’t write the checks for
Hollande’s political plans should he win the election against
Nicolas Sarkozy, the Berlin-based newspaper cited him as saying
in an excerpt of an interview that will be published tomorrow.  Carmignac is relying on Merkel to do all in her power to
“bring Hollande back to earth,” the  fund manager  is cited as
saying. He foresees the euro-area shrinking to a group of core
countries that maintain ties to a collection of satellite states
through trade or currency agreements over the next 10 years,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
