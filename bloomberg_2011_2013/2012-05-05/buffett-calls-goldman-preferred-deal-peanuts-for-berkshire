Warren Buffett  said his deals to
inject $8 billion in  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  General
Electric Co. (GE)  were “peanuts” compared with longer-term bets his
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  made with stock picks and acquisitions.  “Those deals have not been key to Berkshire,” Buffett
said of the 2008 investments in Goldman and GE. “They’re not
remotely as important as buying Coca-Cola stock.”  Buffett bought $5 billion of preferred shares in Goldman
Sachs and $3 billion in GE at the depths of the credit crisis,
earning a 10 percent annual coupon and getting warrants to
acquire stock in the firms. The companies have since redeemed
the preferred stock, while Berkshire continues to reap dividends
from more enduring investments, such as the purchase of 
railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe.  “The values in Berkshire that have been accumulated by
some special security transaction are really just peanuts
compared to buying businesses like Geico, or Iscar or BNSF,” he
said today at his annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “It’s not
a key to Berkshire’s future.”  Buffett accumulated a stake in beverage maker  Coca-Cola (KO)  Co.
for about $1.3 billion from 1988 through 1994 and the holding is
now valued at more than $15 billion. He has also acquired
businesses like car insurer Geico and Israel’s Iscar
Metalworking Cos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
