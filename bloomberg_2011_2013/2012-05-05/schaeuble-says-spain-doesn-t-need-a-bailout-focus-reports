German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  deemed the lack of confidence by the financial markets
in Spain as unjustified because the right steps are being taken
to reform its economy,  Focus  magazine reported, citing the
legislator in an interview.  Spain doesn’t need a bailout as it can master the
challenges alone, the German magazine cited Schaeuble as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
