Warren Buffett , whose  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  has more than $19 billion invested in U.S. banks,
said the lenders have ample liquidity and are a class apart from
European rivals.  “I would put European banks and American banks in two very
different categories,” Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief
executive officer, said today at the firm’s annual meeting in
Omaha, Nebraska. “The American banking system is in fine shape.
The European system was gasping for air a few months back”
before getting assistance from the European Central Bank.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted record
profits last year and their CEOs are contesting efforts by U.S.
policy makers to strengthen banking regulations. European banks
have struggled amid the continent’s sovereign debt crisis and
turned to the ECB, starting in December, for extraordinary
three-year loans at interest rates of 1 percent.  “I’d like to have a lot of money for three years at 1
percent, but I’m not in trouble,” said Buffett, 81. U.S. banks
have “liquidity coming out their ears.”  Berkshire, which Buffett has led for 42 years, is the
biggest shareholder of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, with a
more than $12 billion stake. Buffett injected $5 billion into
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  last year in exchange for preferred stock
and warrants. Berkshire’s shareholding of  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  was
valued at $2.2 billion as of yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
