Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused
mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and four codefendants
deferred entering pleas during their arraignment today on
terrorism charges at a U.S. naval base in Cuba.  Defense attorneys asked for a trial to begin in May 2013,
while military prosecutors said they would be ready by Aug. 1 of
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
