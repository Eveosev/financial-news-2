Volker Kauder , the parliamentary
leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc,
said German-French relations may be hampered if  Francois Hollande  is elected president tomorrow, Welt am Sonntag said.  Ties between the two countries form the basis for unity in
Europe and leadership changes won’t alter this, the newspaper
said in an excerpt of an interview to be published tomorrow.
Still, the relationship may be impeded if Hollande wins the vote
and stands by comments he has made in his pursuit of the office,
Die Welt cited Kauder as saying.  Hollande has repeatedly called for a re-negotiation of the
budget pact agreed by European leaders in March, saying it needs
to place more emphasis on growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
