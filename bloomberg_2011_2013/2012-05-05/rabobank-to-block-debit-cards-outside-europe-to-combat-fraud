Rabobank Groep, the biggest Dutch
mortgage lender, plans to block retail-banking clients’ debit
cards for use outside  Europe  unless specifically requested
otherwise by the account-holder to combat theft of card
information.  Clients will be able to lift the blockade and access their
accounts from specific continents for specific periods of time,
Rabobank said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  Theft and abuse of debit- and credit-card information,
known as “skimming,” cost Dutch banks 39 million euros ($51
million) last year, according to Rabobank. Some 24,000 of
Rabobank’s clients had money taken from their accounts, it said.  “A number of banks abroad have already implemented this
sort of blockade,” Rik Op den Brouw, retail director at
Rabobank Nederland, said in the statement. “The number of fraud
incidents has dropped sharply and the response from
clients is generally positive. We expect this measure will also
lead to substantially less financial damage resulting from
skimming in the Netherlands.”  Rabobank has 6.8 million customers in the Netherlands,
according to the Utrecht-based lender’s 2011 annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
