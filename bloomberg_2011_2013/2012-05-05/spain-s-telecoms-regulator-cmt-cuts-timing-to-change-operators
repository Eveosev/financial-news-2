Spanish Telecommunications Market
Commission or CMT reduced the time limit for fix telephone
customers to change operators keeping the same number to one
working day from five days.  Telephone companies will have to apply the new rule before
July 2013, the CMT said in an e-mailed statement yesterday,
adding that the time limit could be longer when customer also
changes broadband provider.  The CMT already cut the timing to one working day for
mobile phones a year ago and the rule will be available this
June, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
