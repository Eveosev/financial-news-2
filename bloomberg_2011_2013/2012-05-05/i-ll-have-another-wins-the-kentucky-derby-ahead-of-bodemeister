I’ll Have Another will try to become
the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 as the colt heads for
the  Preakness Stakes  after charging to victory in the 138th
running of the  Kentucky Derby .  The three-year-old colt overtook second-place Bodemeister
in the stretch and held off a late surge by third-place Dullahan
yesterday in the 1 1/4-mile (2 kilometer) race at Churchill
Downs in Louisville,  Kentucky . The winner, which sold for
$11,000 as a yearling, earned $1.46 million.  “Maryland, here we come,” trainer Doug O’Neill said after
his first Derby victory with the only horse to ever win from the
19th post position.  The Triple Crown continues with the  Preakness  on May 19,
followed by the  Belmont  on June 9. It’s been 34 years since
Affirmed became the 11th Triple Crown winner, in 1978.  Jockey Mario Gutierrez also secured his first Derby victory
aboard the colt.  “The first time I met him, I knew he was the one,”
Gutierrez said in a televised interview. “He was going to give
me 100 percent. He’s so professional for his age.”  Gutierrez held I’ll Take Another in seventh place as the
speed horses, including Bodemeister, led in the 20-horse field.
The colt moved into fourth place on the final turn and charged
ahead of Bodemeister to win by 1 1/2 lengths in two minutes,
1.83 seconds in front of a record crowd of 165,307.  As Dullahan made a surge, trainer O’Neill said he kept
thinking, “Where’s the wire?”  The winner paid $32.60, $13.80 and $9 on a $2 bet.
Bodemeister returned $6.20 and $5.60 and Dullahan paid $7.20.  “I was just kind of numb through the whole race,” said
owner Paul Reddam, a former philosophy professor at the
University of  Southern California . “I blinked and it was
over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
