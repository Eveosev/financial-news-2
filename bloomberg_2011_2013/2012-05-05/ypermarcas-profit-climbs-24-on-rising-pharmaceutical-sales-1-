Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , the Brazilian maker of
more than 190 consumer products, said profit climbed 24 percent
after sales of pharmaceuticals rose.  Net income increased to 40.8 million reais ($21.2 million) 
from 32.9 million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based 
company said in a regulatory filing May 5. The profit missed a 
53.9 million-real mean  estimate  for adjusted net income of eight
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales advanced 14 percent to 897.1 million reais, pushed by
a 17 percent increase at its pharmaceutical unit and a rise of
9.2 percent at its consumer products division.  “In 2012, the company will maintain its focus on organic
growth combined with operating cash generation and the reduction
of debt levels,” the company said in the statement.  Hypermarcas has gained 41 percent since the beginning of
the year, the third-best performer in the Bovespa benchmark
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
