OAO Rosneft, Russiaâ€™s largest oil
producer, plans to increase  capital spending  at least 23 percent
this year as it boosts investments in refinery upgrades
following a change in tax rules on heavy products.  Rosneft plans to invest more than 480 billion rubles ($16
billion) this year, according to a  presentation  posted on the
company website. Capital expenditures amounted to 389 billion
rubles last year and 271 billion rubles in 2010, according to
the presentation.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  raised export taxes on
residual products such as  fuel oil  and lowered the duty on
middle distillates such as diesel in October to encourage
refinery upgrades.  Net debt increased 6 percent to 527 billion rubles at the
end of the first quarter from 497 billion rubles on Dec. 31, the
Moscow-based company said in its results for the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
