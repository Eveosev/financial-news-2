Russian stocks sank for a second week,
erasing the benchmark index’s gain this year, as concern the
global economic recovery is faltering pushed crude below $100
for the first time since February.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated 0.3 percent to 1,386.41
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The benchmark lost 5.9 percent
this week, the biggest weekly drop since December. OAO
Novolipetsk Steel, billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, fell
to an almost three-year low on concern the European economic
slowdown may curb demand for the metal. Oil producers OAO
Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom Neft dropped at least 0.8
percent. OAO Raspadskaya, a Russian coal producer, added 1.4
percent.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, dropped the most since
December yesterday as a U.S. government report showed payrolls
had their smallest gain in six months.  France  and  Greece  hold
elections this weekend, stoking concern leadership changes will
hamper efforts to resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The Russian market is like a monkey that’s watching the
Western economic indicators,” Alexander Ivanischev, equities
analyst at Infina Investment Co. in Moscow, said by phone.
“External risks from the European power change and the mixed
U.S. data are pressuring the Micex.”  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter and the largest
producer of nickel and palladium, got almost 50 percent of
budget revenue from oil and gas sales last year, according to
government estimates.  ‘Free Fall’  Russia-focused equity funds recorded back-to-back outflows
in the week ended May 2 for the first time since December,
posting net outflow of $18 million, according to EPFR Global
data.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 0.6 percent to
1,489.55, the lowest level since Jan. 18. The index lost 6.6
percent this week. Markets are open today before the May 7 to
May 9 holidays.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled $4.05 to $98.49 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Feb. 7. It was the biggest one-day drop since
Dec. 14 and capped a 6.1 percent decline for the week, the most
since September.  Urals crude , the country’s main export blend, fell 2.7
percent to $110.99 yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 31.  “When the market loses the support of high oil prices and
positive economic data, it finds itself in free fall,”
Ivanischev said. The Micex may extend declines, retreating a
further 3.8 percent to 1,330 in the next “few days,”
Ivanischev said.  Global Markets Slump  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index dropped 0.6 percent this
week to 1,012.96, its seventh straight weekly retreat and the
longest string of weekly declines since 2008.  “The Russian market is expecting a further slump in the
global markets and  oil prices ,” Alexei Kozlov, an equities
trader at Ufs-Finance Investment Co. in Moscow, said by phone.  The  S&P 500  fell 2.4 percent to 1,369.10 this week,
trimming its gain for the year to 8.9 percent after the biggest
weekly retreat in 2012.  Five polls showed socialist candidate  Francois Hollande 
maintaining a lead over  Nicolas Sarkozy  before the May 6 vote in
France. U.S. payrolls climbed 115,000 in April, Labor Department
figures showed yesterday in  Washington , while the median
estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a 160,000 advance. Euro-region services and manufacturing output
contracted more than initially estimated in April, a report
showed yesterday.  First 100 Days  The Micex has  returned  5.7 percent to investors in the
first four months of the year, less than half the earnings for
the  MSCI Emerging Markets index (MXEF) , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Russia’s benchmark measure has lost 14 percent since
 Vladimir Putin  won the March 4 presidential election, returning
the former KGB officer to the Kremlin.  “The first 100 days of Putin’s presidency will be
indicative of his economic policy for the next six years,”
Ivanischev said.  Analysts are concerned Putin may prevent government asset
sales set out by President  Dmitry Medvedev , who will replace him
as premier. Medvedev has ordered the government to cut its
stakes in lenders to less than 50 percent as part of a pledge to
relinquish government control over companies.  While backing sales to boost competition, Putin said in a
Jan. 30 Vedomosti article it would be “stupid to sell assets on
the cheap, ignoring the situation on markets.” Putin will be
inaugurated on May 7 after four years as  Russia ’s prime
minister.  Raspadskaya, Rusal  The Micex will be open for trading during public holidays
on May 7 and 8 and closed on May 9.  Novolipetsk Steel, or NLMK, as the steel producer is known,
declined 2 percent to 55.79 rubles, the lowest price since June
2009. NLMK got 24 percent of its revenue from European sales in
2011, up from 22 percent in 2010,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show.  OAO Magnit, Russia’s biggest retailer by market value,
declined 1.4 percent to 3,445.10 rubles, the lowest level since
March 6. The shares fell 6.9 percent this week, the biggest
weekly decline since the week ended Sept. 25.  Surgutneftegas lost 1.3 percent to 26.631, the lowest price
since Jan. 17. Raspadskaya, a Russian coal producer, advanced
1.4 percent to 88.19 rubles, the most since April 28. The stock
lost 9.6 percent this week, the biggest weekly drop since the
week ended Oct. 9.  Russian stocks trade at 4.9  times  estimated earnings,
having lost 1.1 percent this year. That compares with a 10
percent gain for the MSCI Emerging-Market Index which trades at
10 times projected earnings.  Trading volumes on the Micex slumped 30 percent in April
from the month before compared with a 22 percent drop in the
same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
