Passengers arriving at the U.K.’s
 Stansted  airport were forced to wait as much as two hours before
passing through passport control yesterday evening, the Press
Association reported, citing travellers at the airport.  Immigration lines can be “unacceptably long” at peak
times, a spokesman for the airport, about 35 miles by car from
central London, told the news agency. A Border Force spokesman
said additional staff can be deployed to help minimize delays.  Stansted’s owner BAA Airports Ltd. also controls Heathrow
Airport, Europe’s busiest, where passengers arriving in the U.K.
also faced delays of more than two hours this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
