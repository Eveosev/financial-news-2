Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt
urged French presidential candidate  Francois Hollande  to
recognize the economic challenges Europe faces in his bid to
oust incumbent  Nicolas Sarkozy , Die Welt reported, citing an
interview.  French politicians will eventually “wake up” to the
crisis, though when they do, it may be such a “brutal
awakening” that it will have repercussions for the rest of the
continent, the former Swedish prime minister is cited as saying
in the German newspaper.  Hollande has repeatedly called for a re-negotiation of the
budget pact agreed by European leaders in March, saying it needs
to place more emphasis on growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
