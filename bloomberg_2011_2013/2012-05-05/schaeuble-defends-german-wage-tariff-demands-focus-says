German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the new wage tariffs may help reduce some of the
economic imbalances afflicting the European Union,  Focus 
magazine reported.  It’s acceptable that wages in Germany are rising more than
in other EU countries, the magazine reported, citing Schaeuble.  Germany can afford higher wage increases than other
European nations because it endured years of political and
economic reforms, Focus cited the finance minister as saying.  IG Metall , Europe’s biggest labor union, is demanding a 6.5
percent pay increase for its 3.6 million members as talks with
employers resume on May 8 in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
