Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s most
popular social network, is acquiring Glancee, a mobile service
that helps users find and connect with people based on their
locations.  The company, based in  Menlo Park , California, announced the
acquisition in an e-mailed statement. It didn’t disclose terms.  Facebook, which plans to raise as much as $11.8 billion in
an initial public offering, is using acquisitions to fuel growth
in services aimed at mobile users. The company said last month
that it’s buying Instagram, a mobile photo-sharing service, for
about $1 billion.   Glancee lets users explore profiles of people nearby and
receive notifications of people who have common friends or
mutual interests.   Glancee, founded in 2010, includes three co-founders,
Andrea Vaccari, Alberto Tretti and Gabriel Grise.  With the initial public offering, Facebook will seek a
market value of as much as $96 billion, offering shares at $28
to $35 each, a regulatory filing showed this week. Facebook has
more than 900 million users.   To contact the reporter on this story:
