German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler opposes the idea of letting the European Financial
Stability Facility support banks directly,  Bild-Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  The bailout fund can prevent contagion in the banking
sector if it’s used as a last resort to make loans to nations
seeking to recapitalize banks, he said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
