Greece  must undertake deeper reforms
for its bailout to work,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing
representatives of the so-called troika that is assessing
whether the government is meeting the conditions of its rescue.  “Greece is standing at a crossroads,” Poul Mathias Thomsen, head of the International Monetary Fund’s delegation in
 Athens , was quoted as saying. “It’s obvious that the program
won’t work if authorities don’t take the path that requires much
tougher structural reforms than those we’ve seen so far.”  The European Commission’s representative on the troika,
Matthias Mors, criticized the Greek government for taking too
long to implement planned reforms, according to the German
newspaper. It also quoted the head of the  European Central
Bank ’s delegation to Athens, Klaus Masuch, as saying Greece has
lived beyond its means for too long, and without European aid
its economic collapse would be much more dramatic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
