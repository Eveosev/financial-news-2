The  Milwaukee  Brewers reached their
first National League Championship Series, defeating the Arizona
Diamondbacks 3-2 in 10 innings today to win a decisive fifth
game in their first-round playoff series.  Nyjer Morganâ€™s single knocked in the winning run for the
Brewers, whose previous appearance in a league championship
series came in 1982 when they were in the American League.
Milwaukee moved to the NL in 1998.  The Brewers will face either the Philadelphia Phillies or
the  St. Louis Cardinals  in the NL Championship Series. The
Phillies and the Cardinals play their Game 5 tonight in
Philadelphia.  The AL Championship Series is already set and starts
tomorrow in Arlington, Texas. The Detroit Tigers eliminated the
 New York Yankees  in Game 5 last night and advanced to play the
Texas Rangers, who won their division series in four games
against the Tampa Bay Rays.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
