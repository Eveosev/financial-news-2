The  Smithsonian National Air and
Space Museum  in  Washington  was closed today after a security
officer used chemical spray to thwart the assault of another
when about 150 people converged to protest the use of drones.  The guards were attempting to stop the protesters from
entering the building, John Gibbons, a Smithsonian spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. One security guard was held
against the wall by demonstrators, he said. Several were treated
at  the scene  for respiratory distress after another guard
released the spray, and one woman was arrested.  A group called “Stop the Machine” may have organized the
protest, which began about 3 p.m., Gibbons said. The
demonstrators were protesting an exhibit containing a drone, or
unmanned aerial vehicle, Gibbons said. The U.S. has used drones
flown remotely by pilots during the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan 
for surveillance and to fire weapons.  One protester carried a sign saying “Don’t let the
government put blood on your hands,” with the word “hand”
replaced with an image, Gibbons said.  The Museum is expected to open at its normal time of 10
a.m. tomorrow, Gibbons said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
