German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the extent of the debt reduction Greece needs to
make may have been underestimated,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Thereâ€™s a high risk that the debt crisis will intensify and
spread, Schaeuble said, according to the newspaper. He said
euro-area governments must ensure that banks have enough capital
to withstand any losses they incur in the event of a Greek debt
restructuring, FAZ reported.  Schaeuble also rejected the suggestion that the European
Financial Stability Facility could be given a bank license so
that it could borrow from the  European Central Bank , saying that
would amount to the monetization of government debt, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
