Wales  beat Ireland 22-10 to reach the
Rugby World Cup semifinals for the first time in 24 years.  Shane Williams,  Mike Phillips  and  Jonathan Davies  scored
tries with Rhys Priestland and Leigh Halfpenny kicking seven 
points for sixth-ranked Wales in the quarterfinal in Wellington, 
 New Zealand . Ireland’s points came from a Keith Earls try and a 
conversion and penalty from  Ronan O’Gara .  Wales, which finished third at the inaugural edition in
1987, rebounded from missing the knockout stages four years ago
and will play the winner of today’s matchup between England and
 France  in the final four.  Ireland had been seeking to reach the semifinals for the
first time after finishing atop its pool ahead of two-time
champion  Australia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
