Greece  has funds until mid-November
and a decision on paying the sixth tranche of the first bailout
should be made by the end of this month, European Union Economy
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  Greece must show it is taking the action that’s needed,
Rehn said in a television interview on  Finland ’s state-owned YLE
TV1 today. “In principle” it is possible the sixth tranche
won’t be paid, Rehn said. It’s up to Greek politicians to ensure
that doesn’t happen, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
