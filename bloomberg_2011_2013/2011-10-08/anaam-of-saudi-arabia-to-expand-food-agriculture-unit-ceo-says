Anaam International Holding Group, a
Saudi food processing and agriculture company, is expanding its
dry and frozen foods business, as well as its livestock-feed
unit.  The company is in talks with two Spanish manufacturers of
olives and olive oil to be the exclusive supplier of their
products in  Saudi Arabia , Chief Executive Officer Hassan Yamani
said Oct. 6 in an interview at Anaam’s headquarters in  Jeddah .
He declined to provide further details.  Anaam signed an agreement with Nepalese noodle
manufacturer, Wiwi as well as Basmati rice manufacturer LTD
Foods,  India  last month. The company is also the sole
distributor in the kingdom for  France ’s Tilly chicken.  “We aren’t looking at the shorterm but are focusing on the
longterm and are willing to go at breakeven in order to
penetrate the market with new products and claim market share,”
Yamani said.  In the agricultural business, Anaam plans to add corn this
quarter, wheat in 2012 and barley in 2013, the CEO said. The
company almost doubled the amount of grass for fodder it

next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
