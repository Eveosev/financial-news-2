The  Nobel Foundation , which awards
winners a 10 million-krona ($1.5 million) prize, may reduce the
amount as a decline in global markets lessens its returns,
 Svenska Dagbladet   reported , citing Executive Director Lars Heikensten.  The foundation has about 3 billion kronor in capital and
120 million kronor in annual expenses, Heikensten said,
according to the Stockholm-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
