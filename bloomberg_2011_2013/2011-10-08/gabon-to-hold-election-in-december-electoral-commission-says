Gabon  will hold parliamentary
elections on Dec. 17, the National  Electoral Commission  said in
a public notice published in the daily Union newspaper.  The election campaign will start on Dec. 7, the notice
said. Opposition parties said last month they would boycott an
election to protest the lack of biometric voting in the central
African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
