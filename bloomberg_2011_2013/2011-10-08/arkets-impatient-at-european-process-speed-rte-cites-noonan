Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said there is an “impatience” on world markets at the
speed with which  Europe  is resolving the problems in the
eurozone, RTE  reported today.  The recapitalisation of Europe’s banks may involve 100
billion euros, though this “needs to be done as the first step
before a solution for Europe can be put in place,” RTE cited
Noonan as saying today at the Global Irish Economic Forum in
Dublin Castle.  Ratings agencies have been active recently and some
downgrades have been the result of wider problems in Europe and
not the particular countries or institutions involved, Noonan
was cited as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
