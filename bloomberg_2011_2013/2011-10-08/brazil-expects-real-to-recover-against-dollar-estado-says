The Brazilian government expects the
real to recover against the dollar because the high yields of
the country’s bonds will keep attracting foreign capital, O
Estado de S. Paulo  reported , without saying where it obtained
the information.  Still, the economic team doesn’t see the real rising above
1.50 per dollar, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, without
giving a time frame. To prevent a steep appreciation of the
real, the government will keep the so-called IOF tax on some
currency derivative transactions, according to Estado.  A telephone call and e-mails sent to the  Finance Ministry 
by Bloomberg News seeking comment weren’t immediately answered.  The real gained 6.1 percent this week to close at 1.7715
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
