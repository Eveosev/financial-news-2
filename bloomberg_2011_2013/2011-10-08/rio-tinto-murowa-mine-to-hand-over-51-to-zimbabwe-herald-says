Rio Tinto Group’s Murowa diamond mine
agreed to cede a 51 percent stake to the Zimbabwean government,
the Harare-based Herald reported today, citing Indigenization
Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere .  Murowa’s Harare-based Managing Director Niels Kristensen
said he may comment next week, when reached today by telephone.
Kasukuwere didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone.  Zimbabwe , with the world’s second-biggest reserves of
platinum and chrome after neighboring South Africa, has demanded
all foreign or white-owned companies submit plans to sell stakes
in local assets for approval by the government. They risk losing
their right to operate if they don’t comply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
