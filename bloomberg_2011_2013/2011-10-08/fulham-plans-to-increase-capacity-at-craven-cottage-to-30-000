Fulham plans to increase the capacity
of its Craven Cottage stadium to 30,000, the Premier League
soccer club said on its website.  The team has played at the ground on the banks of the
Thames River in west London since 1896. Several refurbishments
over the past decade have increased capacity to 25,700.  “We are confident that a redevelopment will improve the
fans’ matchday experience by enhancing the facilities, while
remaining sympathetic to the design of this historic ground,”
Chief Executive Officer Alistair Mackintosh said on the club’s
website.  Fulham will look to develop the Riverside Stand to
accomodate the seating increase. Facilities throughout the venue
will also be improved and the club said it will ask fans and
local residents for input.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
