Greece ’s financing needs until 2020
will be bigger due to a deeper than expected recession and the
outcome of private-sector participation on debt swaps,  Imerisia 
reported, citing the country’s representative to the
 International Monetary Fund .  The gap must be covered by an increase in the 109 billion-
euro bailout loan agreed to by European leaders, bigger losses
for private creditors or a longer repayment period for Greece’s
debt, the Athens-based newspaper cited Panagiotis Roumeliotis as
saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
