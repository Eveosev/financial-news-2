Mark Hughes  says he’d like to return
to Chelsea some day as manager, the Daily Mirror said.  Hughes played for the Blues in the 1990s and helped the
team win the F.A. Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and League Cup. He then
went on to manager Wales, Blackburn,  Manchester City  and Fulham.  “Chelsea is the club I have a special affinity for,” the
Mirror quoted Hughes as saying on Chelsea’s television network.
“As a manager you want to test yourself at the top, so if in
the future if it’s ever possible for me to work here then I
would be absolutely delighted to because it’s an outstanding
club.  Hughes left his most recent coaching job at Fulham last
year after turning down a contract extension.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
