The world’s oldest running automobile
sold for $4.6 million in  Pennsylvania  last night. The price with
fees was more than double the catalog estimate and is a world
record for an early motor car at auction.  The steam-driven 1884 De Dion, capable of 37 miles per hour
on a straight, was the most highly valued of 115 cars being
offered by  RM Auctions  at Hershey on Oct. 6-7. The vehicle drew
a standing ovation from the audience as it drove onto the
auction stage.  The bidding started at $500,000 and immediately jumped to
$1 million, before climbing to the record. RM didn’t identify
the buyer. The four-seater was being sold by the estate of the
Texas-based collector John O’Quinn, who died in 2009.  It was originally built for the French entrepreneur the
Comte de Dion by the engineers Georges Bouton and Charles-Armand
Trepardoux. Named “La Marquise” after the count’s mother, the
quadricycle had only been through four owners.  It was restored in the late 1980s by the U.K. veteran car
enthusiast Tim Moore who raced it four times in the annual
London-to-Brighton run. Moore sold the vehicle in 2007.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
