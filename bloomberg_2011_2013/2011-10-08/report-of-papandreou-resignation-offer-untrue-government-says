A report that Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  may resign to make way for a national unity
government is false, a government spokesman said.  “He is not willing to resign,” spokesman Ilias Mossialos
said by telephone today. “He enjoys the support of his
parliamentary group.”  Greek newspaper  Imerisia  reported today, without citing
anyone, that Papandreou was willing to offer his resignation in
order to form a unity government to pass measures needed to
avert a default. Some lawmakers from Papandreou’s governing
Pasok party were reluctant to accept the political cost of new
budget measures, the newspaper said. Papandreou’s party has
154 seats in the 300-member Parliament.  Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said yesterday that
 Greece  has sufficient cash to meet its needs until mid-November.
European Union and International Monetary Fund officials are
awaiting a report from a team of inspectors to determine
approval for a sixth loan installment of 8 billion euros ($10.7
billion) under a 110 billion-euro bailout approved in May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
