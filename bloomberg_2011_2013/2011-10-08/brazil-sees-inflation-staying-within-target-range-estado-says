Brazil ’s government sees “very
little” chance of inflation this year surpassing the target
ceiling of 6.5 percent, O Estado de S. Paulo  reported , citing
Marcio Holland, the Finance Ministry’s secretary of economic
policy.  Holland said inflation for 2011 is more likely to stay
within the inflation target range, according to the newspaper.  Brazil targets annual inflation at 4.5 percent plus or
minus 2 percentage points. Consumer prices rose 7.31 percent in
the 12 months through September, the national statistics agency
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
