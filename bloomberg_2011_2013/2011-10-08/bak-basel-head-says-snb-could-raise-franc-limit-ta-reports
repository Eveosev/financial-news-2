The  Swiss National Bank  “could well”
increase the limit on the euro-franc  exchange rate  “somewhat”
beyond the current 1.20 ceiling, Urs Mueller, head of the BAK
Basel Economics research institute, told Tages-Anzeiger.  The SNB wouldn’t be able to defend an exchange rate of more
than 1.30 francs per euro over the longer term as the
equilibrium rate is somewhere between 1.30 and 1.40, Mueller
told the newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
