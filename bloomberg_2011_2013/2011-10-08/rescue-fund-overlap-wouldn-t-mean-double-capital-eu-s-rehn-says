Speeding up the European Union
permanent rescue fund to implementation next year would mean it
would overlap with the temporary rescue fund, EU Economy
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in a television interview on 
 Finland ’s YLE TV1 today.  As the measures would overlap gradually,  Europe  would not
have 940 billion-euro firepower to counter the debt crisis, Rehn
said. The European Stability Mechanism will have 500 billion
euros in capital, while the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility has 440 billion euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
