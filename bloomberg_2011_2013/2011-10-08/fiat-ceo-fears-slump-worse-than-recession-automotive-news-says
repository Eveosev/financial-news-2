Fiat SpA (F)  Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  said mismanagement of  Europe â€™s sovereign debt
crisis may cause a regional slump worse than a regular
recession,  Automotive News Europe  reported, citing an interview.  European carmakers could survive a 12-month recession as
long as they follow measures taken during the last crisis,
including protecting cash reserves, cutting inventories and
increasing labor flexibility, Marchionne was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
