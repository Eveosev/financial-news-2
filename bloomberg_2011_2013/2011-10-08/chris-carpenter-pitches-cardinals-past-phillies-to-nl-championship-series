Chris Carpenter pitched a three-hit
shutout and the wild-card St. Louis Cardinals defeated the
Philadelphia Phillies 1-0 to reach the National League
Championship Series.  The Cardinals, who got the game’s only run in the first
inning on a run-scoring double by Skip Schumaker, beat the
Phillies 3-2 in the best-of-five division series and moved on to
face  Milwaukee  in the NLCS starting Oct. 9.  The Brewers earlier today reached their first NL
Championship Series by defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-2 in
10 innings to win a decisive fifth game in that first-round
playoff series.  Nyjer Morgan’s single knocked in the winning run for the
Brewers, whose previous appearance in a league championship
series came in 1982 when they were in the American League.
Milwaukee moved to the NL in 1998.  The AL Championship Series is already set and starts
tomorrow in Arlington, Texas. The  Detroit Tigers  eliminated the
New York Yankees in Game 5 last night and advanced to play the
Texas Rangers, who won their division series in four games
against the  Tampa Bay Rays .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
