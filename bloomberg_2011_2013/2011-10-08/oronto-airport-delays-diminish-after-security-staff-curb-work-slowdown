Delays at Toronto’s Pearson
International Airport dropped to about 30 minutes today from two
hours yesterday as a work slowdown by security checkpoint
screeners eased.  Employees of  Garda World Security Corp. (GW) , a subcontractor
for the  Canadian Air Transport Security Authority , are involved
in a “go-slow” work action that began on Oct. 6, ahead of
Canada’s three-day Thanksgiving weekend.  “It’s a clear improvement from yesterday, though we’re not
quite sure if it’s over,” Mathieu Larocque, a spokesman for the
federal agency, said in a telephone interview today. “The
longest wait is about 30 minutes.”  The job action was being conducted at just one checkpoint
today, for international travelers, compared with all nine at
the airport yesterday, Larocque said.  Spokesmen for  Air Canada (AC/A)  didn’t immediately reply to e-
mails today seeking comment. The airline postponed some
departures yesterday due to passenger backups at the
checkpoints, airline spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said at the
time.  Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for Montreal-based Garda,
declined to comment on the job action in an e-mail response to
questions. The  Canadian Broadcasting Corp.  has reported the
dispute concerns employee scheduling.  Pearson is  Canada ’s largest and busiest airport, handling
400,000 flights a year and almost 32 million passengers,
according to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
