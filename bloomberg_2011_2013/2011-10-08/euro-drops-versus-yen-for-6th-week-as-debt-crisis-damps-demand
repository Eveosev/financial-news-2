The euro weakened against the yen for
a sixth straight week, matching a string of losses ended in June
2010, after  Italy  and Spain saw their ratings cut even after the
 European Central Bank  said it would aid regional banks.  The 17-nation currency slid against most of its major
counterparts amid increased speculation  Greece  may have to
default, deepening the region’s debt crisis. Higher-yielding
currencies, such as the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, rose as
stocks advanced and after a report showed employment in the
world’s biggest economy rose more than forecast. Group of 20
finance ministers meet in Paris Oct. 14-15 before a G-20 summit
in Cannes in November.  “The  U.S. dollar  has some legs to gain against the euro
going into the end of the year,” said  John Doyle , a strategist
in  Washington  at currency-trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc.
“It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when Greece is going
to default, and that’s going to weigh on the common currency.”  The euro dropped 0.5 percent to 102.66 yen this week and
reached 100.76 yen Oct. 4, the weakest level since June 2001.
The common currency fell 0.1 percent to $1.3378. The dollar fell
0.4 percent to 76.73 yen.  Ratings Cuts  Italy’s rating was cut to A+ from AA- by Fitch Ratings
yesterday and to A2 from Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service
earlier this week. Both companies cited concern stemming from
the euro region’s debt crisis.  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded
Italy on Sept. 20 for the first time in five years.  Spain’s rating was also reduced yesterday by Fitch, to AA-
from AA+. The outlook for Spain and Italy is negative. The
ratings company maintained a rating watch negative on  Portugal ,
indicating the nation may still be cut to below investment
grade.  “It’s a reminder for people that there’s still a nice
laundry list of issues that they have to get through,” said
Brian Kim, a currency strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the region’s economy
is facing “intensified downside risks.”  The euro gained Oct. 6 after Trichet, announcing a policy
decision for the final time, said the ECB will resume covered-
bond purchases and reintroduce year-long loans for banks as the
sovereign-debt crisis threatens to freeze money markets. Trichet
will step down at the end of the month and be succeeded by
Italy’s  Mario Draghi .  ECB Policy  ECB officials left their benchmark rate at 1.5 percent, as
forecast by 41 of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Currencies linked to growth rallied against the dollar this
week as positive U.S. economic reports diminished concern the
recovery is faltering.  Brazil’s real rose the most among major currencies,
climbing from a more than two-year low of 1.9549 reached Sept.
22. The currency surged 5.7 percent to 1.7715 per dollar.  Mexico’s peso added 3.2 percent to 13.4598, rising for the
first week in five.  Australia ’s dollar advanced 1.1 percent to
97.68 U.S. cents, touching a one-year low of 93.88 Oct. 4.  “There’s a number of emerging-market currencies where
you’ve had very dramatic outflows over the last three to four
weeks,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency
research in New York at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Those emerging-
market currencies are now retracing at a very fast pace. If we
have any stability in the U.S., we can have stability in
emerging markets.”  U.S. Markets  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 2.1 percent and the MSCI World index
of equities added 2 percent. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of raw materials rallied 1.8 percent.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised
57,000 increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed yesterday in Washington.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise
of 60,000. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners including the euro and yen, fell 0.1 percent to
78.754.  The pound tumbled against its U.S. counterpart after U.K.
policy makers said Oct. 6 they would increase their bond-
purchase program by 75 billion pounds ($115 billion). The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for no
change. The main rate was maintained at 0.5 percent, as
predicted by all 53 economists in a separate survey.  Pound Down  Sterling declined 0.1 percent to $1.5562, and weakened 0.1
percent to 85.97 pence per euro.  Turkey ’s and Russia’s central banks separately intervened
in the  currency market  this week in an effort to prop up their
currencies.  The Turkish central bank has sold $1.3 billion for liras
this week and offered a further $750 million in a daily auction
yesterday. The lira has dropped 16 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the second-worst performer among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after South
Africa’s rand.  Bank Rossii sold about $6.8 billion and 591 million euros
($796 million) of its foreign-currency reserves in September,
the central bank said on its website yesterday.  The ruble dropped 0.5 percent to 32.3443 per dollar,
falling for a sixth straight week. It touched 32.8935 on Oct. 4,
the weakest since August 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
