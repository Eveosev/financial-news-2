Hetzner Online AG, one of  Germany ’s
largest web-hosting providers, left online customer data openly
accessible, including bank data, police correspondence and
passwords to servers,  Spiegel  reported, citing data samples it
acquired.  Some of the data wasn’t encrypted on Hetzner’s computers,
the magazine said. The  company ’s customers include  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
web-based book retailer  Buch.de Internetstores AG (BUE)  and online
travel agency Opodo. The security leak may also affect end
customers, according to the report.  A phonecall to Hetzner’s headquarters in Gunzenhausen,
Germany, outside of office hours wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
