(Corrects conversion in third paragraph of story published
on Oct. 8.)  Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN) ,  Saudi Arabia ’s biggest property company by assets, will
receive 4 billion riyals ($1.1 billion) from the kingdom’s
Public Investment Fund for the  Qasr Khozam  regeneration.  The funds will help in “sending evacuation notifications”
and in “the compensation and transfer of ownership of the
properties located in the project area,” the Riyadh-based
company said in a statement to the Saudi bourse today.  The 4 million-square-meter (43 million square-foot) Qasr
Khozam project in Jeddah is a joint investment between Dar Al
Arkan and Jeddah Development and Urban Regeneration Co., a
company owned by the Municipality of Jeddah.  Dar Al Arkan’s shares rose 0.8 percent to 6.15 riyals
before the announcement, giving the company a market value of
6.6 billion riyals. The stock has lost 32 percent so far this
year compared with a decline of 8.1 percent for the 148-member
 Tadawul All Share Index. (SASEIDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
