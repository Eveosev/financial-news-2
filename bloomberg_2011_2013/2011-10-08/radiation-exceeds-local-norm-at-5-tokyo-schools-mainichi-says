Radiation levels exceeding a local
safety standard were detected at five schools in southeastern
 Tokyo , the Mainichi newspaper reported today, citing the Ota
ward board of education.  Airborne radiation measured 0.32 to 1.01 microsieverts per
hour around rain gutters near school flower gardens, the
Mainichi said. Ota ward has set a radiation safety standard of
0.25 microsieverts per hour.  Radiation levels dropped to below the ward standard a meter
(3.3 feet) away from the rain gutters, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
