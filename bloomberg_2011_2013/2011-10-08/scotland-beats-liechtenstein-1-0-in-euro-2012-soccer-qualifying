Scotland  won 1-0 at Liechtenstein to
stay in contention for a berth at the 2012 European soccer
championship.  Craig Mackail-Smith scored in the 32nd minute as Scotland
moved into second place in qualifying Group I.  The winners of the nine groups, along with the second-place
team with the most points, qualify for Euro 2012 in Poland and
Ukraine. The remaining eight second-place teams will play off
for the final four spots.  Scotland leads the  Czech Republic  by one point going to the
final round of qualifiers in three days. Scotland visits
European and World Cup champion  Spain , which has already won the
group, and must at least equal the Czech Republicâ€™s result in
 Lithuania  to finish second.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
