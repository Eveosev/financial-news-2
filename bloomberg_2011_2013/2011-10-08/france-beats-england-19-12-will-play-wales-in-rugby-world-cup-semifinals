France  beat  England  19-12 to reach
the Rugby World Cup semifinals for the fifth straight time.   Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard scored a try each, while
Dimitri Yachvili and Francois Trinh-Duc kicked the other points
at Eden Park in Auckland. England’s points came through tries by
 Ben Foden  and Mark Cueto and a Jonny Wilkinson conversion.  France, the runner-up in 1987 and 1999, advanced to a Oct.
15 semifinal against  Wales , which beat Ireland 22-10 earlier
today in Wellington. England had reached the past two finals,
winning its only title in 2003.  In tomorrow’s quarterfinals, defending champion  South
Africa  faces fellow two-time winner  Australia  in Wellington
before tournament favorite New Zealand hosts Argentina at  Eden
Park .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
