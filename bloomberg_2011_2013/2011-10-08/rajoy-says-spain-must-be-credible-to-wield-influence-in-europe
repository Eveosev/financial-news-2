Spain’s opposition People’s Party’s
leader  Mariano Rajoy , who is leading in polls ahead of Spain’s
general election next month, said the nation needs to meet its
commitments before it can play a part in  Europe .  “Spain has a lot to say in Europe,” Rajoy said during the
closing speech of a three-day party conference in Malaga in the
South of Spain today. “For that Spain needs to be a serious
country which meets its commitments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
