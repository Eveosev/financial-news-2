Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year note
yields up the most since July, on optimism Europe’s leaders will
adopt a coordinated approach to supporting banks and as U.S.
employers added more jobs last month than forecast.  Yields rose this week even as the  Federal Reserve  began
buying longer-term debt and selling shorter maturities to keep
borrowing costs low under a policy known as Operation Twist. The
U.S. Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $66 billion of
notes and bonds next week.  “Markets have caught the idea that something is coming or
something seems to be coming out of policy talks in Europe,”
said  David Ader , head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital
Group LLC in Stamford,  Connecticut . “That has taken some of the
flight-to-quality rally out of Treasuries.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 2.08 percent this week, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent securities
maturing in August 2021 dropped 1 14/32 points, or $14.38 per
1,000 face amount, to 100 14/32. Yields fell on Sept. 23 to
1.6714 percent, the lowest in Fed figures beginning in 1953.  A drop in 30-year bonds pushed yields up 10 basis points to
3.02 percent. The yields slid four days ago to 2.69 percent, the
lowest level since January 2009. Two-year note yields rose five
basis points to 0.29 percent.  Job Market  U.S. payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised
57,000 increase in the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of 60,000.
The gain reflected the return to work of 45,000 telecom
employees. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  “The number coming in better than expected adds pressure
to a Treasury market that was already vulnerable to higher
rates,” said  Kevin Flanagan , chief fixed-income strategist in
Purchase, New York, at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “The data
is certainly not indicative of economic strength, but it helps
allay fears that recession is imminent.”  Bonds slid on speculation the European Commission is
pushing for a coordinated capital injection into banks.
 Germany ’s  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters in Berlin this
week that policy makers “shouldn’t hesitate” if it turns out
financial institutions are undercapitalized.  ECB Loans  The  European Central Bank  said it will reintroduce year-
long loans, giving banks access to unlimited cash through
January 2013, and resume purchases of covered bonds to encourage
lending. The  Bank of England  raised the ceiling for debt
purchases known as quantitative easing to 275 billion pounds
($428 billion) in the biggest expansion since the first round of
stimulus in March 2009.  “People are looking for optimism anywhere they can get it
right now,” said Christopher Bury, co-head of fixed-income
rates in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., one of the 22 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “You have these random
stories, and the market reacts.”  Italy’s foreign and local currency long-term issuer default
ratings were cut yesterday by  Fitch Ratings  to A+ from AA-,
while  Spain ’s were lowered to AA- from AA+. The outlook for both
is negative.  U.S. government debt securities surged last quarter on
speculation  Greece  was headed for default and as the Fed said
after its Sept. 20-21 meeting that it would buy $400 billion of
Treasuries with maturities of six to 30 years through June while
selling an equal amount of securities due in three years or
less. Minutes of the meeting are due Oct. 12.  Operation Twist  The central began the program on Oct. 3 with the purchase
of $2.5 billion of securities maturing from February 2036
through August 2041.  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 146 basis points in the
third quarter, the most since falling 164 basis points in the
last three months of December 2008.  “There was so much priced in about a double dip both here
and in  Europe ,” said John Fath, a principal at the investment
firm BTG Pactual in New York.  “The market was expecting such
bad data, it’s sort of a relief event,” he said, referring to
yesterday’s payrolls report.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said
employment gains in September that were almost double analysts’
forecasts aren’t enough to signal sustained growth in the  U.S.
economy .  The economy needs 200,000 to 250,000 added jobs per month
to expand, said Gross, manager in Newport Beach, California, of
the world’s biggest bond fund, in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  The U.S. will auction $32 billion of three-year notes, $21
billion of 10-year debt and $13 billion of 30-year bonds in
offerings beginning Oct. 11.  “Supply has been on traders’ minds over the last couple of
days, and this should add pressure to yields,” said Paul Montaquila, head of fixed-income trading in San Ramon,
 California , at Bank of the West.  To contact the reporters on this story:
