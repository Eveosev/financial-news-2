Mouchel Group Plc (MCHL)  is talking to banks
about its debt after an accounting error resulted in the erasure
of 4.3 million pounds ($6.7 million) of profit from a contract
and caused the stock to plunge.  A spokeswoman for the government-services company confirmed
that Mouchel is in talks with its lenders, after the Financial
Times reported the discussions with  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS) , Lloyds Banking Group Plc and  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  Mouchel has
87 million pounds in debt and is attempting to avoid breaching a
covenant, the  newspaper  said.  Mouchel plunged the most in more than nine years in London
trading on Oct. 6 as the firm, which provides highway
maintenance services, said Chief Executive Officer Richard Cuthbert resigned after the discovery of “an actuarial error.”  The company is receptive to takeover offers, the Financial
Times reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  The spokeswoman for the Surrey, England-based company
declined to comment on speculation about a takeover when
contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
