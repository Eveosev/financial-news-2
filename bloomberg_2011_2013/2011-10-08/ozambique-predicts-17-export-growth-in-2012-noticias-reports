Mozambique  predicts that exports will
jump 17 percent next year on the resumption of the shipping of
coal,  Noticias  reported, citing Finance Minister Manuel Chang.  The value of exports may total more than $3 billion in
2012, Chang said, according to the state-controlled daily. The
contribution of coal to GDP will be known by the end of this
year, he said.  Vale SA (VALE3)  started exports of coal this year from its Moatize
mine, marking the first exports of the material from Mozambique
in 20 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
