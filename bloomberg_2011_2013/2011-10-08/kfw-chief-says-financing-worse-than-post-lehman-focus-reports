Ulrich Schroeder , chief executive
officer of German state-owned lender KfW, said medium- and long-
term financing markets are “more dramatic” than after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to an
interview in  Focus  magazine.  Risk management systems are now better than after the
Lehman bankruptcy, he was cited as saying.  Lenders shouldn’t be given automatic aid as banks without a
sustainable business model shouldn’t be kept afloat, he said,
according to Focus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
