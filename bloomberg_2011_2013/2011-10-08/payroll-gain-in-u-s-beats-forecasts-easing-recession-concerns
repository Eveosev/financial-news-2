American employers added more workers
in September than forecast and earnings and hours also rose,
allaying concern the economy is slipping into another recession.  Payrolls increased by 103,000 after a 57,000 gain in
August, the Labor Department said yesterday in Washington. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called
for an increase of 60,000. The figures reflected the end of a
strike at  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  that brought 45,000 people
back to work. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  Treasuries fell as the report added to evidence the world’s
largest economy is maintaining its expansion. The pace of job
growth is still too slow to push down the unemployment rate as
companies hold back on hiring amid a debt crisis in  Europe ,
political gridlock in the U.S. and a plunge in stock prices.  “These numbers are another argument against the idea that
the economy is moving toward a recession,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We’re mired in a period of anemic growth, but the
economy is growing nonetheless.”  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.06 percent
in  New York  late yesterday from 1.99 percent a day earlier. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent to 1,155.46.  Revisions added a total of 99,000 jobs to payrolls in July
and August, yesterday’s employment report showed.  The figures capped a week of data indicating the economy is
gaining strength after growing at the slowest pace in two years
in the first half of 2011.  Data Improving  Manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated in September,
propelled by gains in exports and production, figures from the
 Institute for Supply Management  showed. Construction spending
expanded in August, and orders for capital equipment increased
by the most in three months, government data showed.  “The economy is certainly not as weak as it was thought to
be over the last couple of months,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief
financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
New York.  Labor Secretary Hilda Solis used the report to push
President  Barack Obama ’s $447 billion jobs plan consisting of
tax cuts and infrastructure projects.  “We need to do more,” Solis said in a Bloomberg
Television interview yesterday. She said Obama’s plan, proposed
last month, will create between 1 million to 1.9 million jobs.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  is among companies planning to boost
payrolls, saying this week it has committed to add about 12,000
hourly jobs in its U.S. manufacturing plants by 2015 as part of
an agreement with the  United Auto Workers .  Jobs at Ford  Ford said it will be “in-sourcing” jobs from  Mexico ,
 China  and  Japan . Ford said this will be 5,750 hourly jobs more
than a previously announced 7,000 positions to be added by the
end of 2012.  Sustained increases of around 200,000 jobs a month are
needed to reduce the jobless rate by about a percentage point
over a year, according to  Eric Green , chief market economist at
TD Securities Inc. in New York.  More Americans who would like a full-time job are settling
for part-time work instead. They are counted in the
underemployment rate, which increased to 16.5 percent, the
highest this year, from 16.2 percent. The number of people
working part-time for “economic reasons” jumped 444,000 to 9.3
million.  Unemployment has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009,
the longest stretch of such elevated joblessness since monthly
records began in 1948. Through September, the economy has
recovered about 2.09 million of the 8.75 million jobs lost as a
result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  Fed’s View  “Economic growth remains slow,” Federal Reserve policy
makers said Sept. 21 as they announced a plan to bring down
longer-term lending rates. While officials said they “expect
some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters,” they
anticipate “the  unemployment rate  will decline only
gradually.”  Private payrolls, which exclude government jobs, rose
137,000 after a gain of 32,000 in the prior month, the Labor
Department said.  Factory payrolls declined 13,000 in September, the biggest
decrease since August 2010. Employment at service-providers
increased 85,000 in September, the most since April.
Construction employment climbed 26,000, the biggest gain since
February, led by a jump in non-residential building.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent to $23.12. The
average work week for all workers climbed six minutes to 34.3
hours.  Government Cuts  Government payrolls decreased by 34,000 last month.
Employment rose by 2,000 at state governments and slumped 35,000
at the local level. The loss at state governments was driven by
education payrolls, which slipped 24,400 to a more than six-year
low of 7.8 million.  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration this week
asked agency heads to cut spending by $2 billion over the next
18 months and freeze hiring on concern that a slowing economy
may reduce city revenue.  “We’re looking at extreme economic uncertainty, and state
and federal governments that are likely to further cut funds
they return to the city,” Caswell Holloway, deputy mayor for
operations, said in a statement. The mayor is founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
