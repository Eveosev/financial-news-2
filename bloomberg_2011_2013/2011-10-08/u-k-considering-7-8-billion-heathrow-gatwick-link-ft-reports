U.K. lawmakers are studying the
construction of a 5 billion-pound ($7.8 billion) high-speed rail
link between  London ’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports, the
Financial Times said.  The plan is a possible alternative to increasing the
capacity of Heathrow, the FT cited Victoria Borwick, a member of
the Greater London Authority’s transport committee, as saying.  The Department for Transport said a public consultation in
2012 would consider improving connectivity between existing
airports, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
