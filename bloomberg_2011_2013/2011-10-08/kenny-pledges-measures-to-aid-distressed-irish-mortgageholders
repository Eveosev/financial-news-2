Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said
today he will introduce measures to help distressed home
mortgageholders.  “There will be additional facilities for people who are in
distressed mortgage situations,” Kenny said at a conference in
Dublin.  “Fundamentally, we don’t want to see the roof taken from
anybody,” Kenny said.  The new measures will be based on proposals the government
recently received from a panel of experts, Kenny said. They will
be presented in “coming weeks,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
