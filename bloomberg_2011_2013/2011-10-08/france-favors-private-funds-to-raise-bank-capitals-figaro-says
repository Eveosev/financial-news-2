European banks must favor private
funding if they need to raise capital, including to reassure
investors,  Le Figaro  reported, citing a person close to French
Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  it didnâ€™t name.  Injecting public capital must be a last-resort solution,
the person said, according to the newspaper. European
coordination is key to determine capital ratio goals, deadlines
and tools to reach them, the person said, adding that German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
will try to agree on these issues at a meeting tomorrow, Le
Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
