Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.â€™s largest
supermarket chain, overhauled the management of a 4 billion
pound ($6.2 billion) unit that includes its mobile and Internet
businesses, the London-based Times reported.  Online operations will be folded into the British stores
unit led by Richard Brasher, the Times said, citing an internal
announcement seen by the newspaper. Per Bank will run the
telecoms business and Ken Towle will take on a group strategy
role for internet retailing, the Times reported.  A spokeswoman for Tesco, who declined to be identified,
confirmed the accuracy of the Times report, when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
