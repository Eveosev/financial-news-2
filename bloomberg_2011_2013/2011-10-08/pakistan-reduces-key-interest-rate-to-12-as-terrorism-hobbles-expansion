Pakistan â€™s central bank cut  interest
rates  for a second straight meeting to spur investment after
terrorism and floods weakened economic growth.  The  State Bank  of Pakistan lowered the discount rate to 12
percent from 13.5 percent, Syed Wasimuddin, a central bank
spokesman, said in Karachi today. Three of five economists in a
Bloomberg News survey predicted a percentage point cut while the
rest forecast a reduction of half a point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
