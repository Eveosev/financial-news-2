AT&T Inc. (T)  received more than 200,000
preorders for the iPhone 4S in 12 hours, marking the company’s
most successful debut yet for the  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  device.  There has been “extraordinary demand” for the new iPhone,
the Dallas-based carrier said today in a statement. AT&T, along
with Verizon Wireless and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , provide service
for the phone.  The rush of orders signals that there’s pent-up demand for
the new model, which followed the previous version by 16 months
-- longer than usual. Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S at a press
conference earlier this week, pricing it at $199, $299 and $399,
depending on the features. The device comes with new voice-
command features and a higher-resolution camera.  It also has an A5 chip that will make graphics seven times
faster than the old processor and an “intelligent antenna
system” for improved call quality. The phone works with both
CDMA and GSM wireless standards, and users will have up to 8
hours of talk time on one charge.  The new model will be the first Apple product release since
the Oct. 5 death of co-founder  Steve Jobs . The iPhone represents
the company’s biggest source of revenue, accounting for nearly
half of its sales. For the first time, the device is available
from all three of the largest U.S. carriers. The other two,
Verizon and Sprint, haven’t disclosed preorder sales.  Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple fell $7.57, or
2 percent, to $369.80 today. The stock has risen 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
