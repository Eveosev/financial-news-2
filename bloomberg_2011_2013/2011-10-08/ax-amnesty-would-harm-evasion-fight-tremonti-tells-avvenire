Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said any amnesties on unpaid levies or illegal
construction would harm the nation’s fight against  tax evasion ,
 Avvenire  reported, citing an interview.  “So far the proceeds from the fight against tax evasion
helped finance systematically the public spending for health,
pensions and welfare,” the Italian Catholic church daily
newspaper cited Tremonti as saying. An amnesty “would threaten
that income and by doing so we would find ourselves with a
higher deficit.”  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government denied last
night that it was considering a plan for an amnesty on tax
evasion or other transgressions as part of efforts to improve
public finances.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
