Saudi Arabia  beheaded eight
Bangladeshi nationals in public yesterday for the murder of an
Egyptian citizen in 2007, the official  Saudi Press Agency 
reported, citing an Interior Ministry statement.  The Egyptian was killed during a robbery of a warehouse in
 Riyadh , the news service said, citing the ministry’s statement.
Three other Bangladeshis were sentenced to prison terms and
flogging for their roles in the crime.  Saudi Arabia, where religious police patrol shopping
centers and cinemas are prohibited, enforces Islamic law. The
kingdom usually beheads or sentences people to lashings for
murder, rape and drug-smuggling. The Sunni Muslim-majority
country and member of the Group of 20 nations has been
criticized by international human rights groups.  Two other Saudi nationals were executed in the northern
city of Tabuk yesterday, bringing the total number of executions
to 10, London-based  Amnesty International  said in a statement on
its website yesterday. At least 58 people have been executed in
the country this year, including 20 foreign nationals, Amnesty
said.  “Court proceedings in Saudi Arabia fall far short of
international standards for fair trial and news of these recent
multiple executions is deeply disturbing,” Hassiba Hadj
Sahraoui, Amnesty’s Deputy Director for  Middle East  and North
Africa, said in the statement.  The number of executions had been declining, dropping to 27
people in 2010 and 69 in 2009 from about 102 the year earlier
and 158 in 2007, according to Amnesty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
