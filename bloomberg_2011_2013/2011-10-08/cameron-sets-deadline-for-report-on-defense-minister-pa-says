British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
has requested a report on an investigation into U.K. Defence
Secretary Liam Fox by Oct. 10, the Press Association said,
citing a Downing Street statement.  Cameron has asked Gus O’Donnell, head of the civil service,
to give him the initial findings of the inquiry into Fox’s
working relationship with Adam Werritty -- a former flatmate who
was best man at the minister’s wedding and who describes himself
as Fox’s adviser -- PA cited a spokeswoman for Cameron as
saying.  The Ministry of Defence said Oct. 6 that Fox had asked
Permanent Secretary Ursula Brennan to look into what he
describes as “baseless allegations” concerning Werritty, PA
reported. Brennan originally set out a two week timetable for
producing her early conclusions, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
