Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  will
“significantly” exceed its production target of 1.6 million
vehicles this year,  Automotive News Europe  reported, citing the
company’s head of production, Frank-Peter Arndt.  BMW factories are projected to run at 110 percent of
capacity, with full capacity defined as two shifts working five
days a week, Automotive News said. BMW could absorb a slump in
demand of 20 percent to 30 percent in the event of an economic
downturn, Arndt said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
