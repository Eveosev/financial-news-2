Colombia ’s government reduced its
fiscal deficit forecast as tax income exceeds projections,
President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  The deficit this year probably will be 3.3 percent of gross
domestic product, less than a previous 4 percent forecast,
Santos told a conference in Cartagena, according to comments
published yesterday on the  presidential website .  Colombia’s economy expanded 5.2 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the second-fastest pace in three
years. Tax revenue will be about 8 percent more than previously
calculated, giving the economy a better position to face an
“uncertain global panorama,” Santos said.  “We are going to be better protected for any
eventuality,” he said, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
