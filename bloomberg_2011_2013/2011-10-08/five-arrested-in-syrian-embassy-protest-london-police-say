Five people were arrested at the
Syrian embassy in  London  during a protest in which three men
climbed onto the building, the Metropolitan Police said.  The trio climbed onto a ledge above the front door of the
embassy and didnâ€™t enter the building, a police spokesman said
by telephone, declining to be named according to department
policy.  The nationalities of those detained have not been
confirmed, the spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
