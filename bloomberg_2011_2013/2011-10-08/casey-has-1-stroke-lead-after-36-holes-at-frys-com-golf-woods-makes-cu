Tiger Woods made the cut at the
Frys.com Open, where England’s  Paul Casey  holds a one-stroke
lead after two rounds.  Woods is 1-under par at the CordeVale Golf Club in San
Martin,  California , as the second round was completed this
morning after being suspended by darkness yesterday. The cut to
play the final two rounds was 1-over par.  Casey reached 8-under after a 64 yesterday. Ernie Els
finished up a round of 66 this morning to tie American Bud
Cauley for second place at 7-under.  Woods, 35, is working with caddie Joe LaCava for the first
time at the tournament, having split in July with Steve
Williams, with whom he won 13 of 14 major championships and 72
tournaments worldwide. LaCava spent 20 years as  Fred Couples ’s
caddie and briefly carried Dustin Johnson’s bag earlier this
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
