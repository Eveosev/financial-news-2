China ’s air travel grew at less than
half the pace of capacity in the National Day holiday week,
adding to signs that the world’s second-largest economy may be
slowing down.  Air traffic capacity rose 8.2 percent to 42,263 flights
during the so-called Golden Week holiday period Oct. 1-7, the
Ministry of Transport said in a  statement  on its website today.
Passenger traffic increased 5.2 percent to 5.98 million during
the week, it said.  Growth in passenger numbers slowed from a 24 percent jump
for the entire Golden Week vacation last year as waning
manufacturing and a cooling property market damp  consumer
spending . A gauge of Chinese production compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics shrank for a third month in
September.  Airlines filled between 78 percent and 79 percent of seats
on domestic routes during this year’s holiday, except for Oct. 1,
when the occupancy rate exceeded 80 percent, the transportation
regulator said.  Last year’s travel numbers were partly boosted by the World
Expo in Shanghai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
