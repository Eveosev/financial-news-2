The  Green Bay  Packers, the only
publicly owned professional U.S. sports franchise, received
National Football League approval to hold their fifth stock sale
to help finance a $140 million upgrade to  Lambeau Field .  The team may complete the sale of 100,000 shares priced at
$200 or more per share by Christmas, Jason Wied, the team’s vice
president of administration and general counsel, said last
month. The Packers want to add 6,600 seats and two gates to the
54-year-old field.  “The Packers appreciate the NFL’s review of our
information relating to a potential stock sale,” Wied said last
night in an e-mailed statement. “Proceeding with a stock sale
would also involve regulatory steps and other actions, which we
are exploring. We intend to keep our fans informed of further
developments to the greatest extent possible.”  Commissioner Roger Goodell “has determined that the stock
sale meets the appropriate conditions established in 1997 for
such a sale in order to raise funds for stadium renovation,”
NFL senior vice president  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail.  The NFL said in 1997 that the Packers could sell stock for
capital-raising purposes such as stadium improvements, Aiello
said. The proceeds will be held separate from other team funds.  Shares Authorized  “In this case, the Packers are planning to sell shares
that were authorized, but not sold, in 1997,” Aiello said.  The other 31 NFL teams will be briefed on the plan at the
owners meeting Oct. 11 in Houston. No ownership vote is
required, Aiello said.  Green Bay is the smallest market in the NFL, with a
population of 100,971, according to the  U.S. Census Bureau .  The Packers are valued at $1.08 billion, ninth highest in
the league, according to  Forbes  magazine. The team’s permanence
keeps the franchise from reaching its maximum value, Robert Boland, Academic Chair of NYU’s  Tisch Center for Hospitality and
Sports Management , said in an interview last month.  The Packers have about 112,000 shareholders owning 4.75
million shares. The team has sold shares four times in its 93-
year history, first in 1923 when 1,000 people bought $5 shares
and most recently in 1997 when the team raised $24 million to
renovate Lambeau. Then, the Packers issued more than 100,000
shares at $200 apiece.  Shareholders vote on board members, and get an invitation
to the team’s annual meeting in July, where the team schedules a
special event each season, such as a locker-room tour or a
private rookie practice. There is also a private merchandise
store with shirts, hats and accessories priced from $5 to $65.  To contact the reporters on this story:
