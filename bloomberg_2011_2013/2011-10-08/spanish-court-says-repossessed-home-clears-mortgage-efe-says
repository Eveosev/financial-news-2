A family thrown out of its Spanish
home after defaulting on the mortgage doesn’t have to repay
162,500 euros ($217,620) outstanding on the debt after the house
was sold by lender  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Efe newswire reported,
citing a court ruling.  The court in Gerona said that Deutsche Bank, which
auctioned the house after foreclosing on a 303,658-euro loan,
wasn’t acting in good faith even though most mortgage contracts
state that banks have recourse to all of a person’s assets, Efe
said, citing a lobby group representing borrowers.  The court followed a precedent set by the provincial court
of Navarre in a December ruling and said it sought a solution
that avoided “unjustified profits,” the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
