Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel won pole
position for tomorrow’s Japanese Grand Prix, where he can win
his second consecutive Formula One world championship.  Vettel beat out McLaren’s Jenson Button by nine-thousandths
of a second at Suzuka to top qualifying for the 12th time in 15
races this season. The German, who’s won nine times this season,
needs just to finish in the top 10 to claim the title.  “What a qualifying!” Vettel said in a news conference.
“There isn’t much between Jenson and myself. We were able to
extract everything we had today, which was just enough, so we’re
very happy.”  McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton qualified third ahead of Ferrari
teammates Felipe Massa and  Fernando Alonso . Red Bull’s  Mark
Webber , Mercedes’s  Michael Schumacher , Renault’s Bruno Senna and
Vitaly Petrov and Sauber’s Kamui Kobayashi round out the top-10
starters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
