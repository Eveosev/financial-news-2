Paul McCartney  will marry Nancy
Shevell in  London  tomorrow, the Mirror reported, citing a person
close to the musician and former member of the Beatles that it
didn’t identify.  Thirty guests will attend the ceremony at Westminster
Register Office, after McCartney, 69, got special dispensation
from the local council to get married on a Sunday, the newspaper
said. Shevell, 51, is a U.S. heiress, the paper said.  The reception for tomorrow’s wedding will be held in a
marquee in the garden of McCartney’s London home, according to
the Mirror. Guests will dine on an entirely vegetarian three-
course meal mostly made with organic produce, which McCartney’s
daughter Stella helped choose, the newspaper said. His brother,
Mike, will be best man, the newspaper said.  It will be McCartney’s third marriage, after first wife
Linda Eastman, whom he married in 1969, died of  breast cancer  in
1998 and following a divorce from second wife Heather Mills in
2006, according to the Mirror. Mills was awarded 24 million
pounds ($32 million) and 35,000 pounds a year payments to
support their daughter in a court-ruling on the divorce, the
Mirror said.  A spokesman for McCartney declined to comment, according to
the Mirror.  To contact the reporter on this story:
