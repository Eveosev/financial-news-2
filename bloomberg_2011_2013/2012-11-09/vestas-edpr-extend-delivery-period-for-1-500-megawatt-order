Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  agreed to
extend by three years the delivery period for a 1,500-megawatt
order received in 2010 from  EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable
energy division of Portugal’s biggest utility.  The delivery period, originally slated for 2011 and 2012,
will now stretch to 2015, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas said
today in a statement to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The
postponement won’t affect the turbine maker’s forecast for 6.3
gigawatts of shipments in 2012, Vestas said.  “It’s a master-supply agreement, meaning they have to
inform us in advance and we have to plan in advance,” Lars
Villadsen, an investor relations spokesman for Vestas, said in a
phone interview. “We have for some time been negotiating an
extension to the delivery period, so it’s factored into the plan
already.”  Villadsen said the change also won’t affect Vestas’s
forecast for 5 gigawatts of shipments next year. He declined to
say how much of the 1,500 megawatts has already been delivered,
citing contractual confidentiality. EDPR didn’t exercise an
option in the original agreement to extend the order to 2,100
megawatts, he said.  EDPR is a unit of EDP-Energias de  Portugal  SA, which is
based in Lisbon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
