Metex Manufacturing Corp. , formerly
known as Kentile Floors Inc., filed for  bankruptcy protection 
for the second time since 1992 to cope with asbestos product-
liability claims.  The company, which manages two industrial facilities in New
Jersey, listed assets and debt of more than $100 million each in
Chapter 11 documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Metex faces about about 6,000 active asbestos claims
tied to Kentile, according to court papers.  Planned insurance settlements, including a trust, “will
provide the best and fairest opportunity for all asbestos
personal injury claimants,” Anthony Miceli, president of Great
Neck, New York-based Metex, said today in court papers.  Kentile  traced its roots to the late 1800s, when it began
manufacturing cork tile. Until the mid-1980s, Kentile used
asbestos, a type of mineral which can cause  lung disease  when
the fibers are inhaled, in some tiles. The company “experienced
severe difficulties” when it could no longer use asbestos,
according to court papers.  Kentile sought  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  in 1992
while facing about 20,000 asbestos claims. The company changed
its name to Metex in 1998, according to court papers.  The case is In re Metex Mfg. Corp., 12-14554, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
