U.S. banking regulators said today
they don’t expect to finish implementing new capital rules known
as Basel III on Jan. 1, 2013, the deadline set by the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision .  The delay came because “many industry participants have
expressed concern” the rules would go into effect before they
understood or were able to adapt to them, according to a release
from the  Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  “In light of the volume of comments received and the wide
range of views expressed during the comment period, the agencies
do not expect that any of the proposed rules would become
effective on January 1, 2013,” the agencies said.  The bank capital rules for the U.S., Europe and Japan were
agreed to by the Basel Committee and were drawn up to prevent a
repeat of the financial crisis that followed the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
