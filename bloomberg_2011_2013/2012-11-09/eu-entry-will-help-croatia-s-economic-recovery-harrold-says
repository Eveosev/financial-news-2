Croatia  should “maximize benefits”
from the European Union membership once it joins next year to
fund investment projects and kickstart economic recovery, Peter Harrold, the  World Bank ’s senior official, said.  “Croatia will be treated very generously by the EU in the
next seven years and that could lead to a huge stimulus of the
economy,” Harrold, the lender’s regional director for central
 Europe  and the Baltics, told reporters in Zagreb.  Croatia, which is set to become the EU’s 28th member in
July 2013, stands to receive about 10 billion euros ($12.7
billion) in EU grants through 2020. The Adriatic Sea nation is
struggling to revive the economy and boost investment after
three years of recession and stagnation.  Harrold also said he “has doubts” that Croatia is
prepared to absorb the EU funds that will become available.  The  government  estimated the economy will stagnate this
year, while the European Commission said on Nov. 7 it will
shrink 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
