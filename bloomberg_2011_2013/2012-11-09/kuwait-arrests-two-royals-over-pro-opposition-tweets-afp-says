Kuwait has arrested two members of
the Al-Sabah ruling family for writing posts on Twitter critical
of the government and supportive of the opposition,  Agence
France-Presse  reported.  Sheikh Abdullah Salem Al-Sabah and Sheikh Nawaf Malek Al-
Sabah were arrested on Nov. 7 after posting messages sympathetic
to the Kuwaiti opposition, which has been organizing
demonstrations protesting government-imposed changes to the
voting law, AFP reported, citing lawyer Al-Humaidi Al-Subaie.
The young royals are expected to be questioned by the public
prosecutor later today, he said.  The Cabinet held an extraordinary meeting Oct. 20 to issue
a draft decree changing the voting system by reducing the number
of candidates each voter can elect to one from four. The
opposition has alleged the change will make it easier for
corrupt candidates to buy votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
