Mexico ’s peso posted its biggest
weekly drop in five months as inflation slowed and scheduled
U.S. tax increases and spending cuts threatened to stall the
largest economy and hurt the Latin American country’s exports.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 13.2003 per dollar at 4 p.m.
in Mexico City. The currency finished the week with a decline of
1.2 percent, the steepest since the five days ended June 1. The
five-day slump was the biggest among the greenback’s 16 most-
traded counterparts after the  New Zealand dollar .  “After the U.S. elections, we once again saw people
focusing on the fiscal cliff,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America
strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia , said in a phone interview
from Toronto.  U.S. President  Barack Obama , who won re-election Nov. 6, is
facing more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts
that take effect in January if lawmakers fail to reach a
compromise. Mexico, which sends about 80 percent of its exports
to its northern neighbor, stands to suffer from measures
projected to send the world’s biggest economy into recession in
the first half of 2013.  Mexico’s annual inflation slowed last month for the first
time since April, the national statistics institute reported
yesterday. Consumer prices rose 4.60 percent in October from a
year earlier compared with 4.77 percent in the prior month.  Rate Outlook  Yields on interbank rate futures contracts due in February
2013 fell 0.06 percentage point yesterday, indicating traders no
longer expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs from a
record low 4.5 percent at the March meeting.  The inflation report “pared down expectations of rate
hikes,” Suarez said.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell seven basis points
today, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.42 percent, extending the
weekly drop to 19 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price has climbed 1.98 centavos to 140.53
centavos per peso this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
