Greece  plans to hold a licensing
round for the exploration of oil and natural gas in the Ionian
Sea and south of the island of Crete in the first half of 2014,
the  energy ministry  said.  The Nordic Explorer research vessel of  Norway â€™s  Petroleum
Geo-Services ASA (PGS)  will begin Nov. 11 a three-month long seismic
survey of the Ionian Sea and the maritime zone south of Crete in
an area that covers a total 220,000 square kilometers, which is
40 percent larger than mainland Greece, the Athens-based
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Processing and interpretation of the data from the survey
should be completed by mid-2013, with the aim of holding the
licensing round for exploration blocks in the first half of
2014, according to the statement.  Houston, Texas-based  Noble Energy Inc (NBL)  said Dec.28 it found
as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of gas off the southern coast
of Cyprus. The geological conditions in this area may extend
west to south of Crete, former Greek energy minister  George
Papaconstantinou  said in an interview March 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
