The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index dropped as  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  posted its biggest weekly slide since
2004 on concern the Brazilian government’s plan to lower
electricity costs will hurt profits.  Braskem SA,  Latin America ’s largest petrochemicals maker,
led declines on the gauge. Concert promoter T4F Entretenimento
SA fell after posting third-quarter earnings that trailed
forecasts. Banco do Brasil SA slid to the lowest since July.  The Bovespa fell for a third day, declining 0.3 percent to
57,357.71 at the close of trading in Sao Paulo and extending its
weekly decline to 1.8 percent. Forty-two stocks fell on the
gauge today while 24 gained. The real weakened 0.2 percent to
2.0462 per  U.S. dollar .  “The government’s interference in the electric sector
makes investors more cautious about putting money in  Brazil 
because people worry that other sectors may also be targeted at
some point,” Otavio Vieira, who helps manage 270 million reais
as a partner at hedge fund Fides Asset Management, said by phone
from  Rio de Janeiro .  The gauge gained as much as 1 percent earlier as OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA rose even after posting third-
quarter results that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Shares slid again after U.S. President  Barack Obama  said he
was “open to compromise” on budget negotiations and reiterated
that a solution must include spending cuts and raising revenue,
including raising taxes on the wealthiest.  Eletrobras Swoons  Preferred shares of Eletrobras, as power company Centrais
Eletricas is also known, fell 2.7 percent to 13.76 reais. The
stock is down 18 percent since Nov. 2, the steepest weekly
decline since December 2004.  Brazil’s government announced last week a plan to cut
electricity costs in which utilities must agree to reduce rates
when applying for contract renewals.  T4F, whose name stands for Time For Fun, tumbled 9.8
percent to 10.06 reais. The company posted third-quarter
adjusted net income of 12.5 million reais, missing an average
forecast of 15.6 million reais, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twenty-three out of 35 companies on the Bovespa that have
reported third-quarter earnings missed analysts’ forecasts.  “There haven’t been many companies that surprised
positively this earnings season,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at
Orama Asset Management, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro.  Braskem fell 4.7 percent to 13.85 reais. Banco do Brasil
slid 2.3 percent to 20.95 reais.  Rally Since June  OGX gained 1.7 percent to 4.85 reais after earlier falling
as much as 2.9 percent. The company posted a third-quarter loss
excluding one-time charges of 343.3 million reais, compared with
an average estimate among analysts of a 152.6 million reais
loss, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bovespa has climbed 9.3 percent from this year’s low on
June 5 as stimulus from central banks around the world eased
economic concern and borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index trades at 15.5 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next four quarters, which compares
with the ratio of 11.3 times for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 6.7 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo 
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with a daily average of 7.23 billion reais this year through
Nov. 7, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
