Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis became
South Africa’s greatest scoring partnership on the opening day
of the first cricket Test against  Australia .  Amla is an unbeaten 90 and Kallis 84 not out as the
Proteas, the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council’s
Test rankings, reached 255-2 in Brisbane. The duo has scored
3,607 runs to break the mark of 3,592 held by Kallis and Gary
Kirsten.  Captain Graeme Smith was out leg before wicket to James
Pattinson for 10 and Alviro Petersen was caught by Michael
Hussey off Nathan Lyon for 64, leaving the visitors 119-2. Amla
and Kallis then teamed for 136 runs before bad light stopped
play eight overs early.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
