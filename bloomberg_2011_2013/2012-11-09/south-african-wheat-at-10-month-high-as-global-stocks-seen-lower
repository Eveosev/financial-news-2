South African wheat rose to the
highest in 10 months before a report from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  that is expected to slow a decline in global stocks
of the grain.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
gained 0.9 percent, the highest since Jan. 19 when the contract
started trading, to 3,753 rand ($431) a metric ton by the close
in Johannesburg.  Global inventories were forecast to slump to 166.7 million
tons from 189.2 million tons a year earlier, the  United Nations ’
Food & Agriculture Organization said yesterday. The U.S.
government will probably trim its estimate for global stockpiles
to 171.5 million tons from last month’s 173 million tons in a
report due in  Washington  today, a Bloomberg survey showed.  “The USDA report is coming out today and expectations from
the market are that wheat stocks will be reduced,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader, said by phone from Kroonstad in
 South Africa . “With that momentum carrying on, prices are high
today.”  South  Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after Ethiopia. Imports
surged to the highest in at least 14 years, the Pretoria-based
South African Grain Information Service said on Oct. 2.  White corn for delivery in December declined 0.4 percent to
2,466 rand a ton, while the yellow variety dropped 0.6 percent
to 2,509 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
