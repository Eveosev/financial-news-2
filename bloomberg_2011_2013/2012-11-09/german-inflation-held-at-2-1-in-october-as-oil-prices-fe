Germany ’s inflation rate remained
unchanged in October as  oil prices  declined.  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, held at 2.1 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today, confirming an Oct. 29 estimate. That’s in
line with all 21 economist estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .
In the month, consumer prices rose 0.1 percent.  Oil prices dropped 7 percent in October as global growth
weakened. The European Central Bank yesterday kept  interest
rates  unchanged and President  Mario Draghi  said on Nov. 7 the
sovereign debt crisis is starting to hurt Germany, the pillar of
economic strength in the 17-nation currency bloc.  Euro-area “inflation rates are likely to remain above 2
percent for the remainder of 2012,” Draghi said. “They are
expected to fall below that level in the course of next year.”  The European Commission on Nov. 7 predicted euro-region
inflation to average 2.5 percent this year and 1.8 percent in
2013, more than the 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent forecast for
Germany, Europe’s largest economy.  Germany’s non-harmonized inflation rate held at 2 percent
in October, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
