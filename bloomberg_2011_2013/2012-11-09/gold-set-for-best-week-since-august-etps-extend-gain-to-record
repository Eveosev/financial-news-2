Gold futures capped the biggest
weekly gain since January as speculation that the U.S. will
expand monetary stimulus following President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election bolstered demand for the metal as a store of value.  Mitt Romney , the loser in the election, criticized Federal
Reserve policies and said he would replace Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke. The U.S. risks entering a recession should policy
makers fail to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic tax
increases and spending cuts next year, Fitch Ratings said.  “Global stimulus announcements and negative real interest
rates are helping gold,” Michael Smith, the president of T&K
Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview. “Also, some investors are buying gold to
hedge against the uncertainty surrounding the tax program and
fiscal cliff.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1,730.90 an ounce at 1:33 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $1,739.40, the highest for a most-
active contract since Oct. 19.  This week, the metal has climbed 3.3 percent, the most
since Jan. 27. Gold dropped in the previous four weeks, the
longest slump since September 2011.  Demand in  India , the world’s biggest user last year, may
climb as much as 15 percent this quarter as festivals boost
sales,  Rajesh Exports Ltd. (RJEX) , a jewelry maker, said.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 1.1 percent to
$32.599 an ounce, extending the weekly advance climb to 5.6
percent and the first gain in eight weeks. Earlier, the price
reached $32.785, the highest since Oct. 19.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery rose 1.1 percent to close at $1,559.40 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery slipped 0.5
percent to $611.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
