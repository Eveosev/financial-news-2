Ukraine’s central bank increased
sales of foreign currency by 20 percent last month to support
the national currency, the hryvnia.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy , which is based in the
capital, Kiev, spent $2.17 billion in October to meet demand
from the population, compared with $1.8 billion a month earlier,
according to a statement on its website today.  The central bank said its reserves declined last month to
$26.8 billion compared with $29.3 billion in September. The NBU
has been supporting the hryvnia by buying and selling dollars on
the  interbank market .  Ukraine’s legislature approved a bill earlier this week
giving the central bank the power to determine the amount and
terms of exporters’ obligatory sales of foreign-currency
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
