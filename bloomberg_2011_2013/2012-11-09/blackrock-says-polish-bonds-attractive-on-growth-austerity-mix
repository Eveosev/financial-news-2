Polish bonds are attractive because
of the government’s “prudent” policy of balancing economic
growth and budget cuts, according to  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s fund
manager Beata Harasim.  “Polish bonds look attractive in the current
environment,” said Harasim, who helps oversee 27 billion euros
in European fixed-income assets for the world’s largest asset
manager. “Fundamentals are still supportive with the risk of
recession being very low, the central bank is cutting  interest
rates  and fiscal policy is prudent.”  While the rally has sent yields to record lows, further
gains won’t be “as spectacular as we have seen so far this
year,” said Harasim. The zloty is “very close to being fairly
valued” after 7.5 percent appreciation against the euro in
2012, she said.  Polish bonds have lured foreign investors as the European
Union’s largest eastern economy dodged recession amid the debt
crisis while the government reduces the  budget deficit . The
yield on 10-year zloty notes tumbled 1.66 percentage point this
year, on course for biggest gain in a decade, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “Poland’s ability to balance growth and fiscal discipline
is a very strong point supporting the local  bond market ,”
Harasim said. The country’s debt “will obviously not remain
immune if the low yield environment were to change or if flows
to emerging markets turned around,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
