Refined-tin shipments from  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest exporter, gained 12 percent in October to
the highest level in 10 months as prices gained.  Exports rose to 11,048.4 metric tons from 9,874.5 tons in
September, data from the Trade Ministry showed today. That’s the
highest level since December, when shipments reached 15,102.8
tons. Sales were 5,441.6 tons in October of last year.  Higher shipments from Indonesia, which account for about 40
percent of global trade, may halt the rally in tin in London.
Futures have risen 17 percent since July when the metal plunged
to the lowest close since 2010.  The metal was shipped to 13 countries last month, with
Singapore accounting for about 67 percent of sales, the data
showed. Other destinations include Malaysia,  Japan ,  China  and
 South Korea .  Producers in Indonesia restricted sales in August after the
price of the metal used to make solder and packaging dropped in
July. The stoppage, which idled about 70 percent of smelting
capacity in Bangka-Belitung province, the country’s main
producing region, lasted for less than a month after prices
rallied.  Tin for three month delivery fell 1.2 percent to $20,295 a
ton on the London Metal Exchange at 5:54 p.m. Jakarta time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
