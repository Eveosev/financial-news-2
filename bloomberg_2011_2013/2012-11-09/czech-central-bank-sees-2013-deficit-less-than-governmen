The Czech central bank forecasts the
public-finance  deficit  to be less than the government’s target
next year even as it expects weaker economic growth than the
 Finance Ministry .  The Ceska Narodni Banka in  Prague  sees the shortfall at 2.6
percent of economic output in 2013, compared with the
government’s target of 2.9 percent, according to the bank’s
quarterly Inflation Report published on its website today. The
central bank sees  gross domestic product  growth of 0.2 percent
next year, less than the Finance Ministry’s forecast for a 0.7
percent expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
