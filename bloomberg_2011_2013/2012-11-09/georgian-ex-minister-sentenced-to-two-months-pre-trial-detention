A former Georgian minister and ally
of President Mikheil Saakashvili was sentenced to two months in
pre-trial detention after being charged with abuse of office and
false imprisonment.  The Tbilisi City Court in the Black Sea nation’s capital
refused today to grant bail to Bacho Akhalaia, a former interior
and defense minister, according to his lawyer David Dekanoidze.
It freed on bail former chief of staff Giorgi Kalandadze, who’s
also charged with abuse of office.  U.S.-backed Saakashvili’s party was unexpectedly defeated
by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition in
Oct. 1 elections. Akhalaia’s detention is “political revenge,”
former ruling party member Nugzar Tsiklauri told reporters
outside the court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
