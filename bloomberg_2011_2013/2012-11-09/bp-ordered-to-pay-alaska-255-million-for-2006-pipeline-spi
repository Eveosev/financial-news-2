BP Plc (BP/) ’s exploration unit was ordered
to pay Alaska $255 million in damages for a 2006 oil pipeline
spill at its Prudhoe Bay field, according to the state attorney
general’s office.  The state won an arbitration award against BP Exploration
Inc. for damages for oil production shortfalls caused by leaks
and pipeline replacements, the office said in an e-mailed
statement. BP admitted liability for the purposes of the
arbitration and said the state had suffered no losses and asked
the arbitration panel to award no damages, the statement said.  After reimbursements from the other owners of BP
Exploration, BP Plc’s share of the judgment will be about $66
million, Dawn Patience, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  owns 36 percent of BP Exploration,
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  owns 36 percent and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  has a 1
percent stake, Patience said.  “We are pleased to finally resolve the last remaining
claim” from the spill, the London-based company said in an e-
mailed statement.  BP pleaded guilty in 2007 to violating the Clean Water Act
by spilling 200,000 gallons of oil from its  Prudhoe Bay  field
into water on Alaska’s North Slope in 2006.  Prudhoe Bay, the largest field in the U.S., came online in
1977 and can produce about 400,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
