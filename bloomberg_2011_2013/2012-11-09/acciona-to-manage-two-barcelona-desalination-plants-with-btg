Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy and
water provider, and the Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual
will manage Barcelona’s two desalination plants in an agreement
with the Catalonia regional government.  The Alcobendas, Spain-based company said its Acciona Agua
unit and BTG Pactual both have 39 percent interests and minority
investors smaller stakes in the new 50-year concession for
Aigues Ter Llobregat, the company that manages upstream water
supplies for the Barcelona area and 5 million residents.  The desalination plants are the Prat de Llobregat and
Tordera. Acciona also operates desalination plants in Perth and
Adelaide, Australia; Beckton in the U.K.; and in Tampa,  Florida .
The company is building the world’s biggest wastewater treatment
plant in Atotonilco,  Mexico , which Acciona will operate for 25
years and provide fresh water for 10.5 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
