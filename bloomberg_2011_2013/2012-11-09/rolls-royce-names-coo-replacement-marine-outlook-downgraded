(Corrects to say guidance excludes Tognum in last
paragraph.)  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the second
biggest maker of commercial aircraft engines, today named Alain
Michaelis lead operations director to replace retiring Chief
Operating Officer Mike Terrett.  Michaelis, Terrett’s deputy, who also runs the gas turbine
supply chain operation, will take over the COO’s responsibility
at a non-board level, according to the company. Michaelis joined
Rolls-Royce in December 2008.  The appointment comes as Rolls-Royce also confirmed full-
year guidance, while downgrading expectations for its Marine
unit where ’’due to the phasing of deliveries, underlying
revenue is now expected to be broadly flat.’’ It previously
forecast a “modest increase.”  At company level Rolls expects “good growth in underlying
revenue and underlying profit, with cash flow around break
even,” the London-based company said. Civil Aerospace should
see strong profit growth, defense modest growth and the energy
business improving profit.  Guidance excludes the acquisition of the Tognum diesel
engine business, which remains in process, and the disposal of
Rolls’s share of the  United Technologies (UTX)  Pratt & Whitney-led
International Aero Engines joint venture building powerplants
for Airbus SAS A320 single-aisle airliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
