Centrais Eletricas do Para SA , a
Brazilian utility know as Celpa that was acquired this month by
 Equatorial Energia SA (EQTL3) , filed for Chapter 15  bankruptcy
protection  in New York.  The company, based in Belem, Brazil, listed both debt and
assets of more than $1 billion in documents filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Chapter 15 protects foreign
companies from U.S. lawsuits and creditor claims while a company
reorganizes abroad.  Celpa is asking the U.S. court to recognize the proceeding
pending before the Thirteenth Civil Court of Belem, State of
Para, as a “foreign main proceeding,” according to court
papers.  Celpa filed for bankruptcy protection in Brazil in February
after a four-year freeze on rates pushed up debt to about 2.3
billion reais.  Celpa distributes electricity to 7.4 million people in 143
municipalities in the northern Brazilian state of Para, the
company said in the February filing.  The case is  Centrais Eletricas do Para SA (CELP5) , 12-14568,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
