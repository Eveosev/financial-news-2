TPC Group Inc. (TPCG) , the butadiene maker
that agreed to be acquired for $705.9 million, should hold an
auction to allow  Innospec Inc. (IOSP)  to offer a higher price, said
shareholder Sandell Asset Management Corp.  TPC shouldn’t have cut off talks with Innospec weeks before
the company concluded its due diligence, Sandell Chief Executive
officer Thomas E. Sandell said today in a letter to TPC
directors. On Oct. 8, fuel-additives maker Innospec and private-
equity firm  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  made a non-binding offer of $44
to $46 a share.  TPC said yesterday it agreed to a sweetened, fully financed
bid from First Reserve Corp. and SK Capital Partners of $45 a
share, up from $40. Giving Innospec more time to determine TPC’s
value would ensure a “level playing field” and avoid what
appears to be a “flawed process,” Sandell said.  “We urge you to fully cooperate with Innospec, allowing
them to complete due diligence and seek to have them increase
their offer,” Sandell said in the letter. TPC should “engage
in an auction with all interested and bona fide bidders.”  Sandell, the third-largest TPC  shareholder  with a 7.1
percent stake according to data compiled by Bloomberg, said in
August that the $40 bid was an “outrage” and an attempt to
steal the company at the bottom of the industry’s cycle.  TPC competes in the market for butadiene, a chemical used
to make synthetic rubber, with  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp.  TPC  fell  0.2 percent to $46.42 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
