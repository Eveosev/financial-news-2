State Bank of India  shares headed for
their biggest drop for this month in Mumbai after the nation’s
largest lender said defaults climbed in the second quarter.  Net income rose 30 percent to 36.6 billion rupees ($673
million), or 54.51 rupees a share, for the three months ended
Sept. 30, from 28.1 billion rupees, or 44.26 rupees, a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based bank said in a filing to exchanges
today. That compared with the 35.2 billion-rupee median of 38
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The government-controlled lender’s profit growth may slow
as bad debts rise further and demand for credit declines in an
economy that the  International Monetary Fund  said is expanding
at the slowest pace in a decade. The central bank’s reluctance
to ease the highest borrowing costs among  Asia ’s major economies
may also hinder  State Bank ’s efforts to boost lending.  “The bad-loan numbers disappointed,” Nitin Kumar, a
Mumbai-based analyst at Quant Broking Ltd., said by telephone.
“The management had given the impression that there would be a
marked improvement in asset quality. Investors are
disappointed.”  Shares of State Bank fell 3.8 percent to 2,158 rupees as of
3:09 p.m. in Mumbai. The  stock has risen  33 percent this year,
surpassing the 21 percent gain in the equity benchmark BSE  India 
Sensitive Index. The Bankex Index, a gauge for 14 lenders in the
country, has advanced 44 percent in 2012.  Bad Loans  Bad loans widened to 5.15 percent of total advances from
4.19 percent a year ago, SBI said today. Defaults will probably
drop in the quarter as recoveries increase, Chairman Pratip C. Chaudhuri had told reporters on Aug. 10.  The nation’s economy will grow 4.9 percent this year,
according to the IMF. Gross domestic product  expanded  5.5
percent in the three months ended June from a year earlier,
faster than a three-year low of 5.3 percent in the previous
quarter, according to the most recent government data.  Net interest income, or revenue from lending minus payments
on deposits, rose 4.7 percent to 110 billion rupees, the bank
said in the statement. The 206-year-old lender’s total
outstanding loans increased 18 percent from a year earlier to
9.6 trillion rupees at the end of September.  Loans at banks in India, excluding advances made to state
agencies for food procurement, expanded 16 percent in the 12
months to Oct. 19, data  compiled  by the  Reserve Bank  of India
show. The central bank trimmed its credit growth projection last
month to 16 percent for the year ending March 31, from 17
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
