Rafael Soriano ,  Hiroki Kuroda  and
 Nick Swisher  rejected $13.3 million qualifying offers from the
New York Yankees and Josh Hamilton turned down an equivalent bid
from the Texas Rangers as all chose to be free agents.  Outfielders  Michael Bourn , who played for the Atlanta
Braves last season, and B.J. Upton, who was with the Tampa Bay
Rays, also were among nine Major League Baseball players who
declined the $13.3 million offers, the Major League Baseball
Players Association said yesterday in a news release.  First baseman Adam LaRoche, who played with the Washington
Nationals in 2012; pitcher Kyle Lohse of the St. Louis
Cardinals; and designted hitter  David Ortiz  of the  Boston Red
Sox  also were listed. Ortiz agreed on a two-year deal to return,
the team announced on Nov. 6, making his rejection of the offer
a formality.  Under new terms of the major leagues’ collective bargaining
agreement with its players, teams can make one-year qualifying
offers for the average of the previous season’s 125 top
salaries, which this year is $13.3 million.  The players still may re-sign with their previous team. If
they sign elsewhere, their former franchise will be compensated
with a draft pick.  Soriano, 32, had 42 saves in 46 appearances last season,
filling in for the injured Mariano Rivera, who has said he’d
like to return in 2013.  The 31-year-old Swisher, who played four seasons with the
Yankees, batted .272 with 24 home runs and 93 runs batted in in
2012, playing in 148 games, including 41 at first base.  Yankees Season  Kuroda, 37, went 16-11 with a 3.32 earned run average in
his first season with the Yankees following four years with the
 Los Angeles Dodgers . His career record is 57-57 with a 3.42 ERA.  Hamilton, the 2010 American League Most Valuable Player,
batted .285 with a career-high 43 home runs and 128 runs batted
in last season. The 31-year-old outfielder has a .304 career
batting average.  Bourn, 29, stole 42 bases in 2012, posting a .274 batting
average with nine home runs and 57 RBI.  The 28-year-old Upton batted .246 with 28 home runs and 78
RBI for the Rays.  Lohse, 34, went 16-3 with a 2.86 ERA in his fifth year with
the Cardinals.  LaRoche, 33, hit .271 with a career-high 33 homers and 100
RBI in his second season in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
