German power for 2013 trimmed its
biggest weekly gain in three months as coal and carbon permits
advanced.  German power for next year rose 0.5 percent from Nov. 2 to
47 euros ($59.77) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg at 1 p.m. in Berlin. It was down 0.3
percent from yesterday’s close. The electricity contract remains
near its record low of 46.50 euros on Nov. 5.  EU emission permits for delivery in December advanced 1.2
percent from last week to 8.21 euros a metric ton on the ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange in  London . Coal rose 2.1 percent from
Nov. 2 at $95.50 a ton, broker data show.  “We believe that over 100 years of power demand growth is
now over for western Europe,” Alberto Gandolfi, an analyst for
UBS AG in London, said yesterday in an e-mailed research note.
The bank forecast 1 percent demand reductions a year through
2020, citing muted economic production, oversupply and energy
efficiency measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
