Peru ’s sol fell to its lowest level
in 10 weeks after policy makers took steps to slow capital
inflows that pushed the currency to a 15-year high last month.  The sol depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.6130 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
That is the weakest level since Aug. 30. The currency is
unchanged from a week ago.  The central bank increased  reserve requirements  for soles
and dollars for a third straight month Oct. 30 and is
considering relaxing limits on pension funds’ investments
abroad. The Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Pension
Fund Administrators said Oct. 19 it will consult lenders on a
proposal to tighten restrictions on banks’ dollar sales to
reduce bets against the greenback.  “We’ve seen more volatility in local banks’ dollar
positions over the past weeks following the adjustments by the
authorities,” said  Alejandro Cuadrado , the head of Latin
American currency strategy at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  in
New York.  Peruvian companies have turned to international bond
markets and foreign banks for financing amid record low
borrowing costs in the U.S. Foreign direct investment and demand
for Peruvian  government bonds  have added to inflows.  The sol touched 2.5770 on Oct. 22, the strongest since
December 1996, according to  data  from the banking regulator.  The central bank has bought $12.5 billion this year to stem
sol appreciation. The monetary authority purchased $20 million
in the spot market today and said on its website it paid an
average 2.6120 soles per dollar.  Risk Aversion  Increased  risk aversion  in global markets amid concern U.S.
and Chinese growth may falter has also curtailed demand for the
sol, Adrian Armas, research director at the central bank, said
on a conference call with reporters today.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.30 percent at 2:31 p.m. in Lima, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.08 centimo to 122.97
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
