Hong Kong  billionaire Peter Woo,
chairman of property developers  Wheelock & Co. (20)  and Wharf
(Holdings) Ltd., has a stake worth HK$5.4 billion ($700 million)
in rival developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., a public filing
shows.  Woo’s family owns 48,260,000 shares in Sun Hung Kai, the
largest real estate developer in Hong Kong, through a broker
named Corrington Securities & Investment Ltd., according to a
page detailing Sun Hung Kai’s shareholding structure posted on
the  website  of Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  Corrington is owned by Woo’s family, according to Agnes
Hui, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Wharf and Wheelock.
“Wheelock is not privy to the business of Corrington,” Hui
said in an email today, declining to make further comments.  Sun Hung Kai shares lost as much as 29 percent this year as
its billionaire co-chairmen Thomas and  Raymond Kwok  are facing
bribery-related offenses. The stock gained 0.5 percent to
HK112.40 as of 1:21 p.m in Hong Kong trading, giving Woo’s
holding a value of $HK5.4 billion.  -Michael Wei. Editors: Patrick Chu  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Michael Wei in
