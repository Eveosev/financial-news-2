Connecticut Water Service Inc. (CTWS) , a
water provider that’s expanding in the U.S. Northeast, reported
revenue rose almost a fifth to $26.5 million in the third
quarter, topping analysts’ estimates of $24.7 million.  Net income for the quarter climbed to almost $6 million
versus $3.7 million in the year-earlier period, the Clinton,
Connecticut-based utility said in a statement. The shares rose
as much as 3.5 percent, the most in more than three months.  The publicly traded water company agreed in July to expand
in New England by buying Maine-based  Biddeford & Saco Water Co. (BDDD) ,
winning approval of the purchase this week from Maine’s public
utility commission. When the closing is completed, the utility
will serve about 350,000 people in both states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
