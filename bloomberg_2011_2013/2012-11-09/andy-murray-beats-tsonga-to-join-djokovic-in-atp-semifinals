U.S. Open champion  Andy Murray 
defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to move to the last four of the ATP
World Tour Finals.  An ace out wide handed Olympic champion Murray a 6-2, 7-6
(7-3) win against the seventh-seeded player from France at
London’s O2 arena.  Murray joins top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals
of the season-ending championships for the world’s top eight
singles players and doubles pairs, which begins with a round-
robin format.  Serbia’s Djokovic, the champion in 2008, beat the fifth-
seeded Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic 6-2, 7-6 (8-6),
earlier today. Djokovic swept his three round-robin matches to
claim the top spot in the group. Murray finishes second, with
two wins and one loss - to Djokovic.  Six-time champion  Roger Federer  of  Switzerland  had already
qualified for the semi-finals yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
