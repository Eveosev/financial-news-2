Soybeans fell for a third day on
speculation that a U.S. government report today will show
supplies are more ample than previously estimated. Corn advanced
and wheat rose in Paris.  U.S. soybean output may total 2.89 billion bushels, 1.1
percent more than forecast a month ago, signaling yields may
have fared better during drought than expected, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the U.S. Department of Agriculture
updates domestic and world projections later today.  Brazil  may
harvest 83 million metric tons of soybeans this season, more
than the 82.8 million tons forecast last month, the  Agriculture
Ministry ’s forecasting agency, known as Conab, said yesterday.  “There does appear to be more bullish sentiment in grains
as we go into the report than oilseeds,” Erin FitzPatrick, an
analyst at Rabobank International, said by telephone from
London. “Conab raised its Brazil soybean expectations, so
likely the USDA will follow suit. The weather there has improved
a bit, although we’re still not as optimistic about the
production numbers as they are.”  Soybeans for January delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $14.86
a bushel a bushel by 5:15 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
poised for a 2.5 percent loss this week. Corn for delivery in
March rose 0.3 percent to $7.4525 a bushel, set for a second
weekly advance.  The USDA may cut its outlook for the U.S. corn crop to
10.67 billion bushels, compared with an October forecast of
10.706 billion bushels, analysts said. The USDA report is set to
be released at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  Global wheat stockpiles may total 171.5 million tons by the
end of this marketing year on June 1, down from last month’s
forecast of 173 million tons, the survey showed. The  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said yesterday that
inventories may total 166.7 million tons.  “Wheat supplies look set to tighten further,”  Wayne Gordon , a commodity strategist at UBS AG in New York, said in a
report yesterday. Poor crop conditions in the U.S., sub-optimal
soil moisture in  Russia , excessive rains in  Argentina  and
declining production in Australia will “keep supply-side risks
elevated for wheat going into the second quarter of 2013.”  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $9.0125 a
bushel in Chicago, paring this week’s gain to 4.3 percent.
Yesterday, the price rose to $9.05 a bushel, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 28.  In Paris, milling-wheat for January delivery climbed 0.7
percent to 277.50 euros ($352.79) a ton on NYSE Liffe, after
yesterday rising as high as 279.25 euros, a record for the
contract. Feed-wheat futures advanced 0.9 percent to 228.50
pounds ($364) a ton in  London , after reaching 229 pounds a ton
yesterday, the contract’s all-time high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
