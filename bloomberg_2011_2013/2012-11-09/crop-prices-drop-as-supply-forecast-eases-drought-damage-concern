Soybeans tumbled to a four-month low
and wheat fell the most in a month after the U.S. raised its
estimates for crop inventory including corn, easing concern over
tight supplies following the worst drought since 1956.  Global soybean stockpiles as of May 31 will be 60.02 metric
million tons, up 4.3 percent from last month’s forecast, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. World
wheat reserves at 174.18 million tons were up 0.7 percent from
the October projection, topping an average forecast of 171.5
million by 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The corn estimate
was increased 0.6 percent.  The Midwest drought that cut output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter of the three crops, sent soybean and
corn prices to record highs and wheat to a four-year peak.
Surging costs may have damped demand by makers of food, biofuel
and livestock feed, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  “Given all the rhetoric about the rest of the world
running out of food, it appears that supplies are adequate and
that high prices may have slowed demand,” Schultz said in a
telephone interview from  Minneapolis .  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 3 percent to
close at $14.5125 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the oilseed touched $14.49, the lowest for a
most-active contract since July 3. On Sept. 4, the price rose to
a record $17.89.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 1.7 percent to
$8.865 a bushel, the biggest decline since Oct. 12. The price
has surged 36 percent this year. On July 23, the grain reached
$9.4725, the highest since August 2008.  Grain Demand  World grain demand will fall 1.4 percent to 2.273 billion
tons from a year earlier, the USDA said. U.S. beef, pork and
chicken production will drop 2.2 percent in 2013 to 90.14
billion pounds.  Global food costs slipped in October from a six-month high
as prices, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization
said this week.  World soybean output in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 will
be 267.6 million tons, up 1.3 percent from the October forecast,
the USDA said.  Global wheat production was estimated at 651.43 million
tons, down 0.2 percent from October, while consumption was
forecast 0.5 percent lower at 675.14 million tons, according to
the USDA.  ‘More Comfortable’  “U.S. and global supplies are larger than people
thought,”  Don Roose , the president at U.S. Commodities Inc. in
 West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “The
market should be more comfortable that supplies will be adequate
with signs of slowing global demand.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.42 a
bushel. Earlier, the contract gained as much as 1.9 percent. The
grain has dropped 13 percent from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4
billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
