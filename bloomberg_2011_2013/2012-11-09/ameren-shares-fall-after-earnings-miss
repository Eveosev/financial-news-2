Ameren Corp. (AEE) , owner of  Missouri ’s
largest utility, fell the most in 11 months after the company
reported earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates and
narrowed its 2012 profit forecast.  Ameren fell 3.6 percent to $30.36 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest drop since Dec. 2, 2011.  Excluding a tax gain and a gain from contracts to lock in
commodity prices, Ameren’s per-share profit was 8 cents less
than the $1.41 average of eight analysts’  estimates compiled  by
Bloomberg.  Lower electricity sales at its Missouri utility, lower
power prices and higher coal costs for its merchant generation
unit and an Illinois utility rate order hurt quarterly results,
the  St. Louis , Missouri-based company said in a statement.  “Results were weak based on Ameren Illinois new formula
rates, which now reflect an authorized return on equity of 8.8
percent, one of the lowest authorized electric rates in the
country,” said Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a New York-based utility
analyst for UBS Securities LLC, said in a telephone interview.  “As a consequence, results were materially lighter than
our expectations,” said Dumoulin-Smith, who rates Ameren shares
to neutral, the equivalent of a hold, and doesn’t own any.  The company narrowed its 2012 adjusted earnings per share
guidance to $2.35 to $2.45, compared with a prior range of $2.25
to $2.55, Ameren said. Estimated 2012 per-share profit was
$2.46, based on the average of 11 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
