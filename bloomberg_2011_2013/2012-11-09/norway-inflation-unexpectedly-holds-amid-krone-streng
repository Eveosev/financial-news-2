Norwegian underlying inflation was
unchanged in October as a strong krone weighted on imported
prices, putting pressure on the central bank to keep  interest
rates  low.  Annual underlying inflation, which adjusts for taxes, fees
and energy prices, held at 1.1 percent in October, Oslo-based
 Statistics Norway  said today. The rate was estimated to rise to
1.2 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of nine economists.
Underlying consumer prices were unchanged from September.  Policy makers have left their main rate unchanged at 1.5
percent since March after cutting it twice since December. Last
week Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen postponed the bank’s
next rate rise into 2013, citing low inflation even as record
offshore investments helped push registered unemployment to
lowest in almost four years.  The strong krone, which has emerged as a haven from
 Europe ’s debt crisis, has helped keep inflation below the
central bank’s 2.5 percent target since mid-2009.  Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil, gas and
shipping, will expand 3.75 percent this year, according to
central bank forecasts. Economic developments “give reason to
believe that inflation will gradually pick up,” Olsen said in
the bank’s Oct. 31 monetary policy report.  Headline inflation was 1.1 percent in the year and 0.5
percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
