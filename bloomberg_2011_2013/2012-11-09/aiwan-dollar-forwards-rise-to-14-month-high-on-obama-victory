Taiwan dollar forwards rose to a 14-
month high, gaining for a second week, on speculation Asia will
attract more capital inflows as a result of monetary stimulus in
the U.S. after President  Barack Obama  won re-election.  Foreign funds have bought $197 million more Taiwanese
stocks than they sold so far this week, boosting net purchases
this year to $1.9 billion, exchange data show. Obama defeated
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , who had said he wouldn’t
appoint Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to a third term.
The U.S. central bank announced a third round of asset purchases
in September that adds $40 billion a month to the financial
system.  “There is still much hot money flowing in and that’s
causing appreciation,” said Albert Lee, a fixed-income trader
in Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co. “That’s related to the U.S.
election because Obama won.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.9 percent this
week to NT$28.925 versus the greenback as of 4:40 p.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts rose 0.5
percent today and reached NT$28.903 earlier, the strongest level
since September 2011. The contracts are at a 0.8 percent premium
to the spot rate.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.5 percent in the five days
to NT$29.150 against its U.S. counterpart, according to data
from Taipei Forex Inc. The currency rose 0.2 percent today and
earlier touched NT$29.028, the strongest level since September
2011. The local dollar has gained 4.4 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, increased 75 basis points, or 0.75
percentage point, this week and advanced 54 basis points today
to 4.14 percent.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2017
fell one basis point this week and two basis points today to
0.866 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The
 overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at 0.387
percent from Nov. 2, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
