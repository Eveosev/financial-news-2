Swedish industrial production fell
more than estimated in September as the export-dependent country
suffers from declining sales abroad.  Industrial production  fell an annual 5 percent, after
rising a revised 2.7 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based
Statistics  Sweden  said today. Production was  estimated  to fall
0.1 percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of six economists. Output fell a  monthly  4.1 percent,
compared with a predicted drop of 1.5 percent.  Sweden’s central bank last month signaled it may cut rates
for a fourth time since December last year as it trimmed its
2012  growth  forecast to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent. Exporters
including  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest maker of wireless
equipment, and truck maker  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  are cutting jobs as demand
slows from  Europe .  Industrial orders fell an  annual  5.3 percent and increased
a  monthly  1.2 percent in September, Statistics Sweden said.
Exports orders dropped an annual 4.3 percent, while domestic
orders declined an annual 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
