The pound was little changed versus
the dollar and the euro after a report showed Britainâ€™s trade
deficit narrowed more than economists forecast in September as
exports rose.  Sterling traded at $1.5980 versus the dollar after
declining to a two-week low yesterday of $1.5930. The U.K.
currency was at 79.74 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
