U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed, paring earlier gains, as investors awaited a report on
American  consumer confidence .  Futures on the  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index (SPX) , expiring in
December, rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,376.4 at 8:38 a.m. in
London, trimming an earlier increase of as much as 0.5 percent.
Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts expiring the same month
slipped 1 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 12,774.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer
sentiment index probably climbed to 83 in November, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the preliminary reading
due at 9:55 a.m. New York time today. The October reading of
82.6 was the highest since September 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
