Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Brazil’s biggest card-
payment processor, is selling $875 million of 10-year bonds at a
record low 3.8 percent yield, Banco Bradesco SA said.  Demand for the bonds, which will pay 225 basis points, or
2.25 percentage points, more than benchmark Treasuries, was
about eight times oversubscribed, Renato Ejnisman, managing
director at Bradesco BBI in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. The yield is a record low for a 10-year dollar bond
by a non-state-owned Brazilian company, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cielo obtained such a low yield  “because of the quality
of the company and because it’s a good moment in terms of demand
for Brazilian debt,” Ejnisman said.  Banco Bradesco ,  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. are arranging the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
