Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest
carmaker, will build a new engine factory in  Indonesia  to more 
than double capacity in the Southeast Asian country as demand
surges.   The automaker will boost annual capacity at its first
Karawang plant to 130,000 units by September 2013 from 110,000
units, the Toyota City, Japan-based company said in a Nov. 10
statement. The company will have capacity to make 250,000 cars
by 2014 after its second Karawang  factory  opens early next year.  Toyota and related companies plan to invest 13 trillion
rupiah ($1.35 billion) in Indonesia during the next five years,
boosting employment to about 41,000 from more than 32,000 at
present, according to the statement. Expansion in Indonesia
comes as the maker of Camry sedans seeks to raise its local
procurement rate to offset the impact of the strong yen. Toyota
now sources 75 percent of its components locally, according to
the statement.  “Toyota has been working with the government, customers
and community in Indonesia for more than 40 years and this is
why we think the country is very important,” President  Akio Toyoda  said at a press conference in Jakarta. The Southeast
Asian nation is also important because of its large population,
stable political situation and economy, he said.  Toyoda also met with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
last week. In the meeting, Yudhoyono asked the Japanese
carmaker’s support to develop low-cost and green automobiles,
Firmansyah, president’s special staff for the economy told
 Bloomberg News  by telephone.  Separately, the company will purchase 150 hectares of land
to build a new engine factory, Toyota said in the statement. The
automaker will hire 190 workers at the Karawang plant, it said.  Toyota fell 0.5 percent to close at 3,140 yen in Tokyo
trading on Nov. 9, paring this year’s gain to 22 percent. The
 benchmark   Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average had risen 3.6 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
