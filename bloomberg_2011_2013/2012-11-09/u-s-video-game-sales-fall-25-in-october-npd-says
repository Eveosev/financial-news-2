U.S. retail sales of video-game
software, hardware and accessories declined 25 percent in
October to $755.5 million from a year earlier, according to
researcher NPD Group Inc.  The decline was led by shrinking sales of consoles, which
fell 37 percent to $187.3 million, the  Port Washington , New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Software
sales fell 25 percent to $432.6 million, NPD said.  As the video-game industry enters the peak holiday shopping
season it has seen sales shrink this year as consumers buy fewer
packaged titles and shift to digital downloads and games played
on mobile devices.  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-largest U.S.
video-game publisher, said last month that its latest “Medal of
Honor” release had lower-than-expected early sales as the
buying season gets under way.  Microsoft held the lead in console sales in October for the
22nd consecutive month. The Redmond, Washington-based company
said in a separate statement that U.S. retailers sold 270,000 of
its Xbox consoles last month. That’s down 31 percent from
393,000 it sold a year earlier.  The company released “Halo 4,” a new installment to its
$3 billion shooter franchise, on Nov. 6, and  Activision Blizzard
Inc. (ATVI) , the largest U.S. video-game maker, plans to release a new
“Call of Duty” game on Nov. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
