London & Stamford Property Plc (LSP)  agreed
to buy  Metric Property Investments Plc (METP)  in an-all share
transaction combining two commercial property focused U.K. real
estate investment trusts.  London &  Stamford  offered 0.94 of a new share for each
Metric share, the companies said in a statement today. That gave
Metric a value of about  209 million pounds  ($334 million), the
London-based REITs said. The REITs said on Nov. 6. that they
were discussing a deal.  “Organizations across the world are deleveraging and we
believe that this will continue to bring attractively priced
assets to the market,” Andrew Jones, Metric’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “We are excited by the prospect
of being strongly positioned, with  London  & Stamford, to exploit
these opportunities as they arise across the market.”  Shareholders will receive more than 100 million pounds in
capital after the merger is completed, subject to their
approval, according to the statement. The enlarged group will
focus on commercial and residential property in London, suburban
retail investment and development and opportunistic purchases.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Peel Hunt are advising London &
Stamford, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Oriel Securities Ltd.
are acting for Metric.  To contact the reporter on this story:
