The Rutgers University football team
is 7-1, its best start in six years, and is doing it with a
first-year coach that is getting paid a third of his predecessor.  The Scarlet Knights, who beat Princeton in the first
college football game in 1869, are competing for the  Big East 
conference championship and the berth in a top-tier Bowl
Championship Series postseason game that goes along with the
title.  They are doing it under former Rutgers assistant  Kyle Flood ,
who was promoted to head coach on Feb. 1 when Greg Schiano left
to coach the  National Football League ’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At
$750,000 a year, Flood is the lowest paid coach of any public
school in the conference whose contracts can be obtained under
open public records laws.  “If you are placing this on a value meter, it’s off the
charts,” former  Denver Broncos  offensive lineman and current
ESPN analyst David Diaz-Infante said in a telephone interview.
“Flood got his shot to become a head coach, and the school
saved a bundle by paying him commensurate with his experience.”  Flood will receive $750,000 in salary this year, less than
Louisville’s Charlie Strong ($2.3 million),  South Florida ’s Skip Holtz ($2 million), Cincinnati’s Butch Jones ($1.7 million) and
 Connecticut ’s Paul Pasqualoni ($1.6 million). Syracuse, Temple
and Pittsburgh aren’t subject to open records laws requiring
contract terms be disclosed.  Schiano, who never coached the team to a  conference
championship  in 11 seasons, made $2.2 million in salary last
season, according to the school.  Forgiven Mortgage  The school also sold Schiano university land to build a
home, gave him an $800,000 no-interest loan to pay for
construction and then forgave $100,000 of the mortgage each year.
There was a balance of $300,000 when he resigned, which he has
until the end of January to pay back, the school said.  Schiano took the  Tampa Bay  job Jan. 26, five days before
high school players could formally commit to colleges. Flood, 41,
who had been on Schiano’s staff since 2005, was promoted four
days later. Schiano signed a five-year deal worth around $15
million, the Star-Ledger reported. Tampa Bay is 4-4 this season,
in second place in the National Football Conference South
Division behind the 8-0  Atlanta Falcons . The Buccaneers wouldn’t
make him available to be interviewed for this story. Earlier
this season, he told reporters that he was proud of the Scarlet
Knights and the coaches.  “They’ve worked very hard to put themselves in this
position and I’m confident there’s nothing that’s going to get
in their way,” he said.  Seven Straight  This season, Flood’s team reeled off seven straight wins
before losing to Kent State on Oct. 27. The Scarlet Knights are
home against Army (2-7) tomorrow and will wear helmets with
stars and stripes logos to honor the military. The  New Brunswick ,
 New Jersey , university is tied with Louisville for the
conference lead and is No. 23 in the BCS rankings.  In addition to his base salary, Flood can boost his
compensation with bonuses for on-field performance and academic
achievements.  The team’s six wins already qualify the Scarlet Knights for
a non-BCS bowl invitation, which would pay Flood an additional
$25,000, plus $10,000 for a win. That bonus increases to $50,000
for a BCS bowl and $25,000 for a victory.  He can earn another $100,000 if Rutgers wins its first Big
East title outright and $50,000 for sharing the title. Flood
will receive additional bonuses for being named Big East Coach
of the Year ($25,000), National Coach of the Year ($50,000),
winning 10 games ($25,000) and finishing in the Top 25 of the
 Associated Press  or Coaches’ Poll ($25,000).  Fair Value  “We felt, and continue to feel, that we offered Kyle fair
market value for a first-time head coach,” Pernetti said in a
telephone interview. “Greg didn’t start out making what he did
in the end, either. He had to earn it. In the end, his success
was rewarded. We will always pay the fair market rate for head
coaches.”  Rutgers qualified for its first bowl game in 27 years in
December of 2005 and rewarded Schiano with a seven-year contract
extension through 2012. The contract increased his pay to
$875,000 from $516,000.  The school said Pernetti was speaking for the athletic
department and wouldn’t make Flood available to be interviewed
for this story. Flood went to high school in Queens,  New York ,
and was an assistant at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New
York, and the  University of Delaware  in  Newark  before joining
Rutgers.  While incentives are part of all coaches’ contracts,
Flood’s are less than other coaches in the conference. Flood
stands to earn $100,000 for winning the conference; South
Florida’s Skip Holtz can earn $200,000. Where Flood will receive
$25,000 for winning Big East Coach of the Year, Louisville’s
Charlie Strong will receive $50,000.  Most Successful  The last time the school promoted an assistant from their
staff to head coach was Frank Burns in 1973, and he became the
most successful coach in school history (78-43-1 in 11 seasons)
including a perfect 11-0 season in 1976.  After this weekend’s game at High Point Solutions Stadium,
Rutgers travels to play Cincinnati (6-2, 2-1 in Big East) and
Pittsburgh (4-5, 1-3 in Big East) and then returns home for the
season finale against Louisville (9-0, 4-0 in Big East) in what
could decide the conference championship and automatic BCS
invitation.  Diaz-Infante said Rutgers still has Schiano’s imprint. One
of the advantages in hiring Flood is that Schiano’s former
assistant kept key members of the staff, its football language
and its vision of what it means to be a Scarlet Knight football
player.  “He has a very similar vision and value system that  Greg
Schiano  had in terms of playing great defense, running the
football, and a certain amount of toughness that he wanted to
bring to the program,” he said. “They have a clear identity of
who they are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
