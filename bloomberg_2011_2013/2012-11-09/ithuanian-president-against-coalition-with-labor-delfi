Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite reiterated her opposition to any cabinet that
includes the  Labor Party , rejecting a compromise proposed by a
coalition formed this week after elections, delfi.lt reported.  Excluding some members of the Labor Party from high posts,
as proposed by the coalition of the Social Democrats, Labor and
Order & Justice, isn’t sufficient, Grybauskaite told reporters
today in Kaunas, according to delfi.lt.  The president, who must approve a new prime minister and
Cabinet, this week asked the Baltic nation’s  Constitutional
Court  to rule on the validity of parliamentary voting rounds on
Oct. 14 and Oct. 28 after the election commission said bribery
may have influenced several thousand votes.  The court’s ruling, expected Nov. 10, will determine which
of three possible coalitions will be able to form a government
and who will be offered the premiership, Grybauskaite said
without elaborating, delfi.lt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
