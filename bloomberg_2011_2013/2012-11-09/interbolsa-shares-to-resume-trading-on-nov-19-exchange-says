Trading in Interbolsa SA’s shares was
suspended an additional four days as Colombian regulators
liquidate the company’s brokerage.  The shares will resume trading on Nov. 19, the Colombian
stock exchange said in e-mailed statement. Interbolsa has been
suspended since Nov. 2, the day after tumbling a record 30
percent. The stock has fallen 58 percent this year.  Regulators suspended trading in Interbolsa shares last week
and seized its brokerage, Colombia’s largest, after it was
unable to meet a payment on a 20 billion peso ($11 million)
loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
