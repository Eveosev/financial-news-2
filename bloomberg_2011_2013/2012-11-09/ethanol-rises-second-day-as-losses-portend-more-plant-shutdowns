Ethanol rose for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation that production losses will force more
plants to halt operations.  Futures gained as producers stand to lose 31 cents on each
gallon of the fuel made, based on December contracts for corn
and ethanol, compared with a 26-cent profit a year earlier, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That excludes revenue from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of making the biofuel
that can be fed to livestock.  “It’s pretty bad,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten
Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “As negative as
they are, it’s going to continue to take plants offline.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.381 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Nov. 1. Futures have jumped 8.1 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  climbed 3
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.50 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.38, according
to data collected by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.44 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.545.  The fuel needs higher prices to encourage  production , said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  U.S. Requirements  A 2007 energy law called the Renewable Fuels Standard
requires the U.S. to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol this
year and 15 billion by 2015.  At least 10 plants have been idled as the industry wrestles
with higher-than-normal corn costs in the aftermath of the worst
U.S. drought since the 1950s.  About 42 percent of the 10.7 billion bushels of corn U.S.
farmers will harvest this year will be used to produce ethanol,
the Agriculture Department said today. Last year, farmers grew
12.358 billion bushels and 40 percent was used to make the
biofuel.  Ethanol prices have also suffered from lower gasoline
consumption, leaving a smaller pool from which the biofuel could
be blended.  U.S.  gasoline demand  last week fell 6.1 percent, the most
since Jan. 7, 2005, Energy Department data show, after  Hurricane
Sandy  shut filling stations and kept drivers off the road in the
population-dense East Coast.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline for December delivery rose 9.19 cents, or 3.5
percent, to $2.6992 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 31.82
cents from 24.13 cents yesterday, boosting the biofuel’s appeal
for refiners to use more in an effort to pocket the spread
between the two. Gasoline traded at a premium of 99.8 cents to
ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  Corn for December delivery slipped 2.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $7.3875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Sugar prices near the lowest level in two years may
increase exports from Brazil, where ethanol is made from the
sweetener, Babler said.  Sugar production in  Brazil ’s main growing region climbed 73
percent to 2.55 million metric tons in the second half of
October, industry association Unica said yesterday.  Ethanol  imports  in the week ended Nov. 2 averaged 60,000
barrels a day, compared to none a year earlier, the Energy
Department said Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
