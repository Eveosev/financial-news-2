Crude fell, trading near its lowest
level in four months amid speculation that risks to the U.S. and
European economies will restrain demand while supplies increase.  West Texas Intermediate futures, little changed this week,
may decline next week on concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will
reduce economic growth and fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey
showed. OPEC cut forecasts for demand for its crude next year
and said that it decreased production last month. WTI plunged to
$84.44 a barrel on Nov. 7, its lowest close since July 10, after
U.S.  crude inventories  rose for the fourth time in five weeks.  “The potential to the downside is higher than to the
upside,” said Gerrit Zambo, an oil trader at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “There is still the chance of sliding
into a mild recession, and the oil market is quite saturated
with supply.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery dropped
as much as 86 cents, or 1 percent, to $84.23 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , and was
at $84.32 at 1:09 p.m. London time. Prices are down 15 percent
this year.  Brent for December settlement declined 74 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $106.51 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $22.18 to New
York-traded WTI.  OPEC will need to provide an average of 29.7 million
barrels a day in 2013, 1.25 million less than it’s currently
pumping, and 100,000 a day less than it forecast a month ago,
the group said in a report today.  OPEC Supply  Supply from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries dropped by 0.2 percent to 30.95 million a day in
October, the lowest since last December, because of declines in
 Nigeria ,  Iran  and  Saudi Arabia , the report showed.  Nineteen of 33 analysts and traders, or 58 percent,
forecast WTI futures will decrease through Nov. 16. Seven
respondents, or 21 percent, predicted that futures will gain and
seven said there will be little change in prices.  Euro-area finance ministers may not make a decision on
unlocking 31.5 billion euros ($40.1 billion) of aid for  Greece 
until late November, a European Union official said yesterday.
Finance chiefs will wait for a full report on the country’s
compliance with the terms of its bailout, the official said on
condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.  Crude in  New York  is in a downtrend channel on the daily
chart, signaling price advances may not be sustainable,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have traded
between the middle and lower Bollinger Bands for the past seven
weeks. The indicators, representing technical resistance and
support levels respectively, are at about $88.70 and $83 a
barrel today.  U.S.  crude supplies  increased 1.77 million barrels to 374.8
million barrels last week, the Energy Department data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
