Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a fourth
week as the central bank reported the fourth quarterly current-
account deficit in a row.  Government bonds  advanced.  The shortfall narrowed to $5.3 billion in the three months
through September, from a revised record-high of $7.7 billion in
the second quarter,  Bank Indonesia  said in a  statement  today.
The balance of payments showed a surplus of $834 million for the
period, compared with a revised deficit of $2.8 billion for
April through June. There was a $12 billion surplus in the
second quarter of 2011, central bank data show.  “The current-account deficit remains high and the balance-
of-payments surplus is small compared to last year, which will
weigh on the rupiah,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT
Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The weaker rupiah will
continue to support the  trade balance , so we may see the
current-account situation improve.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent this week to 9,632 per dollar
as of 3:29 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,668 on Nov. 7, the
weakest level since October 2009, and was little changed today.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped 20 basis points this week
and today, to 4.80 percent, the lowest since September 2008.
Bank Indonesia continues to stabilize the currency’s exchange
rate according to its fundamentals, it said in a note on its
website yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 dropped five basis points this week to 5.58 percent,
the lowest level since March 2, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
