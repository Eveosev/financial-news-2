Accretive Health Inc. (AH) ’s chairman and
chief executive officer should be dismissed over stock losses
caused by the use of “shameful” tactics to collect money from
hospital patients, an investor said in a lawsuit.  Chairman J. Michael Cline, CEO Mary Tolan and other board
members breached their fiduciary duty, Robert Doyle said in the
lawsuit made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. Accretive plunged 19 percent after it lost the right
to collect health-care debt for Fairview Health Services,
reducing 2012 income by as much as $68 million, Doyle said.  “The company was violating state and federal law regarding
debt collection and patient privacy and engaging in practices
that were outright shameful,” Doyle said in the complaint.  Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson said in July that
Accretive had agreed to withdraw from doing business in the
state for at least two years and pay the state $2.5 million.
Swanson sued the Chicago-based company in January, accusing it
of a privacy-law breach after a laptop computer containing data
on about 23,500 patients was lost. Accretive admitted no
wrongdoing in the accord.  The company also faced consumer lawsuits over its tactics
that damaged its reputation, according to Doyle. His so-called
derivative lawsuit demands unspecified damages that would go to
Accretive’s coffers.  Christina Slemon-Dokos, a spokeswoman for Accretive, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Doyle v. Accretive Health Inc. CA8008, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
