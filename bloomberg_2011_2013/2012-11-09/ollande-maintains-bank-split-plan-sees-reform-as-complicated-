French President  Francois Hollande 
reiterated his plan to separate banks’ retail and investment
activities, while saying it may be “complicated” to implement
without hurting the country’s banking system.  “We will do it and we will do it swiftly,” Hollande said,
according to an interview in  Marianne weekly magazine  to be
published tomorrow. The head of  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , France’s
biggest bank, Jean-Paul Chifflet, said today he’d “negotiate
inch by inch” until the bill is published Dec. 19.  Separately, Hollande said 2013 will be a “tough” year for
the economy. The Socialist president said he believed business
leaders and entrepreneurs “see me as their adversary,” the
weekly quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
