Nigerian Bag Manufacturing Co., a
packaging manufacturer, rose to the highest in more than six
weeks after reporting a 26 percent price increase in profit.  The stock gained 0.5 percent to 1.95 naira by the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the highest level since
Sept. 25. The volume of shares traded was more than double the
three-month daily average.  Profit after tax for the six months through September rose
to 876.72 million naira from 696.71 million naira a year
earlier, the company said yesterday. Earnings per share rose to
14 kobo from 11 kobo.  “The price is being propelled by the result” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance
Ltd., said by phone today. With the increase in earnings per
share, investors can look forward to a dividend payment at the
end of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
