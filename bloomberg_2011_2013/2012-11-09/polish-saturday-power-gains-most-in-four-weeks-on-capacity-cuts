Polish electricity for Saturday
climbed the most in four weeks as utilities planned to cut
output and exports were set to increase.  Power for tomorrow  rose 7.8 percent from a week earlier to
170.78 zloty ($52.24) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the biggest gain since Oct. 13.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility, said it would halt 1,233
megawatts of capacity at its Belchatow, Dolna Odra and Turow
power plants on Nov. 10 and keep the units off line for most of
the weekend. Demand for electricity typically subsides on
weekends. The country was set to send more power to the  Czech
Republic ,  Germany  and Slovakia, compared to a week ago, data
from the power grid manager  PSE Operator SA  showed.  Next-day contracts on the coupled Czech and Slovakian
markets settled 16 percent higher than a week ago at 39.40 euros
($50.10) and 39.53 euros a megawatt-hour respectively, while
Hungarian power increased 27 percent to 43.87 euros a megawatt-
hour, according to the countries’ market operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
