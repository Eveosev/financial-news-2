The European Commission will call for
legislation on money-market mutual funds and  securities lending 
agreements as part of a push to regulate so-called shadow
banking.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, intends
to propose a plan on shadow banking in the spring, Stefaan De Rynck, a spokesman for Barnier, said in an e-mail.  “The overall objective is to make sure that our new
regulations do not result in pushing activities to the world of
shadow banking,” De Rynck said. “To reach this goal, we will
no doubt come forward with new legal initiatives in the next
year on issues such as  money market funds  and securities
lending.”  While watchdogs have reined in excessive risk-taking by
banks in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in 2008, they are concerned that lenders might use shadow
banking to evade new rules on capital and liquidity. The
Financial Stability Board has estimated that global shadow-
banking activities were worth about $60 trillion in 2010, as
much as 30 percent of the total financial system.  Supervisors classify shadow-banking activities as those
that allow banks to carry out business off balance sheets, as
well as those which allow investors to bypass lenders and the
functions they traditionally fulfill on the markets.  The FSB, which brings together central bankers, regulators
and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20 nations, has
said that it will publish draft recommendations for regulating
shadow banks, with a final version to come by September 2013  Barnier’s proposals must be approved by governments and by
the European Parliament before they can take effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
