Sweet Louisiana oils strengthened as
the margin between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened to
the largest gap in more than a week.  The spread between the benchmarks widened $1.15 to $23.31 a
barrel at 2:38 p.m. in New York, the biggest differential since
Oct. 30. When Brent’s premium to WTI gains, it typically
strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign
oils priced using the European benchmark.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI widened $1 to $21.50 a barrel as of 2:43 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
added 85 cents to $20.85 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium widened $1.40 to $15.90. Mars Blend
increased $1.30 to $15.70 a barrel over WTI, and Southern Green
Canyon gained $1 to a $15.90 premium.  The premium for Thunder Horse, a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 25 cents to $19.75 above WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2.75 to $27.25
below the U.S. benchmark. Syncrude, a Canadian light synthetic
oil processed from oil sands, gained $1 to a discount of $6 a
barrel.  Bakken crude delivered in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , was
unchanged at $8 below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
