China ’s October exports rose more
than 11 percent compared with a year ago, Commerce Minister Chen Deming was cited as saying by Reuters today.  The median estimate of analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg News
was for a 10 percent increase.  Imports grew by 2.8 percent over the same period, Chen
said, according to Reuters. It would be “very difficult” for
China to hit its target of growing total trade by 10 percent in
2012, Reuters  quoted  Chen as saying on the sidelines of the
Chinese Communist Party’s Congress.  China is due to release trade data for October on Nov. 10.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
