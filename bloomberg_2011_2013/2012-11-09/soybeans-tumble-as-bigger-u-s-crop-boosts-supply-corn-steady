Soybeans plunged to a four-month low
after a U.S. government report showed that August rains helped
revive Midwest yields more than forecast, after the worst
drought in five decades. Corn was little changed.  The soybean harvest will total 2.971 billion bushels, up
3.9 percent from last month’s forecast, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected
2.892 billion. Corn output will be 10.725 billion bushels, up
from 10.706 billion estimated in October. Better-than-expected
U.S. yields will boost global inventories, the USDA said.  “There wasn’t really a bullish number in the lot to hang
your hat on,”  Charlie Sernatinger , a vice president for ABN
Amro Clearing LLC in  Chicago , said in an e-mail. “November is
not going to be a good month for the bulls.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 1.4 percent to
$14.7525 a bushel at 8:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $14.63, the lowest since July 3. Through
yesterday, the price had fallen 16 percent since reaching a
record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for December delivery were up 0.1 percent to
$7.4425 a bushel on the CBOT, after slipping as much as 1
percent. The most-active futures fell 12 percent through
yesterday after reaching a record high of $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
