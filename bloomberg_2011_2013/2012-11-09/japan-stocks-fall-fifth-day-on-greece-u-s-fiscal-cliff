Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average capping its longest losing streak in nine
weeks, after exporters declined on a stronger yen and amid
concern Greece’s bailout will be delayed.  Brother Industries Ltd. (6448) , an office-equipment maker that
counts Europe as its biggest market, lost 2.5 percent.  Sumitomo
Rubber Industries Ltd. (5110)  sank 6.7 percent after the tiremaker
lowered its sales outlook.  Nexon Co. (NKY)  plunged 16 percent after
the online-gaming company trimmed its forecast and was cut to
underperform from buy at CLSA.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent to 8,757.60 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , declining a fifth day. The price of the gauge’s
November options, also known as the “special quotation,”
settled at 8,745.24. Volume on the gauge was more than 15
percent below the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost
0.6 percent to 730.74, sliding 2.8 percent on the week.  The possibly delay in the Greek bailout “is reigniting
concern the country may default and separate from the euro
region,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33 trillion yen ($415 billion)
in assets. “Investors are shying away from risk assets because
of the  European debt crisis  and the U.S. fiscal cliff.”  The Topix has risen 1.6 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.1 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Fiscal Cliff  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4
percent today. The gauge fell 1.2 percent yesterday, capping its
biggest two-day decline of the year. Stocks have tumbled since
President  Barack Obama ’s re-election on concern he will be
unable to reach a budget compromise to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that
threatens to drive the U.S. back into recession.  Euro-region finance ministers may not make a decision on
unlocking 31.5 billion euros ($40.1 billion) in aid for Greece
until late November as they await a full report on the country’s
compliance with the terms of its bailout, said a European Union
official who asked not to be named because the discussions are
private.  The yen appreciated to as high as 101.03 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 101.89 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 79.32 from 79.90. A stronger yen cuts overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  ‘Under Pressure’  “The yen is under pressure because investors are being
cautious about the prospects of even more stimulus from the U.S.
if it falls off the fiscal cliff,” Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank’s
Sera said.  Brother Industries, which gets 28 percent of its sales in
Europe, slipped 2.5 percent to 717 yen. Nikon Corp., a camera
maker that gets 24 percent of its sales in  North America ,
slumped 1.3 percent to 1,878 yen.  In China, the Communist Party yesterday started a weeklong
meeting to choose its fifth generation of leaders. Data today
showed the nation’s industrial production and retail sales
exceeded economists’ estimates. Inflation unexpectedly
decelerated to a 33-month low, signaling the government is
supporting growth without driving a rebound in prices.  Some 551 of the 1,675 Topix companies post  earnings results 
this week. Of the 341 companies on the gauge which have reported
quarterly revenue since Oct. 1 and for which  Bloomberg News  has
estimates, 65 percent have missed projections.  Earnings Forecasts  Sumitomo Rubber tumbled 6.7 percent to 868 yen after
cutting its sales forecast 1.4 percent to 705 billion yen in the
year ending Dec. 31 on slumping overseas demand. The stock’s
investment rating was trimmed to outperform from buy at CLSA.  Nexon (3659)  tumbled 16 percent to 766 yen after the gamemaker
lowered its full-year net-income forecast to between 28.9
billion yen and 31 billion yen from an earlier 32.7 billion yen.
The company said it adjusted its outlook due to exchange rates
and its 36.5 billion yen acquisition of mobile-game designer
Gloops Inc. last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
