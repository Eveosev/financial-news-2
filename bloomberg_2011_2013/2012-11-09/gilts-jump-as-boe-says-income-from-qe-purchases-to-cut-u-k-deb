(Corrects percentage-point change in third paragraph.)  U.K. government bonds surged as the
Bank of England said it plans to transfer cash it receives as
coupon payments from gilts held as part of its asset-purchase
plan to the Treasury.  The intention of the government “is to use any funds
transferred to the Exchequer to reduce the stock of outstanding
government debt,” Governor  Mervyn King  said in a letter to
Chancellor  George Osborne  today. Maturing debt won’t be
transferred to the Exchequer, King wrote.  The yield on 10-year gilts fell as much as 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 1.67 percent, the lowest since Sept.
10, and was at 1.68 percent at 12:31 p.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
