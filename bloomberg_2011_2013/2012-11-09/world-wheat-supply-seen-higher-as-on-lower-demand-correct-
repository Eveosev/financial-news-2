(Corrects to show stockpile forecast was up from October
in second paragraph.)  World wheat inventories before the
next Northern Hemisphere harvest will be 0.7 percent larger than
forecast a month ago as demand fell, the government said.
Analysts expected a decline in supplies.  Global stockpiles will total 174.18 million metric tons at
the end of May, up from 173 million forecast in October, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. The
average estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 171.50
million tons.  A 2.5 million ton reduction in the estimated amount of
wheat to be used for  animal feed  more than offset a projected
drop in Australian production to 21 million tons, from 23
million projected last month, according to the report.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to
settle at $9.025 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price reached $9.05, the highest since Sept. 28,
partly as drought threatens crops in the U.S. southern Great
Plains.  World production may total 651.43 million metric tons, down
from 653.05 million tons forecast last month, according to the
report.  U.S. production in the year that began June 1 will total
2.269 billion bushels (61.76 million tons), unchanged from the
October estimate, the government said. U.S. inventories at the
end of the marketing year will be 704 million bushels, up from
the 654 million estimated in October, because of lower exports.
Analysts expected 658 million bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
