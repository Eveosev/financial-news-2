Wasson Capital Advisors co-founder
Anand Sekaran pleaded guilty to perpetrating a $2 million fraud
in which he misled investors about the value of his fund.  Sekaran, 44, of Miami, who started New York-based Wasson in
1997, told U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in  Manhattan 
today that Wasson sustained substantial losses after the 2008
financial crisis and several redemption requests. Sekaran said
he began to operate a  Ponzi scheme , distributing funds to some
investors from other investors from 2009 to June 2011.  He told the judge he misrepresented to existing and
potential investors Wasson’s investment value and past
performance and falsely claimed Wasson was stable and doing well
to secure additional investments. Sekaran also admitted creating
and sending faked performance statements through the U.S. mail
and in Internet messages.  “In the midst of the most recent market crash, Wasson
suffered very significant losses between 2009 and 2011,”
Sekaran said in court. “Wasson, through me, misrepresented the
investment returns and account holdings.”  Sekaran pleaded guilty to a count of securities fraud and
mail fraud, which each carry prison terms of as long as 20
years. As part of a plea agreement, Patterson said Sekaran faces
41 to 51 months in prison under sentencing guidelines. The judge
set sentencing for Feb. 19.  Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Sekaran, declined to comment
after court on the plea.  The case is U.S. v. Sekaran, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
