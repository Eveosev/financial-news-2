The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  is considering fines for some asset managers for
failing to limit conflicts of interest.  The regulator said it observed poor practices including the
favoring of certain customers over others, failing to report
trading errors and inconsistent policies regarding the personal
trading accounts of fund managers. The policies at firms for
accepting gifts “might have caused concern about the
objectivity” of decisions made for clients, the FSA also said.  Employees of some firms, which the FSA didn’t name, “often
lacked awareness of situations where short-term business goals
conflicted with the long-term interests” of customers, the
regulator said in a letter to chief executive officers of asset
management firms published on its  website  today.  The FSA carried out a review of conflicts of interest at
asset management firms between June 2011 and February this year
and will select some firms for follow up visits. Rules
require the boards of asset management firms to set up and
regularly review policies to prevent unfair practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
