Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck
ran for two touchdowns as the Colts beat the Jacksonville
Jaguars 27-10 for their fourth straight win in the National
Football League.  Luck, the No. 1 pick in this year’s draft, scored with runs
of five yards and one yard in the second quarter as the Colts
took a 17-3 halftime lead last night at EverBank Field in
Jacksonville,  Florida .  Darius Butler intercepted a Blaine Gabbert pass and ran 11
yards for a touchdown four minutes into the third quarter for
the Colts.  Cecil Shorts III got Jacksonville’s lone touchdown when he
caught a 4-yard pass from quarterback Chad Henne in the fourth
quarter.  At 6-3, Indianapolis is second in the American Football
Conference South behind the 7-1 Houston Texans. The Jaguars
remain in last place in the four-team division after dropping to
1-8 with their sixth straight defeat.  Luck completed 18 of 26 passes for 227 yards and one
interception.  Henne took over at quarterback when Gabbert, who completed
18 of 31 passes for 209 yards and one interception, was injured
on his third sack in the fourth quarter. Henne went 10-for-16
for 121 yards and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
