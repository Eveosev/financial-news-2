Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  extended a 500 million-euro ($636 million)
credit line by a year as  Greece ’s largest phone operator seeks
to refinance maturing facilities and cut debt.  The company, also known as OTE, will repay 400 million
euros of a 900 million-euro revolving credit facility on
maturity in February 2013 and extend the remainder to February
2014, it said today in a statement, released on the same day as
its third-quarter earnings.  “We are making rapid progress with our refinancing plans”
and are “confident that all components will be in place on
schedule by the end of of the first quarter of 2013,” Michael Tsamaz, chief executive and chairman of the Athens-based company
known as OTE said in the earnings report.  The revolving credit facility, a type of loan where money
repaid can be borrowed again, was undrawn at July 30, the
company said Sept. 3.  Net debt at OTE has been cut by more than 1 billion euros
in the last year to 3 billion euros supported by improving cash
flows, according to the earnings report. Free cash flow was 249
million euros in the third quarter of 2012, compared with 148
million euros in the same quarter the previous year, it said.  OTE, 40 percent owned by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , also has 3.2
billion euros of bonds outstanding, according to today’s
earnings report. These include a 1.25 billion-euro bond due to
repay in August 2013.  The refinancing plans also involve raising funds from the
sale of OTE’s Globul mobile unit in  Bulgaria  and Hellas Sat SA,
Timotheus Hoettges, Deutsche Telekom chief financial officer,
said yesterday in a conference call. The Greek company could
raise around 1 billion euros from the sales, Euro2day reported
in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
