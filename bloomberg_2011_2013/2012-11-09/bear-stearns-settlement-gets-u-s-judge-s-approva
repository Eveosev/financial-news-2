JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM)  Bear Stearns
unit’s settlement of a consolidated lawsuit by investors who
lost money from 2006 to 2008 was approved by a federal judge in
New York.  Bear Stearns in June agreed to the $275 million cash
settlement, which called for the money, minus legal fees, to go
to shareholders who claimed the company issued “materially
false and misleading statements” about financial results. Its
auditor,  Deloitte & Touche , agreed to pay $19.9 million.  U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in  Manhattan  gave
preliminary approval to the settlements on June 13 and made his
approval final in an order posted today in court records.  “Since the proposed settlement is both procedurally and
substantively fair, and because the settlement of class action
litigation is generally favored by the courts, the proposed
settlement is hereby approved,” Sweet said in the order.  Shareholders filed a series of lawsuits against Bear
Stearns beginning in 2008, claiming the company’s statements
artificially inflated its share price, which reached $159.36 in
April 2007, and then fell to $106.55 on Aug. 3, 2007, after news
about “Bear Stearns’ risky  hedge funds ” and negative rating-
agency outlooks. The suit was filed on behalf of investors who
bought Bear Stearns stock and other equity securities and
options from Dec. 14, 2006, to March 14, 2008.  Prosecutors’ Inquiry  Bear Stearns, a New York-based investment bank, disclosed
in January 2008 that U.S. prosecutors were inquiring into the
collapse of the hedge funds. The stock fell to $78.87, according
to court filings. Other announcements in early 2008 led to
further declines. In March JPMorgan Chase announced it was
buying Bear Stearns for $2 a share.  The lead plaintiff in the case is the State of Michigan
Retirement Systems. Sweet in January 2011 denied a Bear Stearns
motion to dismiss the case, and the two sides then engaged in
“extensive discovery” that resulted in the production of about
9 million documents by defendants and other parties and almost
180,000 pages by the plaintiffs, according to Sweet’s order.  Settlement discussions that stalled in November 2009 were
revived with the assistance of a mediator in May, and the two
sides reached the proposed agreement in June, according to
Sweet’s order.  The case is In re The Bear Stearns Cos. Securities,
Derivative and ERISA Litigation, 08-mdl-1963 and 08-cv-2793,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
