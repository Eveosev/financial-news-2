A company controlled by  Intermediate
Capital Group Plc (ICP) , a lender and money manager, plans to raise as
much as 250 million pounds ($400 million) by selling shares in a
new lending unit through an initial public offering.  The London IPO of ICG-Longbow Senior Secured UK Property
Debt Investments Ltd. will raise capital to provide senior loans
backed by commercial real estate in the U.K., according to an e-
mailed statement today. The company will be managed by a venture
formed last year by ICG and Longbow Real Estate Capital LLP,
founded by Martin Wheeler and Kevin Cooper.  ICG-Longbow joins insurers and funds seeking to fill the
real estate funding gap caused by tougher credit conditions
banks demand as they scale back property lending to meet
stricter capital rules. The credit shortfall may be as large as
100 billion pounds in the U.K., based on current loan terms,
according to De Montfort University estimates.  “This new vehicle will aim to provide investors with
predictable and attractive target returns with minimal risk of
income or  capital loss ,” ICG-Longbow Chairman David Hunter said
in the statement.  The company aims to pay dividends that will provide
shareholders with a 6 percent return once fully invested,
according to the statement.  London-based ICP makes mezzanine loans and manages funds
holding about 11.4 billion euros ($14.5 billion) of loans.  Investec Bank Plc is working as adviser and bookrunner for
the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
