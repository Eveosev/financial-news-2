Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer of the metal, posted an unexpected second-quarter loss
as weak demand in  Europe  and China cut prices and costs rose.  The  net loss , including Tata Steel Europe Ltd., was 3.64
billion rupees ($66.5 million) in the three months ended Sept.
30 from a profit of 2.12 billion rupees a year earlier, Mumbai-
based Tata Steel said today in a statement. The median profit
estimate of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 2.27 billion
rupees. Sales rose 4.2 percent to 338.7 billion rupees.  Weaker economies and overcapacity have forced  steel mills 
to cut prices. The average cost of the international benchmark
hot-rolled coil that Tata Steel produces fell 19 percent in the
quarter.  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest steelmaker, last
month posted the lowest quarterly profit in almost three years.  Tata Steel declined 3.3 percent to 390.55 rupees by the
close of Mumbai trading, its biggest drop since Sept. 5.  Costs rose 6.9 percent to 331.58 billion rupees. Expenses
for employee benefits increased 14 percent to 45.39 billion
rupees and power costs 19 percent to 14.05 billion rupees.  “Europe has been significantly affected by falling steel
prices,” Koushik Chatterjee, group chief financial officer,
told reporters on a call. “The demand conditions are fairly
uncertain and muted.”  Steel deliveries fell 0.8 percent to 6.07 million metric
tons from 6.11 million tons. In India, output increased 9.3
percent to 1.87 million tons, Tata said on Oct. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
