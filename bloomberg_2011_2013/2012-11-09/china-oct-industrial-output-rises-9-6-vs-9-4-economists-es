China ’s industrial output rose 9.6
percent in October from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today.  The growth compares with the 9.4 percent median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts and a 9.2 percent
increase in September.    Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households increased
20.7 percent in the January-to-October period from a year
earlier, the report from the Beijing-based agency showed. That
compared with the 20.6 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey and a 20.5 percent rise in the first nine months of the
year.  Retail sales in October grew 14.5 percent from a year
earlier after a 14.2 percent gain in September. The median
forecast was for an increase of 14.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
