The Italian drug industry regulator
lifted a ban on  Novartis AG (NOVN)  flu vaccines, allowing the company
to resume selling the shots during the prime winter flu season.  The regulator, or Aifa, didn’t find any defects in the
banned vaccines Agrippal and Fluad, the agency said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Italy and Switzerland halted sales of the vaccines on Oct.
24 after the company informed Italian authorities of a buildup
of particles in the shots. About 488,000 doses were subject to
the ban, the Italian Health Ministry said. Countries including
Canada,  France  and the U.K. later imposed restrictions.  “Novartis is pleased that the Italian authorities have
decided to lift the precautionary hold on its seasonal influenza
vaccines,” Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis said in an e-
mailed statement.  Vaccines account for 5 percent of Novartis’s total sales,
according to a report by Helvea SA analysts. Seasonal flu shots
make up about a quarter of that revenue, the analysts said.  Authorities in  Canada  and Switzerland have already allowed
the vaccines back on the market.  Recalls are still effective in the U.K. and for specific
batches in  Germany , Beth Calitri, a Novartis spokeswoman, said
in an e-mailed message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
