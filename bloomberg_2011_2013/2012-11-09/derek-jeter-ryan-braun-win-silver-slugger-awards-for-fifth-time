New York  Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and Milwaukee Brewers leftfielder Ryan Braun were named to
the Silver Slugger baseball teams for the fifth time.  The Silver Slugger winners are determined by votes from
Major League Baseball coaches and managers who selected the best
offensive players in the American and National leagues.  Ten of the 18 team members, including San Francisco Giants
catcher  Buster Posey , were first-time winners.  The Washington Nationals have three players on the NL team:
pitcher  Stephen Strasburg , first baseman Adam LaRoche and
shortstop Ian Desmond.  The AL team also includes Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers and Yankees second baseman
Robinson Cano.  The Silver Slugger Award was started by Louisville Slugger
in 1980 as an extension of the Silver Bat Award given to the
batting champions in the AL and NL. This yearâ€™s awards went to
Cabrera, who hit .330, and Posey, who had a .336 batting average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
