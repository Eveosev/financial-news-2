European Union carbon permits made
their fourth weekly gain in five weeks ahead of a Nov. 14
announcement of a plan to help fix a glut in the market’s
supply.  EU emission permits for delivery in December rose 0.4
percent to 8.31 euros ($10.57) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London  at 5:07 p.m., taking its weekly
increase to 2.5 percent.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, is due
to publish next week a detailed proposal to delay some auctions
of allowances as of 2013 after prices fell to a record low
earlier this year because of the glut. It will also send to
member states a report on the functioning of the market,
floating ideas to overhaul it in the long-term.  United Nations Emission Reduction Unit credits for
December, which can be used for compliance in the EU program,
increased 9.1 percent to 60 cents a ton on ICE Futures.
Certified Emission Reduction credits for December jumped 8.7
percent to 1 euro a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
