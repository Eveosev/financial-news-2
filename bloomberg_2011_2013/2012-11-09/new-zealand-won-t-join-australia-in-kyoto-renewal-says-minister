New Zealand will align climate
efforts with the largest emitters such as the U.S. and  China 
instead of committing to a second phase of the Kyoto agreement
alongside  Australia , said Climate Change Minister Tim Groser.  New Zealand will take its pledge under the United Nations
Convention Framework, with countries responsible for 85 percent
of the world’s emissions, the minister said in a statement
today. That’s even as its closest and larger neighbor,
Australia, today renewed its Kyoto commitment.  “I want to emphasize that New Zealand stands 100% behind
its existing Kyoto Protocol Commitment,” Groser said in the
statement. The government decided it was in “New Zealand’s best
interests” to join the large majority of economies under the
Convention, he said.  Australian Climate Change Minister Greg Combet today said
the nation would join  Europe  in the second Kyoto phase, in a
renewed and binding pledge to cut emissions.  Australia will link its emissions market starting in 2015
with the world’s largest cap-and-trade system in Europe,
according to an Aug. 28 announcement. New Zealand yesterday
passed changes to its emissions trading scheme which critics
said weakened its obligations to reduce omissions.  “Not content yesterday to pass a law to gut New Zealand’s
Emissions Trading Scheme, the National Government is now out to
undermine any international credibility the nation ever had on
climate change,” Green Party spokesman Kennedy Graham said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
