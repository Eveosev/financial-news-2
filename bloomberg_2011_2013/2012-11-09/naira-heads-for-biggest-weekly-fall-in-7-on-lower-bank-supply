The naira capped its biggest five-day
retreat in 11 weeks as the  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold the
lowest amount of dollars in almost three years and  oil companies 
reduced their supply of the U.S. currency.  The naira depreciated 0.2 percent to 157.50 a dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The currency of
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer has slid 0.5 percent this week,
the biggest decline since the five days to Sept. Aug. 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $79.9 million at its two scheduled
auctions this week, the lowest since December 2009, according to
data on the Abuja-based bank’s website. The regulator sells
dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3
percent band around 155 per dollar. The oil industry, which
sells dollars to lenders around the month end to meet domestic
expenses, is the biggest supplier after the central bank.  “Dollar supply thinned down as the central bank sold a
small amount owing to restrictions and oil industry month-end
supply is receding,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone today.  The central bank, led by Governor Lamido Sanusi, has left
the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a record 12 percent
this year, increased lenders’ reserve requirements and limited
access to money auctions to stop dealers from buying foreign
currency using naira purchased from the bank at a discount.  The yield on the nation’s 16.39 percent naira debt due
January 2022 fell 10 basis points to 12.66 percent, according to
yesterday’s prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association. The yield on the country’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due January 2021 slipped one basis point to 4.381
percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.8789 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
