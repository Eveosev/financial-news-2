OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell for a third day as the government proposed to tax
trading of financial securities.  The shares slid 0.5 percent to 4,061 forint by the close in
Budapest, extending the week’s drop to 2.1 percent. The
benchmark BUX stock index slipped 0.1 percent.  Hungary’s government, which earlier planned to tax
transactions such as cash withdrawals from ATMs, is planning to
extend the scope of the levy to buying and selling of securities
including derivatives, according to a draft bill published by
the  Economy Ministry  late yesterday.  The plan is “definitely unfavorable” for stocks, Jozsef Miro, a Budapest-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  Developing-nation stocks declined for a second day, with
the benchmark MSCI Emerging Market  index  retreating 0.4 percent,
after  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. posted its biggest profit
drop in four years and a European official said Greece’s bailout
may be delayed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
