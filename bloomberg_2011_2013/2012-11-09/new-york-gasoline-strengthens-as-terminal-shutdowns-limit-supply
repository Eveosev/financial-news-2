Conventional gasoline strengthened in
New York Harbor as terminals in New York and  New Jersey  remained
shut, helping limit supplies already hovering at the lowest
levels in a month on the U.S. East Coast.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Newark, New Jersey, and Brooklyn
and  Long Island , New York, terminals were closed for an 11th day
after  Hurricane Sandy  made landfall in southern New Jersey.
Crews are assessing damage and don’t have a timeline for
restart, according to a  statement  on the company’s website.
 Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Tremley Point terminal in New Jersey is also shut.  Stockpiles of motor fuel on the U.S. East Coast dropped by
1.25 million barrels to 46.6 million in the week ended Nov. 2,
the lowest level since Oct. 5, the Energy Department reported.
Inventories held in large terminals and refineries along the
Central Atlantic coast fell to 22.9 million last week, the
lowest for this time of year since 2008.  The premium for  conventional gasoline  in New York rose by
1.25 cents to 19.75 cents a gallon over futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 11:54 a.m. Prompt delivery gained 7.23
cents to $2.8646 a gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region
advanced 0.37 cent to a premium of 15.50 over heating oil
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
