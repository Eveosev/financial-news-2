Picasso’s 1932 painting of his young
mistress Marie-Therese Walter fetched $41.5 million tonight at
 Sotheby’s (BID)  in  New York .  Philip Hook, senior specialist at Sotheby’s  London , bought
it for a client on the phone.  “Nature Morte aux Tulipes” is at once a portrait and a
still life, depicting Walter’s sculpted white head on a pedestal
next to a bouquet of tulips and some sexually suggestive fruit.
It had been estimated to bring $35 million to $50 million.  The work was the top lot by estimate of Sotheby’s evening
Impressionist and modern art sale, expected to bring more than
$169 million.  The seller had been guaranteed a minimum undisclosed price,
provided by Sotheby’s, a third party or a combination thereof,
according to the catalog. A third party also provided Sotheby’s
with an irrevocable bid on the lot, ensuring that the work will
sell.  It sold for $28.6 million in 2000 at Christie’s in New
York. Picasso’s paintings of Walter have been popular with
collectors, surging since his “Nude,  Green Leaves  and Bust”
went for $106.5 million at Christie’s in New York in 2010.  Most of the top Marie-Therese paintings that have come up
for auction have been dated 1932, the year of Picasso’s big
retrospective at Galeries Georges Petit in Paris.  To contact the reporters of this story:
