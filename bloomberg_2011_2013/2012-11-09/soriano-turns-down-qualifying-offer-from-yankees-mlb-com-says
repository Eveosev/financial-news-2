Relief pitcher  Rafael Soriano 
rejected the New York Yankees’ $13.3 million qualifying offer,
making him a free agent, while former teammates  Nick Swisher  and
Hiroki Kuroda also are expected to turn down equivalent packages
from the club, MLB.com reported.  Yankees General Manager  Brian Cashman  said today at
baseball meetings in Indian Wells, California, that he received
a rejection phone call from  Scott Boras , Soriano’s agent, and
that he doesn’t expect Swisher, an outfielder and first baseman,
and Kuroda, a starting pitcher, to except offers before today’s
5 p.m. New York time deadline,  according to MLB.com .  Under new terms of Major League Baseball’s collective
bargaining agreement with its players, teams can make one-year
qualifying offers for the average of the previous season’s 125
top salaries, which this year is $13.3 million, the amount
offered to all three Yankees’ players.  The players still may re-sign with the team. If they sign
elsewhere, the Yankees will be compensated with draft picks.  Soriano, 32, had 42 saves in 46 appearances last season,
filling in for the injured Mariano Rivera, who has said he’d
like to return in 2013.  The 31-year-old Swisher, who has played four seasons with
the Yankees, batted .272 with 24 home runs and 93 runs batted in
in 2012, playing in 148 games, including 41 at first base.  Kuroda, 37, went 16-11 with a 3.32 earned run average in
his first season with the Yankees following four years with the
Los Angeles Dodgers. His career record is 57-57 with a 3.42 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
