Most  European  stocks fell, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index posting its biggest weekly drop in a month, amid concern that automatic spending cuts and tax increases may push the world’s largest economy into a recession.  Credit Agricole sank 5.9 percent after posting a wider third-quarter loss than analysts had estimated. Novo Nordisk A/S rallied 7.3 percent as an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration backed its insulin treatment.  The  Stoxx 600  slipped 0.1 percent to 270.27 at the close in London, after earlier declining as much as 1.1 percent. Four stocks fell for every three that rose. The equity benchmark retreated 1.7 percent this week. The gauge has still  rallied 16 percent  from this year’s low on June 4 as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said he would do everything to protect the single currency and the Federal Reserve opted for a third round of asset purchases.
