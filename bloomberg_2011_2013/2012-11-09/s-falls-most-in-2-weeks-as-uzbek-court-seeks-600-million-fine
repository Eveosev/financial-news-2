OAO Mobile TeleSystems fell the most
in two weeks on bets  Russia ’s largest mobile operator won’t
restore operations in Uzbekistan.  MTS fell as much as 1.7 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since Oct. 26, and traded down 1.3 percent at 231.28 rubles a
share as of 11:15 a.m. in Moscow.  While an Uzbek court overturned a decision to confiscate
MTS’s assets in the country, it demanded payment of a $600
million fine, the Russian operator said last night.  “It is premature to assume that MTS will restore its
operations in the country,”  Anna Lepetukhina , an analyst at
Sberbank Investment Research, said in a note today. “The $600
million fine seems too high, given that it’s almost half of the
value of this asset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
