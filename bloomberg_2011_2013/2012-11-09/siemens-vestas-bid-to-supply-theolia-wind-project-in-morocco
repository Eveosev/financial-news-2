Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
and  Alstom SA (ALO)  are among bidders to supply turbines for a wind
project developed by French developer Theolia SA in  Morocco .  The tender is to replace existing turbines with higher-
capacity machines at the first 100-megawatt phase of the Koudia
Al Baida park in northern Morocco operated by Theolia, the Aix-
En-Provence-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Spain’s Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA and  Acciona SA (ANA)  also bid
to repower the wind farm, Theolia said.  With its high energy demand and untapped wind resources,
Morocco is luring developers including Enel Green Power SpA,
which said in March it plans to add 100 megawatts in the country
by 2016. EDP Renovaveis SA and Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co are also seeking to tap growing demand in the
nation, which has a goal to build 2,000 megawatts of wind
capacity by 2020 to curb fossil-fuel dependence.  Theolia is carrying out the project with Morocco’s Office
National de l’Electricite et de l’Eau Potable, or ONEE. Theolia
will select the winning bidder from those deemed to be
technically compliant with the project. A list of those meeting
technical requirements will be published early next year,
according to a  separate statement  on the ONEE website.  A second phase of 200 megawatts will be installed at
adjacent sites, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
