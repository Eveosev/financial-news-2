Austria’s financial watchdog will be
empowered to regulate accounting practices and financial reports
under a government proposal to bring the country into compliance
with an eight-year-old  European Union law .  The  Finanzmarktaufsicht , known as the FMA, will gain the
authority to check auditing practices and financial reports
under a law proposed today, the  Finance Ministry  said. It covers
companies with shares or bonds traded on Austrian public
markets.  “Investors’ trust in the integrity and stability of the
entire market has been shattered by corporate scandals at home
and abroad in recent years,” the ministry said in the proposal.
“The predominant goal is the supervision of financial reporting
of capital market-oriented companies.”  Austria has bailed out three banks since 2008, and
prosecutors are investigating whether false accounting played a
role. Retail investors have also suffered losses in real estate
companies whose financial problems may have been hidden from
investors.  No authority in Austria currently has the power to review
company accounts. The FMA oversees banking, insurance, pension
saving and securities trading. The only way to put companies to
a test is to report suspicions to state prosecutors who might
then investigate whether there were accounting problems.  The proposed law will go before parliament for
consideration next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
