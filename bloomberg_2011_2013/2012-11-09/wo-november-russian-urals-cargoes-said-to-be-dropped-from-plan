Two cargoes of Russian Urals crude
due to be shipped from the  Baltic Sea  were dropped from this
monthâ€™s loading program, said three traders with knowledge of
the schedule.  One cargo, owned by TNK-BP, was initially for loading on
Nov. 16 to Nov. 17 from Primorsk, while the other dropped
shipment, owned by OAO Rosneft, was planned for Nov. 18 to Nov.
19 from Ust-Luga, said the people, who declined to be identified
as the information is confidential. Each cargo was for 100,000
metrics tons.  Urals exports from Primorsk were consequently revised down
to 5.52 million tons from 5.62 million tons in November, and
loadings from Ust-Luga are now at 1.7 million tons, 100,000 tons
less than originally planned, according to a revised loading
program.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
