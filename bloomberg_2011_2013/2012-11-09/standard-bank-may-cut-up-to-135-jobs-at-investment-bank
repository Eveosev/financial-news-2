Standard Bank  Group Ltd. said it may
cut as many as 135 jobs in its corporate and investment bank in
 London  to reduce costs amid “challenging” economic conditions
and increased regulation.  Africa’s largest lender may eliminate between 10 percent to
15 percent of its 900 permanent positions in London,
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank said in an e-mailed statement
today. The cuts could help remove about $100 million of costs as
it scales back products and geographies in its corporate and
investment bank globally, it said.  “We continue to seek ways to simplify our business, reduce
our cost base and improve profitability,” said David Munro,
chief executive officer of the corporate and investment bank, in
the statement.  International financial firms, with securities trading hubs
in London, are cutting positions amid volatile markets and
increased regulation including Basel III capital rules.  UBS AG (UBSN) 
plans to cut 10,000 jobs as  Switzerland ’s largest lender shrinks
its investment bank. About 100 traders at its fixed-income unit
in London were put on leave, a person briefed on the plan said
last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
