Germany  sold 3 million European Union
carbon permits for the third phase at 8.20 euros ($10.44) a
metric ton in an auction on the European Energy Exchange AG,
according to the bourse’s  website .  The sale received bids totaling 11 million tons,
representing 3.5 times the volume on offer. That’s the lowest
bid volume of the three German Phase 3 spot sales that have
taken place so far, according to data from EEX compiled by
Bloomberg.  The country is selling as many as 23.5 million tons of
permits for immediate delivery under an EU program of so-called
early Phase 3 auctions scheduled to take place by the end of the
year. The bloc’s emissions trading system’s third phase starts
January and runs through 2020.  The  spot price  for Phase 2 permits, which are eligible
until April, was 8.15 euros at 11 a.m. Berlin time, when the EEX
auction closed, according to data from the Bluenext SA spot
bourse.  EEX, based in Leipzig, Germany, has also sold Phase 2
permits on behalf of Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech
Republic and  Lithuania , and sold Phase 3 allowances for delivery
in 2013 for the  European Investment Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
