Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures rose after President  Barack Obama  said he will meet with
Congressional leaders next week for fiscal talks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.99 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 4:10 p.m., down from 32.45 percent
yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil rose 99 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to settle at $86.55 a barrel on the Nymex.  Obama, speaking at the White House for the first time since
his re-election, invited House and Senate leaders to begin talks
to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, $607 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in
January.  “There’s some hope they have to agree on something and the
sentiment that the market was oversold,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $110 calls, which fell 1 cent to 8 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,016 lots at 4:14 p.m. December $85 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,786 lots exchanged as they declined
75 cents to 45 cents.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 50
percent of the 44,309 lots traded.  Exchange Data  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 51 percent of the
