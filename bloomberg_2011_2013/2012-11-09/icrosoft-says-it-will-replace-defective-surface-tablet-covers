Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said a small number
of covers for its Surface tablet computer are prone to splitting
after two weeks or less in users’ hands and that it’s replacing
the defective ones.  The company is “aware of a small number of instances of
material separation” of the cover accessory, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement. The
cover serves a protective jacket for the Surface, the tablet
computer released last month. “Microsoft makes every effort to
ensure our customers receive a high quality product.”  Surface, which went on sale Oct. 26, represents Microsoft’s
first foray into the computer-hardware market. The world’s
largest software company built the device, which runs its new
Windows 8 operating system, to operate as a touch-screen tablet
that doubles as a small notebook computer.  Users can engage a stand to prop Surface on a table, then
fold out the Touch Cover to use it as a notebook. The Surface
starts at $499 for a 32-gigabyte tablet and the Touch Cover
 costs  an additional $120. Microsoft also sells the two combined.  The defects with the Touch Cover, which users said had
begun to split apart at the seams, were reported earlier on
technology industry  websites .  Shares of Microsoft climbed less than 1 percent at $28.83
at the close in  New York . The  shares  have gained 11 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
