Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.18 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities maturing from January 2019 to February 2042. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace short-term
debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort
to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to purchase between $1 and $1.5
billion securities today, according to the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
