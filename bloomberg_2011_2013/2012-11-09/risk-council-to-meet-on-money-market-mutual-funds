The Financial Stability Oversight
Council will meet Nov. 13 to discuss recommendations to overhaul
money-market mutual fund regulations, the Treasury Department
said in a statement today in  Washington .  Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, the council’s
chairman, has been putting pressure on the Securities and
Exchange Commission to tighten oversight of the $2.6 trillion
money-market fund industry, saying the funds may pose a risk to
the stability of the U.S. financial system if they failed.  Geithner asked the FSOC in September to prepare
recommendations for the overhaul of money-market funds for this
month’s meeting.  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro in August gave up on a plan to
tighten regulation of the funds after three of the five
commissioners -- Republicans Daniel Gallagher and Troy Paredes,
joined by Democrat Luis Aguilar -- told her they wouldn’t vote
to issue it for public comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
