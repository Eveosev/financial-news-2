Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-
largest  iron ore  exporter, estimates Chinese annual steel output
will hit 1 billion metric tons, a rise of about a third, within
the next two decades.  “The forecast is based on China growing at a slowing phase,
but it’s still a pretty robust number,” Vivek Tulpule, chief
economist at the London-based company, said yesterday in a
presentation in Melbourne. “Steel scrap plays an increasingly
more important role but, it will translate into a pretty
substantial growth in iron ore demand.”  Rio has an approved spending budget of $22.4 billion on ore
projects under way and plans to boost capacity in Australia’s
Pilbara region to 333 million tons in 2015. Steel production in
China, the biggest consumer, will peak toward 2030 from a 732
million ton annual run rate in October, Tulpule said.  China ’s move to shift to a consumption-led economy would
reduce the proportion of steel demand for construction to 38
percent by 2030 from 53 percent in 2010, said Tulpule. Demand
from the industrial sector will account for 41 percent of the
total from 36 percent in 2010, he said.  Beyond 2030, demand growth will shift to India and
Southeast Asian countries such as  Indonesia , he said.  Iron ore accounted for 43 percent of Rio’s  revenue  in the
first half, ahead of aluminum, with 17 percent, and copper at 11
percent. Rio expects to produce a total of about 250 million
tons of iron ore this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
