Seven members of a Navy SEAL team
have been punished for disclosing classified information while
serving as consultants for a video game, a Pentagon spokesman
said.  The SEALs were given a non-judicial punishment that
includes letters of reprimand and the forfeiture of half their
pay for two months, said Lieutenant Colonel James Gregory. An
investigation will determine whether more personnel were
involved, he said.  The seven who received punishments at a hearing yesterday
were charged with disclosing classified material, misuse of
command gear and dereliction of duty, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
