Nordic power for the first quarter of
2013 dropped as wet and mild weather combined with the highest
nuclear output in 7 years for the month to boost supply.  “Swedish nuclear output for November is poised to reach
the best levels since the Barsebaeck reactor was closed” in
2005, while utilization rates for December may rise further if
EON AG’s Oskarshamn-1 unit is started,  Handelsbanken AB (SHBA)  said
today in an e-mailed research note.  Nordic nuclear reactors, which supply a fifth of the
region’s power use, were producing at 96 percent of their
average combined capacity at 7:35 a.m., unchanged from
yesterday, data from the operators showed. The Oskarshamn-1
unit, the only reactor which is not operating, may start on Nov.
19, EON AG said on Nov. 6 in a filing with the Nord Pool Spot AS
exchange in Oslo.  Electricity for delivery from January through March lost
0.4 percent to 40.15 euros ($50.99) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo at 2:45 p.m. Power for
December lost 1.1 percent to 38.34 euros, and is set to lose 2.4
percent over the week.  The next 10 days may be 3 degrees Celsius warmer than
average in the region, pointing to subdued electricity demand,
Handelsbanken said.  Weather forecasts continue to point to higher water
supplies in the hydropower-dependent region. The surplus
compared with the seasonal average may increase by 12 percent to
9.6 terawatt-hours in the next two weeks, Markedskraft AS data
on Bloomberg show. The area meets more than half its power needs
by running  water through turbines .  To contact the reporter on this story:
