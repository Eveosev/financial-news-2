It’s no secret that the methods many
banks use for calculating capital ratios are a farce, especially
at large European lenders. Sometimes the numbers are so over-
the-top, all you can really do is sit back and admire the
chutzpah.  Consider  France ’s third-largest bank,  Credit Agricole  SA,
which  today reported  a third-quarter  loss  of 2.85 billion euros
($3.62 billion), sending its stock down 6 percent.  The  real entertainment  can be found in its “core Tier 1
ratio,” which it said was 9.3 percent as of Sept. 30. The
numerator in that calculation is regulatory capital. The
denominator is what the regulators call “risk-weighted assets.”
The smaller the denominator is, the bigger the capital ratio is.  Total assets at Credit Agricole were 1.9 trillion euros as
of Sept. 30. Risk-weighted assets, however, were a mere 298.3
billion euros. In essence, we’re supposed to believe that 84
percent of Credit Agricole’s assets were riskless, even though
that obviously is impossible.  Give blame  where it’s due: The  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  is the body that writes these rules, the objective
of which is to make too-big-to-fail banks’ capital  seem more
robust  than it really is.  For a more realistic capital ratio, take tangible
shareholder equity (which excludes intangible assets such as
goodwill) and divide it by tangible assets. At Credit Agricole,
the figure was 1.4 percent as of Sept. 30, which translates into
leverage of about 73-to-1.  The financial crisis isn’t over by a long shot.  ( Jonathan Weil  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on
