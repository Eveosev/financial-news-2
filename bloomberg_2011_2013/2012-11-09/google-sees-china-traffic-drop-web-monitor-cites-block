Google Inc. (GOOG)  reported higher traffic patterns on its sites in  China  after the company earlier said there was an unusual decline in the country, and an Internet monitor said company services were blocked there.  Google’s Transparency Report, which  measures  traffic to its sites around the world, showed a bigger-than-typical plunge in China traffic yesterday. The company’s services -- including mail, maps and document storage -- were being blocked in China, according to  Greatfire.org , a website that monitors Internet activity and access in China.  China’s government, which is currently holding the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress to appoint a new generation of leaders, maintains media regulations that let it block websites that it deems out of compliance with those rules. Google  said  in 2010 that it would not comply and shuttered its local search page, redirecting users to a Hong Kong site.  “We’ve checked and there’s nothing wrong on our end,” Mountain View, California-based Google said yesterday in a statement.  Ma Yuanchun, a spokeswoman for the Chinese consulate in New York, said she wasn’t informed on the matter and referred all queries to the relevant government authorities in Beijing. Calls and an e-mail sent yesterday after normal office hours to Hong Lei, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing, weren’t immediately answered.  Searches for Google services were recently being routed to another site located in  Korea , using a tactic known as DNS poisoning, Greatfire.org reported.  In June 2010, following its decision to route searches to Hong Kong, Google said some Web search services in China were being partially blocked. Hong Kong isn’t subject to Web restrictions imposed in mainland China.  Google rose 1.7 percent to $663.03 at the close in New York yesterday. The shares are up 2.7 percent this year.
