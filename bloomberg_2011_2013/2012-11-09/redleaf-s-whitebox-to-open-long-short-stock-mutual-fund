Hedge fund investor Andrew Redleaf’s
firm is opening a long-short equity mutual fund for retail
investors.  Whitebox Advisors LLC, which has $2.3 billion in assets
under management, is starting its second alternative mutual
fund, Whitebox Long Short Equity Fund, which seeks to provide
positive returns regardless of the direction and fluctuations in
the U.S. equity markets, according to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It will be publicly offered
to investors starting Nov. 12 and be run by managers including
Jason Cross, Paul Karos and Kurt Winters.  The fund is the successor to Minneapolis-based Whitebox’s
long-short hedge fund, whose investor shares returned 8.5
percent, excluding sales charges, in the 12 months ended Sept.
30. The net expense ratio for investor shares is 1.95 percent
and the front-end sales charge is 4.5 percent. The firm started
its first mutual fund, Whitebox Tactical Opportunities, in
December 2011.  Long-short equity fund managers can bet on rising and
falling stocks. Private-equity firm KKR & Co. LP plans to open
debt funds for individual investors, and fund companies
including  Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN)  and  AllianceBernstein Holding
LP (AB)  have expanded alternative-investment offerings as clients
turn away from traditional stock funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
