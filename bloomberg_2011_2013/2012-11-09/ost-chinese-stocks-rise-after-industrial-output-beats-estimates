 Most Chinese stocks rose after the
release of data showing industrial production, retail sales and
fixed-asset investment exceeded economists’ estimates.  The Shanghai Composite added 0.1 point to 2,071.60 at 1:38
p.m., led by property companies, as five stocks gained for every
three that retreated. The CSI 300 Index was unchanged at
2,245.44, as gains for industrial companies were overshadowed by
declines for telecom and health-care stocks.  Industrial output rose 9.6 percent in October from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The growth
compares with the 9.4 percent median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts and a 9.2 percent
increase in September.  China’s stocks will “linger” unless there are positive
catalysts such as policy easing which is becoming increasingly
unlikely given recent data showing the economy is stabilizing,
Hao Hong, managing director of research at Bank of
Communications Co., said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
