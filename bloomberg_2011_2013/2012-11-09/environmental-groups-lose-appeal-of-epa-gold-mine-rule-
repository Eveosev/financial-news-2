A  Sierra Club  lawsuit seeking tougher
Environmental Protection Agency standards on emissions
associated with  gold mines  was rejected by a federal appeals
court, which found the agency properly limited its regulation to
mercury pollutants.  A three-judge panel of the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in
Washington ruled today that the EPA wasn’t required to set
standards for so-called fugitive emissions while developing the
“Gold Mine Rule.”  The Sierra Club and Desert Citizens Against Pollution sued
the agency last year arguing that the EPA’s explanation for
failing to set controls on emissions from “tailings ponds,
leach fields and waste rock pile” while developing the rule was
arbitrary and capricious.  “EPA reasonably concluded that the record before it
provided insufficient information about the quantity of fugitive
emissions or available methods of controlling them,” U.S.
Circuit Judge  Stephen Williams  wrote in the ruling.  Seth Johnson, a lawyer for the groups with the
environmental organization EarthJustice, said the ruling means
that harmful pollutants from gold mining, such as arsenic,
cyanide, lead and chromium, will remain unregulated.  “There are people who live next to existing and proposed
gold mines and this ruling is going to hurt them,” Johnson said
in a telephone interview. “We hope that states take note and do
something about this.”  The case is Desert Citizens Against Pollution v.
Environmental Protection Agency, 11-1113, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
