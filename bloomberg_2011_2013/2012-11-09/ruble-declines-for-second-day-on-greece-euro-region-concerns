The ruble fell for a second day as
oil, Russia’s chief export earner, declined and concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis will deepen curbed demand for riskier assets.  The ruble depreciated 0.4 percent to 31.6310 against the
dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow. The currency slid 0.2 percent versus
the euro to 40.2250 and sank 0.3 percent against the central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket.  European finance chiefs won’t make the call to release 31.5
billion euros ($40.1 billion) of aid for  Greece  that has been
frozen since June when they meet in Brussels on Nov. 12, a
European official said yesterday on condition of anonymity.
 Brent crude  was down 0.3 percent to $106.94 per barrel at close
of trading in Moscow.  “Europe is still in the doldrums with the Greece situation
remaining unresolved,” Vladimir Kolychev, head of research at
Societe Generale SA’s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in Moscow, said by e-
mail. “Oversupply on the oil markets becomes more evident which
caps upside for the  oil prices .”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.0635 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.9870 yesterday. An index
of five-year government bond yields was unchanged at 7.034
percent.  Ruble-denominated notes may benefit as Russia works to open
its market to foreign investors by giving access to Euroclear
Bank SA and Clearstream International SA, the world’s largest
bond settlement systems.  “In the middle-term, the ruble has a supportive domestic
factor in the liberalization of financial markets,” Ivan Sinelnikov, economist at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow, said by e-
mail. Sinelnikov forecast the ruble at 30.5 to 30.7 per dollar
by year-end.  The extra yield that investors demand to own  Russia ’s
dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points 197,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
