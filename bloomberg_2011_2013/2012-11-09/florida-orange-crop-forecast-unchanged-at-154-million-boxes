Florida orange growers will harvest
154 million boxes of the fruit in the season that started in
October, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today, carrying
forward a projection made last month.  The forecast was made in a  report  posted online by the
USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. A crop of that
size would be 5 percent bigger than the previous season’s
harvest.  “We typically don’t make any changes in the November
report from October,” said Candice Erick, NASS’s agricultural
statistics administrator.  A box of oranges weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms. Florida
is the world’s second-biggest producer of the fruit, after
Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
