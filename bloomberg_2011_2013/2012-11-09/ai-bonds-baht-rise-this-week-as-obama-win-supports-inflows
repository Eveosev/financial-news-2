Thai government bonds and the baht
rose this week as President  Barack Obama ’s re-election increased
the likelihood the  Federal Reserve  will keep boosting the supply
of dollars that can be invested in  emerging markets .  Foreign funds bought $71 million more sovereign notes than
they sold this week through yesterday, Thai Bond Market
Association data shows, helping push the benchmark three-year
yield to a 21-month low on Nov. 6. Global investors sold a net
$64 million of Thai stocks during the period, exchange data show.
Obama faces negotiations with a Republican-led House to avoid
more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that
are set to take effect in January, the so-called fiscal cliff.  “While there will be plenty of liquidity provided by the
Fed, there’s an issue over the fiscal cliff, making investors
reluctant to take riskier positions,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo.
“Funds are coming into emerging markets but investors prefer to
buy bonds rather than stocks.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.83 percent this
week as of 9:05 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It fell one basis point today. The benchmark  rate 
reached 2.81 percent on Nov. 6, the lowest since Jan. 17, 2011.  Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  had said he wouldn’t
reappoint Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in 2014. The central bank
chief announced a third round of assets purchases in September
and said  interest rates  may remain near zero until mid-2015 to
revive growth in the world’s biggest economy.  The baht rose 0.1 percent this week to 30.69 per dollar and
was little changed today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, held at 4.27 percent today
and this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
