For a long time, European diners
brought personal knives to the table. Eating with a strange
utensil was as unthinkable as using another’s toothbrush.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The specially made, decorated knife was housed in a sheath
and worn on belt or girdle. It was kept honed, ready for slicing
bread, spearing meat and defending one’s honor.  In 1637, Cardinal Richelieu was at a formal dinner when he
saw a guest use the sharp tip of a double-edged knife to pick
his teeth.  Appalled, the adviser to King Louis XIII ordered that all
his own knives be ground down and rounded off -- creating the
version still in use today. It became the rage, and in 1669
Louis XIV made it illegal for French cutlers to forge pointed
dinner knives.  I spoke with Bee Wilson, author of “Consider the Fork: A
History of How We Cook and Eat,” on the following topics:  1. Food Technology  2. Knife: Tooth Aide  3. Laughable Forks  4. Focus on Fridge  5. Caffeine Cravings  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
