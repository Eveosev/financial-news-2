Canada ’s dollar fluctuated against
its U.S. counterpart, trading below parity for a second day, as
concern  Europe  and the U.S. will fail to contain their fiscal
crises eroded appetite for higher-returning assets.  The Canadian currency touched a three-month low before
erasing losses after  consumer confidence  in the U.S., the
nation’s biggest trade partner, rose to a five-year high.
Investors have sought refuge in the greenback this week as
policy makers in Europe decide on rescue aid to  Greece  this
month and U.S. lawmakers risk pushing the world’s largest into
recession in a budget-deficit showdown called the fiscal cliff.  “There are still fundamental event risks at play,” Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD
Securities in Toronto, said in a phone interview. “The market
isn’t in a position to make any large bets on the Canadian
dollar. Canada is being held hostage by the fiscal cliff
issue.”  The Canadian currency, called the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, declined 0.1 percent to
C$1.0016 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It depreciated
0.3 percent earlier to C$1.0033, the weakest level since Aug. 3.
One Canadian dollar buys 99.84 U.S. cents.  Canadian  government bonds  were little changed after paring
earlier gains. The  10-year benchmark  bond yielded 1.72 percent
after falling earlier to 1.68 percent, also the lowest since
Aug. 3. The price of the 2.75 percent note maturing in June 2022
slipped 3 cents to C$109.09.  U.S. Confidence  Crude oil for December delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent
to $84.13 a barrel in New York before gaining 1.2 percent to
$86.10 after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary U.S.  consumer sentiment  index climbed to 84.9, the
highest level since July 2007. It was up from 82.6 in October. A
Bloomberg survey forecast a preliminary reading of 82.9 for
November.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent after
dropping earlier as much as 0.3 percent.  The loonie has climbed 1 percent this year against nine
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The  U.S. dollar  has dropped 1.2 percent, and
the yen slid 4.8 percent.  The greenback gained yesterday versus most major peers,
including the loonie, after a European Union official said euro-
area finance ministers may not make a decision on unlocking a
31.5 billion-euro ($40 billion) installment of rescue funds for
Greece until late this month.  Investors have also sought refuge this week since the re-
election of President  Barack Obama  and a split Congress spurred
concern lawmakers will be unable to compromise on the budget.  The U.S. faces $1.2 trillion in mandated spending cuts and
tax increases starting Jan. 1 if Congress can’t agree to reduce
the deficit, which totaled $1.09 trillion in fiscal 2012. The
 Congressional Budget Office  has said the  U.S. economy  would slow
by as much as 0.5 percent next year if Congress fails to prevent
the measures from kicking in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
