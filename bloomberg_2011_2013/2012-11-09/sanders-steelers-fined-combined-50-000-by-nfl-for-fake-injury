Emmanuel Sanders and the Pittsburgh
Steelers were fined a combined $50,000 after the wide receiver
faked an injury in an Oct. 21 National Football League game
against the  Cincinnati Bengals .  Ray Anderson , the NFL’s executive vice-president of
football operations, fined Sanders $15,000 and the team $35,000,
saying game officials and video evidence showed Sanders running
“swiftly and effortlessly” just after the injury supposedly
left him in severe pain.  “Moreover, after missing the one play that is mandatory
pursuant to the playing rules, and receiving no apparent
treatment, Sanders returned to the game for a fourth-down punt,
on which he out-sprinted all of his teammates 26 yards down the
field, arriving at the ball ahead of all other Pittsburgh
players, and then downing the ball,” Anderson wrote in a letter
to the team and player.  Anderson also said a September memo to all clubs urged them
not to fake injuries, and noted that the league’s competition
committee has frequently discussed the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
