Deutsche Bank AG’s DWS Investments
unit, which oversees about $350 billion, cut its holdings of
Treasuries to underweight from neutral yesterday, according to
Bettina Mueller, a portfolio manager at the firm.  The  yield  on U.S. 10-year notes has fallen 12 basis points
since President  Barack Obama  won re-election on Nov. 6, dropping
to a more than two-month low today. The election results boosted
speculation U.S. lawmakers will struggle to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff, the more than $600 billion of tax increases and
spending cuts scheduled to take effect automatically next year
unless Congress acts.  “The rally in Treasuries has been overdone,” Frankfurt-
based Mueller said in a phone interview today. “We thought the
market expected Obama to win but just thought it would be a
little bit tighter. It’s astonishing that now the market is
turning so quickly and we don’t understand that. Our expectation
regarding the fiscal cliff is that both sides will come to a
compromise.”  The  yield  on U.S. 10-year notes rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.63 percent as of 11:21 a.m.  New York 
time, after earlier dropping to 1.578 percent, the lowest since
Sept. 5.  Being underweight means owning a smaller percentage of the
bonds than is contained in benchmark indexes used to monitor a
fund’s performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
