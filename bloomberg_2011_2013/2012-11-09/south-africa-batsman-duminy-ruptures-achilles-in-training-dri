South Africa batsman JP Duminy faces
surgery after rupturing his left Achilles tendon following the
opening day of the first cricket Test against  Australia .  Duminy, 28, was injured during a warm-down drill after
today’s play at the Gabba in Brisbane, Cricket South Africa said
in a statement.  “At first assessment JP said he heard a loud clicking
sound and it felt like he had been hit by an object,” South
Africa team manager Mohammed Moosajee said. “He will undergo
surgery to re-attach the tendon on Saturday morning.”  Duminy may be sidelined for as long as six months, Moosajee
said. He’ll return to South Africa as soon as possible with a
replacement for the rest of the three-Test series to be named in
due course, Cricket South Africa said.  Francois du Plessis, the Proteas’ 12th man, will replace
Duminy in the field, but will not be able to bat when play
resumes tomorrow with South Africa 255-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
