The Australian dollar may climb
further versus its New Zealand counterpart after it breached a
key Fibonacci retracement level, acccording to Credit Suisse
Group AG.  The so-called Aussie may approach the 61.8 percent
retracement of its decline from July to October after it rose
above the 50 percent level, analysts led by London-based  David Sneddon , Credit Suisse’s head of technical analysis research,
wrote in a report yesterday.  The Australian currency’s strength “has already removed
with ease the 50 percent retracement barrier,” the analysts
wrote. “This should reinforce the bullish Australian dollar
outlook.”  The Aussie was at NZ$1.2770 as of 12:08 p.m. in Sydney,
little changed from yesterday’s close in  New York . It earlier
touched NZ$1.2792, the strongest since Sept. 10.  It climbed as high as NZ$1.2778 yesterday, surpassing
NZ$1.2726, the 50 percent retracement of its decline from a high
of NZ$1.3080 on July 25 to a low of NZ$1.2372 on Oct. 2,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its 61.8 percent level
stands at NZ$1.2810 and was last seen on Sept. 7, when the
currency climbed to as much as NZ$1.2882, the data show.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, as levels where there may be sell orders
clustered are known, indicates it may advance to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
