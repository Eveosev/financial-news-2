Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat  exporter last season, is expected to ship 10 million tons
of the grain this season, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said, raising its October estimate of 9 million metric tons.  That would make Russia the fifth-biggest exporter, after
the U.S.,  Canada , the European Union, and Australia, according
to the USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates
report today. The estimate was raised due to “strong shipments
from the  Black Sea region ,” according to the report.  Russia’s wheat exports reached 8.2 million tons from July
through October, the Grain Producers’ Union said Nov. 1. The
country’s wheat production is seen unchanged at 38 million tons,
down from 56.2 million tons a year earlier, according to the
WASDE report.  Russia, whose crops have been seared by drought this year,
harvested 72.9 million tons of grains from 99 percent of the
sown territory by Nov. 7, or 24 percent less than a year
earlier, according to Agriculture Ministry data. The wheat crop
is 39.6 million tons from 99 percent of the planted fields so
far. The harvest is before drying and cleaning.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$8.9225 a bushel by 7:22 p.m. Moscow time. It’s advanced 37
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
