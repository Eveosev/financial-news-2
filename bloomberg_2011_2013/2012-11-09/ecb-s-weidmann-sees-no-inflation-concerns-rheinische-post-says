Bundesbank President and European
Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann said there’s no cause
for concern about inflation in the short term, German newspaper
 Rheinische Post  reported.  “There’s no reason for immediate concern about higher
inflation,” Rheinische Post quoted Weidmann as saying in an
interview. Recessions in several euro-area countries and slower
global growth are curbing price pressures, he said.  For  Germany , Weidmann doesn’t expect the inflation rate to
exceed 2 percent in 2013, Rheinische Post reported.  Referring to the ECB, Weidmann said that the Governing
Council is “technically” in a position to exit from
“expansive monetary policy” at any time. “However, we also
must have the political power to do so,” he said, according to
Rheinische Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
