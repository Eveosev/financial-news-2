Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)  is aiming for U.S.
approval of its experimental diabetes medicine Tresiba in the
first half next year, after obtaining the backing of an advisory
panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration , Mads Krogsgaard
Thomsen, Novo’s chief scientific officer, said.  Heart risks with the medicine, also known as insulin
degludec, are probably not of enough concern to block its
approval, the majority of an advisory panel to the FDA said
yesterday.   “For sure we will target working with the agency in such a
way that we can get the approval in the first half next year,”
Thomsen said in a telephone interview today from Novo’s
headquarters in Bagsvaerd, Demmark. The FDA has not yet informed
Novo of a date by when it expects to complete its review of the
medicine, Thomsen said.   Novo, the world’s largest insulin maker, provided
sufficient efficacy and safety data to support marketing
degludec for use alone or in combination with an insulin boost
for blood-sugar control during meals, the panel voted 8-4 today.
It voted 12-0 that Novo should conduct a trial to examine the
cardiovascular safety of degludec, which may have higher heart
risks than other diabetes treatments. The FDA isn’t required to
follow the panel’s advice.  “It was a vivid, constructive debate,” Thomsen said.
“This is how the FDA advisory committee works. They are
mandated to stress-test” the benefits and risks of new
products, he added. Tresiba’s potential won’t “by any means be
impacted” negatively by today’s panel discussion, Thomsen said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
