Suez Environnement (SEV)  and  SPML Infra
Ltd. (SPML)  won a 75 million-euro ($95 million) contract to improve
water supplies, extend pipelines and cut losses in the network
to 400,000 residents in the Malviya Nagar district of New Delhi.  Suez, which has operated in India for 30 years through its
Degremont water treatment subsidiary, and the SPML construction
company were awarded the 12-year contract by Delhi Jal Board,
which is responsible for water management in the Indian city.
The project works are due to begin next month.  DJB is hoping the water upgrades, including renovating 100
kilometers (62 miles) of pipeline and building 26 kilometers of
extensions, will enable district residents to have a continuous
supply of water 24 hours a day compared with the current 3-8
hours a day, Paris-based Suez said today in a statement.  Degremont was awarded a contract in July by DJB to build
and operate for 11 years a wastewater treatment plant in Delhi,
the first in  India  to use a system to remove odors. Degremont is
finalizing construction of the Bandhup drinking water treatment
plant in  Mumbai , the largest in India, producing 1 billion
liters of water daily, and the TK Halli water treatment plant in
Bangalore, the French water company also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
