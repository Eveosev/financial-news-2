India ’s  interest-rate swaps  completed
a third weekly drop as economists forecast a government report
will show inflation accelerated to the fastest pace this year.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 7.9 percent last
month from a year earlier, according to the median of estimate
of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before data due Nov.
14. That would be the biggest increase since November 2011.
Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao kept the repurchase rate
unchanged for a fourth policy meeting on Oct. 30, and signaled a
reduction is likely only after inflation eases next quarter.  “Swap rates are reflecting elevated inflation levels,”
said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit
Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The central bank has also more or less
ruled out any rate cut this quarter.”  The fixed payment to lock in five-year borrowing costs rose
seven basis points this week to 7.18 percent in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, today to the highest
level since since Sept. 19.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 rose two basis points this week and today at 8.22
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
