Omtron USA, which bought poultry
producer Townsends Inc. out of bankruptcy last year, filed for
bankruptcy protection in  Delaware .  The Siler City, North Carolina-based company listed assets
and debt of $10 million to $50 million each in Chapter 11
documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  Omtron joins Zacky Farms LLC, a Fresno, California-based
poultry producer, that filed for bankruptcy in October with
plans to sell itself to pay creditors owed as much as $100
million. The closely held company blamed the filing on heavy
debt and soaring feed costs in papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in  Sacramento ,  California .  The North Carolina operations of Townsends were closed in
2011 by Omtron Ltd., which bought the processing plants, feed
mills and hatcheries for about $24.9 million when Townsends was
in bankruptcy.  Townsends Inc., a family-owned chicken and egg producer
based in Georgetown, Delaware, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
on Dec. 19, 2010, listing about $131 million in assets and about
$127 million in debt as of Dec. 5. In February 2011, Townsends
won court approval to sell virtually all of its assets to Peco
Foods Inc. and Omtron Ltd. for about $76.4 million. Peco, based
in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama , bought Townsendsâ€™ Arkansas operations
for about $51.4 million.  The case is In re Omtron USA LLC, 12-13076, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
