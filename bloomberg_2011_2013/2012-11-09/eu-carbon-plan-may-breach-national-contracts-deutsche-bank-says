A European Union draft plan to
restrict use of United Nations Emission Reduction Units and
other UN credits issued after this year may breach commitments
made by some EU members, Deutsche Bank AG said.  Countries from  Lithuania  to Cyprus may have handed out
approval letters to companies cutting emissions through this
year and beyond, Isabelle Curien, an analyst in Paris at the
bank, said today in an e-mailed research note. The draft EU plan
may make it unlawful for companies to hold credits issued beyond
this year in their registry accounts, she said.  “Given that not all pre-2013 emissions reductions can be
verified before Jan. 1, 2013, it would appear that member states
could be in breach” of those commitments should the draft
amendment be implemented, Curien said.  The commission may have run out of time to implement its
plan because a Climate Change Committee vote probably won’t take
place until Dec. 13 and a three-month scrutiny period would
follow, the bank said.  “It is only after these processes have been completed that
the technical  information technology  work necessary to implement
the new/amended provisions of the registry regulation in the EU
registry system could be launched,” Curien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
