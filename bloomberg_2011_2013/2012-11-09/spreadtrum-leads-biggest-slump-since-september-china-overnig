weekly loss in four months in New York ahead of new leadership’s
measures to bolster growth after a seven-quarter slowdown.

Agency reported. At stake is the policy direction of an economy
that grew at the slowest pace since 2009 and led companies to
miss analysts’ earnings estimates by 8.5 percent last quarter.  “It’s the uncertainty amid  China ’s power transition that’s
damping the stock market this week,” Timothy Ghriskey, the
chief investment officer at New York-based Solaris Group LLC,
which manages about $2 billion in assets including Chinese
stocks, said by phone yesterday. “Investors are not sure if new
leaders will focus on growth and when. What we really want to
see is a rebound in growth after quarters of slowdown.”  ETF Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 0.2 percent yesterday to

Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies traded in Hong

 Shanghai , tumbled 8.9 percent to $19.44 yesterday in New York,
the steepest slump since Aug. 10. Its American depositary
receipts have declined 9.5 percent for the week.  JPMorgan equity analyst Qin Zhang lowered his rating on
Spreadtrum to neutral from overweight yesterday, while lifting
its price target by $1 to $23.  The company expected fourth-quarter sales to be between
$189 million and $196 million with gross margin remaining
“flat” from the previous three months in a Nov. 8 statement.
The revenue estimate fell short of the $197.3 million average
projection of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  VanceInfo Merger  VanceInfo, which said Nov. 6 that shareholders approved its
merger with rival Hisoft, dropped 1.6 percent to $7.58 in New
York, extending its weekly retreat to 3.8 percent. Hisoft, whose

percent to $10.20 for a weekly loss of 3 percent.  The name of the combined company is Pactera Technology
International Ltd., according to a statement yesterday.
VanceInfo’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange will be
canceled from Nov. 12, the statement said.  Cnooc Ltd. (CEO)  added 0.2 percent to $206.30 yesterday, trading

takeover of  Canada ’s Nexen will be completed by the end of the
year, Chairman Wang Yilin said at a meeting held as part of the
18th Communist Party Congress in Beijing yesterday. The comment
came after Canada extended its review of state-owned Cnooc’s bid
for the second time on Nov. 2, resetting the deadline to Dec. 10
and citing the need for a thorough review.  For the week, Cnooc’s ADRs lost 1 percent, the first
decline in five weeks.  Yuan Forwards  Twelve-month  yuan  forwards strengthened 0.16 percent in the
week to 6.3485 a dollar, after the currency snapped a 13-week
rally in Shanghai during the period, falling 0.1 percent to
6.2450 a dollar.  The  30-day volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US gauge was
15.48 yesterday, up from 15.26 a week ago, and compares with
this year’s average of 22.7. The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse
