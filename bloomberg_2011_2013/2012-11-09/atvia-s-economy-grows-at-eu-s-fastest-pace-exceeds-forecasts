Latvia’s  economy  expanded at the
quickest pace in the European Union in the third quarter, fueled
by trade, manufacturing and construction.  Gross domestic product grew a preliminary 5.3 percent from
a year earlier compared with a revised 5 percent advance in the
second quarter, the  statistics office , based in the capital,
Riga, said today by e-mail. That’s more than the 4.5 percent
median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg survey. GDP
rose 1.7 percent from the previous quarter.  Latvia is rebounding from the world’s deepest recession in
2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of economic output
after a property bubble bust and credit inflows dried up,
prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. GDP will
advance 4.3 percent this year, the fastest pace in the 27-member
EU, buoyed by exports and domestic demand, the European
Commission said Nov. 7.  Manufacturing and trade grew 7 percent from a year earlier
between July and September while construction expanded 8
percent, according to today’s statement. The statistics office
will release detailed GDP data Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
