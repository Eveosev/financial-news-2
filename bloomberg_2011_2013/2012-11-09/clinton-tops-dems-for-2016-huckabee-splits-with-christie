Now that the 2012 election is over,
time to think about 2016. At least one polling firm thinks so.  The first polls of the next presidential race, by the
Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling, found Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  as the Democrats’ favorite in the first
two states on the political calendar, Iowa and New Hampshire.  Former Arkansas Governor  Mike Huckabee  led among
Republicans in Iowa, while New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
was the preference among Republicans in New Hampshire.  Even before the final ballots of 2012 are counted and
Florida’s 29 electoral votes are officially awarded to President
 Barack Obama , PPP looked ahead four years from now and found 58
percent of Iowa Democrats and 60 percent of New Hampshire
Democrats preferring Clinton, who unsuccessfully sought her
party’s nomination in 2008 and lost to Obama.  Vice President Joe Biden was the runner-up among Democrats,
with 17 percent in Iowa and with 10 percent in New Hampshire.  On the Republican side, Huckabee polled 15 percent in Iowa.
Christie, 2012 vice-presidential nominee  Paul Ryan  and Florida
Senator Marco Rubio tied for second, with 12 percent. Christie
led in New Hampshire with 21 percent, while Rubio was second
with 14 percent.  The surveys were taken Nov. 3-4, even while other pollsters
still were asking likely voters about their presidential
preferences this year.  PPP is an automated poll, meaning it cannot call cell
phones and does not know who is pressing the response buttons on
the other end of the landline. Even so, it called eight of the
nine swing states in 2012, missing only in its home state of
North Carolina when the Raleigh-based firm forecast a tie rather
than the eventual win by Republican nominee  Mitt Romney .  To contact the reporter on this story:
