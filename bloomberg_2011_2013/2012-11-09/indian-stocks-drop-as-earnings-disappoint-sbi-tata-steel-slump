Indian stocks had their biggest drop
this month as earnings reports from companies including  State
Bank of India , the largest lender, and Tata Steel Ltd., the
biggest producer of the alloy, disappointed investors.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 0.9 percent
to 18,678.28, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. The 30-stock gauge fell 0.4 percent this week.
 State Bank  sank 4 percent as a rise in bad loans outweighed
better-than-estimated second-quarter earnings. Tata Steel sank 4
percent after unexpectedly reporting a loss and  Oil & Natural
Gas Corp. (ONGC)  tumbled to a five-month low after profit declined the
most in almost four years.  Out of the 29 Sensex companies that have reported earnings
for the quarter ended September, 11, or 38 percent, have lagged
behind  analystsâ€™ estimates . That compares with 40 percent of the
index companies missing forecasts in the June quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
