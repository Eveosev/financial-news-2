Romania ’s Eurobond yields rose to the
highest level in more than a month as a plan to renew the
nation’s safety-net accord with the  International Monetary Fund 
next year may increase the appeal of local currency debt.  Yields on 2018 euro-denominated bonds advanced six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.76 percent, the highest
since Oct. 4. The leu weakened less than 0.2 percent to 4.5260
per euro by 5:32 p.m. in Bucharest, falling for a third day.  Romania seeks to secure a new precautionary agreement with
the IMF that will act as a safety net against “serious
turbulences” in financial markets, Prime Minister Victor Ponta
said yesterday. The nation’s current 5 billion-euro ($6.4
billion) accord with the IMF expires in April.  “We think a new precautionary agreement with the IMF will
be positive for leu  government securities ,” Nicolae Covrig, a
Bucharest-based analyst at Raiffeisen Bank Romania SA wrote in a
note today.  The yield on 2019 Eurobonds climbed four basis points to
5.04 percent, while the 2022 dollar debt yields was little
changed at 4.61 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  A campaign for general elections started today, a month
before a ballot on Dec. 9 as ruling coalition parties,
supporting Ponta face the opposition, backing President Traian Basescu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
