MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) , a
provider of cash transfers worldwide, agreed to forfeit
$100 million to resolve U.S. charges that some of its agents
defrauded customers.  The forfeiture is part of a deferred-prosecution agreement
between the Dallas-based company and the U.S. Attorney’s Office
in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , MoneyGram said today in a
statement. Prosecutors will withdraw criminal charges if
MoneyGram complies with the agreement for five years, according
to papers filed in federal court in Harrisburg.  The settlement stems from an investigation from 2003 to
2009 into transactions involving MoneyGram’s U.S. and Canadian
agents, as well as its fraud-complaint data and consumer anti-
fraud program, the company said. MoneyGram will appoint an
independent compliance monitor under the agreement.  “We take compliance very seriously at MoneyGram, and
nothing angers us more than when our services are used to
perpetrate illegal activity,” Chief Executive Officer Pamela Patsley said in the statement.  Agents’ Acts  MoneyGram knew as early as 2003 that its agents were
involved in a scheme to trick victims into sending money through
participating outlets, prosecutors said in court documents.  Victims were promised they would receive lottery winnings,
fictitious loans and large cash prizes. The scheme also involved
offering high-ticket items for sale over the Internet at deep
discount and posting jobs for “secret shoppers,” according to
court documents. Victims were then directed to send advanced
payments to fake payees using MoneyGram, the government said.  Prosecutors alleged that MoneyGram agents knowingly entered
false addresses and telephone numbers for these transactions
into the company’s database. The agents then subtracted their
own fees for their role in completing the fake transactions,
according to court papers.  Customers filed more than 63,000 consumer fraud reports
claiming more than $128 million in losses in the U.S. and  Canada 
from 2004 to 2009, the government said. MoneyGram’s fraud
department recommended terminating numerous agents and outlets
suspected of fraud as early as 2003, recommendations that were
rarely accepted, according to court documents.  Compliance Expenses  Patsley said the company has  invested  more than $84 million
in compliance programs since 2009. MoneyGram that year paid
$18 million to the Federal Trade Commission, which distributed
the money to victims of the fraud scheme, according to today’s
statement.  The case is U.S. v. MoneyGram International Inc., 1:12-
00291, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania
