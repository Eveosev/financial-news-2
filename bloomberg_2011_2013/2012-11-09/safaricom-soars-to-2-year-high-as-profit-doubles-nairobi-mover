Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  East Africa ’s biggest
mobile-phone company, climbed to the highest level in close to
two years after first-half profit almost doubled.  The  stock rallied  as much as 11 percent and closed trading
7.9 percent higher at 4.80 shillings in the capital, Nairobi,
the strongest since January 2011.  Net income surged to 7.77 billion shillings ($91 million)
in the six months through September, from 4.01 billion shillings
a year earlier, the company said yesterday. The company raised
its guidance for full-year earnings. Safaricom increased call
charges in October 2011 for the first time in 11 years amid a
weakening currency and accelerating inflation in East Africa’s
biggest economy.  “Safaricom is expected to elicit positive investor
sentiments,” Nairobi-based AIB Capital Ltd. said today in an e-
mailed note to clients. “The management remains optimistic of
its full year performance results.”  Voice revenue climbed 19 percent to 37.4 billion shillings,
while data sales climbed 29 percent to 3.98 billion shillings.
Income from MPESA, the company’s mobile money-transfer service,
surged 32 percent to 10.4 billion shillings as the number of
customers grew 2.4 percent to 15.2 million.  Shares in Safaricom,  Kenya ’s  second-biggest company  by
market value, have rallied 63 percent this year, outperforming a
35 percent rise in the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
