The cotton crop in the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter, will be 0.9 percent bigger than
forecast last month because of higher yields, the
government said.  Production may total 17.447 million bales, up from
17.287 million projected in October, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. The average estimate of
nine analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was 17.4 million.
The harvest was 64 percent complete as of Nov. 4, the USDA
said this week. The previous crop totaled 15.57 million
bales, each weighing 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Cotton has plunged 68 percent from a record $2.197 a
pound in March 2011 as the higher prices eroded demand and
boosted global output. The December contract closed
yesterday at 69.26 cents, down 0.8 percent, on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , after touching 69.03 cents, the lowest
since June 28.  “ South Carolina  and  Georgia  are likely to produce the
biggest harvests in years, while yield forecasts in
 Louisiana  climbed each of the last several months and could
inch even higher in the November report,” Gary Raines, an
economist at FCStone Fibers and Textiles in Nashville,
 Tennessee , said in an e-mail before the report was
released.  U.S. growers may export 11.6 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, down from 11.71 million
in the previous season, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at
the end of the year will total 5.8 million bales, up 73
percent from 3.35 million last year, according to the
report.  Projected Yields  Yields may reach 802 pounds per acre, up from 795
projected last month and 790 pounds in the previous year,
the USDA said.  World output will reach 116.83 million bales, down 6
percent from 124.28 million the previous year, the USDA
said. Last month’s estimate was 116.32 million bales.  Consumption will total 106.33 million bales, up 3.1
percent from 103.17 million last year, the department said.  Global stockpiles on July 31, 2013, may total 80.27
million bales, a 1.5 percent increase from 79.11 million
forecast in October, the USDA said.  Estimated inventories in  China , the biggest user of
the fiber, at the end of this marketing year will be 37.11
million bales, up 1.4 percent from the October estimate of
36.61 million, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
