Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, sold 300 million pounds ($478.5
million) of bonds as credit risk rose for a third day in  Europe 
on concern the region’s debt crisis will worsen.  The company priced senior unsecured securities due in three
years at 108 basis points more than the midswaps rate, according
to a person with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be
identified because they’re not authorized to speak. The Markit
iTraxx Financial Index on the senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers rose five basis points to 180 at 3 p.m. in London, the
highest since Oct. 29.  Corporate debt sales are heading to about 6.4 billion euros
($8.2 billion) this week, as companies including  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) ,
the world’s fourth-largest brewer, take advantage of the lowest
borrowing costs in 18 months. Issuers are confident even as the
Bank of France said the nation may fall into a recession and
 Greece  struggles to meet the terms of its bailout.  “Although spreads have been edging a bit wider in the last
few days this will still be extremely cheap funding for
Prudential by almost any historic standard,” said Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London.  Prudential last sold fixed-rate debt in pounds when it
priced 250 million pounds ($318 million) of 3.375 percent bonds
in January 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lanxess Sale  Also in  capital markets  today,  Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German
chemical maker, sold 500 million euros of 10-year senior
unsecured bonds priced to yield 107 basis points more than
swaps, according to a banker involved in the deal. It’s the
company’s first benchmark-sized sale in the currency since May
2011, Bloomberg data  show .  In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of
125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis
points to 132. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked
to the debt of 50 mostly junk-rated European companies climbed
one basis point to 533.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
