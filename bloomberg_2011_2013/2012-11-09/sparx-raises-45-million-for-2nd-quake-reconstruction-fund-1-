Sparx Group Co. (8739) , a Japanese asset
manager, raised 3.6 billion yen ($45 million) for its second
fund that will invest in building hotels areas devastated by
last year’s Japan earthquake.  Banks including  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  and  Bank of Yokohama Ltd. (8332) 
provided non-recourse loans for the fund, while companies
including  Daiwa House Industry Co. (1925) , Japan’s biggest homebuilder,
and  Denso Corp. (6902) , an auto parts maker partially owned by Toyota
Motor Corp., provided mezzanine debt, said Chief Executive
Officer Shuhei Abe. Mezzanine debt is a type of leveraged loan
repaid after senior loans in a default.  Sparx’s Reconstruction Fund is part of the company’s
efforts to widen offerings from stock-related funds to become
profitable as assets dropped more than 70 percent since their
peak in 2006. The company in September said it will start a fund
that will invest in the nation’s residential properties after
receiving money from a sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East.  “The fact that banks are supporting this project is
actually a progress for us,” Abe said in a telephone interview.
“There are still not enough places to stay in the quake-hit
areas and demand is expected to increase.”  Rebuilding Effort  A 314-room hotel Sparx’s first 1.1 billion yen fund built
in Natori city in Miyagi prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, to
provide lodging for relief workers and volunteers following the
disaster opened on Oct. 1, Abe said. The second fund will be
dedicated to two hotel projects with a total of 1,000 rooms in
the same prefecture, he said. The hotels are expected to open in
April, he said.  Japan  plans total spending of 19 trillion yen over five
years for reconstruction after the March 2011 magnitude-9
temblor and tsunami that devastated the northeast coast, leading
to a nuclear crisis and leaving almost 20,000 people dead or
missing.  The Tokyo-based asset manager widened its loss to 1.59
billion yen for the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with 820
million yen a year ago, as asset management and performance fees
declined.  Separately, Sparx won a bid to build a mega-solar power
plant in Toyama prefecture on the Japan Sea coast, said Yoshiko Mitsui, a vice president at unit Sparx Green Energy & Technology,
which manages the project.  The plant, on about 15.8 hectares and generating 7,686
kilowatts, is scheduled to start operation in February 2014,
Mitsui said.  In September, Sparx entered the renewable business,
revealing plans to build a mega-solar power plant in Kumamoto
prefecture in southern Japan.  Sparx’s  shares  fell 1 percent 5,100 yen at the close of
trading on the Jasdaq exchange, bringing its year-to-date drop
to 4.9 percent. That compares with the 8.4 percent gain by the
Jasdaq Stock Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
