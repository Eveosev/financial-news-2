Palm oil dropped to the lowest level
in more than five weeks on deepening concern that stockpiles in
 Malaysia , the largest producer after  Indonesia , will expand from
a record as production peaks.  The contract for January delivery fell 0.9 percent to 2,316
ringgit ($756) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price at close for the most-active contract
since Oct. 2. Futures retreated 7.2 percent this week, the
second straight week of losses and the most since the five days
ended Sept. 28.  Reserves in Malaysia probably climbed 8.9 percent to 2.7
million tons in October from an all-time high of 2.48 million
tons in September, according to a Bloomberg survey. Output
remained at a monthly high of 2 million tons for a second month,
the survey showed. The Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board is scheduled to
release monthly data on Nov. 12.  “People are still talking about the stockpiles and rising
production in Malaysia,” Ryan Long, a vice president of futures
and options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone.  Palm-oil exports from Indonesia, the world’s largest
producer, will probably climb 13 percent to 1.6 million tons
this month to the highest level since January, according to a
Bloomberg survey. Imports by  India , the biggest buyer, probably
climbed 23 percent to 750,000 tons in October after a slump in
prices spurred traders to stockpile to meet festival demand,
another survey showed.  Soybean oil for December delivery slid 0.9 percent to 48.35
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
January delivery declined 0.7 percent to $14.8575 a bushel, the
lowest level since July 3. Palm and soybean oils are substitutes
in food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for May delivery lost 1.2 percent to 6,708  yuan 
($1,075) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the lowest
close for the most active contract since July 2010. Soybean oil
for the same month fell 1.6 percent to end at 8,614 yuan a ton,
the lowest price for the most-active contract since November
2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
