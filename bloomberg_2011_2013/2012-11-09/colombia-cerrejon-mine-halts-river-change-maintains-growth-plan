Cerrejon, a Colombian coal mine owned
by units of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton
Ltd (BHP) , halted a study to change the course of the Rancheria River
as part of an expansion plan.  Cerrejon will maintain a $1.3 billion plan to boost annual
output to 40 million tons from 32 million tons by 2015 without
changing the river, the company said yesterday in a statement on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
