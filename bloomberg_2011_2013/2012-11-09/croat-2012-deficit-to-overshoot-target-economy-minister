Croatiaâ€™s budget deficit this year
could reach 10.8 billion kuna ($1.8 billion), 800 million kuna
more than originally planned, Economy Minister Radimir Cacic
told state radio today.  The Adriatic nation, set to join the European Union in
July, is struggling to revive the economy after three years of
recession and stagnation. The government said in January it will
reduce spending by 4 billion kuna this year to narrow the budget
gap to 2.9 percent of output from 4.2 percent in 2011.  The  government  forecasts the economy will stagnate this
year, while the European Commission said on Nov. 7 it will
shrink 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
