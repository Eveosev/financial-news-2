Slovenians probably won’t be able to
elect their president in first-round voting on Nov. 11 as none
of the three candidates will gain more than 50 percent of
support, a poll showed.  The incumbent President Danilo Turk would get 34 percent of
votes, former Prime Minister Borut Pahor 27 percent while Milan Zver, a lawmaker in the European Parliament would get 18
percent, the survey by Delo Stik agency published in the
Ljubljana-based  Delo newspaper  today showed. The poll was
conducted from Nov. 5 to Nov. 8 among 1,012 adults. No margin of
error was given.  If no candidate wins on Nov. 11, a second-round vote would
be held three weeks later, according to the newspaper.
Slovenia’s president is elected for a five-year term and has a
largely ceremonial role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
