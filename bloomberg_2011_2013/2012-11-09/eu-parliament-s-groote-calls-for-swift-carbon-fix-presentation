The chairman of the European
Parliament’s environment committee called on the European
Commission to present without delay its proposal to curb the
oversupply in the bloc’s carbon market.  Matthias Groote, a German Socialist member of the
parliament, urged the European Commission to publish a report on
the functioning of the EU emissions program and a draft
regulation to delay some auctions of carbon allowances “as soon
as possible and not later than Nov. 14,” according to a letter
to commission President  Jose Barroso  obtained by  Bloomberg News 
and dated Nov. 7.  The 27-nation bloc’s regulatory arm is planning to publish
next week details of its strategy to reduce oversupply in its
emissions trading system, specifying a number of permits to be
delayed. The European  People’s Party , the biggest group in the
parliament, yesterday called on the commission to delay the
presentation of the backloading proposal by about five months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
