Strayer Education Inc. (STRA) , a for-profit
college chain with 97 campuses, fell the most in almost two
years after forecasting profit that fell short of analysts’
estimates and suspending its $1-a-share quarterly dividend.  Profit will be $1.43 to $1.45 a share in the current
quarter, and $5.40 to $5.60 in 2013, Herndon, Virginia-based
Strayer said today in a statement. That compares with analysts’
average estimates of $1.56 for the quarter and $5.57 for next
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  For-profit colleges are reporting declining enrollment as
students are reluctant to take on debt in a sluggish economy.
The schools’ marketing practices, job placement and student-loan
defaults have also been under scrutiny by Congress, the U.S.
Education Department and federal prosecutors, and they face more
competition from traditional colleges.  “We believe the postsecondary market is increasingly
crowded, commoditized and competitive,”  Peter Appert , an
analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co., wrote in a note to investors.
He  rates  the stock “underweight.”  Strayer fell 17 percent to $46.51 at the close in New York,
the most since January 2011 and is at its lowest level in almost
11 years. A Bloomberg index of 13 for-profit education stocks
dropped 2.5 percent.  Career Education Corp. (CECO) , a college chain based in
Schaumburg,  Illinois , fell 14 percent to $2.93 after reporting
it will close 23 campuses and eliminate 900 jobs amid declining
enrollment.  Last month, Phoenix-based  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , the largest
chain and the operator of University of Phoenix, also said it
was closing campuses and cutting jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
