The forint snapped a two-day decline
after  Hungary ’s industrial output unexpectedly expanded for a
second month in September.  The currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 283.29 per euro,
paring its slide this week to 0.4 percent. Yields on the
government’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 6.945 percent.  Production rose a workday-adjusted 0.6 percent from a
revised 1.8 percent increase in August, the statistics office in
Budapest said today, citing an expansion in vehicle output. The
median estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a
0.5 percent drop.  “The currency gained on the better-than-expected
industrial production data,” Imre Kerekgyarto, a Budapest-based
trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
