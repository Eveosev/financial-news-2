Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  said President  Francois Hollande ’s deficit-reduction plan
relies too much on tax increases and that they hurt economic
growth more than spending reductions.  “I would prefer more savings from spending and less
emphasis on revenue,” Noyer said in an interview with  Le
Progres  newspaper that was published today. “Still, raising
taxes reduces deficits more quickly. In future, the focus should
be on spending.”  The comments by Noyer, a member of the European Central
Bank board, are a rare criticism of the government by the
politically independent central bank. Noyer said reaching
Hollande’s target of a 2013 budget deficit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product deficit is key to maintaining credibility in
markets.  Hollande’s plan involves 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in
tax increases and 10 billlion euros in spending cuts.  The central bank governor also said French banks are solid
and don’t face the same fate as  Spain ’s, which required a 100
billion-euro European bailout.  To contact the reporters on this story:
