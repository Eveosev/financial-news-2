Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s fourth biggest airline, advanced to the highest level
in more than one month, after returning to profit in the second
quarter.  The  stock  rose 5 percent, the most since Sept. 19, to 10.50
rupees by 10:54 a.m. in Port Louis, the capital. The number of
shares traded was more than six times the three-month daily
average volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income for the three months through September was 1.27
million euros ($1.62 million), compared with a loss of 7.69
million euros a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Andre Viljoen announced yesterday. Air Mauritius has embarked this
year on a recovery plan which includes purchases of more fuel-
efficient aircraft, cost management and focus on more profitable
routes. It targets a return to full-year profitability by fiscal
2014.  “The airline is moving on improved financials,” said
Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at the city-based Axys
Stockbroking Ltd. “Their recovery plan seems to have a positive
impact on the cost side.”  Revenue declined 3 percent to 112.9 million euros, Viljoen
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
