Greece  and Cyprus will present two
Mediterranean energy plans to the European Commission in an
effort to secure part financing from the European Union, the
Greek  Energy Ministry  said.  Greece, Cyprus and  Israel  are to promote the connection of
the three states with an underwater electricity cable and a
natural  gas pipeline , the ministry said late yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  The 2,000-megawatt EuroAsia Interconnector Project
underwater cable between Israel and  Europe  would help ensure the
security of power supplies to Israel, Cyprus and Greece as well
as to southeast Europe and the Mediterranean area, the Greek and
Cypriot energy authorities said April 26.  The pipeline would allow Israeli, Cypriot and possibly
Greek gas later, to be sent to European clients via Greece,
offering the region a third source of the fuel in addition to
Russian and Azeri supplies, former Greek Energy Minister  George
Papaconstantinou  said March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
