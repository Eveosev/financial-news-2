Colombia’s peso bond yields rose the
most in a week as investors sold local financial assets as they
seek liquidity after the collapse of the Andean nation’s biggest
brokerage.  The yield on 10 percent peso-denominated debt due in July
2024 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.23
percent, according to the central bank. The price fell 0.545
centavo to 130.62 centavos per peso.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said Nov. 7 that
regulators will liquidate Interbolsa SA’s brokerage after it
failed to meet a loan payment last week. The yield on the
 government bonds  due July 2024 has risen six basis points and
the benchmark Colcap stock index dropped 3.5 percent this month,
after Interbolsa said Nov. 1 it was facing a funding squeeze.  “The market is very volatile given all that’s happening
with Interbolsa,” said William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank
SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage in Bogota. “The question is how much will need
to be sold in shares and bonds as people seek liquidity.”  Following the collapse on Interbolsa’s brokerage,
Colombia’s central bank began offering this week 300 billion
pesos ($165 million) of 14-day  repurchase agreements  to boost
liquidity, accepting securities including corporate bonds as
collateral. None of the repos were taken by investors today,
while 4 billion pesos worth were taken yesterday.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 1,815.35 per  U.S. dollar .
The currency gained 0.6 percent this week and has jumped 6.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
