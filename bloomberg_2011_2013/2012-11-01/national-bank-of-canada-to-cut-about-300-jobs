National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest bank, plans to cut about 300 jobs, or
almost 2 percent of its workforce.  “As part of normal course of business, National Bank is
optimizing its structure to ensure it remains efficient and
agile,” spokesman Claude Breton said.  Pat Minicucci, who was head of National Bank’s consumer-
banking operations outside of  Quebec , said in an e-mail
yesterday that he was let go. Breton declined to discuss
specific departures or departments.  The lender had 16,825 full-time employees at the end of
July and has created more than 3,300 jobs since the beginning of
2008, Breton said. The Montreal-based bank will also hire about
800 people over the “normal course of business,” Breton said
in an e-mailed statement today.  National Bank rose 0.4 percent to C$77.50 at 4 p.m. in
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 7.4
percent this year, the third-best performer among the country’s
six biggest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
