Italian and Spanish government bonds
advanced after a U.S. report showed fewer Americans filed for
 unemployment benefits  last week than economists forecast,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  Italy’s  10-year securities  climbed for a third day after a
separate report showed manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly
accelerated last month. U.S. employers hired 125,000 workers in
October, up from 114,000 in September, according to a Bloomberg
News survey before tomorrow’s Labor-Department report. German
bunds were little changed ahead of data tomorrow that economists
said will confirm euro-region manufacturing shrank in October.  “The U.S. data was better than expected,” said Nicola Marinelli, who oversees $160 million at Glendevon King in
 London . “Credit risk is continuing to be bought. The market is
very quiet, looking ahead to tomorrow’s U.S. payrolls data.
Expectations are not high so if we get a better number the
market may rally.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.93 percent at 5 p.m. London time. The 5.5
percent bond due in November 2022 rose 0.24, or 2.40 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,293) face amount, to 104.925. The Spanish 10-year
yield dropped three basis points to 5.59 percent.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. fell 9,000 to
363,000 in the week ended Oct. 27, the least in three weeks, the
Labor Department said in  Washington . Economists forecast
370,000, according to a Bloomberg survey. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index climbed to 51.7 in
October from 51.5 a month earlier, group said today.  German Bunds  Germany’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.46
percent after falling to 1.44 percent on Oct. 30, the lowest
level since Oct. 4.  A gauge of euro-area manufacturing dropped to 45.3 last
month from 46.1 in September, according to a separate Bloomberg
survey.  A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.  Spanish 10-year yields have fallen 44 basis points since
Sept. 6, when European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
he would back the Europe’s rescue fund with unlimited bond-
buying for countries in distress in return for conditions.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  justified his delay
yesterday in response to criticism in Parliament by saying
“sometimes the hardest decision is not to take any decision.”  ‘More Involved’  “The market is reluctant to renew its risk-averse mood
because the ECB may get more involved,” said  Orlando Green , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “The ongoing question is will  Spain 
ask for a bailout. The market is caught between a rock and a
hard place.”  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest among euro-area
markets today, followed by those of  Finland , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Greece ’s 10-year bond yield climbed 40 basis points 18.17
percent after increasing to 18.27 percent, the highest level
since Oct. 12. The price dropped to 30.36 percent of face value.  Efforts to rescue Greece have failed to provide the basic
structural reforms needed to help bring competitiveness to its
economy, said  John Lipsky , the International Monetary Fund’s
former first deputy managing director.  “It has been frustrating because some of these have been
clear from the outset in so many ways,” Lipsky said in an
interview in Copenhagen yesterday. “This process could have
been handled so much better.”  German bonds returned 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 3.2 percent, while Italy’s earned 17 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
