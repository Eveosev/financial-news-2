The dollar rose for a third day
against the yen before a U.S. report that economists said will
show employers stepped up hiring last month, pointing to a
recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  The euro weakened versus 13 of its 16 major counterparts
after a report confirmed the region’s manufacturing sector
contracted in October. The yen headed for a third weekly decline
against the U.S. currency as economic weakness and disappointing
corporate earnings spurred speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will
expand monetary easing. The pound climbed to the strongest in a
month against the euro.  “Squaring up ahead of the payrolls must be a factor,”
said Adam Cole, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “In terms of dollar-euro, if
you knew what the number would be, it’s hard to say how the
market would react. If you were to get a good number relative to
expectations, the way the market will play that more immediately
would be in dollar-yen.”  The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 80.27 yen as of 7:17 a.m. in
New York, extending this week’s advance to 0.8 percent. The U.S.
currency gained 0.5 percent to $1.2878 per euro after reaching
$1.2865, the strongest since Oct. 11. The euro declined 0.3
percent to 103.37 yen.  The U.S. Labor Department will say today employers hired
125,000 workers last month following an increase of 114,000 in
September, according to the median estimate of 91 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before the report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington . The jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent from a three-
year low of 7.8 percent, a separate survey showed.  Jobless Benefits  Applications for jobless benefits fell 9,000 to 363,000 in
the week ended Oct. 27, the Labor Department said yesterday. A
report from ADP Research Institute showed that companies boosted
payrolls in October by 158,000, the most since February.  “If we get very good data out of the U.S. we might
actually see people going to the U.S. dollar because, on a
relative basis, the U.S. is much better” than the euro area,
said Lee Sue Ann, a treasury economist at  United Overseas Bank
Ltd. (UOB)  in Singapore. “If we get very bad data and things are not
so good, usually the dollar is also supported because it’s a
safe-haven currency.”  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area dropped
to 45.4 from 46.1 in September, snapping two months of advances,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That compares with an
initial October estimate of 45.3 published on Oct. 24. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Europe’s Decline  The euro has weakened 2.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which tracks 10
developed-nation currencies. The yen has dropped 6.5 percent,
the biggest loser, and the dollar slid 2 percent.  Commerzbank AG today raised its forecasts for the euro
against the dollar through December 2013, saying weakness in the
currency will be delayed.  The Frankfurt-based bank estimates the euro will trade at
$1.30 by December this year, up from a previous forecast of
$1.23, analysts Ulrich Leuchtmann and  Ralph Solveen  wrote in an
e-mailed note. It will be at $1.23 by December 2013, from a
previous estimate of $1.16, the analysts wrote.  Yen’s Decline  The yen has declined at least 0.3 percent this week against
all 16 of its major counterparts, dropping as much as 1.9
percent against the Norwegian krone and 1.4 percent versus the
South Korean won.  Sharp Corp., based in  Osaka , said there was “material
doubt” about its ability to survive after yesterday forecasting
a record full-year loss on falling demand for its display
panels. Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest consumer electronics
exporter, reported a seventh quarterly loss.  The BOJ increased its asset-purchase program by 11 trillion
yen to 66 trillion yen on Oct. 30 to bolster growth through
lower borrowing costs. In the previous meeting on Oct. 4-5, the
central bank avoided adding to stimulus.  “The possibility could not be ruled out that the economy
would be acknowledged retroactively to have entered a
recessionary phase,” according to the  minutes  of Oct. 4-5
meeting released today.  “Markets are increasingly convinced that the Bank of  Japan 
will continue to ease monetary policy until deflation is
overcome,” weakening the yen, said Minori Uchida, Tokyo head of
global market research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
“Views that the U.S. economy isn’t so bad are causing a change
in market sentiment.”  The pound climbed for a third day against the euro after
data showed U.K. construction unexpectedly expanded in October.  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers rose to
50.9 last month from 49.5 in September. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast a decline to 49. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Sterling rose 0.2 percent to 80.05 pence per euro after
appreciating to 79.97, the strongest level since Oct. 3. The
U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent to $1.6088.  To contact the reporters on this story:
