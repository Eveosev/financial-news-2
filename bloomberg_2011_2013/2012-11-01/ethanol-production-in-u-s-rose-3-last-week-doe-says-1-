Ethanol  output  in the U.S. rose 3
percent last week to 825,000 barrels a day, the highest level in
six weeks.  Stockpiles swelled 2.4 percent to 19.2 million barrels, the
biggest weekly gain since June 15 and the highest amount in
three weeks, the Energy Department said in a report today in
 Washington , while  imports  surged to 58,000 barrels a day, up
from 19,000, the previous week.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 91 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 93 percent in the week ended
Oct. 19.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery climbed 0.6 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.442 a gallon at 10:10 a.m. local time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have jumped 11 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
