DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , maker
of the “Madagascar” films, agreed to make its next 15 animated
movies using Barco NV’s 3-D sound format.  The agreement will begin with the Nov. 21 release of “Rise
of the Guardians,” Glendale, California-based DreamWorks and
Kortrijk, Belgium-based Barco said today in a statement.  Studios and technology companies are developing new sound
systems to draw consumers into theaters rather than watch movies
on television and small devices. The Barco system distributes
the soundtrack among speakers set at three heights in the
theater to provide a more natural sound, the companies said.
 Dolby Laboratories Inc. (DLB) ’s competing system called Atmos has been
featured in some films including “Brave,” from  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s Pixar.  “Rise of the Guardians,” featuring the voice of  Hugh Jackman , is based on the William Joyce children’s books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
