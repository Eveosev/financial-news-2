Comet, a U.K. electronics chain, will
appoint Deloitte LLP as insolvency administrator, less than a
year after being bought by private-equity firm OpCapita LLP, two
people familiar with the matter said.  Legal paperwork was presented to the high court today, said
one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
matter is confidential. The court may take until Nov. 6 to
approve the move to put the business, one of the main
competitors to U.K. market leader  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , into
administration, according to the person.  Cometâ€™s website  was closed this afternoon, though all
existing orders are expected to be fulfilled, the person said.
Stores will remain open and staff will be retained until the
business is formally in the hands of administrators, they said.  OpCapita took over the unprofitable 240-store chain from
Kesa Electricals Plc, since renamed  Darty Plc (DRTY) , in February after
receiving a 50 million-pound ($81 million) cash dowry. Darty
retained the pension program and received a nominal sum of 2
pounds. OpCapita brought in former Dixons chief John Clare to
help turn the business around, but has struggled with tightened
supplier terms and a loss of credit insurance.  Spokespeople for all parties involved declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
