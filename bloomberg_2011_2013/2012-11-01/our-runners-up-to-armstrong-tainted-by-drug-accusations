The  International Olympic Committee 
opened an investigation into  Lance Armstrong ’s bronze medal at
the 2000 Games in Sydney, the Associated Press reported.  Armstrong won the medal in the time-trial event and may now
lose it after being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles
by cycling’s governing body last week because of doping, the AP
said.  The news service quoted the IOC as saying it “will now
immediately start the process concerning the involvement of
Lance Armstrong, other riders and particularly their entourages
with respect to the  Olympic Games  and their future involvement
with the games.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
