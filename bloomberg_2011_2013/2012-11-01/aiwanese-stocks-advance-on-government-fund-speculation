Taiwanese shares rose on speculation
government funds may have supported stocks after the benchmark
index fell as much as 1.6 percent in the morning.  The  Taiex index  advanced 0.2 percent to 7,179.64 at the
close, with 462 stocks gaining and 230 declining. Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., which has the second-largest weighting
on the benchmark index, jumped 1.2 percent.  Hiwin Technologies
Corp. (2049) , a ball-bearing maker, slumped 6.9 percent after it was
downgraded at HSBC Holdings Plc.  “Government funds may have supported stocks in the
morning, though it’s unlikely the stabilization fund was used,”
Diana Wu, a vice-president at Capital Securities Corp., said by
phone in Taipei.  Tseng Ming-chung, deputy finance minister, didn’t
immediately answer two phone calls seeking comment. Taiwan’s
Financial Supervisory Commision said in a statement on its
website on Oct. 30 stocks were affected by global uncertainty
and it will monitor developments in the stock market and take
measures when appropriate.  The gauge dropped 7.1 percent last month, the most since
November 2011. The government cut its 2012 growth estimate to
1.05 percent yesterday from 1.66 percent, and said the economy
may expand 3.09 percent in 2013, less than a previous prediction
of 3.67 percent.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Taiwan gauge was at 10.6,
lower than this year’s average of 16.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. About 2.8 billion shares changed hands in
the Taiwan gauge yesterday, compared to this year’s average of
3.1 billion. Trading volumes were about 8.4 percent higher than
the 30-day average for the Taiex Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
