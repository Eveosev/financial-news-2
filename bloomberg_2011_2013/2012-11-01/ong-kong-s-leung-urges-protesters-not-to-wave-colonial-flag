Hong Kong  people unhappy with the
government’s performance shouldn’t wave the flag from the
British colonial era to express their disappointment, Chief
Executive Leung Chun-ying told the city’s Legislative Council
yesterday.  Leung said he pays attention to both the positive and
negative sides of closer socio-economic integration with  China .  Hong Kong, which was handed back to China by the United
Kingdom in 1997, has the widest wealth gap in Asia. The flag of
the former colony has been displayed at demonstrations against
the government in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
