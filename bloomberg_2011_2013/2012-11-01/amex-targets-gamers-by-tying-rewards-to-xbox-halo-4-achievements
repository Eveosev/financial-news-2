American Express Co. (AXP) , the largest
U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases, is seeking to lure
gamers by awarding special deals to Xbox 360 players tied to
their performance in the soon-to-be-released “Halo 4” video
game.  AmEx has partnered with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s bestselling game
franchise to introduce new interactive card benefits that unlock
rewards and coupons based on how well players score.  “When you reach certain levels in the game, you are
getting rewarded couponlessly and seamlessly,” said Leslie Berland, AmEx’s senior vice president of digital partnerships
and development. “It’s adding a totally new layer of value for
playing Halo 4 on the platform.”  American Express credit- and charge-card customers will
need to synchronize their accounts with their Xbox to win the
offers, which include deals at  Best Buy Co. (BBY)  and Currys PC World,
as well as account credits of $25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
