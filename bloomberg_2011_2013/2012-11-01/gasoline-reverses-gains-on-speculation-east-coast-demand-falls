Gasoline was little changed,
reversing earlier gains, on speculation flooding and power
outages after  Hurricane Sandy  struck the East Coast will reduce
demand because people are unable to drive or unable to find
service stations with adequate fuel.  Futures were down 0.17 cent to $2.6286 a gallon at 1:25
p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier touching
$2.6726.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
