Maynilad Water Services Inc. and
 Manila  Water Co., metropolitan Manila’s water concessionaires,
signed a subsidiary loan agreement to facilitate implementation
of a World Bank-funded wastewater project, the Philippine Star
said, citing nobody.  LandBank’s $275 million loan from the  World Bank  for the
metropolitan Manila wastewater project to be carried out over 25
years will be equally divided between the concessionaires under
the agreement, the paper said. The World Bank announced approval
for financing of the loan in May to boost wastewater collection
and treatment in the country’s largest city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
