Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest
publicly traded water company, said revenue in the third quarter
almost doubled from a year earlier.  Revenue climbed to S$155 million ($127 million) from $87.7
million a year ago, Hyflux said today in a statement. Net income
in the quarter rose 15 percent to S$14.5 million. Global
economic uncertainties may impact water infrastructure projects
in key markets including China, the company said.  Asia  outside of China provided 80 percent of the group’s
total revenue, it said. Hyflux considers China, where sales rose
to S$26.4 million, and India as its largest growth markets in
Asia. Hyflux shares have risen 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
