Diesel fuel strengthened in the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  today as traders booked cargoes to carry fuel from
the region after Hurricane Sandy closed ports on the East Coast,
boosting demand for shipments to Europe.  As many as eight diesel cargoes were booked for loading
from the Gulf before Nov. 10, according to Charles Martin, head
of clean tankers at MJLF & Associates, a Stamford, Connecticut-
based shipbroker. There would normally be about three such
shipments over a comparable period, he said.  Hurricane Sandy, the Atlantic superstorm that made landfall
in southern New Jersey on Oct. 29, prompted the U.S. Coast Guard
to shut the ports of Boston, Portsmouth,  New Hampshire  and
Portland, Maine this week.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway refinery and
 Hess Corp. (HES) ’s Port Reading plant remained shut three days after
Sandy struck the coast.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the Gulf rose 1.25 cents to
trade at a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon below heating oil
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:56 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the first advance
in four days.  Diesel in New York Harbor gained 2.75 cents to 12.75 cents
a gallon over futures at 3:16 p.m., the highest level since
Sept. 5.  Reformulated gasoline in the New York was unchanged at 4.25
cents above futures.  Stockpiles of gasoline in the U.S. rose by 935,000 barrels
to 199.5 million in the week ended Oct. 26, the third
consecutive weekly advance, the Energy Department reported
today.  Gulf Coast supplies  led the gain with an increase of 1.46
million barrels to 70.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
