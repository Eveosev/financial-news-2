Nigeria , Africa’s biggest oil
producer, lost at least $37 billion in revenue over the last
decade because of underpayments for crude sales, royalties and
signature bonuses for oil-exploration concessions, a report
prepared for President Goodluck Jonathan showed.  The report, obtained by Bloomberg, was prepared by a team
set up by the Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke in
February and is due to be released publicly tomorrow. Collusion
between government officials, Nigeria National Petroleum Corp.
and people working for its partners, who include  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Exxon Mobil Corp., resulted in the losses,
according to the report.  Fidelis Pepple, a spokesman for NNPC, declined to comment.
Kingsley Agha, director of information at the Petroleum
Ministry, said the report will be submitted to the president
tomorrow and declined to comment on its contents.  Tony Okonedo ,
a spokesman for Shell, and Nigel Cookey Gam, a spokesman for
Exxon, said their companies will comment after the report’s
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
