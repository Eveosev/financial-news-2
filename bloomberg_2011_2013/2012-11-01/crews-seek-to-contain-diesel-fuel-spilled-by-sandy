Workers contained a spill of  diesel
fuel  caused by superstorm Sandy, blocking it from flowing into a
waterway that separates New Jersey and New York, the U.S. Coast
Guard said.  Erik Swanson, an agency spokesman based in New York, said
four storage tanks at a facility operated by Motiva Enterprises
LLC were damaged by the storm. Motiva is a joint venture of
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Saudi Refining Inc.  Two of the tanks, which each hold as much as 336,000
gallons of fuel, leaked diesel into a creek that feeds Arthur
Kill, Swanson said.  “The exact volume released is yet to be determined,”
Swanson said.  The leak has stopped, he said. Larry Ragonese, press
director for the  New Jersey  Department of Environmental
Protection, said earlier today that about 336,000 gallons of
fuel had leaked from a single damaged storage tank.  About 130 workers were helping in the clean-up, Swanson
said. Testing by the Coast Guard hasn’t indicated any air-
quality issues at the spill site, Swanson said.  Ragonese said about about 30 birds were found with fuel on
them. Swanson said he couldn’t confirm any effects on wildlife.  Separately, a storage tank at a  Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI)  terminal
in Carteret, New Jersey, on the Arthur Kill leaked about 10,000
gallons of biodiesel, Ragonese said. It wasn’t clear how much of
the fuel got into the water, he said.  “We did have a tank that knocked into another tank, which
caused a tear,” said Joe Hollier, a spokesman for  Kinder
Morgan . “The product is contained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
