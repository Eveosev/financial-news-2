as a means of creating cost-conscious set menus, particularly at
lunch,” Rebecca Burr, editor of “The Michelin Eating Out in
Pubs Guide 2013,” said today in an e-mailed release.  While pubs are chosen mainly for the quality of their food,
some are recognized for their setting, character or service.  Michelin & Cie (ML) , the world’s second-biggest tiremaker,
produced its first guide in 1900. It was free of charge until
1920 and intended for chauffeurs. The volume contained practical
information, including street maps and tips on repairing tires.
The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand,  France .  “Eating Out in Pubs Guide 2013” will be available in
bookshops and online from tomorrow, priced at 13.99 pounds
($22.61), or 16.99 euros in Ireland.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
