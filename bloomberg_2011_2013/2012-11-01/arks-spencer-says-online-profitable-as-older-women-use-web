Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K’s
largest clothing retailer, said its Internet business is
profitable as older, female shoppers move online.  The 128-year-old retailer, which reported 560 million
pounds ($903 million) in multichannel sales last year, told
investors that it made a profit in the fiscal year ended March
2012 at an investor presentation, which it posted on its website
today.  Marks & Spencer is investing in its web offering to
increase sales from the Internet and grab a bigger share of the
market. The retailer is the third-biggest online clothing and
footwear chain in the U.K. and controls about 6 percent of the
market. The company has about 11.7 percent of the total clothing
market in Britain, it said in May.  Marks & Spencer will come off its  Amazon.com. Inc (AMZN)  platform
in early 2014 and is building its own dedicated e-commerce
distribution center in Castle Doddington,  England  to fulfill
online orders. The retailer is spending 250 million pounds to
increase multichannel sales to as much as 1 billion pounds by
fiscal 2014.  The retailer said its online customer is a typically an
affluent female aged between 55 and 65 years old who owns lots
of technology like tablets and smartphones and already banks and
shops online.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
