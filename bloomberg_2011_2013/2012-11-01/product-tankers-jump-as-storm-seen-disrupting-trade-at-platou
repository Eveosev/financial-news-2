Rates for tankers hauling refined
fuels jumped to more than a six-month high as superstorm Sandy
disrupted shipping schedules, according to RS Platou Markets AS.  With power outages and refinery shutdowns curbing U.S.
output and demand, traders are avoiding sending ships to the
U.S. from  Europe , Frode Moerkedal, an Oslo-based analyst at
Platou, said in an e-mailed report today, citing unnamed
brokers. About 6.1 million customers were without electricity as
of Oct. 31, the Energy Department said.  Rates for oil-product tankers to northwest Europe from the
U.S. Gulf jumped 18 percent yesterday, the most since at least
March, to 100.63 industry-standard Worldscale points, according
to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of shipping
costs. That’s the highest since April 11, data show.  “Brokers said  Hurricane Sandy  has created havoc to vessel
schedules and a tight tonnage situation in the U.S. Gulf
underpinned the higher rates,” Moerkedal said in the report.
“With substantial demand destruction on the U.S. East Coast,
refiners and traders have been reluctant to send vessels into
the area from Europe, brokers said.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
