NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , a Kenyan lender,
climbed to the highest level in more than 15 months after
announcing the cut-off date for a bonus share offer.  The stock advanced 1.3 percent to 38.50 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the strongest since July 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The notice of the bonus issue had an impact on the share
price,”  Moses Waireri, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview. “The only way
for this company is up because investors have a lot of
confidence in the management as demonstrated by the level of
oversubscription of its rights issue.”  NIC will issue one free share for every 10 held to
investors in its shareholders’ register by the close of business
on Nov. 22, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
