(Corrects year rate was introduced to 2011 in first
paragraph)  Uganda ’s central bank cut its key
interest rate to stimulate borrowing and spur economic growth,
the eighth reduction since introducing the benchmark in July
2011.  The Bank of Uganda lowered the central  bank rate  to 12.5
percent from 13 percent in October, Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime- Mutebile told reporters today in the capital, Kampala. It raised
the rate by 10 percentage points last year to a peak of 23
percent to protect the currency against depreciation and fight
inflation that reached 30.5 percent in October 2011.  The central bank will probably prefer to cut the rate
“marginally” as it guards “against accelerated decline in the
 interest rates  and provides a little more support for the
shilling in the short term,” Stephen Kaboyo, the managing
director of Alpha Partners, a Kampala-based research company,
said by phone before the decision.  The central bank said the interest rate on 91-day Treasury
bills was 9.688 percent at an auction yesterday.  Economic growth in the 12 months through June slowed to 3.2
percent from 6.7 percent a year earlier after services and the
industrial sectors fell, according to the Uganda Bureau of
Statistics. Growth may recover to 5.4 percent this fiscal year,
it said.  Inflation in the  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy slowed
to 4.5 percent in October from the revised 5.5 percent in
September after prices of some food items dropped, the Uganda
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
