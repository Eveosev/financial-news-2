Medivir AB (MVIRB) , a Swedish biotech
company, rose the most in eight months after announcing a
mid-stage study for a hepatitis C treatment combining simeprevir
with VX-135, developed by  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)   The shares rose as much as 12 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since February, and were up 11 percent at 67.25 kronor as
of 3:11 p.m.  The proof-of-concept study will start early next year to
investigate tolerability, safety and viral cure rates after a
12-week period, Stockholm-based Medivir said today in a
statement. Simeprevir, developed by Johnson & Johnson with
Medivir, is a hepatitis C treatment now in late-stage studies
and is also known as TMC435. VX-135 is designed to attack the
hepatitis C virus in a different way, Medivir said.  “This study will broaden our understanding of simeprevir,
which we believe has the necessary characteristics to become a
key component of future hepatitis C treatment regimens,”
 Charlotte  Edenius, who heads Medivir’s research and development
department, said in the statement.  Johnson & Johnson and Vertex will share the costs for the
study equally and there are no up-front or milestone payments
connected to the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
