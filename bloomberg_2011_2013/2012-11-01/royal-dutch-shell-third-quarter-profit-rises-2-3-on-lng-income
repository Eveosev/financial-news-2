Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europeâ€™s
biggest oil company, reported a 2.3 percent increase in third-
quarter profit on higher earnings from its liquefied natural gas
operations.  Net income  rose to $7.14 billion from $6.98 billion a year
earlier, The Hague-based Shell said today in a statement.
Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, profit was $6.6
billion, beating the $6.3 billion average  estimate  of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  LNG sales volumes of 4.97 million metric tons were 4
percent higher than a year earlier, mainly reflecting the
contribution from the Pluto LNG project in  Australia , according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
