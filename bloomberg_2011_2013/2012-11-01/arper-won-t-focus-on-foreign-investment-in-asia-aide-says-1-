Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  isn’t expected to focus on foreign investment issues during
his trip to Asia next week, his spokesman said.  Asked if the government planned to announce new foreign
investment policy during the trip, Harper spokesman Andrew
MacDougall said the prime minister’s visits to India and the
Philippines will focus on strengthening relations with the two
countries.  “I don’t expect we will be covering much on the foreign
investment front,” MacDougall told reporters today. Harper will
be traveling to India, the Philippines and  Hong Kong  on an
eight-day trip to the region that ends Nov. 11.  MacDougall also said Canada will need foreign investment to
develop its natural resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
