Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ,
maker of Keurig K-Cups and brewers, rose the most in three
months after saying it will make private-label capsules for
 Costco Wholesale (COST)  Corp.  The  shares  climbed about 9 percent to $26.34 at the close
in New York, the biggest increase since Sept. 10. The Waterbury,
Vermont-based company has lost 41 percent this year.  Green Mountain will be the exclusive K-Cup pack
manufacturer for Costco’s Kirkland Signature brand, the brewer
said in a statement. Green Mountain is making so-called
Breakfast Blend and Pacific Bold single-cup capsule varieties
that will be for sale this month at the Issaquah, Washington-
based company’s club stores and website.  Green Mountain is facing increasing competition from
private-label capsules made by  Kroger Co. (KR)  and  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  that
fit into Keurig brewers. Green Mountain also sells branded K-
Cups under the Tully’s Coffee, Newman’s Own Organics and Cafe
Escapes names.  To contact the reporter on this story:
