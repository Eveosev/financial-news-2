U.S.  mortgage rates  fell, decreasing
borrowing costs as the real estate recovery gains momentum.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to
3.39 percent in the week ended today from 3.41 percent,  Freddie
Mac  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate declined to
2.7 percent from 2.72 percent, according to the McLean,
Virginia-based mortgage-finance company.  Home values are increasing as traditional homebuyers
compete with investors for a shrinking supply of listings. The
S&P/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 U.S. cities rose 2
percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest gain since
July 2010, the group said this week.  Higher prices, along with mortgage rates close to record
lows, are “boosting home sales by nudging fence-sitters, who up
to now have been waiting for  home prices  to bottom out before
jumping into the ring,”  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS
Global Insight in Lexington,  Massachusetts , wrote in a note to
clients after the Case-Shiller data were released.  The 30-year average reached an all-time low of 3.36 percent
last month, while the 15-year hit a record of 2.66 percent,
according to Freddie Mac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
