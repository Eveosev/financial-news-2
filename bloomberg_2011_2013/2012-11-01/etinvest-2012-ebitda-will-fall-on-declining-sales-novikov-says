(Corrects figure in fourth paragraph.)  Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, expects earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization to fall this year on declining
steel sales, Chief Financial Officer Sergiy Novikov said.  This year’s Ebitda will drop to $1.7 billion or $1.8
billion from $3.56 billion last year, Novikov said in a phone
interview today. The Donetsk, Ukraine-based steelmaker,
controlled by billionaire  Rinat Akhmetov , envisages capital
expenditures of as much as $800 million next year and doesn’t
plan any big borrowing, Novikov said.  “The first half of the year was challenging, and the
second one will be even more,” Novikov said. “The third
quarter was very difficult as iron ore prices slumped. We see
the results of the second half of the year to be worse than the
first one.”  Metinvest’s six-month net income plummeted 71 percent from
a year earlier to $334 million as consolidated revenue fell 4
percent to $6.74 billion, the company said today. Crude steel
production declined 8 percent to 6.75 million tons in the first
half from the same period a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
