Cypriot Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said comments attributed to his German counterpart,
 Wolfgang Schaeuble , that Cyprus hasn’t had concrete talks with
international creditors “may have been misinterpreted.”  Schaeuble may have meant that a bailout agreement “will
take us until January 2013” before euro-region parliaments
ratify it, “even if we agreed the memorandum of understanding
next week and went to the eurogroup,” Shiarly said, referring
to the group of euro-area finance ministers. He said he is
“optimistic that talks are developing quite satisfactorily and
do not believe that this comment could be true.”  Shiarly said that Cyprus, which in June became the fifth
member of the 17-nation euro region to request an international
rescue, hopes the troika of international monitors -- the
 International Monetary Fund , the European Commission and the
 European Central Bank  -- will announce its next visit to the
island “very soon” to finalize the terms of Cyprus’s rescue.  Cyprus would prefer to have its request approved by euro
finance ministers as early as Nov. 12, when the group is due to
meet in Brussels, even if  Spain ’s bailout request is not on the
agenda, Shiarly said. “It is up to Spain to decide” when its
request will be discussed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
