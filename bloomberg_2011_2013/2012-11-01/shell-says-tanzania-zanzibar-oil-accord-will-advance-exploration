Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , the largest
European oil producer, said an agreement between Tanzania and
Zanzibar on managing oil and gas resources will allow the
company to advance exploration in the Indian Ocean.  Shell holds at least four exploration licenses off Zanzibar
and is working with  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  on two off Tanzania,
 according  to Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. The country’s
President Jakaya Kikwete and Zanzibar President Ali Mohamed Shein last month agreed to begin preparations for the management
of oil and gas resources, the  Daily News  reported.  “We have acreage which we haven’t been developing because
it’s effectively under both jurisdictions,” Chief Financial
Officer Simon Henry said. “Any agreement in fact is good news
that would enable us to have that discussion about going ahead.
It’s a positive step for us.”  Zanzibar, an archipelago including the main islands of
Unguja and Pemba and at least 51 islets, is about 30 kilometers
(19 miles) off the coast of Tanzania. The semi-autonomous  Indian
Ocean  nation is in a political union with Tanzania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
