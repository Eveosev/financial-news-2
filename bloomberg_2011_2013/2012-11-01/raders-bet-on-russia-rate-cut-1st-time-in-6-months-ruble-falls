Investors are betting for the first
time in six months the Russian central bank will cut interest
rates this month, forward-rate agreements show. The ruble
weakened.  The ruble depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 31.345 per
dollar and 40.685 per euro by 4:55 p.m. in Moscow. The currency
was little changed at 35.5507 against the central bank’s euro-
dollar basket.  Three-month forward-rate agreements traded at 7.3 percent
today, 0.08 percentage point lower than the MosPrime rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This indicates traders
are pricing in an 8 basis points cut in rates over the next
three months, the first time the data indicated a reduction
since April. Bank Rossii is due to review interest rates in the
first ten days of November.  The ruble has depreciated 7.5 percent from this year’s peak
of 28.9925 per dollar reached on March 26 when oil traded $2.74
from a high of $109.77 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Urals,  Russia ’s export blend of crude, traded up 1 percent
at $108.21 a barrel.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8393 per
dollar in three months.  The central bank is likely to leave the  refinancing rate  on
hold at 8.25 percent, according to a median estimate of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The inflation rate rose to an annual 6.6 percent in
September. It likely remained unchanged in October, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s chief economist in Moscow
Vladimir Osakovsky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
