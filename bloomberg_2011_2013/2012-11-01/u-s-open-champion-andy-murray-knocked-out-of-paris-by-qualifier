U.S. Open tennis champion Andy Murray
was knocked out in the third round of the BNP Paribas Paris
Masters today by a qualifier ranked 66 places below him.  Third-ranked Murray lost to Jerzy Janowicz of Poland 5-7,
7-6 (7-4), 6-2. Murray, a 25-year-old right-hander from
 Scotland , failed to convert a match point on his serve at 5-4 in
the second set.  It’s the third tournament in a row that Murray has exited
after squandering match points. He had two against Canada’s
Milos Raonic in Tokyo and five against Novak Djokovic in
 Shanghai .  Murray’s latest defeat comes a day after second-ranked
Djokovic was also upset in Paris. The Australian Open champion
from  Serbia  lost to Sam Querrey of the U.S. in his opening
contest, his earliest tournament exit for more than two years.  Murray and Djokovic will compete in next week’s Barclays
ATP World Tour Finals in London, the season-ending event for the
top eight singles and doubles players in the world. Top-ranked
Roger Federer of Switzerland withdrew from the Paris event and
No. 4 Rafael Nadal of Spain hasn’t recovered from a knee injury
that’s kept him out since Wimbledon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
