Kellogg Co. (K) , the maker of Corn Flakes
cereal and Keebler Cookies, reported third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates amid price increases.  Net income rose 2.1 percent to $296 million, or 82 cents a
share, from $290 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier, the
Battle Creek, Michigan-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was 92 cents a share. The average
of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 81 cents.  Chief Executive Officer John Bryant is looking to boost
profit by selling cereal and Pringles chips in  China ,
overhauling the company’s supply chain and acquiring new brands.
Global pricing increased 2.7 percent in the quarter, driven by
North America.  “While we believe the foundation for getting back to
sustainable long term growth is clearly in place, we continue to
expect this process to take hold over the next year or so,”
 Christopher Growe , an analyst at Stifel Nicolas & Company in St.
Louis, said today in a note.  Kellogg rose 2.3 percent to $53.50 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 5.8 percent this year.  Third-quarter sales rose 12 percent to $3.72 billion,
helped by better-than-expected sales in its Pringles unit, which
the company acquired in May. The average estimate of 18 analysts
was $3.69 billion.  Lower profitability from Pringles reduced the company’s
overall gross margin by 40 basis points.  A recall of Mini-Wheats cereal reduced per-share earnings
by 6 cents in the quarter, Kellogg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
