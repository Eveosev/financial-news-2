Asian currencies traded near an
eight-month high after data showed manufacturing picked up in
 China  and  India  and  South Korea ’s exports rose for the first
time in four months.  China’s purchasing manager’s  index  climbed to 50.2 in
October from 49.8 in September, according to official figures
released today. A reading above 50 signals expansion. A similar
gauge in India rose to 52.9 from 52.8, according to a report
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. Korea’s overseas
 shipments  rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier after a revised 2
percent drop in September, a separate statement showed.  “Signs of economic data bottoming out are helping to
sustain interest in Asian currencies,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “Funds are
still flowing into  Asia  and that will provide support.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, was at
117.84 as of 4:30 p.m. in  Hong Kong , after having reached the
highest level since February of 117.98 yesterday. South Korea’s
won, which touched a 13-month high of 1,090 per dollar
yesterday, closed at 1,092.40, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar was at 29.290 and touched 29.200
earlier, approaching a five-month high scaled on Oct. 17.  Emerging-market bond funds attracted $44.2 billion this
year through Oct. 24, compared with $15.9 billion in all of
2011, according to U.S. data research firm EPFR Global.  Yuan Fixing  China’s yuan slipped 0.05 percent to 6.2405 per dollar,
halting a three-day advance as a lowering of the People’s Bank
of China’s  reference rate  meant the currency had to weaken to
remain within its permitted trading range. The PBOC’s  fixing 
fell 0.04 percent to 6.3017 per dollar today, 1.02 percent below
yesterday’s closing level for the currency. The  yuan ’s value is
kept within 1 percent of the reference rate.  “China’s export growth this year doesn’t justify rapid
yuan appreciation,” said Tommy Ong, a Hong Kong-based senior
vice president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong)
Ltd. “Yet capital continues to flow into China on an improving
growth outlook, which will continue to support the yuan.”  The currency touched 6.2371 per dollar on Oct. 29, the
strongest level since the government unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority added HK$2.3 billion ($298
million) into the financial system today to prevent the city’s
currency from rising beyond its permitted trading range, data
showed. That’s the seventh intervention followed a combined $2.6
billion injection since Oct. 19.  Rupiah Falls  Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in more than two weeks,
declining 0.2 percent to 9,623 per dollar, as a report showed
the nation’s exports contracted for a sixth month. The currency
fell for a ninth straight month in October in the longest run of
losses since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1991.  Shipments from Indonesia slid 9.4 percent in September from
a year earlier, after declining 24.3 percent the previous month,
official data showed today. The nation’s current-account
shortfall reached a record $6.9 billion in the second quarter.  Elsewhere,  Thailand ’s baht weakened 0.1 percent to 30.72
per dollar while  Malaysia ’s ringgit slipped 0.2 percent to
3.0542. India’s rupee and Vietnam’s dong were little changed at
53.7950 and 20,848, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
