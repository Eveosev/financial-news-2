Chris Ashton  will miss England’s
rugby Test against Fiji next week after receiving a one-week ban
for three yellow cards this season. He was also warned about his
tackling technique.  Saracens winger Ashton appeared at a Rugby Football Union
disciplinary hearing last night after picking up his third
yellow for a dangerous tackle against Northampton Saints’ Vasily
Artemyev in last weekend’s English Premiership match.  Since Ashton wasn’t released by England for Saracens’ next
game, the disciplinary board hearing the case decided to start
the ban after that match, meaning he’ll miss the Fiji Test at
Twickenham Stadium six days later.  “We deferred commencement until Sunday, Nov. 4 so he
misses a game he would have played in,” disciplinary board
member Jeff Blackett said in a statement. “We are concerned
about his tackling technique and encourage that he and his
coaches work to correct it.”  After meeting Fiji, England hosts Australia on Nov. 17,
South Africa on Nov. 24 and world champion  New Zealand  on Dec.
