Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center, shrank
15 percent during the past week, the most in more than six
months, according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene fell 1.64 million barrels to 9.37 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the largest percentage drop
since the week ended April 25.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen declined 1.53 million
barrels, or 7 percent, to 20.5 million, the ministry’s data
showed. That’s the biggest percentage loss in five weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate increased 194,000 barrels, or 2.2 percent, to 9.18
million, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
