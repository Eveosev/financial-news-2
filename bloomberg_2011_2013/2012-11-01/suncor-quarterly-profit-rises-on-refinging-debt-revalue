Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest
energy company by market value, said third-quarter profit rose
21 percent as the company benefited from rising refining income
and the revaluation of U.S. dollar-denominated debt.  Net income rose to C$1.56 billion ($1.56 billion), or
C$1.01 a share, from C$1.29 billion, or 82 cents, a year
earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Per-share profit beat the 70-cent average of five
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s refining operations reported earnings of
C$708 million in the quarter compared with C$479 million in the
year-earlier period. Suncor attributed its record refining
results to lower feedstock costs for crude oil processed at its
inland refineries. It also booked a gain on the revaluation of
U.S.-dollar denominated debt of C$252 million in the quarter.  Suncor Chief Executive Officer  Steve Williams  has been
evaluating the company’s expansion plans since taking over from
his predecessor Rick George earlier this year. The company is
looking at ways to reduce costs amid an expansion, including its
oil-sands operations that may boost output to 1 million barrels
a day by 2020.  The company plans to delay development of its Fort Hills
oil-sands project and is still evaluating costs for the planned
Voyageur upgrader with  Total SA (FP) , Williams said during a
conference call today.  Capital spending  next year may be
“around” C$7.5 billion from an earlier target of between C$8
billion and C$9 billion, he said.  Output fell 1.8 percent in the quarter to the equivalent of
535,300 barrels a day from a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Suncor rose 3.5 percent to C$34.68 at the close in Toronto,
the most since Aug. 3. The stock, which has gained 18 percent
this year, has 21 buy and three hold  ratings  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
