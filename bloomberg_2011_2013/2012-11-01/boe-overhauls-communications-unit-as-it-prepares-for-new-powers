The  Bank of England  overhauled its
communications operations in preparation for an increased
workload as it is handed unprecedented powers over bank
regulation and financial stability.  The revamp splits the unit into external and internal
communication divisions, according to the  website  of the central
bank in London. The latter, headed up by Chris Shadforth, will
also be responsible for parliamentary affairs and inquiries from
the public.  The changes come as the central bank prepares to absorb
bank oversight from the Financial Services Authority, boosting
its headcount to about 3,300. It began a search last month for a
chief operating officer who will take over day-to-day management
of the institution, freeing up the governor and deputy governors
to focus on policy.  Mark Cornelius, who ran the bank’s previous communications
and information unit, will be in charge of the new Media and
Publications division. Shadforth’s Public and Internal
Communications division will also have responsibility over
education and the Bank of England Museum. Both will report to
Executive Director for Communications Nils Blythe. The central
bank declined to comment on the changes.  Other changes at the central bank saw personnel moves at
the finance department. Jaspreet Kaur will be in charge of
Financial Reporting and Control, while Tim Porter has become
head of Projects and Risk Oversight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
