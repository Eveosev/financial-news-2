Drax Group Plc (DRX)  hired Barclays Plc,
Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to
arrange a new 400 million-pound ($645 million)  credit line  to
help convert Western Europe’s largest coal-fired power station
into one fueled by biomass.  The new loan will replace an existing 310 million-pound
revolving credit, according to an emailed statement from RBS.
The loan pays interest of 200 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Under a
revolver, money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Drax raised 190 million pounds in a share placement last
week after selling 9.99 percent of its existing share capital at
520 pence a share. The company plans to spend 650 million pounds
to 700 million pounds converting the plant and is also seeking a
100 million-pound loan to cover costs, according to the
statement.  The Selby, England-based company is changing the power
station to take advantage of higher margins on biomass fuel
compared with coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
