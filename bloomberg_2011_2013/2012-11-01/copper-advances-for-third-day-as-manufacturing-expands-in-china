Copper declined for the first time in
four days after touching the highest level in more than six
weeks as U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly shrank and a budget
standoff intensified. Aluminum, zinc and lead retreated.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.5
percent to $7,963.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $7,977 at 4:30 p.m. in Tokyo. The industrial metal
touched $8,045 yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 19.  U.S. manufacturing contracted last month amid concern about
the potential economic fallout from the so-called fiscal cliff.
Budget talks became more confrontational as  House Republicans 
rejected President  Barack Obama ’s demand for higher tax rates,
countering with a $2.2 trillion deficit-cutting plan that would
trim Medicare and Social Security.  “The U.S. manufacturing data and concern over the fiscal
cliff weighed down the metals market,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
49.5, the lowest since July 2009, from 51.7 in October. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 51.4. Fifty
marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “A sustained improvement in prices looks unlikely until
there is evidence of draws in Chinese inventories,” Barclays
Plc analysts wrote in a report today. Stockpiles in the main
Waigaoqiao bonded area in  Shanghai  have risen to 600,000 to
700,000 tons, the analysts wrote, citing warehouse executives.  The contract for March delivery fell 0.5 percent to $3.639
a pound on the Comex in New York. March futures closed 0.5
percent lower at 57,280  yuan  ($9,201) a ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
