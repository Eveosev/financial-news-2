Russia  has 15.5 million hectares
(38.3 million acres) of winter grains planted, out of 16.8
million hectares planned, said Pavel Skurikhin, president of the
Grain Producers Union.  Farmers exceeded 2011 winter grain planting by 400,000
hectares in the Southern federal district and by 370,000
hectares in the North-Caucasus federal district, he said. Winter
crops are in “good condition,” he told reporters in Moscow
today.  Temperatures are about 22 degrees Celsius (71.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the main grain growing areas in the southern
regions, about 4 to 5 degrees Celsius above normal, and there is
more rain, Roman Vilfand, director of the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center, said at a separate conference in
Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
