Asian  stocks  fell as Panasonic Corp.
led declines among Japanese electronics makers after forecasting
a loss 30 times bigger than analysts estimated, overshadowing a
report  China ’s manufacturing output expanded for the first time
in three months.  Panasonic plunged 19 percent, the most since at least 1974,
to lead a retreat on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)  Arrium Ltd.
tumbled 13 percent after a consortium that includes Noble Group
Ltd. and Posco dropped an attempt to buy the Australian
steelmaker. Sands China Ltd. climbed 2.9 percent, pacing gains
among Macau casino operators, as gaming revenue in the Chinese
city rose to a record last month.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 121.82 as
of 7:09 p.m. in  Tokyo , paring losses of as much as 0.8 percent.
The benchmark index slid 0.4 percent last month as  more than
half  the companies that reported earnings missed analyst
estimates, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  “While we’ve been seeing improving economic data, it’s too
early to get positive on the market given the profit warnings,”
said  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head of Asia equity research
at ABN Amro Private Banking, which oversees about $207 billion.
“Most indices have done quite well and investors are now
focusing on fundamentals.”  Asia’s benchmark index rose 5.2 percent as of yesterday
since Sept. 6 when European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program
and the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a week later a third
round of quantitative easing. Stocks on the gauge traded at an
average of 12.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.5 for
the  S&P 500 Index  and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  China PMI  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 declined 1.3 percent as a report
showed the nation’s manufacturing output contracted for an
eighth month and National Australia Bank Ltd. dropped for a
second day. South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.7 percent,
 Singapore ’s Straits Times Index lost 0.4 percent.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.2 percent, erasing
losses of as much as 0.6 percent, after the yen depreciated. A
weaker currency boosts earnings of Japanese exporters when
repatriated.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.8 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.7 percent. China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index rose to 50.2 in October from 49.8 in September,
the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing. That matched the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 30 economists. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today. Most U.S. stocks rose yesterday as equity markets
reopened after  Hurricane Sandy  caused a two-day closure, the
longest weather-related shutdown since 1888.  Panasonic, Sony  Gauges tracking electronics makers and raw material
producers posted the biggest declines among the  10 industry
groups  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Panasonic slumped 19 percent to 414 yen in Tokyo. Japan’s
second-biggest television maker said it may post a net loss of
765 billion yen ($9.6 billion) in the year ending March,
scrapping its May projection of 50 billion yen in net income.  Sharp (6753)  Corp. and Sony Corp. declined ahead of the release of
their results. Sharp, which widened its full-year loss forecast
to 450 billion from 250 billion yen after the Japanese market
closed, slid 1.7 percent to 169 yen.  Sony (6758) , which unexpectedly
posted a loss for the seventh straight quarter, sank 4.1 percent
to 915 yen.  United Microelectronics Corp., the world’s second-largest
contract maker of chips, slid 2.8 percent to NT$10.55 in Taipei
after posting third-quarter profit that missed estimates.  Bad Debts  Arrium tumbled 13 percent to 68.5 Australian cents. A
consortium that included Noble Group and Posco dropped a
takeover attempt after the steelmaker rejected an improved offer
of A$1.2 billion ($1.24 billion).  National Australia Bank dropped for a second day, losing 3
percent to A$25.02, after yesterday reporting full-year earnings
fell for the first time since 2009 as a weaker U.K. economy
forced it to set aside more money for bad debts.  Among stocks that advanced, Macau casino operators rose as
a report showed gaming revenue in the city climbed 3.2 percent
to 27.7 billion patacas ($3.5 billion) in October, topping a
record 26.85 billion patacas in the same month a year earlier.  Sands China climbed 2.9 percent to HK$30.  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , the casino operator founded by
billionaire Lui Che-Woo, rose 1.3 percent to HK$27. Wynn Macau
Ltd. jumped 2.7 percent to HK$22.22.  Softbank Corp., the first Japanese carrier to offer Apple
Inc.’s iPhone, gained 3.6 percent to 2,618 yen in Tokyo after
posting higher operating profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
