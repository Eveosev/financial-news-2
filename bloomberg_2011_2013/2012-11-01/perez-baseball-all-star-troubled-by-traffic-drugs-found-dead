Pascual Perez, whose  Major League
Baseball  pitching career was marked by an All-Star berth along
with drug use and a highway mishap that earned him the nickname
“I-285,” was found dead with a head wound in the Dominican
Republic, police said.  Perez, 55, was found in his home in San Gregorio de Nigua,
on the country’s southern coast, with an open wound at the base
of his skull, National Police spokesman Diego Pesqueira said in
a phone interview. No arrests have been made, he added.  Perez, who was having dialysis for liver problems three
times a week, was killed around 5 a.m. today, according to the
Santo Domingo-based newspaper  Diario Libre .  Perez was born on May 17, 1957, in San Cristobal,  Santo
Domingo . The right-hander made his major-league debut on May 7,
1980, with the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He got his nickname in 1982, his first season with the
 Atlanta Braves , after becoming lost on Interstate 285 and
running out of gas while driving to a home game.  “When I get lost, I been in Atlanta for four days,” he
said, according to Sports Illustrated. “I rent a car and get my
driving permit that morning, and I leave for the stadium very
early, but I forget where to make a turn right.”  Perez pitched for 11 seasons with the Pirates, Braves,
Montreal Expos and, for the final two years, the  New York
Yankees . He was an All-Star selection with the Braves in 1983,
when he went 15-8 with a 3.43 earned run average, and had a
 career record  of 67-68 with a 3.44 ERA.  He was arrested for cocaine possession in his home country
following the 1983 season and was suspended by MLB in 1992 after
another positive cocaine test, the  Associated Press  reported.
One of his brothers, Melido, also pitched in the major leagues
for the  Kansas City Royals , Chicago White Sox and the Yankees
from 1987 to 1995.  Perez capitalized on his driving problems in Atlanta by
filming television commercials for the fast-food chain Krystal,
in which he encouraged patrons to pick up a map, Sports
Illustrated reported in 1983.  To contact the reporters on this story:
