The Los Angeles Angels traded pitcher
Ervin Santana to the Kansas City Royals for minor-leaguer
Brandon Sisk rather than pay $13 million to keep the right-
hander on the roster next season.  Santana had a 9-13 record with a 5.16 earned run average
for the Angels last season, while allowing 39 home runs, the
most in Major League Baseball.  The Angels, who are seeking to re-sign pitcher Zack Greinke
and face a $15.5 million option on Dan Haren, also sent $1
million to the Royals to cover the cost of Santana’s contract
buyout,  MLB.com said .  “We were able to bring back a piece in Brandon Sisk to add
to our stable of pitching arms and create depth that before
today we didn’t have,” Angels General Manager Jerry Dipoto
said, according to MLB.com. “This is an opportunity for both
teams to cash in on something that they didn’t have.”  Santana, who threw a no-hitter for the Angels in 2011,
joins a starting staff that ranked 26th out of 30 MLB teams last
season with a 5.01 ERA.  The 29-year-old Santana had a 96-80 record with a 4.33 ERA
over eight seasons with the Angels.  Sisk, 27, played for the Royals’ Triple-A affiliate in
Omaha,  Nebraska , last season, going 3-2 with a 2.54 ERA and
eight saves in 50 appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
