Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened to a
three-year low after data showed exports contracted for a sixth
month, adding to concern the current-account deficit will widen
from a record.  Overseas sales  dropped 9.4 percent in September, the
longest streak of declines since 2009, after falling a revised
25 percent the previous month, the statistics bureau said in
Jakarta today. The current-account shortfall was at $6.9 billion
in the second quarter. The nation’s  trade surplus  widened to
$553 million in September, compared with a revised $233 million
in August and the $2.4 billion recorded a year earlier.  “Falling exports reduce the onshore supply of dollars,
while demand from corporates continues to be strong as the end
of the year approaches,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at
PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The  trade surplus  is
still far from recovering to levels seen last year.”  The rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 9,623 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Jakarta, after touching 9,664 earlier, the weakest level
since October 2009, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency fell for a ninth month in October,
the longest run of losses in Bloomberg data going back to 1991.
One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 5 percent.  A separate report today showed  consumer prices  gained 4.61
percent in October, the most in 13 months, compared with 4.31
percent the previous month and the 4.59 percent predicted by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.69 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 6, according to the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
