Ethanol futures fell for the first
time in five days following a government report showing
production jumped the most since April.  Prices sank after the Energy Department said  output  last
week increased 3 percent to 825,000 barrels a day, the highest
level since Sept. 14, Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 91
percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 93 percent
the previous week.  “Obviously, the report doesn’t help,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa .
“The bigger picture has to come from demand. With  Hurricane
Sandy  and the Northeast down this week, that’s not going to
happen.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 4.1 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $2.395 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest decline since Oct. 15. Futures have advanced 8.7
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged
10.5 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.565 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the additive jumped 4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.50, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago added 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.415
a gallon and in New York the biofuel climbed 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.485.  Stockpile Gain  Stockpiles of the renewable fuel swelled 2.4 percent to
19.2 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly gain since
June 15, the Energy Department reported. Imports surged to
58,000 barrels a day, up from 19,000 the previous week.  Producers need higher exports to help lift prices for the
biofuel, Blackford said.  Ethanol  exports  in August, the most recent month for which
data is available from the Energy Department, averaged 39,000
barrels a day, the lowest since November 2010.  Corn for December delivery dropped 4.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.51 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 33 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 0.33 cent to
$2.6336 a gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
