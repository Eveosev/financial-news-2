The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from default rose in Asia, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index climbed 5 basis points to 207
basis points as of 9:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark, which ranged from 203 basis points to 227.5
in October, is set for its highest close since Oct. 29,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 1 basis point to 119 as of
8:06 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge is on track for its highest close since Oct. 30
after ranging between 114.4 and 134.6 last month, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
142.5 basis points as of 11:10 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The measure fell 20 basis points in
October, its biggest decline since January, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
