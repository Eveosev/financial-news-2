Soybeans rose for a third straight
day on speculation that planting delays in South America will
boost demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter. Corn declined the most in a week.  Much of  Argentina , the largest shipper of soy-based animal
feed, has received about four times the normal rainfall during
the past two months with another storm expected Nov. 7, QT
Weather in Chicago said in a report.  China , the top soybean
consumer, may boost imports after manufacturing growth improved
last month.  “The planting delays in Argentina are a growing concern
and leading to consumers buying ahead in case the situation
continues to deteriorate,” Mark Schultz, the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview. “The Chinese economy is showing signs of
improvement and should increase soybean imports.”  Soybean futures for January delivery gained 0.7 percent to
close at $15.60 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The oilseed fell 3.3 percent in October, after rains
pared yield losses in the U.S. caused by the worst drought since
1956.  Corn futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$7.51 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest drop since Oct. 25.
Prices have retreated 12 percent since touching a record $8.49
on Aug. 10 as demand slowed from meat and fuel producers.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
