Caltex Australia Ltd. (CTX) , the nation’s
biggest oil refiner, said its Kurnell refinery in New South
Wales is operating normally after a “small” fire was quickly
extinguished.  A wooden scaffold plank caught fire this evening after it
made contact with a hot surface, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. There were no injuries and no impact on any
units or production, it said.  Kurnell is one of two plants that Caltex operates in
 Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
