Sharp Corp. (6753)  suffered a 5.3 billion
yen ($66 million) operating loss at its solar cell and module
business, even as revenue rose, on rising competition.  Net sales of solar products rose 22 percent to 51.1 billion
yen in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 from the prior
three months, the Osaka-based company said today in a statement.  The company will expand in  Japan  and shift focus to Asia
from  Europe  and the U.S., President Takashi Okuda told reporters
in Tokyo. Japan started up an incentive program for generation
of clean energy, including solar and wind, from July.  Sharp is studying its options for Recurrent Energy LLC, a
U.S. solar developer it bought in 2010 for $305 million, Okuda
said separately. Kyodo News said in September the company plans
to sell Recurrent for 25 billion yen as part of a restructuring.  Sharp sold solar cells and modules capable of producing 289
megawatts of power in the second quarter, up 15 percent from the
previous three months, according to a company presentation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
