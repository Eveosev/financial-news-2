Oil rose to a one-week high after the
Energy Department reported that crude supplies unexpectedly
declined and as equities gained on increasing optimism that U.S.
economic growth is accelerating.  Futures climbed 1 percent after  crude supplies  fell 2.05
million barrels to 373.1 million last week. A gain of 1.8
million was the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Stocks rose on better-than-expected economic reports,
including a five-month high for the Institute for Supply
Management’s factory  index .  “The crude inventory numbers were obviously bullish,”
said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group
in Chicago. “Crude is also up because the stock market is
flying on the good ISM number, improving  consumer confidence  and
the improving jobs picture.”  Crude oil for December delivery rose 85 cents to $87.09 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Oct. 22. Prices are down 12 percent this year.  Brent crude  for December settlement dropped 53 cents, or
0.5 percent, to end the session at $108.17 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the fourth
straight decline for the contract.  The European benchmark crude grade traded at a $20.92
premium to West Texas Intermediate oil in New York, down from
$22.46 yesterday.  The department released its weekly inventory report at 11
a.m. in Washington, a day later than usual because of delays
caused by  Hurricane Sandy .  Production, Inventories  U.S.  crude oil production  climbed for an eighth week to
6.67 million barrels a day, the most since January 1995, the
Energy Department reported. Imports dropped 10 percent to 7.92
million barrels a day.  Gasoline inventories  rose 935,000 barrels to 199.5 million
million, versus an expected gain of 850,000. Distillate
inventories dropped 93,000 barrels to 117.9 million, versus an
expected decline of 1.4 million.  Refineries operated at 87.7 percent of capacity last week,
the highest level since September, the report showed.  Next week’s report may show a gasoline supply decline after
Hurricane Sandy shut refineries in the U.S. Northeast.  Phillips
66 (PSX)  and  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s New Jersey refineries, which closed before
the storm struck, won’t reopen until post-storm assessments are
complete, the companies said.  Equity Rally  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 1 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 0.9 percent at 3:34 p.m.
after the Nymex floor closed.  Manufacturing expanded in October at a faster pace than
forecast as orders and output picked up. The Tempe, Arizona-
based ISM’s factory index climbed to 51.7 last month, the
highest level since May, from 51.5 in September. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 51.  Confidence among American consumers climbed in October to a
four-year high. The Conference Board’s sentiment  index  increased
to 72.2, the highest level since February 2008, from a revised
68.4 in September, figures from the New York-based private
research group showed today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey was 73.  Applications for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. fell 9,000 to
363,000, the Labor Department said today in Washington, below
the 370,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Labor Department may report tomorrow that employers
took on 125,000 workers in October, not enough to keep the
jobless rate from rising to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent,
according to the Bloomberg survey median.  U.S. Election  The jobs report, the last before the Nov. 6 presidential
election, may help sway voters trying to decide between giving
President  Barack Obama  another four years in office or changing
course with Republican challenger  Mitt Romney .  “The positive economic data is giving us a bit of a bid,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in Stamford, Connecticut. “The jobs numbers and the consumer
confidence report were both better than expected. The market is
focused on tomorrow’s monthly jobs numbers and the election next
week.”  Crude oil futures also advanced after China’s manufacturing
rebounded. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.2 in
October from 49.8 in September. The index rose for the first
time in four months, data from the Beijing-based National Bureau
of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
showed today.  Turning Corner  “Positive PMI data released this morning appears to show
that  China’s economy  is turning a corner after several months of
slowdown,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets
strategy at  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  in London.  The U.S. and China are the world’s biggest oil-consuming
countries, accounting for a combined 32 percent of world demand
in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World
Energy released in June.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 384,071
contracts as of 3:34 p.m. Volume totaled 426,060 contracts
yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.61 million, the most since Sept. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
