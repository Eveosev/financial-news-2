Japanese Financial Services Minister
Ikko Nakatsuka said the banking regulator plans to ask lenders
to avoid curtailing credit after the March expiry of a
moratorium on loan repayments by small businesses.  Nakatsuka made the comments during his opening remarks at a
meeting in  Tokyo  attended by senior officials of the Financial
Services Agency. He didnâ€™t provide any specifics.  The financial-industry watchdog has pledged to craft
measures to help smaller businesses as the appreciation of the
yen, coupled with deflation, dealt a blow to local manufacturers
and exporters.  Japan  has extended the moratorium twice over the
past three years as defaults mounted and the record earthquake
in March 2011 weakened the economy.  The law was introduced in December 2009 to stem small-
business bankruptcies by helping borrowers defer repayments to
lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
