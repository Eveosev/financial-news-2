Ukraine’s credit rating may be cut if
the government fails to unfreeze the International Monetary
Fund’s stalled lending program, said Fitch Ratings.  “Getting the IMF deal back on track would reduce
refinancing risk, boost investor confidence and so underpin
continuing market access,” said Charles Seville, the director
of Fitch Ratings’s sovereign group, today in an e-mailed
statement. Without the program, “there is a risk that reserves
continue to fall, and the hryvnia depreciates in a disorderly
fashion, which would likely trigger a downgrade.”  The Washington-based lender granted Ukraine a bailout in
July 2010 before stalling it the following March after the
government rejected demands to raise household heating tariffs.
An IMF “technical” mission is in Kiev to discuss the banking
industry. Fitch rates Ukraine at B, or five steps below
investment grade.  Ukraine’s hryvnia is under pressure as the current-account
deficit widened because of weak external demand for the
country’s products. The hryvnia, which has lost 1.41 percent
versus the dollar, strengthened today to 8.1550 as of 4:30 p.m.
in Kiev, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “Ukraine’s external financing position is precarious,”
Seville said. “The external financing requirement will grow in
2013 as repayments due to the IMF rise sharply to $6 billion.  ‘‘This probably exceeds the government’s capacity to borrow
externally and will require partial refinancing by the IMF
itself,’’ Seville said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
