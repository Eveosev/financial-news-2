The U.S. is sending about 300 Marines
and sailors based in  North Carolina  to help in  New York  and New
Jersey in the aftermath of the superstorm Sandy.  The detachment to be deployed aboard the USS Wasp “is
capable of providing generators, fuel, clean water, and a
substantial helicopter lift capacity to aid in disaster relief
efforts,” the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based at Camp
Lejeune in North Carolina, said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
