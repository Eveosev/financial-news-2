Alaska North Slope oil production
increased 11 percent in October from a month earlier as fields
in  Prudhoe Bay  ramped up production.  Output averaged 571,269 barrels a day  in October , up from
516,296 in  September , the state’s tax division said on its
website today.  “This was part of the normal ramp-up following the planned
summer maintenance season,” Dawn Patience, a spokeswoman for  BP
Plc (BP/)  spokeswoman based in Anchorage, said in an e-mail today.
“The current production levels are normal.”  October output in the North Slope was down 2.9 percent from
the year-earlier period.  Production in the area  has declined
almost every year since 1988 as flows from existing wells shrink
and aren’t replaced by new ones.  Prudhoe Bay, where companies including BP and
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  operate fields, accounted for 58 percent of total
North Slope production, up from 53 percent in the previous
month. Operators in Prudhoe increased output to 328,630 barrels
a day from 271,444 in September.  Five  BP (BP)  sites, including three at Prudhoe Bay, completed
turnarounds over the summer, Patience said.  Alaska North Slope crude was priced at $103.83 a barrel
today, $16.74 above the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
