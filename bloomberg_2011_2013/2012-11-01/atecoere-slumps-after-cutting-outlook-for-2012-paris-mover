Latecoere SA (LAT) , a French maker of
aircraft structures, dropped the most in 2 1/2 years in Paris
trading after cutting in half its target for the operating
margin and lowering its sales projection for the full year.  The  stock fell  as much as 1.23 euros, to 14 percent, to
7.52 euros in Paris trading, the most since May 2010. Latecoere
has lost almost a fifth of its value so far this year.  Latecoere said in a  statement  after the market closed
yesterday that its operating margin will be about 4 percent of
sales this year, compared with a previous prediction that was
twice as high. The company attributed the cut to a disruption in
production in Tunisia in October. It also predicted full-year
revenue growth of 9 percent this year, compared with a previous
goal of about 10 percent.  “Industrial solutions securing the schedule of deliveries
to customers were immediately implemented, generating temporary
overruns,” Latecoere said. “The production activity is
gradually resuming in Tunisia. This episode will weigh on the
operating margin of the group.”  Total revenue , excluding non-recurring items, in the third
quarter rose 13 percent to 126.4 million euros ($163.5 million),
Latecoere said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
