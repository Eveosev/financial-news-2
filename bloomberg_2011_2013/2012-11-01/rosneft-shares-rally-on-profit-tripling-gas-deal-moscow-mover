OAO Rosneft shares rallied after
profit more than tripled in the third quarter and  Russia â€™s
biggest oil producer agreed a gas supply deal with OAO Inter
RAO, a state-run power utility.  The shares gained 5.9 percent to 246.51 rubles by the close
in Moscow. The stock rose for a third day and erased an earlier
loss of 0.6 percent.  Net income increased to 181 billion rubles ($5.8 billion)
from 56 billion rubles a year earlier, the Moscow-based company
said in a regulatory filing today. The company recognized a gain
on the acquisition of gas company OOO Itera and crude prices
outpaced export taxes.  Separately, Rosneft said it agreed to start supplying as
much as 35 billion cubic meters of gas a year to Inter RAO from
2016, according to a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
