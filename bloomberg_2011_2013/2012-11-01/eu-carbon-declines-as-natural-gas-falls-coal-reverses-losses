European Union carbon permits fell to
the lowest this week as U.K. natural gas declined and coal
reversed earlier losses.  EU carbon for December dropped 2.3 percent to close at 8.05
euros ($10.41) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London .  Carbon tracks gas because utilities burning dirtier coal
need about double the allowances for each unit of power
produced. U.K. gas for the six months through September, the
summer contract, declined 0.7 percent on ICE. Coal for next year
advanced 0.3 percent after earlier dropping to its lowest in
more than two years.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
decreased 18 percent to 96 euro cents a ton. Emission Reduction
Units lost 24 percent to 68 cents a ton, as volumes rose to 4.5
million tons, the second highest ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
