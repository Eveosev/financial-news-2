Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest producer of the precious metal, reported third-quarter
earnings and sales that missed analysts’ estimates after mining
costs rose more than expected and production fell.  Profit excluding impairment charges, foreign-exchange
losses and other items was 85 cents a share, Toronto-based
Barrick said today in a statement, trailing the 99-cent average
of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined to $3.44
billion from $3.97 billion, missing the $3.65 billion average of
eight estimates. The shares fell the most in three years.  Barrick earnings have disappointed for four consecutive
quarters as it struggles to contain costs that are rising at a
faster pace than the gold price. The company, which fired Chief
Executive Officer Aaron Regent in June and replaced him with
former Chief Financial Officer Jamie Sokalsky, is in talks to
sell African mines and is reviewing other assets. Barrick today
raised its cost estimate for the multibillion-dollar Pascua-Lama
mine on the Chile-Argentina border for the second time this
year.  “It’s disappointing that they’re increasing the capex
again on Pascua-Lama just a few months after they’ve already
given us a whopping increase,”  George Topping , a Toronto-based
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said by phone today. “You
would think when you put out the first estimate you would have
made darn sure the estimates were closer to what you expected.”  Output Decline  Net income  fell 55 percent to $618 million, or 62 cents a
share, from $1.37 billion, or $1.36, a year earlier. The shares
slid 9.5 percent to C$36.56 in Toronto, the most since Feb. 24,
2009.  Third-quarter gold output declined to 1.78 million ounces,
compared with 1.93 million ounces a year earlier. Brian Yu, a
San Francisco-based analyst for Citigroup Inc., had estimated
1.95 million ounces, while Stephen Walker, a Toronto-based
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , estimated 1.97 million.  The cost to produce an ounce of gold rose to $592 an ounce
from $453. Yu estimated $552 an ounce and Walker predicted $577.  Barrick said 2012 gold production will be 7.3 million to
7.5 million ounces, compared with previous guidance of 7.3
million to 7.8 million ounces. It forecast total cash costs of
$575 to $585 an ounce, up from $550 to $575 previously.  Spending Cut  Capital expenditure at Pascua-Lama will be “closer” to $8
billion to $8.5 billion, compared with a July estimate of $7.5
billion to $8 billion, Barrick said today. First output at the
project is expected in the second half of 2014, compared with an
earlier view of mid-2014.  Barrick also said it’s cut or deferred about $1 billion of
planned spending at its mines in 2013.  Gold, which has risen for 11 straight years, averaged
$1,655.86 on the Comex in  New York  in the third quarter, 2.9
percent lower than a year earlier and 2.6 percent more than in
the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
