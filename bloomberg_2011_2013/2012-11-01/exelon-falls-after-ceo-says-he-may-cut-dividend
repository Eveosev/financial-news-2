Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S. power
company by 2011 sales, fell the most in three months after
saying it may cut its dividend for the first time to maintain an
investment grade credit rating as power prices decline.  Exelon  dropped  3.1 percent to $34.67 at 1:46 p.m. in New
York, the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 1. Exelon, formed in
2000 by the merger of Unicom and Peco Energy, has never cut its
regular cash dividend.  Investment grade credit is “fundamental” to about half of
Exelon’s business, Chief Executive Officer Chris Crane said on a
conference call today. The company’s credit is rated at the
second-lowest investment grade, BBB by Standard & Poor’s and
Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service.  “With so much of their business dependent on commodity
prices and given where those prices are, one should realize that
potential for a dividend cut exists,” Paul Patterson, a New
York-based utility analyst for Glenrock Associates LLC, said
today in a telephone interview. He doesn’t own or rate the
stock. “This is not your grandfather’s utility company.”  Exelon has paid 52.5 cents a share each quarter since
November 2008. Benchmark wholesale electricity prices in PJM
Interconnection LLC, the nation’s largest power market, have
fallen 35 percent since that time to average $41.60 a megawatt-
hour in October, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is a stressed period,” Crane said. “We don’t want
to live on the edge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
