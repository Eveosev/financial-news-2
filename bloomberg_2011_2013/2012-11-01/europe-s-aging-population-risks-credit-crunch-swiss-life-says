Europe’s aging population could lead
to a credit crunch and a repeat of the “economic malaise” seen
in  Japan , according to  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  Chief Executive
Officer Bruno Pfister.  “The combined impact of demographics and regulatory
requirements is threatening to lead Europe down the slippery
slope of the economic malaise currently affecting Japan,”
Pfister wrote in an essay published today by the Geneva
Association.  Economic growth will weaken and stock markets will decline
as the baby-boomers born in the 1950s sell off risky assets to
finance their retirement, Pfister said. That could lead to a
credit crunch, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
