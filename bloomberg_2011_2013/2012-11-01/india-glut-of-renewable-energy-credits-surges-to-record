A glut of renewable-energy credits in
 India  surged to a record in October as state electricity
utilities failed to comply with clean-energy targets.  The number of credits available for sale topped 1 million,
exceeding the number of buy bids by more than four times,
according to data from  REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt. , a trader
based in the central Indian city of Indore. The oversupply drove
the price of a credit down to 1,500 rupees ($28), the minimum
set by the country’s Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.  The government requires power distributors, steelmakers,
miners and others to buy as much as 10 percent of their
electricity every year from renewable sources. State-run
distribution companies, the main intended buyers, are failing to
meet those targets because they are cash-strapped and count on
government leniency, according to Bharat Bhushan, a New Delhi-
based analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “The inventory has grown so much that even if demand
improves, the market can keep clearing at the floor price for
the next few sessions,” said Bhushan.  Each credit represents one megawatt-hour of clean
electricity fed into the grid. Companies that can’t secure
enough renewable power locally to meet their target can opt to
buy credits sold by wind farms, hydropower and biomass plants
over the country’s two power exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
