The  New England Patriots  acquired
cornerback Aqib Talib in a trade-deadline deal with the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, adding a first-round draft pick who has one game
left on a four-game suspension for violating the  National
Football League â€™s drug policy.  Talib, 26, joins a Patriots defense that has allowed the
fifth-most passing yards in the NFL this season. The Patriots
sent a fourth-round pick in the 2013 draft to the Buccaneers for
Talib and a seventh-round selection in 2013.  Talib has spent his first five NFL seasons with Tampa Bay
after being taken with the 20th overall pick in the 2008 draft
and has totaled 18 interceptions. He received a four-game ban
from the NFL for use of Adderall, a stimulant used to treat
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
