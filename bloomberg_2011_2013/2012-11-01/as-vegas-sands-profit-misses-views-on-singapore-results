Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the casino
company controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , reported an
18 percent drop in profit, missing estimates as results from the
company’s  Singapore  casino fell short.  Net income fell to $349.8 million, or 42 cents a share,
from $424.9 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, excluding
preferred dividends, the Las Vegas-based company said yesterday
in a statement. Profit of 46 cents, excluding items, trailed the
60-cent average estimate of 23 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
The company raised its quarterly dividend 40 percent.  Las Vegas Sands cited lower casino revenue in Singapore,
the result of increased customer winnings and higher provisions
for accounts receivable. That led to a 5.1 percent drop in
adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, to $876.9 million.  Sales rose 12 percent to $2.71 billion, missing estimates
of $2.89 billion. The company opened its fourth casino in  Macau ,
the Sands Cotai Central, in April.  Las Vegas Sands rose 1 percent to $46.91 in extended
trading yesterday. The shares were little changed at $46.46 at
the close in New York and have advanced 8.7 percent this year.  The dividend increase, to 35 cents a share, takes effect in
2013, Las Vegas Sands said. The current 25-cent dividend is
payable on Dec. 28 to shareholders as of Dec. 20.  Marketing Efforts  The company is increasing its marketing efforts in
Singapore, which accounted for 30 percent of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the quarter.
Those efforts include more casino sales representatives,
aircraft to fly high-rollers, and shows, company executives said
in a conference call.  Las Vegas Sands’ shopping malls in Asia are worth $9
billion to $10 billion, Adelson said on the call. The company
will consider selling them after a footbridge in Cotai opens in
December and after approvals are obtained for an 800,000-square-
foot mall the company is building in Macau.  The 79-year-old executive said he expects the gambling tax
rate in  Madrid , where the company is considering a resort, to be
lower than Singapore’s 15 percent. That would let the company be
profitable at lower gambling volumes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
