President  Barack Obama  leads by six
percentage points in  Iowa  among likely voters while Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  has pulled closer to him in New Hampshire
and  Wisconsin , according to a poll released today.  The  NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College survey  put
Obama ahead, 50 percent to 44 percent, in Iowa. The president
had a 51 percent to 43 percent advantage two weeks earlier.  Romney has decreased Obama’s poll lead in two other states
that are among those both campaigns say will decide who wins the
White House Nov. 6.  In New Hampshire, the latest survey shows the president
leads, 49 percent to 47 percent, after being in front 51 percent
to 44 percent last month. In Wisconsin, home of Republican vice-
presidential nominee  Paul Ryan , Obama’s lead was down to three
points, 49 percent to 46 percent, after the poll showed him
ahead 51 percent to 45 percent earlier this month.  A  CNN/ORC International poll  released today gives Obama an
edge among likely voters in  Colorado , 50 percent to 48 percent.
The survey of 733 likely voters in another of the campaign’s
swing states, taken Oct. 26-31, has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points. An Oct. 23-24 NBC/Journal/Marist
poll had Obama and Romney tied at 48 percent in Colorado.  The president has been leading in polls conducted in most
of the nine states that have swung between the two major party
candidates in recent presidential votes and that have been this
year’s main battlegrounds. Several national surveys show a toss-
up in the overall popular vote.  A national  ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll  put Obama
ahead by one point, 49 percent to 48 percent, within the
survey’s margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points. The poll surveyed 1,293 likely voters from Oct. 28-31.  Women Voters  Obama’s lead in the states surveyed in the CBS News/Wall
Street Journal/Marist College poll is based on his support among
likely women voters. He leads 56 percent to 40 percent among
them in Iowa and  New Hampshire , and 55 percent to 41 percent in
Wisconsin. Romney has kept the races close because of his
support from likely men voters; he leads among them 48 percent
to 44 percent in Iowa, 53 percent to 42 percent in New
Hampshire, and 51 percent to 43 percent in Wisconsin.  Romney has been helped by improvements in his
favorable/unfavorable ratings. He’s in positive territory in New
Hampshire, 49 percent to 46 percent, and tied in Wisconsin at 47
percent. In Iowa, he is viewed unfavorably by 49 percent,
favorably by 43 percent.  Obama’s favorable ratings are 52 percent in Iowa, 50
percent in New Hampshire, and 53 percent in Wisconsin.  Handling Economy  The two candidates are tied in Iowa on the question of who
would better handle the economy, each with 45 percent, and in
Wisconsin, each with 47 percent. Romney holds an edge in New
Hampshire, 49 percent to 46 percent.  The polls were taken Oct. 28-29 of 1,142 likely voters in
Iowa with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage
points; of 1,013 likely voters in New Hampshire with an error
margin of 3.1 points; and of 1,065 likely voters in Wisconsin
with an error margin of 3 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
