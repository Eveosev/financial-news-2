OAO Novatek (NVTK) ,  Russia ’s biggest non-
state natural gas producer, dropped the most in more than three
years after it lost a key supply contract with state-run OAO
Inter RAO UES.  Novatek’s depositary receipts fell 12 percent, the most
since February 2009, to $100 by the 3:40 p.m. close in  London .
The shares slid 7.8 percent to 313.89 rubles in Moscow.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, won the 25-year
contract from Novatek to supply OAO Inter RAO UES’s power plants
with natural gas, Rosneft and Inter RAO said in statements
today.  The lost contract may wipe 12 percent from Novatek’s fair
value, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts wrote in a note today. “We
would expect a visible negative reaction in the name,” Andrei Gromadin, a Moscow-based analyst at JPMorgan, said in the note.  Novatek supplies Inter RAO with about 15 billion cubic
meters of gas a year, or about 28 percent of last year’s sales
volumes.  Novatek may be compensated for the loss of Inter RAO sales
“by exporting gas to  Germany  for example,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader with CF Global in London, said by e-mail. “$100 will
prove a good level to buy.”  Rosneft surged 8.8 percent to $8.05 in London, the highest
level in nearly three months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
