Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  is
planning to raise 209 billion yen ($2.6 billion) from the sale
of its Japanese warehouses to a real estate investment trust
that it will partly own and manage.  The company, known as GLP, will sell 30 of its 68 Japanese
logistic facilities to the real estate investment trust, the
company said in a statement today. It will also allow the J-REIT,
as they are known in  Japan , to buy an additional three
properties over the next three years, it said. The REIT will be
granted a “right of first look” over the remaining 38
properties for a period of 10 years, GLP said.  The sale will help in GLP’s strategy of “recycling capital
to fund expansion in high-growth markets and growing our strong
fund management platform,”  Jeffrey Schwartz , deputy chairman of
GLP, said in the statement to the  Singapore  exchange. “It
monetizes a considerable proportion of our portfolio and will
generate stable recurring income for the group, diversifying our
earnings base.”  An initial public offering for the property trust would be
the biggest this year in the nation after the $8.4 billion share
sale by Japan Airlines Co. A stock offering will be the largest
by a REIT in Japan since Nippon Commercial Investment Corp.
raised 121 billion yen in 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index (TSEREIT)  has climbed 27
percent this year, compared with the 2 percent gain in the
broader Topix index.  Japan, China  GLP has operations in seven locations in Japan with a
combined net asset value of $3.93 billion. It has properties in
29 cities in  China  with a net asset value of $3.65 billion as of
June 30, it said. In December last year, the company teamed up
with China Investment Corp. to buy 15 Japanese warehouses for
122.6 billion yen from  LaSalle Investment Management .  GLP raised S$3.5 billion ($2.8 billion) in October 2010 in
what was at the time Singapore’s biggest IPO since 1993. The
company reported a 57 percent increase in profit to $153 million
in its fiscal first quarter ended June, it said on Aug. 14. It
will report second quarter earnings on Nov. 14.  Shares of Global Logistic increased 3.5 percent to S$2.66
at the close of trading in Singapore, the highest since Sept. 13.
The gain added to the 52 percent advance this year, compared
with the 14 percent increase in the Singapore benchmark  Straits
Times Index. (FSSTI)   To contact the reporters on this story:
