MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  led a rally of
mortgage guarantors after the company reached a preliminary deal
with Freddie Mac to resolve a coverage dispute that threatened
to prevent the insurer from backing some loans.  MGIC jumped 16 percent to $1.99 at 10:05 a.m. in New York.
Philadelphia-based  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  climbed 15 percent after
reporting its first profit in four quarters.  Radian and MGIC have outlasted rivals such as PMI Group
Inc. and Triad Guaranty Inc. that were prohibited by regulators
from selling new coverage after capital fell short or the missed
standards imposed by Freddie Mac. Milwaukee-based MGIC will make
payments to Freddie Mac over four years under the arrangement,
which was announced yesterday, the deadline for reaching a deal
over how much coverage the insurer must provide on groups of
loans it backed for the government-sponsored mortgage firm.  MGIC is “pleased with the spirit of cooperation all
parties have again demonstrated” in reaching the preliminary
accord, Chief Executive officer Curt Culver said in a statement
late yesterday. “While there can be no guaranty the open
matters can be successfully resolved, I am hopeful we will
continue to make progress.”  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , which backs mortgages and sells
life insurance, advanced 5.4 percent.  Old Republic International
Corp. (ORI)  climbed 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
