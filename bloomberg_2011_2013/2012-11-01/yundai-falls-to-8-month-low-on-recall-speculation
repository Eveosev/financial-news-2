Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, fell to the lowest level in almost eight
months in  Seoul  trading on speculation the company may need to
recall some vehicles in the U.S.  The  company , based in Seoul, retreated 3.8 percent to
216,000 won at the close of trading on the Korea Exchange, its
lowest level since March 12. The benchmark  Kospi index  slipped
0.7 percent.  “Market rumors that Hyundai may have a big-size recall in
the U.S. are driving shares lower,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst
at NH Investment & Securities Co., said by phone today. Hyundai
Motor declined to comment in an e-mail response to questions.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said in July the South Korean company was recalling some 2007
through 2009  Santa Fe  sport-utility vehicles and some 2012 and
2013 model-year Sonata sedans for issues related to airbags.  Hyundai Motor last week reported third-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as it benefited from anti-Japan
protests in China and the i10 minicar helped the company buck
the slump in  Europe . Deliveries last month increased 14 percent
to 412,189 vehicles from a year earlier, the company said today.  -- Editors: Subramaniam Sharma, Chua Kong Ho  To contact the reporters on this story:
