Norwegian manufacturing contracted
for a fifth straight month in October amid a drop in production
as companies prepare for weaker export demand from the debt-
laden  Europe .  A  seasonally adjusted index  based on responses from
purchasing managers fell to 48.7 from a revised 49.1 in
September, Oslo-based Fokus Bank said today. The median estimate
of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an index of
49.5. A reading below 50 signals a contraction.  PMI sub-index measuring orders rose to 49.6 from 47.3 in
September. The employment index dropped to 49.1 from 50.7 and
the production measure decreased to 48.4 from 49.2. Inventories
fell to 44.1 from 46.5.  Norway ’s central bank held its benchmark rate unchanged at
1.5 percent yesterday and pushed back plans to tighten monetary
policy. Governor Oeystein Olsen said he probably won’t start
raising interest rates until March at the earliest, citing low
interest rates abroad, a strong krone and below target
inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
