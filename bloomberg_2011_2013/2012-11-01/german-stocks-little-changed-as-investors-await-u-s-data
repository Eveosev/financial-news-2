German stocks were little changed as
China’s manufacturing expanded for the first time in three
months, and investors awaited reports that may show U.S.
 consumer confidence  improved in October, while manufacturing
growth probably slowed.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  advanced 1.5 percent after
Citigroup Inc. upgraded the stock, and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  gained 1.1
percent as a gauge of European carmakers advanced. Fresenius
Medical Care AG dropped 1.4 percent as Piper Jaffray & Co.
downgraded its recommendation on the shares.  The DAX Index added less than 0.1 percent to 7,262.02 at
10:42 a.m. in Frankfurt. The equity benchmark has rallied 22
percent from this year’s low on June 5 as the  European Central
Bank  approved an unlimited bond-buying program and the U.S.
Federal Reserve started a third round of asset purchases. The
broader HDAX Index also rose less than 0.1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
