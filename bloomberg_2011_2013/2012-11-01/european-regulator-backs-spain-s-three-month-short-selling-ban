The European Securities and Markets
Authority backed  Spain ’s proposal to extend a ban on short-
selling for three months from today, citing adverse situations
that constitute a threat to financial stability.  Substantial selling pressures, serious financial, monetary
and budgetary problems and risk of further downgrades on the
Spanish sovereign all constitute a “serious threat to the
stability of the financial market in Spain,” the Paris-based
organization said in a statement on its website.  “The measure is appropriate and proportionate to address
the above-mentioned threats that persist in Spain,” ESMA said
in the  statement .  Spain’s CNMV stock market regulator extended on Oct. 19 a
short-selling ban until the end of the month and said it would
notify ESMA of its intention to prolong the prohibition for a
further three months from today. CNMV said it was taking into
account the “exceptional situation” facing the banking
industry and lifting the ban would “add uncertainty.”  Short-sellers sell borrowed shares with plans to buy them
back later at a lower price, a practice some politicians and
investors blame for roiling markets. The ban, which is effective
as of 8.30 a.m. local time and expires at midnight on Jan. 31,
can be lifted at any time if market conditions allow, the
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
