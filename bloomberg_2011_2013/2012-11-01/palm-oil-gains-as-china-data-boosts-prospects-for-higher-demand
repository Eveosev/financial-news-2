Palm oil  climbed the most in more
than a week after improved manufacturing data from China buoyed
speculation that the economy is picking up in the second-largest
buyer, lifting commodity prices.  The contract for January delivery advanced 1.6 percent to
2,537 ringgit ($831) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest gain at close since Oct. 22. Most-active
prices dropped in October for a second straight month.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 50.2 in October
from 49.8 in September, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said, matching the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 30 economists. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion. Crude oil, copper and
grain prices advanced.  “China has shown some improvement in growth finally, and
this is supportive for commodities,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst
at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from  Singapore . “Prices
have fallen in the last few days and this has enticed some
bargain-hunting activities at lower levels.”  Palm oil consumption may grow 7 percent to 8 percent per
year because of a massive shift toward diet richer in meat and
fat by consumers in countries like China and India, Sunny Verghese, chief executive officer of Olam International Ltd.
said at a conference in  Hong Kong  today.  Soybean oil for December delivery climbed as much as 1.5
percent to 50.91 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade,
and was at 50.55 cents. Soybeans for January delivery gained as
much as 1.3 percent to $15.685 a bushel, and were at $15.635.
Palm and soybean oils are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to close at
7,074  yuan  ($1,134) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.5 percent to
end at 9,118 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
