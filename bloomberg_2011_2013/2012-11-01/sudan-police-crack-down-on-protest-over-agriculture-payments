Sudanese police used tear gas and
batons to disperse hundreds of protesters yesterday in al-
Jazirah state, the countryâ€™s agricultural heartland, witnesses
said.  Security forces clashed with about 600 demonstrators
protesting against the Gezira Scheme, a vast farming project
between the Blue and White Nile, over the last two days, Mohamed
Wad Hussein, 21, said by phone today.  The protesters say the government has failed for decades to
meet a promise to pay the farmers rent in return for the share
it took of crops including wheat, sorghum and cotton since the
project started in 1925.  Police have made some arrests and contained the unrest,
according to a statement by the government of the state
published on the official SUNA news agency today. The government
blamed the unrest on the decline of some basic services during
the recent Muslim holiday, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
