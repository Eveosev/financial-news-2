Yields fell to the lowest since July
on the longest-maturity debt in the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal
market as superstorm Sandy led issuers to delay deals.  The  interest rate  on AAA tax-exempts maturing in 30 years
fell about 0.1 percentage point to 2.85 percent as of noon in
 New York , the lowest since July 31, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  States and localities plan to sell $3.7 billion in long-
term debt this week, Bloomberg data show. That’s the least since
the week ended Sept. 7, which was shortened by the Labor Day
holiday.  “The market is really trying to re-establish itself as of
yesterday and maybe more so today,” said David Manges, muni
trading manager at BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC in Pittsburgh.
“The muni market, as much as it’s a national market, is still
dependent on its personnel in the New York and New Jersey
region.”  Sandy, which struck the coast of New Jersey Oct. 29,
knocked out power to 8 million customers in the U.S. Northeast
and caused trading in U.S. equities and bonds to shut the
following day. Michigan delayed a $96 million general-obligation
sale and King County,  Washington , postponed a $39 million offer
from Oct. 29, Bloomberg data show.  The slowdown may be short-lived. Municipalities have $10.7
billion of sales scheduled in the next 30 days, the most since
Oct. 22,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
