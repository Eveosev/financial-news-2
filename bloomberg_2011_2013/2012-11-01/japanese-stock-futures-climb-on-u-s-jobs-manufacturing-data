Japanese stock futures and Australian
equities rose after reports on U.S. employment and manufacturing
topped estimates and  consumer confidence  in the world’s largest
economy climbed last month to a more than four-year high.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 1.8 percent to lead gains among companies whose earnings
are most tied to economic swings. American Depositary Receipts
of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the second-biggest maker of construction and
mining equipment, rose 1.7 percent. ADRs of  Sharp Corp. (6753)  slumped
11 percent after the TV maker forecast a record loss and said
there was “material doubt” about its survival.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,055 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,950 in
Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,050 in  Osaka , at
8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  advanced 0.3
percent today, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index retreated 0.3
percent in Wellington.  “Global indicators are starting to show an improvement in
momentum, particularly in the U.S.,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-
based head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “This can be sustained
if central banks keep supporting growth.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge yesterday gained 1.1 percent, its
biggest advance in seven weeks.  Jobs, Confidence  American companies expanded payrolls in October by the most
in eight months, the Institute for Supply Management’s U.S.
factory index topped estimates, and a measure of consumer
sentiment rose to the highest since February 2008, reports
showed yesterday.  Today’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department
will provide more information about the strength of the economy
before the presidential election. Payrolls probably increased by
125,000 workers in October and the jobless rate rose to 7.9
percent, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index climbed 7 percent this year as
central banks in the U.S., Japan and Europe boosted stimulus  to
support economic growth. The gauge traded at 13.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 Index and
12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Sharp said its  net loss  will probably widen to 450 billion
yen in the year ending March 31, the Osaka-based TV maker said
in a statement yesterday, scrapping an earlier projection for a
250 billion-yen loss. Sharp follows Panasonic Corp. in
predicting losses that exceeded analysts estimates after losing
ground to Samsung Electronics Co. in TVs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
