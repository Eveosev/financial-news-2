JIC Mining Services Ltd ., a provider
of labor to the industry in  South Africa , is considering firing
workers at all levels amid a spate of strikes in the country.  “We are contemplating terminating the services of some
employees based on operational requirements,” Andre Oldknow, a
human resources director, said by phone. The cuts would affect
workers across all skill levels and duties, he said.  JIC announced plans to dismiss 281 employees at Hernic
Ferrochrome Ltd. after a change in its service agreement and
business model, Louis Pretorius, a spokesman for the Solidarity
union, said in a statement. Pretoria-based JIC will fire 376 at
 International Ferro Metals Ltd. (IFL)  when its contract ends, he said.  “At this stage transfers are being considered as an
alternative but it is not yet clear how many employees will be
able to avoid retrenchment in this way,” the union said.  JIC employs about 7,200 people, including from South Africa
and nations such as Mozambique, Swaziland, Lesotho and  Botswana ,
according to its website. The exact number depends on contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
