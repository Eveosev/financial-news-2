U.K. stocks  climbed the most in a
month as  Lloyds (LLOY)  Banking Group Plc and  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc (BSY)  reported better-than-estimated earnings and U.S.
manufacturing expanded.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, gained 8.3
percent and BSkyB, the nation’s largest pay-television provider,
rallied 7.1 percent.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  jumped the most in more than
two years after the U.K.’s biggest fixed-line phone company kept
a full-year profit target and raised its dividend.  Croda
International Plc (CRDA)  slipped 1.3 percent as operating profit missed
analyst projections.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 79.22 points, or 1.4 percent, to
5,861.92 at the close in  London , the largest increase since Oct.
1. The equity benchmark has  rallied 11 percent from this year’s
low  on June 1 as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
pledged to do everything to protect the euro. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index climbed 1.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index added 1 percent.  “The main focus for today has been U.K. corporate
earnings,” Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital
Spreads in London, told Caroline Hyde on Bloomberg Television.
“On that front, things have been relatively good. If you look
at BSkyB, numbers are overall better than expected.”  The number of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
today was 49 percent greater than the 30-day average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volumes were lower than usual for
the first two days of this week as  Hurricane Sandy  shut U.S.
equity markets.  China Economy  China ’s manufacturing expanded for the first time in three
months in October. The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.2
from 49.8 in September, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said, matching the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 30 economists. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s  factory
index  increased to 51.7 last month from 51.5 in September,
exceeding the median estimate of 51 by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. A Labor Department report showed 363,000 Americans
 filed claims  for jobless benefits last week, down from a revised
372,000 the prior period.  The U.S. jobless rate probably increased to 7.9 percent in
October from 7.8 percent in September, a Bloomberg survey of
economists showed before the Labor Department issues the figure
tomorrow. It will be the last of the monthly employment reports
before  Barack Obama  and  Mitt Romney  face off in the Nov. 6
presidential election.  Growth Forecasts  Britain’s biggest business lobby raised its U.K. economic
forecasts for this year and the next. The economy will stagnate
in 2012 and expand 1.4 percent in 2013, the Confederation of
British Industry said in a report in London. In August, it
forecast a 0.3 percent contraction and a 1.3 percent expansion
respectively.  Lloyds advanced 8.3 percent to 43.94 pence, the largest
gain in six months, as the bank said it remains “confident” of
meeting its full-year forecast. Pretax profit increased to 840
million pounds ($1.36 billion) in the third quarter, beating the
554 million-pound median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Liberum Capital Ltd. wrote in a report that investors
should expect “strong outperformance.” Shore Capital Group
Ltd. said Lloyds is making “excellent progress” on improving
its underlying business.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  added 4.1 percent to 287.2
pence and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose 5.2 percent to 239.25 pence.  BSkyB, BT  BSkyB gained 7.1 percent to 759 pence, the largest increase
since June 2010. The company said earnings before interest,
taxes and other items advanced 5.1 percent to 310 million pounds
in the three months ended Sept. 30, beating the average estimate
of 300 million pounds by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  BT Group jumped 6.8 percent to 227 pence, the largest gain
since May 2010, after the company kept its full-year forecast
for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to increase from a year earlier. The phone company
boosted its interim dividend by 15 percent to 3 pence a share.  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , the U.K.’s largest electronics retailer,
surged 14 percent to 23.38 pence after two people familiar with
the matter said that competitor Comet will appoint insolvency
administrators as early as today.  Croda, Chemring  Croda declined 1.3 percent to 2,172 pence after posting
third-quarter profit from continuing operations of 59.7 million
pounds, missing analyst projections for 64 million pounds.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  tumbled 4 percent to 1,102 pence as Bank of
America Corp., Societe Generale SA and Macquarie Group Ltd.
lowered their  recommendations  on the shares. The U.K.’s third-
largest natural-gas producer plummeted 14 percent yesterday
after saying delays in projects in the North Sea,  Brazil  and
 Egypt  will hold back output growth next year.  Chemring Group Plc (CHG)  plummeted 17 percent to 260.6 pence, the
biggest decline in 15 years. The maker of munitions, which is
the target of a takeover approach by Carlyle Group LLP, lowered
its earnings outlook for the 12 months through October by 13
pence a share, without specifying a target figure. Five analysts
with updated estimates had been expecting per-share profit of 43
pence.  “The profit warning reduces any remaining likelihood of a
successful bid” by Carlyle, said Oliver Sleath, a London-based
analyst at Credit Suisse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
