Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
U.S. sales rose 21 percent in October, narrowing the lead of
 Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in luxury-auto deliveries this year.  Sales for BMW climbed to 26,451 vehicles last month,
boosted by a 26 percent gain for its 3-Series. Mercedes
yesterday reported a 5.9 percent increase from a year earlier to
23,978, helped by updated versions of the C-Class small sedan.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  rose 9.7 percent to 19,850.  The October results trimmed Mercedes’s lead to 2,748
vehicles, from 5,221 at the end of September. The two German
automakers are vying to be the No. 1 luxury-auto brand in the
U.S. after BMW outsold Lexus last year. Lexus, hurt in 2011 by
vehicle shortages following natural disasters in Asia, had been
the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. for 11 years.  “What is going to be interesting is what will happen for
the rest of the year,”  Jesse Toprak , vice president of market
intelligence at TrueCar.com, said in an interview. “The areas
impacted by the hurricane are significant selling regions for
the luxury-auto makers.”  Mercedes U.S. sales through October rose 12 percent to
215,596, according to the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker.
Munich-based BMW posted a 6.7 percent increase to 212,848. For
all of 2011, BMW outsold Mercedes in the U.S. by 2,715 vehicles.  The sales results don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and
Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t luxury vehicles.  The luxury sales competition normally intensifies during
the final three months of the year.  Sandy’s Impact  Superstorm Sandy hit the mid-Atlantic, which Toprak
estimates is home to as much as 25 percent of U.S. luxury
vehicle sales. The storm’s aftermath should slow sales in the
first half of this month, then boost deliveries in December as
consumers replaced totaled vehicles, he said.  “For luxury vehicles, I expect it will be a net positive
for the year because of replacement of total-loss vehicles,” he
said.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 5,154 Lincolns in October, a 15 percent
decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement yesterday
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac rose 14 percent to 13,505
vehicles in October, helped by an 11 percent gain in sales of
the SRX crossover SUV and the new ATS compact sedan, the
Detroit-based automaker said in a statement.  Sales of Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand rose 9.4
percent to 12,163 last month, the company said in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 8,757 vehicles last month,
a 28 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company said in a statement yesterday.  U.S. sales of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 15 percent
last month to 11,708, the company said in a statement.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part
of VW, sold 3,211 vehicles in the U.S. last month, a 41 percent
increase, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
