Macau casino revenue  rose 3.2 percent
to reach a record last month as promotions over the eight-day
Golden Week holiday attracted more Chinese tourists to the
world’s biggest gambling hub.  Casino revenue in the Chinese city increased to 27.7
billion patacas ($3.5 billion) in October, topping a record
26.85 billion patacas in the same month a year earlier,
according to data from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and
Coordination Bureau today.  Gambling revenue is back to an all-time high as casino
operators including  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,  Galaxy Entertainment Group
Ltd. (27)  and  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  ramp up expansion in the only place in
 China  where casinos are legal. Middle class Chinese tourists, or
the so-called mass market, have helped shore up growth even as
high-stake bettors have cut back in a weaker economy.  “The numbers are better than my expectations,” said Edwin Fan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOC International Group, who
estimated growth of less than 3 percent. “That was due to a
faster and stronger ramp-up from Sands’ latest property in
Cotai.”  Sands China opened the second phase of its latest Cotai
Central resort on Sept. 20, ten days ahead of the Golden Week
holiday.  Citigroup Inc. last month cut its estimate for revenue in
October to 27.5 billion patacas from 28 billion patacas. Sands
China, controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , jumped 2.9
percent to HK$30 at the close of Hong Kong trading, Wynn Macau
gained 2.7 percent, Galaxy rose 1.3 percent,  MGM China Holdings
Ltd. (2282)  added 1.3 percent and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  climbed 0.8
percent.  Revenue in the gambling hub  rose 12 percent to 23.9 billion
patacas in September. Gaming revenue rose 1.5 percent in July,
the slowest pace since 2009, after a typhoon and a pullback by
high rollers hurt spending in the territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
