Hilton International has decided to
close one of its partner hotels in Lebanon, leaving more than
150 people without jobs, the  Daily Star  said, citing
unidentified industry officials.  The Beirut-based newspaper said it wasn’t clear what
prompted the decision to shut down the Metropolitan Palace
Hotel, which opened in 2001.  Pierre Achkar, president of Lebanon’s Syndicate of Hotel
Owners, said on Oct. 23 that some hotels are downsizing and
laying off staff because of the precarious security situation in
Lebanon. The civil war in  Syria  is threatening to spill over
into neighboring Lebanon, with frequent clashes between Lebanese
supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
