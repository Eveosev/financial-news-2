Thailand’s government  bonds  rose,
pushing the three-year yield to a 10-month low, after
international investors boosted holdings on speculation the
central bank will lower borrowing costs. The baht fell.  The Bank of Thailand cut its 2013 growth forecast to 4.6
percent on Oct. 26 from a previous estimate of 5 percent, after
unexpectedly reducing its policy rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 2.75 percent on Oct. 17. Foreign funds
bought $1.9 billion more Thai sovereign notes than they sold in
October, while paring stock holdings by a net $582 million, data
from the Thai Bond Market Association and stock exchange show.  “The funds are flowing into Asia, and for  Thailand  capital
is going to bonds rather than stocks,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a
Bangkok-based foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “There are some investors who see a chance of more rate
cuts” after the central bank lowered its economic expansion
estimate, he said.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.86 percent as of
3:28 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the lowest level since Dec. 14, 2011. The Bank of
Thailand will next meet to review monetary policy on Nov. 28.  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 30.71 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 27
basis points to 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
