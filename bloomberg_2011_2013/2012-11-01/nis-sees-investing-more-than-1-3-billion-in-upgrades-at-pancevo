Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said
it may invest more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in
upgrades at in its main refinery in Pancevo.  The company has ploughed 547 million euros into the
facility east of Belgrade and may expand the amount by as much
as 500 million euros to improve “refining depth” and
efficiency, NIS Chief Executive Officer Kirill Kravchenko said
today. He didn’t provide a time frame for the new investment.  The upgrade will enable NIS to produce Euro-5-quality fuels
with lower sulfur content. Output capacity is at 638,000 tons of
gasoline and more than 1.5 million tons of diesel annually,
according to a statement NIS released at today’s reopening of
the Pancevo refinery following the first upgrade.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled gas
producer, bought a majority stake in NIS for 400 million euros
in 2009, with a commitment to invest at least 500 million euros.
Its plans include a $100 million upgrade of another NIS refinery
in Novi Sad which produces lubricants and base oils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
