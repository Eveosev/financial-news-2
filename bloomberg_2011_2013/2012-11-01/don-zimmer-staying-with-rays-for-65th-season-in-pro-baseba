Don Zimmer will be back with the
Tampa Bay Rays in 2013, his 65th year in professional baseball
as a player, coach or manager.  Zimmer, 81, will be a coach and adviser during spring
training and for pre-game practices at all home games in St.
Petersburg, Florida, for the Major League Baseball club. This is
his 10th year with the Rays, matching his 10-year tenure with
the  New York Yankees  during three different stints, most
recently from 1996 to 2003.  “Zim has been a valuable resource not only for our players
and coaching staff, but for our front office as well,” Rays
Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman
said in a  statement  on the team’s website.  Zimmer was the 1989 National League Manager of the Year
with the  Chicago Cubs  and has worked as a manager or coach in
the majors every year since 1971, including time with the  Boston
Red Sox  and New York Yankees. He had a 12-year major-league
playing career and also spent 10 years in the minor leagues and
in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
