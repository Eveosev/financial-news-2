Gold futures declined for the first
time in three days as the dollar’s rebound reduced demand for
the metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback gained against a basket of major currencies
after U.S. initial jobless claims fell to the lowest in three
weeks and a measure of manufacturing activity rose more than
forecast, adding to evidence that the economy is recovering. The
dollar advanced 0.6 percent last week, while gold declined 0.7
percent.  “The stronger dollar is putting pressure on gold,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “The dollar is the
winner today.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,715.50 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal reached $1,727.50, the highest since
Oct. 23. The price advanced 0.6 percent in the previous two
days.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent
to $32.248 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,573.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced 0.4
percent to $612.45 an ounce. The price climbed for the third
straight day, the longest rally in almost a month.  -- Editors: Patrick McKiernan, Thomas Galatola  To contact the reporter on this story:
