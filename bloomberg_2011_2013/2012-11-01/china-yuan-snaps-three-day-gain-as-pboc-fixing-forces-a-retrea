China ’s  yuan  snapped a three-day
advance as a lowering of the central bank’s reference rate meant
the currency had to weaken to remain within its permitted
trading range.  The People’s Bank of China’s  fixing  fell 0.02 percent to
6.3017 per dollar, 1.02 percent below yesterday’s closing level
for the currency. The yuan’s value is kept within 1 percent of
the reference rate. China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index
was 50.2 in October, suggesting manufacturing expanded for the
first time in three months, data showed today.  “China’s export growth this year doesn’t justify a rapid
yuan appreciation,” said Tommy Ong, a Hong Kong-based senior
vice president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong)
Ltd. “Yet capital continues to flow into China on an improving
growth outlook, which will continue to support the yuan.”  The yuan dropped 0.05 percent to close at 6.2405 in
 Shanghai , after strengthening 0.76 percent in October, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency touched
6.2371 on Oct. 29, the strongest level since the government
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Hong Kong Monetary Authority added HK$2.3 billion ($297
million) into the financial system today to prevent the city’s
currency from rising beyond its permitted trading range, data
showed. That’s the seventh intervention followed a combined $2.6
billion injection since Oct. 19.  Hong Kong Dollar  Funds are flowing into Hong Kong after the U.S.,  Europe  and
 Japan  introduced policies to stimulate their economies and on
optimism China’s growth is rebounding. The Hong Kong dollar was
little changed at HK$7.7501 per dollar, near the top of its
permitted trading range.  Yuan-denominated deposits in Hong Kong dropped to the
lowest level since April 2011, the HKMA announced yesterday. The
savings declined 1.2 percent in September to 545.7 billion yuan
($87.5 billion).  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.02
percent to 6.2428 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.09
percent to 6.3529, a 1.8 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  One-month implied volatility for the onshore yuan, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
