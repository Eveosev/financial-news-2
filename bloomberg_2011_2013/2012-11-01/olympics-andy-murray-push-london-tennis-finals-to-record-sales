The  London Olympics  and  Andy Murray ’s
Grand Slam breakthrough have helped push ticket sales for next
week’s season-ending  Barclays ATP World Tour Finals  to a record
level.  Eleven of the 15 sessions for the championship, to be
played Nov. 5-12 at London’s O2 Arena, have sold out. The event
is about 6,000 tickets away from selling all 262,000 seats for
the first time since moving to the British capital from Shanghai
in 2009, according to Chris Kermode, the tournament’s managing
director.  “In times of recession, we are definitely bucking the
trend,” Kermode said in an interview. “We are cautiously
optimistic we’ll be very close,” to selling out.  The tournament drew a record attendance of 256,000 in its
first year in  London , with total crowds of 250,000 in 2010 and
2011.  The London Games were held this summer in front of sellout
crowds, who saw Britain’s squad win a record 65 medals including
29 golds. Murray took the gold in the tennis tournament held at
Wimbledon, before winning his first major title at the  U.S. Open 
in September, ending a 76-year Grand Slam singles title drought
for British men.  “The whole Olympic summer of sport reignited a desire to
go and see live sports,” Kermode said. “Having Andy Murray
here as a domestic star definitely helps. It adds that extra
buzz.”  Third-ranked Murray is among the  world’s top eight singles
and doubles players  in the event, which has $5.5 million in
prize money. Switzerland’s  Roger Federer  won the singles title
last year for a record sixth time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
