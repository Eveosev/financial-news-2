Interbolsa SA  tumbled  the most on
record as the company said its brokerage unit, the biggest in
 Colombia , is facing a “temporary” funding shortage.  The stock sank 30 percent to 980 pesos at the close in
Bogota to the lowest since 2005, extending its decline this year
to  58 percent . The Bogota-based company said in a statement
today it’s working to remedy the cash squeeze and that the
brokerage is operating normally.  The brokerage “faces a temporary liquidity shortage” and
“is exploring all options within its reach to address this
situation as soon as possible,” Interbolsa said in a statement.
Investors are speculating the funding problem may be worse than
the company is indicating, said Diego Usme, an analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA.  “This raises the question of why, if the brokerage is
facing this temporary problem, the group hasn’t been able to
support them,” Usme said today in a telephone interview.  Interbolsa Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Jaramillo said
last month the company planned to expand into Chile and  Peru  to
capitalize on growth in Andean stock markets.  “We are looking to strengthen the company with a strategic
partner that can contribute to its development and expansion in
the region,” Jaramillo said in a phone interview Oct. 10.  The company didn’t respond to an e-mail and five calls
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
