Movember , a global cancer campaign
that encourages men to grow moustaches in November, has a record
number of registrations this year driven by the growth in users
of  Facebook (FB)  Inc. and Twitter Inc.  “When we started in 2003 Facebook had just launched,”
said co-founder Justin Coughlan, as the campaign starts today.
“Forms of social media such as Twitter and Facebook are
becoming more and more important to us in spreading a message.
We want to get men talking about their health.” Movember raised
79.3 million pounds ($127.8 million) in 2011 for male cancer
charities, 29 percent more than in the previous year.  Chef Jamie Oliver, U.K. radio broadcaster Chris Evans and
actor Stephen Fry are among celebrities taking part. The Qantas
Wallabies, Australia’s rugby union team, yesterday unveiled a
Boeing 737 aircraft sporting a giant moustache, according to the
team’s website. Comedian Ricky Gervais, actor Daniel Craig,
Formula one driver Jenson Button and soccer player Peter Crouch
all grew moustaches last year.  South African Anton Taylor won international man of
Movember last year, for growing a thick handlebar moustache and
upper body hair designed by two art students. The campaign,
designed to raise awareness of male cancers and increase early
detection and treatment, is themed ‘Movember and Sons’ this year
with fathers and their sons encouraged to grow moustaches
together and compete for the Moscars.  Numbers Double  “At the moment we have 140,000 registered in the U.K.,”
Coughlan said in a phone interview. “That’s double
the number at the same time last year. The signs are looking
good, we’re hoping to be bigger.”  Since 2003 the charity has spread from  Australia  to South
Africa,  Europe  and North America. About 854,000 people took part
in 2011, more than double the number in 2010, with the U.K.
topping the table for entrants and  Canada  raising the most
money, some 25 million pounds. More than 250,000 men in Britain
grew moustaches last year, helping to raise 22.3 million pounds.  In 2010 there were 10,721 deaths from prostate cancer in
the U.K., according to  Cancer Research U.K . There is a lag of
about 18 months in compiling the data, according to the
organisation. In the U.S. an estimated 241,740 new cases of
prostate cancer have been reported so far in 2012 and 28,170
deaths from the disease have been recorded, according to the
National Cancer Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
