Confidence among American consumers
climbed in October to a more than four-year high, which may help
drive bigger gains in the largest part of the economy.  The Conference Board’s sentiment  index  increased to 72.2,
the highest since February 2008, from a revised 68.4 in
September, figures from the New York-based private research
group showed today. The figure was projected to rise to 73,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The percent of respondents who say jobs are currently
plentiful rose to the highest level since September 2008,
indicating that a decline in joblessness is brightening
Americans’ moods. Lower gasoline prices and a budding housing
recovery are also contributing to the improvement in confidence.  “The lower  unemployment rate  and firming of housing prices
has made consumers feel a little bit more confident,” Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham,
 Alabama , said before the report. “Household net worth is slowly
but surely rebounding, particularly with  house prices  starting
to go up. So that may be making consumers feel a little bit more
confident about taking on bigger ticket expenditures.”  Stocks rose as reports today showed that initial claims for
 unemployment benefits  declined more than forecast last week,
companies expanded payrolls in October by the most in eight
months and manufacturing expanded more than forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1 percent to
1,426.62 at 12:21 p.m. in  New York . The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note rose to 1.72 percent from 1.69 percent late
yesterday.  Jobless Benefits  Applications for jobless  benefits  fell 9,000 to 363,000 in
the week ended Oct. 27, the fewest in three weeks, the Labor
Department reported. Economists forecast 370,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Companies added 158,000 workers to payrolls last month
after a revised 114,000 gain in September, data from Roseland,
New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed today. This is
the first ADP report derived using a larger sample and new
methodology.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index climbed
to 51.7 last month, the highest since May, from 51.5 in
September, the Tempe,  Arizona , group reported today. Economists
estimated 51 for October, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between
growth and contraction.  Less Pessimistic  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index held near a six-month
high as U.S. households became less pessimistic about the state
of the economy, a separate report showed today. The index was
minus 34.7 in the period ended Oct. 28 after improving the
previous week to minus 34.6, the highest since mid-April.  The Conference Board’s measure of  present conditions 
increased to 56.2 from 48.7 in September. The measure of
expectations for the next six months increased to 82.9 from
81.5. Estimates for the Conference Board gauge ranged from 65 to
76, according to a survey of 79 economists.  The percent of respondents in the Conference Board survey
saying jobs are plentiful climbed to 10.3 from 8.1. The
proportion of consumers who expect their incomes to rise over
the next six months climbed to 16.7 from 15.9 in September.  Housing’s recovery is brightening moods.  Home prices  rose 2
percent from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month gain since
July 2010, according to S&P/Case-Shiller data released on Oct.
30.  “More Americans are employed,  consumer confidence  has
picked up, inventory levels are healthy and affordability
remains attractive,” Scott Stowell, president and chief
executive officer of  Irvine , California-based homebuilder
Standard Pacific Corp., said on an Oct. 26 earnings
teleconference. “With that backdrop, we remain focused on our
growth strategy and are particularly pleased with the progress
we’ve made.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
