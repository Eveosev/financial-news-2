Passport Capital LLC, the $3.4
billion hedge fund founded by  John Burbank , cut by more than
half its bets on securities expected to fall, according to a
letter to investors.  Passport’s main fund reduced its short positions to about
45 percent of assets at the end of the third quarter from about
95 percent at the start of the three-month period, the San
Francisco-based firm said in the letter dated yesterday, a copy
of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Burbank said in May he’d never been as negative on global
stocks in his dozen years of running Passport. In the firm’s
third-quarter letter, signed by Burbank, he cited central bank
action, including pledges by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Francois Hollande  to protect the euro from a
possible breakup, as the main reason behind the decision to
reduce short positions in the fund.  Steve Bruce , a spokesman for Passport, declined to comment
on the letter.  Passport got rid of various short positions in the quarter,
including those in certain European securities, the firm said in
the letter.  “What we’re primarily left with now are long securities in
which we have bottom-up conviction,” Passport said, referring
to wagers that assets will rise.  Passport Global Fund rose 11 percent this year through
September in its Class A shares, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
