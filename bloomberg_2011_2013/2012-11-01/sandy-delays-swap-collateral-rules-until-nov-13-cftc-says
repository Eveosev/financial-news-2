CME Group Inc. (CME) , Intercontinental
Exchange Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. clearinghouses for
swaps will have a five-day delay to implement Dodd-Frank Act
collateral protection rules because of disruptions from
superstorm Sandy.  Brokers are focused on disaster recovery efforts and have
been unable to test their systems to comply with the new rules
intended to provide safeguards for customer funds, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a letter dated
yesterday. The rules were scheduled to take effect Nov. 8 and
have been delayed until Nov. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
