Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported third-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates after costs increased more than expected.  Net income  dropped 26 percent to $367 million, or 74 cents
a share, from $493 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier,
 Greenwood Village , Colorado-based Newmont said yesterday in a
statement. Basic earnings per share excluding costs related to
restructuring and other one-time items were 86 cents, trailing
the 89-cent average of 17  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
fell 9.6 percent to $2.48 billion.  Newmont said costs applicable to sales were $693 per ounce
of gold and $2.38 a pound of copper, compared with $622 and
$1.10 a year earlier.  Anita Soni , a Toronto-based analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG, predicted costs of $657 an ounce of gold
and copper costs of $2.14 per pound.  Newmont, led by Chief Executive Officer  Richard O’Brien , is
among gold producers seeking to curb rising costs. The average
cost per ounce of gold for large producers increased 18 percent
in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  The shares dropped 8.4 percent to $48.74 at the close in
New York, the most since March 2009.  Newmont, which has mines in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific
region and  Africa , reported on Oct. 16 production of 1.24
million ounces of gold and 35 million pounds of copper in the
third quarter. That compares with 1.31 million ounces and 58
million pounds a year earlier.  Low End  The company said yesterday it expects attributable
production will be at the low end of its forecasts of 5 million
to 5.1 million ounces of gold and 145 million to 165 million
pounds of copper in 2012.  Gold costs per ounce will be at the high end of a narrower
range of $650 to $675, and copper costs are expected to be $2.20
to $2.35 a pound, Newmont said, compared with a July 26 forecast
of $1.80 to $2.20. The company said its attributable capital
expenditure this year is still expected to be $2.7 billion to $3
billion.  “The cost inflation here is quite significant,” Pawel Rajszel, a Toronto-based analyst at Veritas Investment Research,
said yesterday in a phone interview. “And you’ve got dwindling
production and that seems to be continuing.” Rajszel recommends
selling Newmont shares.  Gold, which has risen for 11 straight years, averaged
$1,655.86 on the Comex in  New York  in the three months ended
Sept. 30, 2.9 percent lower than a year earlier.  (Newmont scheduled a conference call for 10 a.m. New York
