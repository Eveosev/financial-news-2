Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) , the integrated oil
and natural gas producer controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , said third-quarter profit rose as increased refining
activity offset production cuts.  Net income rose to C$526 million ($526.2 million), or 53
cents a share, from $C521 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a  statement  on its website
today. Adjusted for after-tax gains on the sale and exchange of
assets, per-share profit was 12 cents more than the 40-cent
average of 11  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Husky is among producers with U.S. Midwest refineries that
capture higher downstream profits when North American crudes are
discounted. Prices for U.S. crude benchmark West Texas
Intermediate averaged $92.20 a barrel during the quarter, versus
$109.42 a barrel for international-benchmark Brent.  The company’s refining margins in the U.S. rose to $24.36 a
barrel compared with $16.13 a year earlier. Husky’s higher
refinery throughput and greater margin is in line with results
from other integrated  oil companies  that have reported this
quarter,  Randy Ollenberger , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets
Ltd. in Calgary, said in a note today.  Revenue after royalties fell 9 percent to C$5.31 billion
from a year ago.  Average output declined 7.8 percent to the equivalent of
285,000 barrels of oil a day due to planned maintenance at
Husky’s operations off the coast of Newfoundland.  The Terra Nova field will start back up in the fourth
quarter, later than previously expected, Husky said today. The
field, down since June 8, was forecast to be offline for 21
weeks. Downtime at two floating facilities in the White Rose and
Terra Nova fields will reduce annual output by 16,000 barrels a
day, Asim Ghosh, Husky’s chief executive officer, said on a July
24 call.  Li owns about 70 percent of Husky, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shares rose 3.6 percent to C$28.03 at
the close in Toronto, the most since Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
