SAC Re Holdings Ltd., the reinsurance
company started by hedge-fund manager  Steven A. Cohen  this year,
hired four people to build up its property reinsurance, finance
and risk-management teams.  SAC Re hired Kathleen Reardon from ACE Tempest Re Bermuda
to serve as chief underwriting officer for property, the company
said today in a statement from Hamilton, Bermuda. Tim Duffin,
hired as a senior vice president and underwriter for the
property reinsurance group, will report to Reardon. He worked
most recently for Platinum Underwriters Bermuda Ltd., where he
was a property reinsurance underwriter.  “We are delighted to have Kathleen on board to lead our
property reinsurance team going into the January renewal
season,” said Simon Burton, chief executive officer of SAC Re.
“Her strong analytical background and deep market knowledge
will be instrumental in building our property reinsurance
business.”  Sac Re focuses on high-margin catastrophe coverage and
casualty protection. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP joins hedge
funds run by  Daniel Loeb  and  David Einhorn , which have entered
the reinsurance business to secure more permanent capital for
that isn’t subject to frequent investor withdrawals.  The company also hired Vanessa Hardy Pickering as group
controller and  Susan Smith  as a senior risk analyst, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
