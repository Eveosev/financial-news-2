To resume work after the birth of her first child, Terue Suzuki moved back to her family home on weekdays to get help with baby-care, leaving her husband in the house they shared.  “It was like a weekend marriage,” Suzuki, 45, who works at a Japanese telecommunications company, said of the arrangement started 14 years ago. “I had a satisfying job and really wanted to go back to it. In Japanese society, when a woman chooses work instead of staying at home to look after her husband, she’s called a devil wife.”  Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s government set a goal in July to boost the proportion of working women within eight years to spur an economy that’s had  two recessions  since 2007. Increasing the number of employed women may bolster gross domestic product by as much as  15 percent , according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Encouraging women in the workforce “has to be a top-down response,” said Christine Wright, head of the Japanese unit of  Hays Plc (HAS) , a London-based recruitment company. “The most important change is awareness.”  A combination of factors including limited daycare facilities, peer pressure and job inflexibility means Suzuki remains a minority in Japan, where 70 percent of women quit work with the birth of their first child, said  Nana Oishi , a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. That level compares with about a third in the U.S., according to Goldman Sachs.  Company Support  Suzuki was fortunate to have the support of her employer  and husband, and remains happily married with two children, she said. A senior manager in cloud-computing services, she said  the company let her switch departments to leave work on time. It  also offered reduced hours, though she chose to remain full time.  She moved to her parents’ place in Yokohama, about a half hour train ride southwest of  Tokyo , in 1998 after failing to find a daycare center for her son near her marital home. Her sister quit a temporary job and looked after the child for six months until an opening came up at a nursery near her parents’ house. Suzuki continued with the “weekend marriage” when her second child was born, in total for about eight years.  A Japanese newspaper nicknamed her oniyome, meaning devil wife, in an article on flexible office schedules that highlighted her determination to go back to work rather than become a housewife to care for her husband and son. The phrase was made famous in a blog whose contents were turned into an 11- episode drama titled Oniyome Nikki, translated as Diary of a Devil Wife, which aired on national television in 2005.  Child Focus  In a survey conducted in 2010 of more than 6,000 couples in  Japan ,  70 percent  of respondents said mothers should stop working when their children are small to focus on raising them, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.  The availability of childcare places, at 166 per 10,000 people, trailing the 210 in the U.K. and 365 in  Australia , has also been a deterrent for women, based on figures from recruitment consultant  Robert Walters Plc (RWA) ’s Japan unit.  While Japan topped the list of 144 countries for innovation capacity in the World Economic Forum’s latest  Global Competitiveness Report , it placed 87th for women’s participation in the labor force, the lowest ranking among Group of Seven nations except  Italy .  Unspoken Discrimination  Some women also felt they were passed up for promotion when they became pregnant, or had it delayed until they returned to work, said Lanis Yarzab, a director at Robert Walters Japan K.K. “This is a type of discrimination that is not frequently discussed in Japan,” she said.  More than half of the 700 male and female respondents in a survey by Robert Walters say the main challenge for working women is balancing their career with family. A decision to start a family will make a woman less employable, according to 77 percent of women and 72 percent of men in the  survey .  “I wanted to have kids but I kept putting it off because I wanted to gain recognition for my work,” said Yoko Ogata, an employee at a Japanese trading company, who has no children.  After she married a co-worker, colleagues told her to “be a good wife,” while others told her husband he “shouldn’t make his wife continue working,” she said.  Ogata started to be given small teams and projects to manage when she turned 36 and felt she was being recognized for her hard work. Soon after that she got pregnant.  ‘Given Responsibility’  “I wasn’t sure what to do,” she said. “I was finally being given responsibility to handle projects and by getting pregnant I worried that people would say ‘This is why we can’t use women.’”  Ogata, now 46, had a miscarriage after returning home late at night during the seventh week of pregnancy.  “My husband and mother-in-law were very angry and asked if I hadn’t had a miscarriage on purpose,” she said. Ogata said she didn’t tell co-workers about the pregnancy or miscarriage. Her husband subsequently divorced her and is remarried to another co-worker.  Japan’s government has set a goal to increase the proportion of employed women ages 25 years to 44 years to 73 percent by the year starting April 2020, compared with 66.5 percent in 2010. It also aims to boost the share of women working after the birth of their first child to 50 percent by the end of March 2016 and 55 percent by 2020, the government said in a plan released July 31.  There is plenty of scope for government-led initiatives to encourage more women in the workforce, such as expanding the capacity of daycare and nursing-care services through greater deregulation as well as better enforcement of rules regarding equal employment opportunity and pay, Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail from Tokyo.  Workforce Expansion  If Japan’s female employment rate of 60 percent rose to the 80 percent for males, there would be an extra 8.2 million employees in the  workforce  spurring growth in disposable incomes and consumption, Goldman Sachs strategists led by Matsui, a working mother with two children, wrote in the latest edition of its  Womenomics  report in October 2010.  Suzuki, who is still a working mother, says she doubts whether Japan can reach a point where the majority of women will stay with their company after the birth of their first child.  “Most mothers are still there to meet their sons after they finish school for the day,” she said. “Women are the ones who are building the expectations of their sons for how a mother acts.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Chris Cooper in Tokyo at   ccooper1@bloomberg.net ; Yuki Hagiwara in Tokyo at   yhagiwara1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Neil Denslow at   ndenslow@bloomberg.net ; Young-Sam Cho at   ycho2@bloomberg.net
