They make flip-flops and pet food. They sell miniskirts and motorcars. They mine iron ore and distribute soda. Their net worth totals $2.7 trillion, about the size of the gross domestic product of France, the fifth-biggest economy on the planet. Bloomberg Markets ’ inaugural list of the world’s richest people, in the magazine’s December 2012 issue, showcases the billionaires who pull the levers on the global economy. We took a snapshot of Bloomberg’s exclusive daily wealth ranking, the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , to identify the megarich and quantify their fortunes this year through Oct. 5. More from the December 2012 issue of  Bloomberg Markets : The ranking shows who’s on top (America
Movil SAB Chairman Emeritus Carlos Slim, with a net worth of $77.5 billion),
who’s faltering (Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, who's
down $6.8 billion since Jan. 1) and who’s just wealthy enough to make our top
200 (SAS Institute Inc. co-founder John Sall, who's worth $5.8 billion). Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, both in
the top five, are household names. Yet nobody racked up billions faster than
relatively unknown No. 3,  Amancio Ortega 
of Spain. The 76-year-old founded Inditex SA, the world’s largest clothing
retailer, which is known for its more than 1,600 trendy Zara stores. He made
more than $18 billion from the start of the year through Oct. 5 -- or
about $66 million a day. That windfall was more than enough for the Spanish
tycoon to eclipse Buffett -- who’s now No. 4, with $48.4 billion as
of Oct. 5. Ortega’s ascent coincides with an
overall rise in retail stocks. Low cotton costs, cheap credit and demand for
reasonably priced goods have driven shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Inditex
to records. Nine of the world’s 25 wealthiest people are retail moguls. Among
them are Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad, four members of the Walton family that
controls Wal-Mart and Stefan Persson, the largest shareholder in Swedish
clothing giant Hennes & Mauritz AB. Bloomberg News unmasked more than 30
hidden billionaires this year. Brazil’s Dirce Navarro de Camargo inherited her
late husband’s industrial conglomerate, Camargo Correa SA, in 1994. Elaine
Tettemer Marshall controls 15 percent of Koch Industries Inc., the second-largest
closely held company in the U.S. With fortunes of about $12 billion each, both
women remain billions shy of Gina Rinehart, the richest woman in the
Asia-Pacific region. She's squabbling with her children over the family’s $19.1
billion minerals empire. Bloomberg News also revealed  Zong Qinghou 
as mainland China’s richest man, who had a net worth of $20.1 billion on Oct.
5. The once poor soda seller today commands the Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co.
beverage empire. With soft drinks producing hard cash, wealth creation is
booming in China -- and beyond. Figures
