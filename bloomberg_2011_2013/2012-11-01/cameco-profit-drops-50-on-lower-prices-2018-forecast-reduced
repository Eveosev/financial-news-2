Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s third-
largest uranium miner, reported a 50 percent drop in third-
quarter profit, excluding one-time items, as the price of the
raw material in nuclear-reactor fuel dropped.  Profit declined to C$52 million ($52 million), or 13 cents
a share, from C$104 million, or 26 cents a share, a year
earlier, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco said today in a
statement. Net income, including items, climbed to C$82 million,
or 21 cents a share, from C$39 million, or 10 cents a share,
according to the company.  The company reduced its annual output forecast from
existing mining projects to 36 million pounds by 2018 from its
previous target of 40 million pounds, Cameco said today. Cameco
reaffirmed its  forecast  of full-year uranium production of 21.7
million pounds this year.  “Ongoing market uncertainty in the near term led us to
review and adjust our growth plans this quarter,” Chief
Executive Officer Tim Gitzel said in the statement. “We decided
to focus on advancing projects with the greatest certainty in
the near term.”  Cameco sold uranium for an average of $44.49 a pound in the
quarter, down from $47.33 a year earlier. The industry’s average
uranium spot price fell to $48.08, compared with $51.04 a year
earlier. Revenue fell to C$408 million from C$527 million, less
than the C$566.3 million average of four estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Uranium Prices Decline  Uranium spot prices have slumped since the March 11, 2011,
earthquake and tsunami led to a meltdown at Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. In response,  Japan 
suspended its fleet of nuclear  power plants .  “Excess uranium inventories in Japan from the Fukushima
disaster last year are overshadowing what I’d call the
industry’s strong fundamentals,” Rob Chang, a Toronto-based
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said by telephone before the
results were released. “A price rebound is overdue.”  Cameco was the third-largest uranium miner last year after
Kazatomprom,  Kazakhstan ’s state-owned producer, and Paris-based
 Areva SA (AREVA) , according to the  World Nuclear Association .  (Cameco scheduled a conference call to discuss the results
for tomorrow at 1 p.m.  New York  time, accessible at
866-226-1792.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
