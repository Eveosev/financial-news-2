Martha Stewart Living (MSO)  Omnimedia Inc.,
the media and merchandising company founded by Martha Stewart,
will cut publishing jobs as it focuses on the Web.  The job reduction is part of a plan to save $45 million to
$47 million annually, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Martha Stewart Living also will make its Everyday
Food magazine into an online publication and drop its Whole
Living magazine.  “We have taken decisive action to drive the company’s
return to sustainable profitability, in part by reducing our
costs for production and distribution and in part by creating
even more engagement with our audiences, and better and more
valuable opportunities for our advertisers,” Chief Executive
Officer Lisa Gersh said in the statement.  The company has posted losses and declining revenue for
four straight years, stung by a slump in advertising demand. In
addition to the print changes, Martha Stewart Living is shaking
up its broadcast division to focus more on Internet services,
including  AOL Inc. (AOL)  and Hulu LLC.  The shares climbed 2.1 percent to $2.95 at the close today
in New York. The company has lost 33 percent of its value this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
