VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  surged after saying
that it expects to keep running the .com Web domain-name
registry, allaying concern that the company would lose control
over a source of revenue.  “VeriSign expects to continue to run the .com registry,”
the Reston, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  The stock increased as much as 15 percent to $42.75 after
the announcement. It climbed to $40.94 as of 2:18 p.m. in New
York.  Government agencies had been reviewing the agreement that
gave VeriSign authority over .com domain names. The company said
it “believes” that the Department of Justice has
“substantially concluded its own review process.”  The Commerce Department’s review may extend beyond Nov. 30,
VeriSign said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
