Peru’s inflation slowed more than
expected to a 16-month low in October on declining food costs,
while remaining above the central bank’s target range.  Consumer prices  increased 3.25 percent from a year earlier
after a 3.74 percent gain in September, the national statistics
agency said in an e-mailed report today. The median estimate of
eight analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for a 3.47 percent
increase. Prices fell 0.16 percent from the previous month.  The central bank has maintained its benchmark  interest rate 
at 4.25 percent since May 2011 while it increased  reserve
requirements  Oct. 30 for the third time in three months to cool
credit demand. Policy makers target inflation at 2 percent plus
or minus 1 percent.  “The central bank is tightening monetary policy in a
preventive manner in a context of strong domestic demand,”  Hugo Perea , the chief economist at BBVA Banco Continental, said in a
phone interview from Lima before the release. “Inflation
expectations aren’t aligned with the central bank’s target.”  Food and drink prices fell 0.35 percent from the previous
month after improved domestic harvests boosted supply of some
vegetables, today’s report showed.  Economists forecast inflation of 3.3 percent this year and
2.8 percent in 2013, according to a Sept. 30 central bank
 survey . Gross domestic product rose 6.4 percent in the third
quarter after a 6.1 percent rise in the first half of the year,
Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
