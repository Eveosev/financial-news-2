James Harden , the National Basketball
Association’s reigning Sixth Man of the Year as the top player
off the bench, signed a multi-year contract extension four days
after being acquired by the  Houston Rockets .  “James Harden is the foundational-type player we have been
looking to add,” Rockets owner Leslie Alexander said yesterday
in a team release. “He is ready to make the next move up to
join the elite players in the NBA.”  The team, which got Harden in a trade with the Oklahoma
City Thunder, didn’t disclose the terms of the contract. The
five-year deal is worth $80 million, according to the  Associated
Press , which didn’t say where it got the information.  Harden, 23, averaged 12.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.5
assists in 220 regular-season games with  Oklahoma City . He was a
member of the U.S. squad that won a gold medal at the London
Olympics in August.  The Rockets also picked up the options for the 2013-14
season on the contracts of forward Marcus Morris and
forward/center Patrick Patterson.  To contact the reporter on this story’’
