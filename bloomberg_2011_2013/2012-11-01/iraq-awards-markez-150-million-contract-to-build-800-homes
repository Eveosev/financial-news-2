Markez Inc.  signed a $150 million
contract to build 800 homes in the southwestern parts of the
Iraqi capital Baghdad, company President Samer Skooti said.  The U.S.-Iraqi company will start building in the first
quarter of 2013 and the project will be completed within three
years, Skooti said in an interview in Baghdad today.  Markez won a $199 million contract in April to build 2,000
homes in the southern provinces of Thiqar and al-Muthanna.  Iraq , which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and lack
of investment. In March 2010, the government approved a plan to
build 1 million homes by 2014 for low- and middle-income
families to reduce the country’s housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
