The following is the text of the U.S.
productivity and costs report for the third quarter released by
the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a
1.9 percent annual rate during the third quarter of 2012, the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The increase in
productivity reflects increases of 3.2 percent in output and 1.3
percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent changes in this
release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the third
quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2012, productivity
increased 1.5 percent as output and hours worked rose 3.3
percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked of
all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid family
workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses decreased 0.1
percent in the third quarter of 2012, while hourly compensation
increased 1.8 percent. Unit labor costs rose 1.1 percent over
the last four quarters.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to labor productivity; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases in
output per hour tend to reduce them.  Manufacturing sector productivity declined 0.4 percent in
the third quarter of 2012, as output and hours worked decreased
0.6 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. Productivity fell 0.7
percent in the durable goods sector and 0.1 percent in the
nondurable goods sector. Over the last four quarters,
manufacturing productivity increased 1.5 percent, as output
increased 4.1 percent and hours worked rose 2.6 percent. Unit
labor costs in manufacturing rose 1.5 percent in the third
quarter of 2012 and decreased 0.8 percent from the same quarter
a year ago.  The concepts, sources, and methods used for the
manufacturing and nonfinancial corporate output series differ
from those used in the business and nonfarm business output
series; these output measures are not directly comparable. See
Technical Notes for a more detailed explanation.  Revised measures  Revised and previous measures for the second quarter of
2012 are shown in tables B and C and cover the following major
sectors: nonfarm business, business, manufacturing and
nonfinancial corporations.  In the second quarter of 2012, nonfarm business
productivity growth increased 1.9 percent, rather than 2.2
percent as reported September 5. The revised figure reflects a
downward revision to output and a slight upward revision to
hours worked. Unit labor costs increased 1.7 percent, as the
downward revision to productivity was greater than the downward
revision to hourly compensation. In the manufacturing sector,
productivity growth was revised up slightly due to a small
downward revision to hours. Unit labor costs increased 0.8
percent, the same as previously reported.  Revised second-quarter 2012 measures of productivity and
costs were announced for the nonfinancial corporate sector.
Productivity increased 1.6 percent rather than the 2.1 percent
preliminary estimate.  The revised Productivity and Costs press release for third-
quarter 2012 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, December
5, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. (EST).
