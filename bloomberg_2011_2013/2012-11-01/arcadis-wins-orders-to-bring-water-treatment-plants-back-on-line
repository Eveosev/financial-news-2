Arcadis NV (ARCAD) , the biggest Dutch
designer of bridges and dikes, won two orders to help bring back
on line water treatment facilities in New York knocked out by
superstorm Sandy, its chief executive said without elaborating.  The company, which helped improve New Orleans levees after
 Hurricane Katrina , is well-positioned to enter talks with U.S.
authorities to help on flood protection in the New York area,
CEO Neil McArthur said today on a conference call after
Amsterdam-based Arcadis reported a third-quarter profit of 23.1
million euros ($29.9 million), topping analystsâ€™ estimates.  The shares, which rose as much as 5.6 percent today, have
climbed 43 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
