OPEC will boost crude shipments to
their highest level in more than six months as demand for
heating fuels in the Northern Hemisphere picks up with the
arrival of winter, according to Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase exports by 390,000 barrels a day, or 1.6 percent, to
24.13 million a day in the four weeks to Nov. 17, compared with
a month earlier, the tanker-tracker said today in a report. It’s
the biggest rise and highest level since late April, according
to the researcher. The data exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “We’re rolling up,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder,
said by telephone from Halifax,  England . “We’re moving into the
winter season and sailings are going up. For the moment it’s all
going west, and that’s seasonal too because their refineries
come out of maintenance” before those in Asia, he said.  Sailings from the Middle East, including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will increase by 2.4 percent to 17.76 million
barrels a day in the four-week period, the report showed.  Crude on board tankers will average 487.32 million barrels,
up 3.9 percent from 468.9 million in the previous month, the
researcher said. Oil Movements calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude oil held
on board vessels as floating storage.  OPEC comprises  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The group’s next meeting is scheduled
for Dec. 12 at its headquarters in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
