Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  is poised to
report its biggest year-over-year increase in book value per
share since 2010 on gains from investments, operating-business
earnings and Chairman  Warren Buffett ’s equity-derivative bets.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, may have
climbed 15 percent to $111,546 per share on Sept. 30 from a year
earlier, according to  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc.
Cliff Gallant of KBW Inc. estimated $110,701 at the end of the
third quarter. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire is scheduled to
report earnings after the market closes tomorrow.  “This year, this quarter, the equity portfolio has done
pretty well, and that’s helped,” Gallant said in a phone
interview. Berkshire’s derivatives book may report gains in the
period and operating businesses were probably steady, he said.  Buffett, 82, highlights the metric on the first page of his
annual report and has said that it’s the  best available proxy 
for intrinsic value. The measure reflects changes in the
company’s investment portfolio, as well as earnings from
Berkshire’s more than 70 operating units that haul freight,
generate electricity and sell products from underwear to candy.  “Book value is a number you can hold on to,” said  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. who estimates the
figure advanced to $110,490 in the quarter. “It’s a reasonable-
ish depiction of what the market thinks Berkshire is worth.”  Berkshire Class A shares have risen 13 percent this year to
$129,505, compared with the 12 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Steady Rise  The book value surged 17 percent in the second quarter of
2010 from a year earlier, to $86,661. It ended that year at
$95,453 and was $99,860 at the close of 2011.  Buffett has boosted Berkshire’s book value per share from
$19 in the 1960s. Stock picks like the $1 billion of  Coca-Cola
Co. (KO)  that Berkshire bought in the 1980s have climbed more than
14-fold. Takeovers such as See’s Candies in 1972 and Geico Corp.
in 1996 have generated earnings that Buffett reinvested. The
company doesn’t pay a dividend.  Berkshire’s portfolio of U.S.-listed equities returned 3
percent in the third quarter, assuming no changes were made
since June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stakes
in San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. home
lender, and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  contributed
the most to the gain. Berkshire is the largest shareholder in
both companies.  Insurance Business  Reduced claims costs from catastrophes stand to help
Berkshire’s insurance units post better underwriting results in
the period before  Hurricane Sandy  struck the U.S. East Coast,
Barclays analysts led by Gelb said in a note last month.
Earnings at railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which Buffett
acquired in 2010 in what he called an “all-in wager” on the
U.S. economy, may improve from a year ago, the analysts said.  “We expect solid operating results at Berkshire Hathaway
to continue with strong earnings growth,” Gelb and his
colleagues wrote in an Oct. 1 note to clients.  Net income for the quarter may climb 80 percent to $4.11
billion from a year earlier, the analysts said. Stifel’s Shields
predicted net income of $3.61 billion.  Insurers are assessing damage from Sandy, which will affect
results in the current period. The storm killed at least 50
people, caused flooding, halted travel and shut U.S. financial
markets. Industry losses probably will be between $7 billion and
$15 billion, according to catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide.  Berkshire probably will record gains on its equity-
derivatives portfolio in the quarter, compared with a $2.1
billion loss in a year earlier, Shields said. The company
collected premiums upfront on the contracts, which expire
between 2018 and 2026.  Market Gains  Buffett made the bets in the last decade to speculate on
long-term gains in stock-market benchmarks such as the  S&P 500
Index (SPX)  and the FTSE 100. Berkshire’s earnings can benefit when
the indexes rise, as they did in the third quarter.  Buffett’s strategy of building book value through stock
picks and by buying whole companies has become more difficult as
the company’s size increased, Tom Lewandowski, an analyst at
Edward Jones & Co., said in a phone interview. He estimates that
book value will climb about 3 percent from the end of the second
quarter, when it was $107,377.  “It’s harder to move the needle when you’re a $180 billion
book value, $210 billion market-cap company,” said Lewandowski.
“There aren’t as many of those great investments that he can go
out and find.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
