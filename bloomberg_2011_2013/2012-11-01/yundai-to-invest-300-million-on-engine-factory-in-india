Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, plans to set up a new engine factory and other
manufacturing facilities in India to meet a growing market for
diesel vehicles.  The facilities, including a new press shop, will be at the
company’s existing manufacturing complex in Sriperumbudur near
 Chennai  in southern India, Hyundai said in a statement.  “This investment will help us meet the growing demand of
diesel vehicles in India and reduce the waiting period,”  Bo
Shin Seo , managing director for Hyundai’s Indian unit, said in
the statement. The new plants will provide 500 jobs, he said.  India’s fuel pricing policy makes diesel about 30 percent
 cheaper  than gasoline, spurring demand for vehicles running on
the less expensive fuel.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , Toyota Motor
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have all announced measures to raise
production of diesel vehicles to cater to this market.  Maruti, based in  New Delhi , has bookings for 125,000
vehicles, with diesel cars accounting for as much as 90 percent
of them, Mayank Pareek, head of sales, said last month. Sales of
diesel vehicles rose to 72,462 units in the second quarter from
50,920 a year earlier, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
