Visteon Corp. climbed the most in
more than two months after the auto-parts supplier said annual
sales will be at the high end of its forecast, exceeding
analysts’ estimates.  The shares  rose  6.6 percent to $47.01 at 10:27 a.m. in  New
York , after gaining 11 percent for the biggest intraday increase
since Aug. 13. They had fallen 12 percent this year through
yesterday.  Visteon, spun off from Ford Motor Co. in 2000, said  sales 
this year would be about $6.8 billion, after forecasting $6.6
billion to $6.8 billion on Aug. 2. The average of four estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was $6.7 billion.  The  Van Buren Township , Michigan-based company said it’s
making progress on plans to sell its climate business to  Halla
Climate Control Corp. (018880)  for cash, creating the Halla-Visteon
Climate Group. Visteon also has said it will sell its interiors
unit, seek to exit its 50 percent stake in Yanfeng Visteon
Automotive Trim Systems Co. and consider options for its
electronics business.  Chief Executive Officer Tim Leuliette was named to the post
a month ago after serving as interim chief following the August
ouster of Don Stebbins. Leuliette was among Visteon directors
who favored revamping the company, which hasn’t been able to
generate consistent profits under three previous CEOs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
