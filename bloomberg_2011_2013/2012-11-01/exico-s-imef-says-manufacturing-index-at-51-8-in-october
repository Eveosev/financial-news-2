Mexico ’s October manufacturing index
was 51.8 in non-seasonally adjusted terms, the Mexican Institute
of Finance Executives reported in an e-mailed statement today.  The non-manufacturing index was 54.27, the IMEF said. The
institute calculates the indexes with technical support from
Inegi, as Mexico’s statistics agency is known.  The manufacturing index reached 55.5 in June, its highest
since November 2006, as Mexican exports picked up on a recovery
in the U.S., the destination of 80 percent of the country’s
goods sold abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
