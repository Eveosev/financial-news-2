Vietnam ’s bonds gained for a sixth
day, the longest winning streak since August, as a decline in
money-market rates signaled banks have more funds to invest in
debt. The dong was steady.  The overnight  interbank  deposit rate fell 136 basis points
in the last two months to 2.14 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since Aug. 16. The measure was at 2.50 percent today. Fund
supply in the banking system has improved after lenders bought
60 metric tons of gold from the public since May and converted
into cash, the central bank’s Governor Nguyen Van Binh told
lawmakers in Hanoi yesterday.  “It’s more profitable and safer to invest in bonds now,
compared with investment channels like lending,” Vu Anh Duc,
the Hanoi-based deputy director of the investment department at
Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Industry & Trade, said
by telephone. “There’s some fund surplus with banks as well.”  The five-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 10.10 percent, the lowest level since Sept.
26, according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 4:12 p.m. in
 Hanoi , unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
