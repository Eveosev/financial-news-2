Honda Motor Co., the No. 2 Asian
automaker in U.S. light-vehicle sales, said it will spend $200
million on engine and transmission factories in  Ohio  and hire
200 workers there.  The expansion of Honda’s engine plant in Anna and a
transmission factory in Russells Point is part of Honda’s $1.2
billion in spending on U.S. plants the past two years, the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  North America , which accounted for 44 percent of Honda
Motor’s revenue last fiscal year, is taking on a larger role for
the Tokyo-based company. Honda’s eighth auto plant in the region
is being built in  Mexico  and, when it opens in 2014, will expand
capacity to 1.92 million units from 1.63 million.  Honda produced the first Japanese car made in America 30
years ago yesterday and was the first Japanese automaker to
build engines and transmissions in the U.S. and export U.S.-
built vehicles overseas, according to the company’s website. The
company employs more than 26,000 people in the U.S. in sales,
manufacturing and product development.  The company’s U.S. sales of light vehicles rose 22 percent
to 1.17 million this year through October. Honda’s vehicle total
is more than any other Asian automaker except  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ’s 1.73 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
