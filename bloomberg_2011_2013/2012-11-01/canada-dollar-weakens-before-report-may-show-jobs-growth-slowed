The Canadian dollar strengthened from
almost a three-month low versus its American counterpart as an
unexpected rise in a gauge of manufacturing in the U.S.,
 Canada ’s biggest trading partner, boosted appetite for risk.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained versus the majority of
its 16 most-traded peers after a private report said U.S.
companies added more workers than forecast. The loonie fell
earlier before data tomorrow forecast to show Canadian job
growth slowed and the U.S. unemployment rate increased.  “A positive for U.S. manufacturing is definitely a
positive for Canada,” Eimear Daly, a currency market analyst at
Monex Europe Ltd. in  London , said in a phone interview. “The
majority of Canadian shipments is to the U.S., and so the loonie
reacts quite strongly to U.S. data.”  The loonie appreciated 0.3 percent to 99.65 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It declined 0.2 percent earlier to
C$1.0013, trading below parity for a fourth day, after touching
C$1.0019 on Oct. 30, the weakest level since Aug. 6. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0035.  The currency strengthened beyond its 200-day moving average
of 99.94 cents to the greenback, which it breached Oct. 29, and
touched its 100-day moving average of 99.68. It has traded
weaker than its 50-day moving mark since Oct. 18.  Moving averages are levels that are seen by some traders as
turning points in the direction of a security’s price. The
average, a momentum indicator, is calculated by adding closing
prices for a specific number of assessment days, then dividing
by that number.  Erased Losses  The loonie erased losses as the company-hiring and U.S.
manufacturing reports were issued.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index 
rose to 51.7 in October from 51.5 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Economists in a Bloomberg News
survey projected a reading of 51. The dividing line between
expansion and contraction is 50.  U.S. companies added 158,000 workers in October, from a
revised 114,000 in September that was fewer than the 162,000
first estimated, a report by ADP Research Institute Roseland,
 New Jersey , showed. A Bloomberg survey forecast 131,000.  U.S. stocks gained, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index
climbing 1.1 percent. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
rose as much as 0.6 percent after data showed  China ’s
manufacturing expanded in October for the first time in three
months.  ‘Definite Bounce’  “ISM manufacturing is pointing to a risk-on tone in the
market,” said Monex’s Daly. “There’s a definite bounce off
this for a stronger Canadian dollar.”  Canada’s government  bonds  were little changed, with the
benchmark 10-year note yielding 1.79 percent. The price of the
2.75 percent security due in June 2022 declined 5 cents to
C$108.44.  Fidelity Investments , the second-largest mutual-fund
company, is shifting holdings of Canadian corporate debt to
 government securities  on concern that slowing global growth will
weigh on the nation’s economy.  Canadian corporate bonds have outperformed this year,
gaining 5.7 percent through October, compared with returns of
2.1 percent for government and 2.7 percent for provincial
securities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.
Corporate debt advanced 0.7 percent in October, the lowest
monthly gain since June.  Employment Data  The loonie earlier sank to within one cent of the weakest
level since August before jobs reports tomorrow.  Employers in Canada added 10,000 jobs last month, after an
increase of 52,100 in September, economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast before a government report tomorrow. The U.S.
 unemployment rate  rose to 7.9 percent in October, from 7.8
percent the previous month, another Bloomberg survey forecast
before the Labor Department issues the data tomorrow.  The loonie has gained 0.4 percent this year against nine
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The greenback has lost 2.3 percent, while the
yen and euro are the biggest losers, dropping 6.7 percent and
2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
