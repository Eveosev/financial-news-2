South Africa Test captain  Graeme Smith  signed a three-year contract with Surrey County Cricket
Club.  Smith, 31, immediately takes over as Surrey’s captain, the
club said in a  statement  on its website. He replaces Rory
Hamilton-Brown, who asked for his release in September following
the death of teammate and close friend Tom Maynard in June.  “Signing Graeme Smith on a three-year deal is a massive
coup for Surrey CCC,” team director  Chris Adams  said. “As well
as being one of the best captains in the modern game, he is a
phenomenal opening batsman and will lead by example from the top
of the innings.”  Smith has captained 94 of the 102 Tests he’s played for
South Africa and scored 8,314 runs at an average of 49.78. He’s
also played in 219 one-day and Twenty20 internationals.  Smith has twice led South Africa to the top of the
 International Cricket Council ’s  Test rankings , most recently
this summer following a series win over then-No. 1 England.  “I am excited about what we can achieve at Surrey going
forward and would like to state very clearly that I will balance
my new role alongside my continuing commitments to the Proteas
and I look forward to continuing to represent my country for
many years to come,” Smith said.  Smith is currently with the South Africa team in  Australia 
and will join Surrey at the end of the Proteas’ home series
against  Pakistan  in March, the English club said.  Maynard, 23, died when he was hit by a train in southwest
London. Three months later Hamilton-Brown said he was returning
to Sussex, his former team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
