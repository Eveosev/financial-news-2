Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) 
Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson said he would be
“surprised” if the Federal Trade Commission “does not
approve” its $2.6 billion acquisition by  Hertz Global Holdings
Inc. (HTZ)   “The FTC would be standing in the way of the industry
becoming more cost efficient,” Thompson said in an e-mail.
“Additionally, the transaction would make Hertz a stronger
competitor against the dominant company in the industry,
Enterprise Holdings Inc.” Hertz is No. 2 behind Enterprise.  Last month, Hertz agreed to extend the FTC’s deadline to
Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the FTC hadn’t finished reviewing
information provided by the companies, the Park Ridge, New
Jersey-based company said in a statement. The acquisition is
meeting resistance at the FTC over concern over market share,
according to people familiar with the situation.  The $87.50-a-share offer represented an 8 percent premium
to  Dollar Thrifty ’s closing price of $81 on Aug. 24. Dollar
Thrifty fell 2.5 percent to $75.07 at 2:11 p.m. in New York. The
shares have dropped below the price at which they were trading
before the Aug. 26 offer as investors have become more skeptical
of FTC approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
