U.S. options volume fell 17 percent
in October from the same month in 2011 as 324.3 million
contracts traded, the Options Industry Council said today.  About 3.36 billion contracts traded in the first ten months
of the year, the Chicago-based OIC said, a 14 percent decline
from the same period in 2011. Average daily volume for the month
was 15.4 million, down 17 percent from the previous October.  Options based on stocks and exchange-traded funds slid 17
percent in October from a year earlier, to 298 million
contracts. Equity options year-to-date volume was 3.09 billion
contracts, down 14 percent from last year.  Trading on U.S. equity markets was suspended on Oct. 29 and
30 as  Hurricane Sandy  caused the longest weather-related
shutdown since 1888.  To contact the reporter on this story:
