Stocks (SPX)  rallied, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest gain in seven weeks, oil rose
and Treasuries fell after data on U.S. employment and
manufacturing beat estimates.  The  S&P 500  jumped 1.1 percent to 1,427.59 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  for the biggest increase since Sept. 13. The Stoxx Europe
600 Index added 1.3 percent. Copper and oil advanced 1 percent.

eight months, and the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.
factory index rose to 51.7 in October from 51.5 a month earlier,
reports showed today. A Chinese purchasing manager’s index
climbed to 50.2 in October, a sign economic growth is picking up
after a seven-quarter slowdown.  Today’s data “definitely fits into the trend of some bit
of firming in the fourth quarter so far and that’s the good
news,” E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC
Wealth Management in Philadelphia, said in a phone interview.
His firm manages about $112 billion. “There is more upside in a
sense that I don’t think valuations are stretched. We don’t
think we’re going into a recession so we don’t expect earnings
are going to collapse.”  U.S. Payrolls  The U.S. jobless rate probably increased to 7.9 percent in
October from 7.8 percent in September, a Bloomberg survey of
economists showed before a Labor Department report tomorrow. It
will be the last of the monthly employment reports before  Barack Obama  and  Mitt Romney  face off in the Nov. 6 presidential
election.  The Labor Department reported jobless claims fell last
week, with applications for benefits dropping by 9,000 to
363,000, the fewest in three weeks. Economists forecast 370,000
claims, according to the median of 49 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  U.S companies added 158,000 workers in October, higher than
forecast, data from ADP Research Institute showed today. This is
the first ADP report was derived using a larger sample and new
methodology.  Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a factory index
reading of 51 for October, according to the median of 88
forecasts. The dividing line between expansion and contraction

profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Macy’s Inc. climbed 6.4
percent after raising its sales forecast.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  retreated
1.3 percent as the world’s largest drugmaker narrowed its
forecast for 2012.  Better-than-estimated results from British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc supported European
stocks. Six shares advanced for every one that declined in the
Stoxx 600.  Oil extended gains after the U.S. Energy Department said
supplies declined last week, falling 2.05 million barrels to
373.1 million. Crude in New York increased to $87.09 a barrel.  Copper rose for a third day in New York after Chinese
manufacturing returned to growth, supporting the demand outlook
in the world’s leading consumer of the metal.  The yen depreciated 0.5 percent to 80.18 per dollar. The

the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, climbed 0.2 percent to 80.06.  Treasury Volume  Treasuries fell, snapping a three-day gain.  U.S. government
