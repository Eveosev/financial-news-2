Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose as
investors pared bets on further interest rate cuts this year.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due in May 2014 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.94 percent, according to the central bank. The price
fell 0.092 centavo to 106.148 centavos per peso.  The central bank held the target lending  rate  at 4.75
percent on Oct. 26, citing eased risk of a global economic slump
and the expanding Colombian economy amid growing domestic
demand. While 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected the
rate to remain unchanged, seven projected a reduction of a
quarter-percentage point. Policy makers have cut the target rate
twice since June from 5.25 percent.  “The market usually takes three or four days to price in
expectations after the central bank’s meeting,” said Daniel
Lozano, head analyst at Serfinco brokerage in Bogota. “The
central bank’s statement was less dovish, increasing the chances
it will leave the rate on hold through the remainder of the
year.”  Colombia’s peso bonds also fell after Interbolsa SA said
its brokerage unit, the biggest in the Andean country, is facing
a “temporary” funding shortage.  “That’s creating uneasiness in the market and may have led
some of its clients to close positions” including in government
debt, said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA,
the nation’s second-biggest bank.  The peso climbed for the first time in 10 days,
strengthening 0.4 percent to 1,825.13 per  U.S. dollar , extending
its gain this year to 6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
