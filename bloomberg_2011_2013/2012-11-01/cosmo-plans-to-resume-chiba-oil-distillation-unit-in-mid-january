Cosmo Oil Co. (5007)  plans to resume
operation at the 120,000 barrel-a-day No. 2 crude distillation
unit at its Chiba refinery in mid-January.  The refiner also expects to restart the 100,000 barrel-a-
day No. 1 crude distillation unit at the refinery near Tokyo in
April, Managing Executive Officer Satoshi Miyamoto told
reporters in Tokyo today.  Cosmo Oil idled the 120,000 barrel-a-day No. 2 crude unit
on May 3 for maintenance and the 100,000 barrel-a-day No. 1
crude unit on May 7 for an electrical equipment check. Restarts
of the two units were delayed due to an investigation over an
asphalt leak in June.  “It will probably be some time in July next year to
operate the two crude units together,” said Miyamoto. “This is
because we plan to idle the No. 2 unit again for scheduled
maintenance some time in spring.”  The refiner may resume operation of a 36,000 barrel-a-day
residue desulfurization unit by the end of December ahead of the
startup of the No. 2 crude unit in January, according to two
company officials who asked not to be identified because the
information is not public.  About 72 kiloliters of asphalt spilled from a storage tank
at the　220,000 barrel-a-day refinery on June 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
