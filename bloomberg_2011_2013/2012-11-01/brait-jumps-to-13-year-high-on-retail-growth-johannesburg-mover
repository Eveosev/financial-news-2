Brait SE (BAT)  advanced to the highest
level in 13 years after the  investment company  grew first-half
net asset value 12 percent and outlined plans to expand its
retail presence in Africa.  Shares in the South African firm jumped 5.3 percent to
35.91 rand by 4:28 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking gains this year
to 82 percent. About 1.2 million shares changed hands, 2.4 times
more than the daily average over the past three months.  The group’s net asset value was boosted by a 15 percent
rise in the value of retail holding company Pepkor Ltd. which
makes up 57 percent of Brait’s assets, Chief Executive Officer
John Gnodde said by phone from  Cape Town  today. Pepkor plans to
grow its 280-strong portfolio of African stores it has outside
 South Africa  by 15 percent a year over the next three years,
Gnodde said.  The market may be re-rating the stock in line with the
broader retail sector due to the dominance of retailers in its
investment portfolio, Simon Fillmore, an analyst at Independent
Securities (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  Brait’s other largest holdings include stakes in U.K.
retailer Iceland Foods Ltd. and food group Premier Foods Ltd.  “It’s a share we hold and it’s run particularly strongly
this year with all the other retailers,” Fillmore said.  Brait trades at  10.8 times March 2013 earnings , compared
with 23 times earnings for  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC) , the country’s
second-largest clothing and homewear retailer. The  FTSE/JSE
General Retailers Index (JGENR)  trades on 16.7 times December 2012
earnings.  The stock’s 30-day historical volatility, a measure of
stock swings, increased to 30.45 from 26.91 the previous trading
day. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility
measure was at 11.19 versus 11.22 yesterday. A higher reading
means the price of an asset can move dramatically in a short
period.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
