The Brooklyn Nets’ game against the
 New York Knicks  originally set for last night has been
rescheduled for Nov. 26, the National Basketball Association
said in an e-mail.  The contest had been planned as Brooklyn’s opening game at
its new $1 billion Barclays Center. It was postponed because of
mass transit problems in the wake of  Hurricane Sandy .  The Barclays Center now will host its first regular-season
NBA game tomorrow when the Nets play the Toronto Raptors.  The Barclays Center, which seats 18,000 fans for basketball,
is next to Brooklyn’s main transportation hub, which includes
stops for subway lines and the Long Island Rail Road, both of
which have been impacted by storm damage.  Tickets for last night’s postponed game will be honored for
the rescheduled contest, Nets Chief Executive Officer Brett Yormark said yesterday in a statement.  The Knicks open their season tonight against the defending-
champion  Miami Heat  at Madison Square Garden in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
