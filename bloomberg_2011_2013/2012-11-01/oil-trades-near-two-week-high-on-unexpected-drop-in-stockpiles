Crude traded near its highest closing
price in more than a week in  New York  after the U.S., the
world’s largest oil consumer, added more jobs than forecast.  West Texas Intermediate was little changed, having fallen
as much as 1 percent, after a net 171,000 workers were added to
payrolls in October, Labor Department data showed. The median
forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an
advance of 125,000. Prices fell earlier as Phillips 66 and  Hess
Corp. (HES) ’s New Jersey refineries remained shut four days after
 Hurricane Sandy  struck the East coast.  “The worst is over for the U.S.,” said Thina Saltvedt, an
analyst at Nordea Bank AB who forecasts  Brent crude  will average
$109 this quarter. “It is the most important oil consumer and
although it took a very long time we’re seeing the U.S. heading
economy slowly heading up.”  WTI for December delivery was at $86.70 a barrel, 39 cents
lower on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:11 p.m. London
time. It advanced 85 cents to $87.09 yesterday, the highest
close since Oct. 22.  Brent for December settlement was at $108.74 a barrel, up
57 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude grade was at a $21.80 premium to WTI.
The gap narrowed by the most in the two weeks yesterday,
shrinking $1.38 to $21.08.  Hiring in the U.S. increased more than forecast in October
as employers looked past slowing global growth and political
gridlock at home, the last jobs report before next week’s
election showed. Still, the  unemployment rate  rose to 7.9
percent as more people entered the  labor force .  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area fell to
45.4 from 46.1 in September, snapping two months of advances,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That compares with an
initial estimate of 45.3 published on Oct. 24. A reading below
50 indicates contraction.  There’s “a lot of concern in the market that you’re going
to see a dampening effect on economic activity because of the
storm, and consequently oil demand,” Soozhana Choi, the head of
Asia commodities research at Deutsche Bank AG in  Singapore , said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move Asia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
