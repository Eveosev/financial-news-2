The yield on  Taiwan ’s benchmark 10-
year bonds reached a record low after the government slashed its
economic growth forecasts. The local dollar weakened, snapping a
three-day advance.  Gross domestic product will increase 1.05 percent this year,
compared with an earlier estimate of 1.66 percent, the
statistics bureau said yesterday. The economy will expand 3.09
percent in 2013, less than a previous prediction of 3.67 percent,
it said. GDP rose 1.02 percent in the third quarter, compared
with the 1.50 percent projection in a Bloomberg survey, official
data showed yesterday.  “The cuts in growth forecasts confirmed investors’
pessimistic outlook and show Taiwan’s industries are really
struggling,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Yields will continue to go down.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was
steady at 1.128 percent as of 4:48 p.m. in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market. It reached 1.124 percent earlier. Wang
said the rate could fall to 1.1 percent by year-end.  Exports will contract 2.5 percent in 2012, compared with an
earlier forecast for a 1.7 percent decline, the statistics
bureau said. HTC Corp.,  Asia ’s second-largest smartphone maker,
forecast on Oct. 26 fourth-quarter sales that missed analysts’
estimates and predicted its narrowest ever operating margin.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.29 against
its U.S. counterpart, data from Taipei Forex Inc. showed. It
touched NT$29.20 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 22.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, dropped 11 basis points to 3.40 percent.  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent to
NT$29.19 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.390
percent today, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
