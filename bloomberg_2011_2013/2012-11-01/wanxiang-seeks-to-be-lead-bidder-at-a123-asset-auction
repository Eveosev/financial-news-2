Wanxiang America Corp. said it wants
to be the lead bidder for the assets of  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , the
bankrupt maker of electric-car batteries that received a
$249.1 million federal grant.  “Although the debtors have not yet engaged in negotiations
with Wanxiang America over the details of that proposal,
Wanxiang America is hopeful that such negotiations will commence
as soon as possible,” Edmon Morton, a Wanxiang attorney, said
in a filing today in bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , filed for bankruptcy
protection last month and said it would sell its automotive-
business assets to Milwaukee-based  Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  in a
deal valued at about $125 million.  Wanxiang, a unit of Chinese auto-parts maker Wanxiang Group
Corp., today filed an objection to the proposed sale timeline
for A123’s assets “as a protective measure in case the debtors
ultimately decide to proceed with JCI as their stalking horse
bidder,” Morton said.  Wanxiang is interested in purchasing virtually all of
A123’s assets and is willing to “provide greater
consideration,” according to court papers.  The case is In re A123 Systems Inc., 12-12859, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
