President  Dennis Lockhart  said the Fed won’t change policy in
response to  Hurricane Sandy  and the impact of the superstorm’s
destruction on U.S. growth may be temporary and modest.  “Although Katrina obviously had a devastating effect on
the local economy, it did not have a significant effect on the
national numbers overall,” Lockhart told reporters after a
speech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, referring to the hurricane
that hit  New Orleans  in 2005.  The central bank need not make a “direct, targeted”
response to the disaster because any harm to the  U.S. economy 
would be transitory, Lockhart said. “That impact is likely to
pass and therefore it is not necessarily something that monetary
policy can or should address.”  Atlantic storm Sandy may cut U.S. economic growth by $25
billion in the fourth quarter, according to Gregory Daco, a U.S.
economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington Massachusetts. He
said that could reduce the fourth quarter pace of growth to a
range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent, from the firm’s earlier
estimate of 1.6 percent.  Lockhart said “it would not surprise me if there is a
measurable fourth quarter effect” on growth from Sandy, given
the large population of the Northeast. Rebuilding after the
storm could be “a form of stimulus.”  Lockhart, a former Georgetown University professor, has led
the Atlanta Fed since 2007. The Atlanta Fed district includes
 Alabama , Florida, Georgia, and portions of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Tennessee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
