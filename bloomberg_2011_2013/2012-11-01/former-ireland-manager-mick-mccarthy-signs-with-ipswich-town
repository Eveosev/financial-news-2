Mick McCarthy, former manager of the
Republic of Ireland, joined Ipswich Town on a contract that runs
until mid-2015, the club said.  McCarthy managed  Wolverhampton Wanderers  for almost six
years before being dismissed in February.  Terry Connor  joins
Ipswich as McCarthy’s assistant after working with him at
Wolves.  Paul Jewell left Ipswich on Oct. 24. The club is bottom of
the Championship, English soccer’s second level, with seven
points from 13 games.  “It’s a fantastic football club with a proud tradition and
history and a terrific fanbase,” McCarthy told the team’s
website. “While the long-term ambition is to take the club back
into the Premier League, it’s clear that the first priority is
to get some confidence back into the team and start climbing the
table.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
