(Corrects to remove reference to BOJ possibly easing
monetary policy tomorrow in second paragraph.)  The dollar gained against the yen and
euro as U.S. initial jobless claims declined to the fewest in
three weeks and a measure of manufacturing activity rose more
than forecast, adding to evidence the economy is recovering.  The pound climbed to the highest level in two weeks versus
the dollar as a report showed U.K. house prices rebounded in
October and Britain’s biggest business lobby raised its economic
forecasts for this year and next. The Japanese currency earlier
weakened for a third day against the euro before the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  releases tomorrow the minutes of the central bank’s  Oct.
4-5 meeting .  “Better data means the  Federal Reserve  isn’t going to buy
forever,” Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Plc
in New York, said of the central bank’s asset-purchasing efforts
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch Money” with
Sara Eisen. “That is how the dollar can outperform lower-
yielding currencies like the yen.”  The dollar gained 0.4 percent to 80.12 yen per dollar at 5
p.m. in New York. It gained 0.1 percent to $1.2943 per euro. The
yen declined 0.3 percent to 103.71 per euro.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, climbed 0.1 percent to 80.022.  Peso, Kiwi  The  Mexican peso  gained against all of its 16 most-traded
peers on the U.S. employment report, which boosted the outlook
for  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy.  The currency appreciated 0.7 percent, the first increase in
four days, to 13.0067 per dollar. It earlier touched 13.1289 per
dollar, the weakest intraday level since Sept. 6.  New Zealand ’s dollar appreciated versus all its major
counterparts except the peso after  China ’s  manufacturing 
expanded for the first time in three months as output and new
orders climbed, adding to signs growth in the economy is
rebounding. China is New Zealand’s second-biggest trade partner.  The so-called kiwi increased 0.6 percent to 82.70 U.S.
cents after climbing to 82.80, its highest level since Oct. 2.
The currency rose 1 percent to 66.26 yen.  The Swedish krona slumped after a survey indicated that a
contraction in the nation’s manufacturing worsened last month as
exporters struggle to stay competitive against the fallout of
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  The currency fell 0.2 percent to 6.6498 per dollar. It
decreased 0.1 percent to 8.6079 against the euro.  ‘Growing Jobs’  Applications for jobless benefits fell 9,000 to 363,000 in
the week ended Oct. 27, the fewest in three weeks, the Labor
Department reported today in  Washington . Economists forecast
370,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  A separate report showed companies expanded payrolls in
October by the most in eight months. The 158,000 increase
following a revised 114,000 gain in September, data from the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed.  “What we have today is confirmation that we’re at least
growing jobs at trend or a notch above,” Dan Dorrow, head of
research in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Faros Trading LLC, said in
a telephone interview. “Given that, today’s currency moves are
consistent with putting a floor under the risk selloff we’ve
seen in the last week or so.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
rose to 51.7 in October from 51.5 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected a reading of 51, according to the median of 88
forecasts. The dividing line between expansion and contraction
is 50.  ‘Firmer Dollar’  “The bias is toward a slightly firmer dollar,” said
 Steven Barrow , head of group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc
in  London . “Growth concerns are first and foremost, more so in
the  euro zone , and that’s not withstanding we’re trying to work
out how much the storm will cost GDP data in the U.S.”  Hurricane Sandy , which battered the East Coast for three
days ending yesterday, caused as much as $50 billion in economic
damage, with about $10 billion to $20 billion of insured losses,
more than double previous estimates, said Eqecat Inc., a
provider of catastrophic risk models.  The Fed announced Sept. 13 a third round of its
quantitative-easing program, this time making open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month, as it seeks
to boost economic growth and reduce unemployment. It earlier
spent $2.3 trillion in two rounds of bond purchases and, in
June, expanded by $267 billion a program to replace short-term
bonds with longer-term debt.  Policy makers said they will keep pumping money into the
economy until there was “ongoing, sustained improvement” in
the labor market.  Sterling Gains  The BOJ increased its asset-purchase program on Oct. 30 by
11 trillion yen ($137 billion) to 66 trillion yen to bolster
growth through lower borrowing costs. In the previous meeting
earlier that month, the central bank avoided adding to stimulus.  Britain’s currency strengthened against the euro as the
cost of a home increased 0.6 percent from September, when it
fell 0.4 percent, the  Nationwide Building Society  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The economy will stagnate this year and expand 1.4 percent
in 2013, the  Confederation of British Industry  said in a report
published in London today. In August, it predicted a 0.3 percent
contraction and a 1.3 percent expansion respectively.  Sterling was little changed at $1.6130 after touching
$1.6175, the highest since Oct. 17. It gained 0.1 percent to
80.24 pence per euro.  The pound has risen 2.3 percent in the past year, the
third-most out of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro posted the
biggest drop in the period, falling 5.6 percent, and the yen
lost 1.6 percent. The dollar gained 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
