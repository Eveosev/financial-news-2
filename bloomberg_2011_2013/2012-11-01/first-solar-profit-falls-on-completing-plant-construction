First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s biggest
thin-film solar manufacturer, said profit fell in the third
quarter as it completed or slowed construction on some solar
farms it’s building.  Net income was $87.9 million, or $1 a share, compared with
$196.5 million, or $2.25, a year earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based company said today in a statement. The company was
expected to earn 87 cents, the average of 15 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell to $839.1 million from $1
billion.  First Solar Chairman  Mike Ahearn  a year ago ousted Chief
Executive Officer Rob Gillette and began a restructuring that
shifted the company’s focus to building  power plants  with its
panels instead of competing with money-losing Chinese
manufacturers in an over-supplied market. In the first quarter,
First Solar’s revenue from developing power plants exceeded for
the first time panel sales.  First Solar lowered its 2012 sales forecast to $3.5 billion
to $3.8 billion, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and raised
the low end of its profit forecast to $4.40 an adjusted share to
$4.70 a share, from $4.20 to $4.70 a share, excluding
restructuring charges.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Hughes, hired in May, is
seeking to expand in new countries. The government of Dubai
selected the company this month to build the country’s first
solar farm, a 13-megawatt project that’s expected to be the
initial phase of a $3.3 billion initiative. First Solar is
seeking to supply 20 percent of  India ’s panel market and agreed
in June to build Australia’s two biggest photovoltaic projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
