A gas tanker exploded at a busy
intersection in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh today after
hitting a bridge, killing 21 people and injuring 126 others, the
official Saudi Press Agency said.  Gas leaked from the tanker for a distance of 300 meters
(yards) and caused a huge fire in the area, the agency said,
citing Saad al-Tuweijri, head of the civil defense corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
