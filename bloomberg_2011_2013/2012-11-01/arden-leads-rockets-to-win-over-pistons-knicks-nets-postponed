James Harden  had 37 points and 12
assists in his first game with the  Houston Rockets , who rallied
to a 105-96 victory over the  Detroit Pistons  in their National
Basketball Association season opener.  “I just wanted to get out there and play,” said Harden
who signed a five-year, $80 million contract extension
yesterday, according to the  Associated Press . “All the talking
and all the craziness that has been happening this last week --I
just wanted to go out there and play basketball.”  Elsewhere, it was the  Indiana Pacers  90, Toronto Raptors
88; Philadelphia 76ers 84, Denver Nuggets 75; Chicago Bulls 93,
Sacramento Kings 87; San Antonio Spurs 99, New Orleans Hornets
95; Utah Jazz 113, Dallas Mavericks 94; Golden State Warriors
87, Phoenix Suns 85; Portland Trail Blazers 116, Los Angeles
Lakers 106; and Los Angeles Clippers 101, Memphis Grizzlies 92.  The Brooklyn Nets opener against the  New York  Knicks at the
Barclays Center tonight was postponed because of storm damage.  The  Miami Heat  are favored to win back-to-back NBA titles,
with a successful $100 bet returning $225, according to
Pregame.com. The Lakers, who have started the season 0-2, are
second followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder, last season’s
runner-up. A winning $100 bet on the Knicks would return $4,000
or $5,000 for the Nets.  Harden, traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder on Oct. 27, and
Carlos Delfino, who scored 15 points, gave the Rockets control
of the game to overcome an 83-72 deficit in the fourth quarter
at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit.  Jeremy Lin, who rose to stardom last season after taking
over as the starting point guard for the Knicks, scored 12
points for the Rockets.  Harden, the NBA’a reigning Sixth Man of the Year as the top
player off the bench, was in the starting lineup last night.
During three seasons with the Thunder, he started seven games.  “I just tried to score and create opportunities,” Harden
told reporters. “Carlos Delfino came in hot. A lot of different
guys stepped up, and I think that’s how it’s going to be
throughout this entire season.”  Brandon Knight  led the Pistons with 15 points and Greg Monroe added 14.  To contact the reporter on this story’’
