Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus luxury
brand will introduce its December to Remember U.S. sales
promotion early for 2012, according to a Nov. 1 e-mail to
dealers that was confirmed by the company.  “The national sales event will break about mid-November,”
Tim Morrison, vice president of U.S. Lexus sales, said today on
a conference call. “Dealers have begun gearing up for that.”  The U.S. sales goal for Lexus this year is 240,000
vehicles, Morrison said today. The brand, which puts giant red
bows on vehicles in ads for its year-end promotion, has sold
190,840 cars and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. through
October, up 24 percent from a year earlier. Lexus sales last
month rose 9.7 percent to 19,850.  “If history repeats itself, we should be in a good
position to reach that,” he said.  Lexus was the top-selling luxury auto brand in the U.S. for
11 years until it was unseated last year by Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG’s namesake brand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
