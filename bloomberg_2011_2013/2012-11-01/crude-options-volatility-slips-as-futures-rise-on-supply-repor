Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures rose for the fifth time in six days to the highest level
since Oct. 22.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.49 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 3:30 p.m., down from 29.99 percent
yesterday.  December-delivery crude oil rose 85 cents to $87.09 a
barrel on the Nymex after the Energy Department reported
supplies declined unexpectedly last week. Prices fell 6.5
percent last month.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $80 puts, which slid 14 cents to 21 cents on volume of
2,061 lots at 3:33 p.m. December $82 puts were the second-most
active, with 1,387 lots exchanged as they declined 27 cents to
38 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of the 25,123 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets made up 56 percent of
the 87,195 contracts traded.  December $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 11,652 contracts. They fell 15 cents to 35 cents
a barrel. December $85 puts declined 35 cents to $1.46 on volume
of 7,774 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
68,168 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 45,999 lots
and December $80 puts with 43,201. according to loading programs
