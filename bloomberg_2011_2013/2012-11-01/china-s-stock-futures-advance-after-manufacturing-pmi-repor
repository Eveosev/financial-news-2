China ’s  stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index up by the most in three weeks, after data showed
the nation’s manufacturing industry expanded for the first time
since July.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science
& Technology Co. gained at least 3 percent after the official
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 50.2 in October from 49.8 in
September. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  China Vanke
Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led a gauge of developers to
the highest level in three weeks as Shenyin & Wanguo Securities
Co. said property sales may have improved last month.  “The PMI data brought some optimism to the market and sent
signals that the economy is stabilizing,” said Dai Ming, a  fund
manager  at Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai,
which manages $190 million.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 1.7 percent to
2,104.43 at the close, posting the biggest advance since Oct. 9
and capping a 1.9 percent gain this week. The CSI 300 Index rose
1.9 percent to 2,297.88. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong gained 0.7 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index slipped 0.4 percent yesterday
after a two-day closure of U.S. markets due to  Hurricane Sandy .  Today’s PMI report from the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing matched the
median forecast of 30 economists in a Bloomberg  survey . A
separate PMI from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
indicated that manufacturing contracted at a slower pace in
October.  The data add to expectations of a pickup in the  economy 
this quarter after industrial production, exports and retail
sales accelerated in September. Growth slowed to 7.4 percent
last quarter, a three-year low.  Volumes, Volatility  “The worst is behind us already,” Joy Yang, chief  Greater
China  economist at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd. in  Hong
Kong , said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  The Shanghai gauge dropped 0.8 percent last month on
concern earnings growth will decelerate. Some 948 of the index’s
companies reported third-quarter profit with an average decline
of 1.7 percent from a year earlier,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The Shanghai index trades at 10 times estimated profit,
compared with the 17.8 average multiple since Bloomberg began
compiling the weekly  data  in 2006. Trading volumes of companies
in the index were 23 percent higher than the 30-day average.
Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 17.8, lower than this
year’s average of 17.2.  Leadership Change  Measures of material and industrial companies in the CSI
300 advanced 2.6 percent and 1.8 percent respectively today.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, jumped 3.3
percent to 17.03 yuan. BBMG Corp., a cement maker, surged by the
10 percent daily limit to 6.27 yuan. Zoomlion, China’s second-
biggest maker of construction equipment, climbed 3 percent to
8.64 yuan.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , the nation’s largest
machinery maker by market value, increased 2.3 percent to 9.19
yuan.  The ruling communist party begins a once-a-decade
leadership transition with a congress set to start Nov. 8 in
Beijing, where Vice President  Xi Jinping  will probably become
head of the party. At the annual session of the legislature in
March, Xi is likely to succeed  Hu Jintao  as president and Vice
Premier  Li Keqiang  may succeed  Wen Jiabao  as premier.  “Investors are hopeful there’s going to be more measures
to boost the economy after the leadership change,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “We
can expect more liquidity after the congress.”  Developers Advance  A  measure  of 24 property stocks in the Shanghai Composite

3.3 percent to 8.59 yuan.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the second
largest, advanced 4.4 percent to 11.60 yuan. China Merchants
Property Development Co., the third biggest, climbed 2.4 percent
