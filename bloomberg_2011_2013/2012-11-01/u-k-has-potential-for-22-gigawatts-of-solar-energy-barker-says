The U.K. has the potential for 22
gigawatts of solar installations by 2020, assuming the costs of
the technology keeps falling, said Energy Minister Greg Barker.  “We have the potential to deploy 22 gigawatts if we
continue to drive down the cost of solar,” Barker said in
response to a question in Parliament in  London  today. “We need
deployment at a rate the country can afford.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
