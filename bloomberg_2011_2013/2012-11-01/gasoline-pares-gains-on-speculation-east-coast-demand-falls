Gasoline pared gains on speculation
flooding and power outages following  Hurricane Sandy  will reduce
demand because people are unable to drive or to find fuel.  Futures narrowed an increase as terminals and two
refineries in  New Jersey  remain idled a third day after the
storm made landfall and as AAA estimated that 35 percent to 40
percent of New Jersey gas stations were operating. Total U.S.
 supplies  rose 935,000 barrels to 199.5 million, the third
consecutive increase, according to Energy Department data.  “Gasoline inventories across the country built this
week,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston. “Across the Northeast, the fact the terminals can’t
supply the service stations is going to result in people not
being able to drive. It will be demand destruction by default.”  Gasoline for November rose 0.35 cent to $2.6338 a gallon at
2:04 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The fuel surged
23 percent in the third quarter, then sank 17 percent last
month, the most of any commodity in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 materials.  Futures also pared gains as Colonial Pipeline Co., operator
of the largest products pipeline from Gulf Coast refineries to
New York Harbor, said its Line 3 from  North Carolina  to New
Jersey will return to limited operations tomorrow after shutting
Oct. 29.  Colonial Return  “Colonial is a big part of this,” said Amrita Sen, chief
oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
consultant in  London .  Futures touched $2.6726 earlier as  jobless claims  fell
9,000 to 363,000 last week, the Labor Department reported.
Companies expanded October payrolls by the most in eight months,
according to ADP Research Institute. East Coast stockpiles of
gasoline fell last week, Energy Department data show.  “There’s a little bit of a rebound on better-than-expected
economic data, the realization we still have terminals down and
concerns that imports could be slowed after the storm,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  Inventories of gasoline in the East Coast, or Padd 1, fell
202,000 barrels to 47.9 million in the week ended Oct. 26.
Gasoline blending components, which include fuel to be blended
with ethanol at terminals before heading to filling stations,
fell 216,000 barrels to 40.85 million barrels.  Increased Demand  Demand for the motor fuel increased 4.1 percent to 8.84
million barrels a day last week, and over the past four weeks
was 0.1 percent higher than a year ago.  Heating oil fell on speculation the power outages in the
Northeast will limit demand.  “The homeowner cannot run his heating oil burner without
electricity so that has impacted demand in the Northeast until
power is restored,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Prices also slipped as European gasoil weakened, reducing
the incentive to ship  diesel fuel  to the U.S. from  Europe .
November-delivery gasoil fell $13.75 to $944.25 a metric ton at
11:34 a.m. New York time on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London.  Heating oil  for December delivery declined 3.63 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $3.026 a gallon on the exchange. Prices sank 3.2
percent last month.  Distillate Supply  Distillate  inventories , which include heating oil and
diesel, fell 93,000 barrels to 117.9 million barrels, the lowest
level in 17 weeks and 17 percent below a year earlier.  Demand was little changed at 3.54 million barrels a day,
and during the past four weeks was down 13 percent from a year
ago.  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  at the
pump declined 1.4 cents to $3.507 a gallon yesterday, AAA, the
largest U.S. motoring organization, said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since July 30. Prices have fallen every
day since Oct. 10. The pump price reached a 2012 high of $3.936
on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
