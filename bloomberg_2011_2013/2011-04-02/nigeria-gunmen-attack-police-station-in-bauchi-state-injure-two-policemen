General Motors Co. (GM)  said production of
its Chevrolet Volt will increase 33 percent from earlier plans,
and the plant making the plug-in hybrid will shut down for four
weeks to prepare for the increased output.  About 16,000 Volts will be built this year and 60,000 in
2012, Detroit-based GM said today in a statement. The automaker
previously targeted output of 15,000 this year and 45,000 in
2012, Rob Peterson, a GM spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson has said GM needs to
offer more fuel-efficient vehicles as gasoline prices rise. GM
will add the Voltec gasoline-electric drive system to more
models in its fleet and needs to prepare for crude  oil prices 
that may increase to $120 a barrel, he has said.  GM said its Detroit-Hamtramck plant, located about 4 miles
north of its headquarters, will close for four weeks beginning
in June for upgrades, including new tooling, conveyers and other
equipment. The factory makes the Volt and its twin, the Opel
Ampera, which sells in Europe and  China .  The Detroit-Hamtramck plant also is preparing to make the
Chevrolet Malibu beginning next year.  GM said the factory shutdown will further restrict supplies
of the Volt in June and July. GM delivered 493 Volts in April,
bringing sales to 1,703 for the first four months of the year.  Akerson has told executives he wants GM to boost Volt
production to as much as 120,000 units in 2012, two people
familiar with the matter said in January. GM continues to look
at ways it can further increase capacity and will try to further
increase output if demand is strong, Peterson said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
