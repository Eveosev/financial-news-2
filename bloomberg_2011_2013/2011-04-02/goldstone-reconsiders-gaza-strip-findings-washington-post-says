South African judge  Richard
Goldstone , who headed a United Nations panel that reported on
 Israel ’s three-week military operation in the Gaza Strip that
ended in January 2009, wrote in the Washington Post yesterday
that he was reconsidering his findings.    “We know a lot more today about what happened in the Gaza
war of 2008-09 than we did when I chaired the fact-finding
mission appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council that produced
what has come to be known as the Goldstone Report,” he wrote.
“If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report
would have been a different document.”  He noted that Israel’s investigations of incidents
“indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a
matter of policy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
