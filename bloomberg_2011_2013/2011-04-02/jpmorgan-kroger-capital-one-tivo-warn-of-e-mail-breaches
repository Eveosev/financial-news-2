JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Kroger Co.,
 Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  and  TiVo Inc. (TIVO)  said they were
affected by a security breach that may have enabled an
unauthorized person to see some customers’ names and e-mail
addresses.  JPMorgan and Kroger yesterday disclosed the accessing of
the data, which occurred at  Epsilon , a Dallas-based provider of
e-mail marketing services. Capital One and TiVo issued
statements today. The information was gained by a person outside
Epsilon, according to separate statements.  All four companies said no personal identification
information or credit card details were compromised. JPMorgan,
Kroger, Capital One and TiVo all said they are investigating the
incidents.  Jessica Simon, a spokeswoman for Epsilon, declined to say
how many more companies might be affected, citing a continuing
investigation. She said she didn’t have details on which law
enforcement agencies might be involved in the probe.  Epsilon said the breach occurred March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
