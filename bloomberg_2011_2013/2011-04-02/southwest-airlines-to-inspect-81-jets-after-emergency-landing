(Corrects fourth paragraph of story published April 2 to
say previous fuselage hole was in July 2009.)  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , the world’s
biggest operator of  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 jets, grounded 79 aircraft
after a hole developed in a plane during flight, forcing an
emergency landing. About 300 flights were canceled today.  Flight 812, with 118 passengers and five crew, was en route
to  Sacramento  from Phoenix yesterday when a loss of cabin
pressure caused oxygen masks to deploy and prompted a landing in
Yuma,  Arizona , Southwest said in a statement today.  “The carrier has decided to keep a subset of its  Boeing
737  fleet out of the flying schedule to begin an aggressive
inspection effort in cooperation with Boeing engineers,”
Southwest said.  Metal fatigue was blamed for an 18-by-12 inch rip in a
Southwest 737 in July 2009 while it was flying at 35,000 feet,
also forcing an emergency landing. In January 2010, the  Federal
Aviation Administration  ordered fuselage checks for metal
fatigue on 135 Boeing 737-300s, -400s and -500s in the U.S.,
after the planemaker recommended such checks in September 2009.  Passengers described a hole in the model 737-300 as being 1
foot (0.3 meters) wide by 3 feet long, said Linda Rutherford, a
spokeswoman for Dallas-based Southwest. A flight attendant and a
passenger were injured, Rutherford said.  The plane will be 15 years old in June; its fuselage skin
had been inspected on March 29 and Feb. 5, Rutherford said.  Top of Aircraft  An inspection by Flight 812 crew members in Yuma found a
hole in the top of the aircraft, toward the middle of the cabin,
the airline said. The tear found last July, in another 737-300,
also was in the top of the fuselage, near the tail.  “The safety of our customers and employees is our primary
concern, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries,”
Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said in the statement.  The airline is working with Boeing engineers “on an
inspection regimen” that will look for “skin fatigue” on the
aircraft over the next few days, Southwest said. The airline
also is working with National Transportation Safety Board
investigators who flew to Yuma, about 150 miles from Phoenix.
The inspections will take place during the next several days at
five locations, Southwest said.  Southwest has 552 737s in its fleet, Chief Executive
Officer  Gary Kelly  said on March 22. According to the airline’s
website, it had 171 737-300s, 25 737-500s and 352 737-700s as of
Dec. 31, 2010. The average age of Southwest’s fleet of 737-300s
was 19 years as of the end of 2010.  ‘Fatigue Cracks’  In the July 2010 incident, “continuous fatigue cracks” on
the inside of the fuselage helped create the hole, the safety
board said. No passengers were injured. In March 2009, Southwest
agreed to pay a $7.5 million fine for flying jets in 2006 and
2007 without some required fuselage inspections.  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  is probing a possible
bullet hole in the fuselage of a  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  Boeing
737 on March 28. The nickel-size hole was discovered on the left
side of the plane near the tail during a pilot’s preflight check
at the  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , airport. The jet, which had
flown from Philadelphia with 84 passengers and five crew, has
since returned to service, said Michelle Mohr, a US Airways
spokeswoman.  The hole in the US Airways plane extended from the jet’s
skin into the cabin, Amy Thoreson, an FBI spokeswoman in
Charlotte, said March 29.  On Oct. 26, 2010, an American Airlines Boeing 757-200
developed a hole in the fuselage while flying at 31,000 feet.
The hole occurred just above the door on the left side near the
front of the aircraft, causing a loss of pressure and forcing an
emergency landing in Miami, where the flight began.  Separately yesterday, a partial loss of cabin pressure on
American Airlines Flight 547 sickened six people on board and
forced an emergency landing in Dayton,  Ohio .  The aircraft, a Boeing  737-800 , landed in Dayton at 8:20
a.m., about an hour and 10 minutes after taking off from
Washington’s Reagan National Airport en route to Chicago, said
