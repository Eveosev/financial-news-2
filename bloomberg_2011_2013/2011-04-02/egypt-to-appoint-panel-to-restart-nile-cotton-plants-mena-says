Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s planned takeover
of Zambia’s Lumwana copper mine through its C$7.3 billion ($7.5
billion) acquisition of  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  is likely to be
approved by a Zambian regulator.  By law a decision must be made on an application within 90
days, Brian Lingela, a spokesman for the Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission, said today in an interview. It
is likely to be quicker.  “Barrick has no history in this country so I don’t think
their application will face any serious challenge,” he said.
“Most of the paperwork has been done.” He didn’t give a date
for when the deal may be approved. Barrick made an application
to the commission on May 9.  Lumwana accounts for 19 percent of  Zambia ’s copper
production, Lingela said in an e-mailed statement today. Zambia
is trying to boost its copper production to accelerate economic
growth and cement its position as  Africa ’s biggest producer of
the metal. Equinox is targeting copper concentrate production of
145,000 metric tons from Lumwana this year.  “The Board of Commissioners is expected to make a decision
soon,” Lingela said in the statement. “The commission is
carrying out a number of assessment tests to ascertain whether
the transaction is likely to result in any negative effects in
the mining sector, to the consumer, fair trade or the economy in
general.”  Equinox rose 1 cent to C$8.09 as of 4:01 p.m. in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading. Barrick advanced 5 cents to C$44.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
