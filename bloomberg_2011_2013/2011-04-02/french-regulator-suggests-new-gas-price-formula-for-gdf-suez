Capmark Financial Group Inc., the
bankrupt commercial lender, won court permission to sell the
right to manage a $1 billion fund that invests in real estate
debt to an affiliate of Normandy Real Estate Partners.  Normandy’s affiliate agreed to pay $12.7 million for the
right to manage the portfolio, whose investors include
California Public Employees Retirement System and similar
pensions in Texas and  Ohio .  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Christopher Sontchi  said today in
Wilmington, Delaware, that he would sign an order approving the
sale after Capmark made minor wording changes.  Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, filed bankruptcy
in 2009, blaming falling property values and a drop in lending.  Two competing bidders will be considered back-up buyers in
case the sale to Normandy falls through, according to court
documents: an affiliate of  Winthrop Realty Trust (FUR) , which came in
second with an offer of $12.6 million, and an affiliate of
Pacific Coast Capital Partners LLC with a bid of $7.55 million.  While in bankruptcy, the company sold its loan-servicing
unit to  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and  Leucadia
National Corp. (LUK)  in a deal valued at $468 million.  Capmark’s 6.3 percent bonds that mature in 2017 climbed
about 1 percent to 58.75 cents on the dollar, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The case is In re Capmark Financial Group Inc., 09-13684,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
