The amount of total  capital spending 
made globally on oil and gas upstream projects is expected to
have risen by 9 percent in 2010 after falling 15 percent in
2009, the International Energy Forum said.  Capital spending to add more upstream capacity started to
improve last year after cutbacks, although “the challenge
facing the industry is to continue to take the long term view
and invest in the oil and gas value chain despite the many
uncertainties,” the Riyadh-based forum known as IEF said in a
paper posted on its website today.  The IEF is a group of nations that account for more than 90
percent of global oil and gas supply and demand, and was
established to discuss international energy security.  According to International Energy Agency estimates,
cumulative oil project investment required meet energy demand
between 2010 and 2035 is $8.1 trillion, or $310 billion per
year, with 85 percent of this amount to be directed to the
upstream. The gas sector needs $7.1 trillion, or $270 billion
per year over the period, it said.  “Mobilising this huge level of investment is a major
challenge for the oil and gas industry,” the IEF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
