India defeated  Sri Lanka  by six
wickets in Mumbai to win the Cricket World Cup for a second
time.  Gautam Gambhir scored 97 and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
was 91 not out as India reached its target of 275 with 10 balls
remaining to complete the biggest run chase in final history.
India finished 277-4 as Dhoni scored the final runs with a six.  “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Gambhir said in an on-field
interview. “This is a dream come true.”  Sri Lanka had the previous highest chase in surpassing
Australia’s 241 in 1996.  Mahela Jayawardene scored an unbeaten 103 in 88 balls for
Sri Lanka, which was 274-6 in its 50 overs after winning the
toss and electing to bat.  India’s Sachin Tendulkar scored just 18 in his attempt to
score a record 100th international century. Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan, who has a record number of wickets in one-day and
Test cricket, was 0-39 in the final match of his career.  India won the  World Cup  in 1983. It was the second
consecutive final for the Sri Lankans, who lost to Australia
four years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
