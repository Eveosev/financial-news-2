Crude oil climbed above $100 a barrel
in  New York  after an Energy Department report showed an
unexpected drop in U.S. inventories as refineries bolstered
operating rates and imports declined.  Oil advanced 3.3 percent after the department said supplies
fell 15,000 barrels to 370.3 million last week. Inventories were
forecast to rise 1.7 million barrels, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Refineries operated at 83.2 percent
of capacity, the most since the week ended April 1.  “The DOE report was definitely a bullish force for the
market,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource analyst with
 Weiss Research  in Jupiter,  Florida . “Commodities remain an
attractive investment and it doesn’t take much to spur buying.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose $3.19 to $100.10 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
price since May 10. Futures are up 44 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for July settlement increased $2.31, or 2.1
percent, to end the session at $112.30 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Imports of crude oil dropped 4.4 percent to 8.57 million
barrels a day, the report showed. Fuel imports declined 14
percent to 2.26 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
the week ended March 11.  Supplies of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade,
fell 1.59 million barrels to 40 million.  TransCanada Corp.’s 591,000-barrel-a-day Keystone oil
pipeline, was shut May 7 until May 13 after a leak in  North
Dakota . The system runs from Alberta to Cushing.  Gasoline Supplies  Gasoline inventories rose 119,000 barrels to 205.9 million
in the week ended May 13. Supplies were forecast to increase
950,000 barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst responses
in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, declined 1.16
million barrels to 143.1 million, the lowest level since April
2009.  U.S. gasoline demand rose 2.5 percent to 9.05 million
barrels a day last week, the first gain in three weeks, the
report showed.  Gasoline for June delivery increased 3.62 cents, or 1.2
percent, to end the session at $2.9555 a gallon in New York.  “There’s plenty of oil out there but continued unrest is
going to keep prices around $100,” said  Chip Hodge , who
oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior
managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
“Libyan oil will remain off the market for the foreseeable
future, and that’s just one trouble spot.”  Libyan Defection  Libya’s top oil official,  Shokri Ghanem , defected from
Muammar Qaddafi’s regime, a spokesman for the rebel group at war
with the country’s leader, said yesterday. About 1.3 million
barrels a day of production has been lost from the country,
holder of Africa’s largest reserves, in an armed uprising
against Qaddafi’s four-decade rule.  Crude oil will lead a rally in commodities as production
fails to keep pace with consumption, said Ray Eyles, chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s commodity business
in  Asia .  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other
producers won’t increase output fast enough to meet demand, the
bank said in a report May 6.  “Ultimately, the long-term fundamental supply and demand
of commodities is still pointing to higher prices,” Eyles said
in an interview in Singapore. “The commodities that have the
best underlying fundamental stories at the moment” are in
energy because of unrest in the Middle East and  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis, he said.  Commodity Index  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
climbed 2.5 percent to 689.52, the highest level since May 10.
Twenty-one of the raw materials increased and three dropped.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  increased 0.7 percent to 1,337.69, and
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 59.18 points to
12,538.76 at 3:05 p.m.  Wildfires in northern Alberta have shut a pipeline that
carries crude from oil-sands projects and may halt more than
55,000 barrels of daily output as companies run short of storage
space for their production.  Fires forced  Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)  to stop
cleanup work from an earlier oil spill and shut down its Rainbow
pipeline system completely on May 15.  Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd. (CNQ) ,  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and other producers have said they may
curtail output because of the pipeline disruption.  Canadian Shipments  The U.S.  imported  1.97 million barrels of oil a day from
 Canada , making it the country’s biggest source, according to the
Energy Department.  “The wildfires in  Alberta  are more supportive than today’s
inventory numbers,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy.
“They pose a real threat.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 717,486
contracts as of 3:05 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 845,336
yesterday, 18 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.58 million contracts, the lowest
level since April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
