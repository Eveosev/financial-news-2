Russia’s government picked Icon
Private Equity President Kirill Dmitriev to manage a fund
created to help attract investment.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who is seeking investors to
join the fund, today introduced Dmitriev to representatives from
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority, and others from the U.S.,  Europe , Asia and
the Middle East, Dmitry Peskov, the premier’s spokesman, said by
phone today.  President  Dmitry Medvedev , seeking to wean the economy off
its dependence on the energy industry, in January announced the
plan to set up a $10 billion fund by June 1. Russia wants to use
the fund to attract $90 billion of investment in 5 years,
Vedomosti said earlier this month.  Putin as premier is the head of the supervisory board at
state development bank Vnesheconombank, which is in charge of
setting up the fund. He met the bankers at the same time as
Medvedev held his first news conference since becoming president
in May 2008.  During the conference, Medvedev said he shared a strategy
with Putin, who he called "like-minded," adding that they aren’t
always in agreement about details. One of the differences is in
their perception of modernization pace, Medvedev said.  Dmitriev, 36, was a founder at the $1 billion Icon. The
Harvard MBA graduate earlier headed Delta Private Equity
Partners and worked at McKinsey & Co. and Goldman Sachs,
Interfax said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
