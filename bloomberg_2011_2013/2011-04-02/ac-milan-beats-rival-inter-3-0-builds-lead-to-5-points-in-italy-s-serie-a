AC Milan defeated Inter Milan
3-0 to take a five-point lead over its rival at the top of
Italian soccer’s Serie A.  Alexandre Pato scored twice at the San Siro stadium as
Milan won for the first time in three league matches. The
Rossoneri, who have 65 points, were without leading scorer
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was completing a two-game
suspension for punching an opponent.  Pato scored 45 seconds into the game and added his
second goal on a header 17 minutes after halftime, eight
minutes after Inter’s Cristian Chivu was sent off for
tripping Pato.  Antonio Cassano added the winners’ third goal on a
penalty kick in the game’s final minute. Cassano celebrated
by pulling off his shirt, receiving a yellow card. He
received his second yellow card, and was sent off, in
stoppage time.  Defending champion Inter had its five-match unbeaten
run stopped. It was the first time Inter manager Leonardo
faced the team he played for and coached last season.  Napoli can move into second place, two points ahead of
Inter, by beating fifth-place Lazio at home today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
