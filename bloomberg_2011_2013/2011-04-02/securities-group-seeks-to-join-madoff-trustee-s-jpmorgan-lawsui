The Securities Investor Protection
Corp., which initiated the liquidation of Bernard Madoff’s money
management firm, told a judge it has a “right to be heard” in
trustee Irving Picard’s $6.4 billion suit against  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)   Picard has alleged the New York-based bank aided in
Madoff’s $20 billion  Ponzi scheme . JPMorgan, which is trying to
move the case to district court from U.S. bankruptcy court, has
said it may object to SIPC’s participation in the case.  SIPC lawyer Kevin Bell addressed the letter to U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon, according to the filing
yesterday in Manhattan federal court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
