BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canada’s biggest phone
company, is “very comfortable” with its exposure to the
National Hockey League through its investment in the  Montreal
Canadiens , and hasn’t bid on Maple Leaf Sports and
Entertainment, owner of the  Toronto Maple Leafs .  The Canadiens are “critically” important to BCE and
“there is nothing we’d want to do to jeopardize that
relationship,” Siim Vanaselja, BCE’s chief financial officer,
said at a conference today in Toronto. “We are very comfortable
with our exposure to hockey at this point.”  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan said in March it plans to
sell its controlling stake in Maple Leaf Sports, which owns the
Maple Leafs hockey team, Raptors basketball team, the Air Canada
Centre arena and the Toronto FC soccer club.  Forbes magazine reported last week that Montreal-based BCE
and Toronto-based telecommunications rival  Rogers Communications
Inc. (RCI/B)  may be among bidders for the sports business.  Ontario Teachers’ last week said it agreed to buy a
minority stake from a unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank to make it
easier to sell the company. The pension fund expects to own 75
percent to 80 percent of the firm once the transaction closes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
