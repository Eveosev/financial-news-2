Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) 
will seek a combination of loans and capital from  Spain â€™s bank
bailout fund to avoid handing control to the state,  Expansion 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  CAM, which said yesterday it would seek 2.8 billion euros
($4 billion) from the FROB fund, will ask for 1.75 billion euros
in capital and 1.06 billion euros in loans, Expansion said. The
Bank of Spain may not approve the plan, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
