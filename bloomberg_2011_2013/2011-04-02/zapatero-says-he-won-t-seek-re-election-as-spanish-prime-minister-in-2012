Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, raised its fiscal 2011 earnings forecast
less than analysts estimated as the effects of Japan’s
earthquake lowered profit and costs rose.  Earnings will be $2.65 billion in the year through October,
more than the $2.5 billion forecast in February, Moline,
Illinois-based Deere said today in a statement. The average
analysts’ estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for profit of $2.67
billion.  Demand for farm and construction equipment is increasing as
the U.S. recovers from the recession that ended in June 2009 and
 developing countries  such as China and  India  aim to feed growing
populations and construct bridges, roads and buildings. The
gains were tempered because of the March 11 Japanese earthquake,
higher material costs and lower sales in South America.  “Maybe investors hadn’t been including the impact of
 Japan ; when you incorporate that, their guidance would have been
above expectations,” Jeff Windau, a St. Louis-based analyst at
Edward Jones & Co. who rates the shares “hold,” said in a
telephone interview. “Investors are noticing the rising costs
and maybe the weaker-than-expected South American market.”  Deere said equipment sales will rise 21 to 23 percent in
fiscal 2011, up from a previous projection for an 18 to 20
percent increase. Equipment sales in fiscal 2010 were $23.6
billion. The forecast includes a negative impact of about $300
million in sales and $70 million in operating profit because of
disruptions from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.  Farm Machinery  U.S. and Canadian farm machinery sales are forecast to rise
5 to 10 percent for 2011 and about 15 percent in the European
Union while declining 5 to 10 percent in  South America , Deere
said. Global sales of construction and forestry equipment will
rise by about 35 percent for fiscal 2011, the company said.  Deere fell 46 cents to $86.50 as of 4:15 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 51
percent in the past 12 months.  Net income gained 65 percent to $904.3 million, or $2.12 a
share, in the quarter through April, from $547.5 million, or
$1.28, a year earlier, Deere said in the statement. The average
analysts’ estimate in the Bloomberg survey was for earnings of
$2.06 a share. Deere’s profit now has beaten average analysts’
estimates in eight of the past nine quarters. Total sales in the
quarter rose 25 percent to $8.91 billion from $7.13 billion a
year earlier.  Increased Costs  Profit in the fiscal second-quarter was “partially offset
by increased raw-material costs and higher selling,
administrative and general expenses,” Deere said in the
statement.  Sales of large farm machinery, particularly in the U.S.,
 Canada  and  Brazil  are rising, with  Europe  in the early stage of
a recovery, as the rally in agricultural prices boosts farm
incomes, Deere said. Construction equipment shipments are
increasing, with the U.S. at the beginning of a rebound, the
company said.  Corn futures have more than doubled in the past 12 months
in  Chicago  trading while soybeans have gained 47 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
