Japan ’s  government bonds  fell for a
second week on speculation investors cut holdings to lock in a
higher coupon at an auction of 10-year securities next week.  Benchmark 10-year yields climbed to a three-week high on
prospects the yen’s decline to its lowest level in six weeks
against the dollar will help increase the earnings outlook for
Japan’s exporters. Bonds also dropped after a report showed this
week U.S. consumer spending advanced in February, reinforcing
signs of resilience in the global economic recovery.  “Investors are refraining from buying before the
auction,” said Makoto Noji, a senior debt and foreign-exchange
strategist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Expectations
are mounting about the  U.S. economy .”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 rose six
basis points to 1.28 percent this week as of yesterday in Tokyo
at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price fell 0.535 yen to 100.176 yen. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The yield was the highest since a magnitude-9 earthquake
struck Japan on March 11.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery fell 0.61 to 139.19
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange this week. The yen touched 84.73 per
dollar yesterday in Asian trading, the lowest since Sept. 24.  Japan’s Ministry of Finance will sell 2.2 trillion yen
($26.3 billion) of 10-year bonds on April 5. The prior 10-year
debt offering on March 1 drew bids worth 2.91 times the amount
on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.69
at the February auction.  Debt Sales  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at debt sales,
often reduce holdings before an auction in case prices drop
before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  U.S. consumer spending increased 0.7 percent in February
after advancing 0.3 percent the prior month, Commerce Department
figures showed on March 28 in  Washington .  The government won’t allow the  Bank of Japan  to underwrite
government bonds, Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said yesterday. Such a step would hurt the bank’s
credibility globally and might affect bond yields, Yosano told
reporters at a news conference in Tokyo.  A quarterly index of sentiment among large manufacturers
rose to 6 points in March from 5 points in December, the Bank of
Japan’s Tankan survey showed yesterday. The central bank noted
that 72 percent of responses from companies came by March 11,
the day the earthquake triggered a deadly tsunami and radiation
leaks at a nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
