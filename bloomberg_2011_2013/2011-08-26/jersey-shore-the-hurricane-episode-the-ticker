It was a stunning sight last night as I was driving up Long Beach Island on the  Jersey Shore , evacuating with my family to safer ground as Hurricane Irene made its way up the east coast. The restaurants were packed along the seven-mile drive from the little town of Beach Haven to the bridge across Manahawkin Bay that leads west to the mainland. Not one building was boarded up. I didn't see a single window all day with storm shutters on it. It was as if the place felt immune, notwithstanding the  hurricane watch  issued yesterday morning. I shudder to think this may be an accurate indicator of how well prepared coastal residents and business owners in the Northeast are for a direct hit. I grew up in South Florida, where the locals take hurricane-preparedness seriously based on long and painful experience. Up here where canes come about as frequently as earthquakes -- could we really have both in less than a week? -- folks don't seem to have a clue. We are holed up for now in a hotel room well inland, unsure of when we'll be able to return to the cute little condo that we rented a block from the beach. Hopefully it will still be there next week after the storm passes. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist)
