Spain ’s two main political parties
agreed to enshrine the principle of budget discipline in the
constitution and gave themselves until next year to set specific
deficit goals for 2020.  The ruling Socialist Party and opposition  People’s Party 
agreed to amend the constitution to ensure all arms of
government stick to the “principle of budget stability,”
according to the text of an amendment distributed by the
Socialists today.  The amendment calls for public debt not to exceed 60
percent of gross domestic product, though the ceiling may be
breached in the case of “natural catastrophe, economic
recession or emergencies.” The parties pledged to pass a
separate law by June next year that will set a maximum
structural deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP to be met by 2020, the
same year the debt limit comes into effect.  “We want to be part of the core of countries at the
vanguard of what is going to be the new European economic
policy,” Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the PP’s spokeswoman in
Parliament, told reporters in  Madrid  today. “With this
agreement Spain is backing the euro.”  Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, fighting a
surge in borrowing costs that prompted the  European Central Bank 
to start buying Spanish debt, is following similar plans by
Germany, France and  Italy  to enshrine budget discipline in
national constitutions. The proposal has prompted criticism from
within Zapatero’s party three months before a general election
that polls indicate it will lose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
