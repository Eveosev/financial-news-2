Growth in loans to households and
companies in the 17-nation euro area slowed in July as the
region’s debt crisis weakened economic expansion and damped
demand for credit.  Loans to the private sector grew 2.4 percent from a year
earlier after advancing an annual 2.5 percent in June, the
 European Central Bank  said today. The rate of growth in M3 money
supply, which the Frankfurt-based ECB uses as a gauge of future
inflation, stood at 2 percent compared with 1.9 percent in June.  “Banks have been tightening credit as the economy cools,”
said  Christian Schulz , an economist at Joh. Berenberg Gossler &
Co. “That trend will continue and at these levels it’s unlikely
that the ECB will see any more inflation drivers from this
side.”  The ECB raised its benchmark rate twice this year to 1.5
percent after faster economic growth and higher  oil prices 
pushed inflation above the central bank’s 2 percent ceiling.
European services and manufacturing industries are expanding at
the slowest pace in almost two years, adding to signs the euro-
region recovery is losing momentum, a report showed Aug. 23.  M3 grew 2.1 percent in the three months through July from
the same period a year earlier, the ECB said. M3 is the broadest
gauge of  money supply  and includes cash in circulation, some
forms of savings and money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
