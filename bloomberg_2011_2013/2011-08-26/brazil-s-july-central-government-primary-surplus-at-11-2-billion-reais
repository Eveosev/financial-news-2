Brazil ’s federal government posted
the largest  budget surplus , excluding public debt payments, ever
for July, Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said.  The so-called primary surplus widened to 11.2 billion reais
($6.9 billion) from a revised 10.6 billion reais in June,
according to a report distributed in Brasilia today. The result
came in lower than the 11.4 billion reais median estimate of 11
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The government targets a primary surplus of 81.76 billion
reais for 2011 and has already collected 66.9 billion reais
through July, Augustin said to reporters in Brasilia.  The July surplus was boosted by a 5.8 billion reais payment
tied to the end of a judicial dispute over taxes with an
unidentified company, and doesn’t necessarily indicate the
government is making strides in containing spending, said
 Jankiel Santos , an economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimentos in Sao Paulo.  Revenue surged 22 percent in the seven months through July
from the year-earlier period, while spending increased 11
percent, Brazil’s Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
