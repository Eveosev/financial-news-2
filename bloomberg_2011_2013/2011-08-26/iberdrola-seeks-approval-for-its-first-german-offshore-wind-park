Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the world’s biggest
renewable-electricity producer, started the process to gain
approval for building its first offshore wind park in Germany,
aiming to supply the public transmission grid in 2016.  The Wikinger offshore plant will generate 400 megawatts of
wind power and be located off the German coast of the  Baltic
Sea , according to a  website  statement today from the Bilbao,
Spain-based utility.  Germany is pushing development of offshore wind farms to
make up for lost capacity as the country plans to shut down its
atomic reactors by 2022, which last year comprised 23 percent of
the nation’s installed generation base. The government raised
subsidies for offshore wind power as part of a plan to install
10,000 megawatts of sea-based generation by 2020.  Iberdrola began applying for permits from the German
Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency for the park about 40
kilometers (25 miles) from the coast of  Germany ’s largest
island, Rugen, the Bilbao-based company said. This stage of the
process requires submission of the project’s planned design and
environmental impact report, the company said.  Iberdrola aims to start building in 2015, subject to having
the required permits. The  wind turbines  will each have a
capacity of about 5 megawatts, according to the statement.
Iberdrola bought rights to build Wikinger from a joint venture
of DEE Deutsche Erneuerbare Energien GmbH, a unit of Deutsche
Bank AG, and Ventotec GmbH, in March 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
