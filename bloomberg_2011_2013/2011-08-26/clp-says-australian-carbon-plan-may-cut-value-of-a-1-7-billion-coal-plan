CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s
biggest electricity producer, said a plan by Australia to put a
price on  carbon emissions  from July may impair the value of its
Yallourn brown coal power station in Victoria state.  “The possible introduction of climate change legislation
may have a significant impact on TRUenergy’s business, in
particular on the Yallourn brown coal-fired generation
business,” CLP said in its 2011 interim report. “It may result
in a significant impairment of the business due to either a
reduction in the earnings from a combination of reduced output
and increased costs, not fully offset by higher electricity
prices and/or a reduction in the useful life of the asset.”  CLP boosted the value of the station in the six months
through June 30 by 3 percent to A$1.71 billion ($1.8 billion),
according to the report. No impairment of the asset had been
taken “on the basis that there is currently uncertainty in
relation to the likely structure, timing and impact of any
climate change legislation,” CLP said.  CLP may raise about A$2.7 billion by selling some of its
TRUenergy shares in a likely 2012 initial offering, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc said July 27.  Along with  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)  and  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) ,
“TRUenergy is now one of the three dominant energy retailers
and generators in Australia and, in our view, is IPO-ready,”
Jenny Cosgrove, a Hong Kong-based analyst at RBS, wrote in a
report. A share sale may help CLP fund new power projects in
 Asia  and a special dividend, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
