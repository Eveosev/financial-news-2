Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil
producer, plans to export 53 crude cargoes in October, one more
than September, according to a final loading plan obtained by
Bloomberg News.  One cargo of the new Pazflor crude was added, raising
exports for October to three shipments, the program showed.  Total SA (FP) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the field’s
equity holders, will get one Pazflor cargo each. The project
will be able to pump as much as 220,000 barrels a day, according
to Total, which operates the deposit.  Exports of Angolan crude will be 50.9 million barrels, or
1.64 million barrels a day, in October, the schedule showed.
That compares with 50 million barrels, or 1.67 million barrels a
day, next month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are in
1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
