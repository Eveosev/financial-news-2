Zhongpin Inc. (HOGS) , a Chinese pork
processor listed in the U.S., may attract a takeover bid or
investments from global food companies seeking to tap China’s
growing demand for meat.  “We believe the long-term opportunity for consolidation
within the Chinese food processing industry is too attractive
for Zhongpin not to attract either a private bid or investment
from an international partner,” Tim Tiberio, a New York-based
analyst for Chardan Capital Markets LLC, who has a “buy”
rating on the stock, said in a report today.  Along with exploring business relationships with companies
like Tyson Foods Inc. and Hormel Foods Corp., Changge-based
Zhongpin may also be considering proposals to take the company
private, Tiberio said.  As the Chinese population grows in size and prosperity, it
is consuming more meat.  Per capita pork  consumption in  China  has
jumped 18 percent to 38 kilograms (84 pounds) in 2010 from 32.3
kilograms in 2007, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
data.  Zhongpin rose 7 cents to $8.23 on Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 4 p.m. The shares have fallen 60 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
