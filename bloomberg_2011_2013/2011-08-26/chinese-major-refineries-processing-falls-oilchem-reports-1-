China ’s largest oil refineries
reduced their processing rate from two weeks earlier to the
second-lowest level this year,  Oilchem.net  reported.  The utilization rate declined 0.62 percentage point to
80.17 percent of designed capacity in the last two weeks through
yesterday, the Shandong-based industry portal reported on its
website today, citing a fortnightly survey of 35 major
refineries with a capacity of about 7.3 million barrels a day,
or 71 percent of the nation’s total.  Major refinery utilization fell from a record 88.6 percent
in May after plants shut for seasonal maintenance starting June.
The utilization rate dropped to 78.46 percent at the end of
June, the lowest this year.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-largest oil refiner,
shut its 5 million metric ton-a-year, or 100,000 barrels-a-day,
Changqing refinery on Aug. 20 for one month of maintenance. The
200,000 barrel-a-day Luoyang plant will be closed on Aug. 31 for
45 days of repair, it said.  Major refineries’ processing is expected to be maintained
at about 80 percent in September, Oilchem said.  Refineries in the northeastern part of the nation were
running at 74 percent of capacity in the two weeks ended
yesterday. Plants in the northwest were at 45 percent, while
those in the north were at 82 percent. Refineries in the east
were operating at 91 percent, those in central regions were at
78 percent and those in the south were at 92 percent, according
to Oilchem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
