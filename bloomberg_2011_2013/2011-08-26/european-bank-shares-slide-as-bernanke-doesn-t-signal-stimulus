European banks fell after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
still has tools to stimulate the economy without giving details
or signaling when or whether policy makers may deploy them.  The Stoxx 600 Banks Index dropped 2.7 percent to 133.17 as
of 4:37 p.m. in Frankfurt.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  and
 Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  led the declines, dropping 7.6 percent and 6.7
percent, respectively.  While Bernanke sought to reassure investors and the public
that U.S. growth is safe in the long run and that the Fed still
has tools to aid the recovery if needed, he stopped short of
indicating that the central bank will move ahead with a third
round of government bond-buying. Some investors may have
expected the central banker to signal such a move, said Stefan Scharff, a banking analyst at SRC Research.  “Everyone hopes for something but we’ve had all this
before and even if it helps in the short term, it fades,” said
the Frankfurt-based analyst. “It is a good thing there wasn’t
such an announcement, as we’d go into a deeper downward spiral
if the medication loses its effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
