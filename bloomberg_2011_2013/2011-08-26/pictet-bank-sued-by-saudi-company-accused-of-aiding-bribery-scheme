Swiss private bank Pictet & Cie was
sued by Saudi Arabian company Al Rushaid Petroleum Investment
Corp., which said its employees got help from the bank in a
bribery scheme.  Three employees at the company’s Al Rushaid Parker Drilling
Ltd. unit laundered more than $4 million in kickbacks through
accounts with Pictet, the company said in a lawsuit filed today
in  New York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  “Pictet’s part in the conspiracy was clear -- it was
charged by the corrupted employees with responsibility of
concealing their receipt of the bribe money,” Al Rushaid
Petroleum said in the complaint.  The alleged scheme started with Al Rushaid Parker
Drilling’s work for  Saudi Aramco , Saudi Arabia’s national oil
company. The employees took kickbacks from vendors in exchange
for buying goods at inflated prices, according to the lawsuit.
The employees were indicted for  money laundering  in Geneva, the
company said.  A spokesman for Geneva-based Pictet couldn’t be reached for
comment after regular business hours.  The case is Rasheed Al Rushaid v. Pictet & Cie, 652375-
2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
