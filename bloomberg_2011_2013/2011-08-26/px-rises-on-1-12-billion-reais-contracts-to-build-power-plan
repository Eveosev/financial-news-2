MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) , the energy company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, gained the
most in two weeks after signing contracts valued at 1.12 billion
reais ($699 million) for Spanish suppliers to build power plants
in the country’s northeast region.  MPX jumped 5.4 percent to 36.89 reais at 4:15 p.m. New York
time, the biggest one-day increase since Aug. 11. The Bovespa
index climbed 0.8 percent.  Spanish companies  Duro Felguera SA (MDF)  and Initec Energia SA
will engineer, build and assemble MPX’s thermoelectric power-
plant complex, known as MPX Parnaiba, in Brazil’s Maranhao
state, according to a regulatory filing. The plants allow MPX to
fulfill a 6.5 billion reais contract to supply electricity for
20 years starting in 2014, according to a statement posted in
the company’s website Aug. 18.  With the deals, “MPX takes another step towards reducing
the project’s execution risk and reinforces the formidable
potential Parnaiba has,” Felipe Miranda and Rodolfo Amstalden,
analysts at Sao Paulo-based Empiricus Research, wrote in a note
to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
