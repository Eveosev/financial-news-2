Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
should review the security of its systems and web services
“more frequently” and enhance its hacking detection and
prevention technology after attempts directed at its website,
the city’s Securities and Futures Commission said today.  A “malicious attack” disrupted the corporate filing
website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chief Executive Officer
Charles Li said Aug. 10. Trading of companies including HSBC
Holdings Plc and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. was suspended
because the disruption meant price-sensitive documents sent to
the website may not have been published. Hong Kong police
arrested a 29-year-old man in relation to the hacking attempts
last week.  The SFC said the exchange’s decision to suspend trading of
the companies was “the appropriate way to ensure and maintain
an orderly, informed and fair market,” according to a report
published on the Legislative Council website today.  The exchange should consider enhancing the capability of
its trading system so it can have the flexibility of supporting
the operational needs of any changes to its trading-halt policy,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
