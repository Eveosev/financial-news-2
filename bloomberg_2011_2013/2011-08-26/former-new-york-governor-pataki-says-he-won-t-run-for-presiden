Former New York Governor George Pataki today said he wouldn’t seek the Republican nomination for
president.  Pataki made the announcement before his scheduled trip
tomorrow to  Iowa , site of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. He
said he would focus his attention on his new group, No American
Debt, which is focusing on overhauling entitlement programs,
such as Social Security and Medicare, and reducing federal
spending.  His former communications director, David Catalfamo, said
earlier this week that Pataki was “seriously considering” a
run.  “I remain committed to the advancement of real,
politically viable reforms to entitlements and rolling back the
size and cost of the federal government,” Pataki said in a
statement. “At this time, I will continue to do this as the
leader of  No American Debt  and not as a candidate for
president.”  Pataki said he would support the candidate “who offers the
vision, the ideas and the leadership to bring an end to
America’s debt crisis.”  Pataki was chairman of a nonprofit political group in the
2010 election, Revere America, which spent $3 million to help
elect Republican congressional candidates. The group did not
disclose its donors.  Republicans in the race include Texas Governor  Rick Perry ,
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Representatives
Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and  Ron Paul  of Texas, and former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Former Minnesota
Governor  Tim Pawlenty  ended his campaign after finishing third
in the Iowa Straw Poll earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
