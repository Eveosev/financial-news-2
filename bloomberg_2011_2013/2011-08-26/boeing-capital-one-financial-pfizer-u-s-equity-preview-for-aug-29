Shares of the following companies
may have unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 5:44 p.m. in New York.  Boeing Co. (BA)  : The Chicago-based company is replacing
its commercial-jet sales chief, Marlin Dailey, a month after
Airbus SAS made inroads into one of the U.S. planemaker’s top
customers. Ray Conner, who had been head of sales before Dailey
was appointed in December 2008, will take an expanded role as
vice president of sales and customer support. Dailey previously
led European sales and will become president of Boeing Germany,
Northern Europe/EU and Africa.  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  : The Federal Reserve
said it will hold public hearings on the McLean, Virginia-based
lender’s acquisition of ING Direct USA. The Fed said the
scrutiny is to examine whether the acquisition creates benefits
to the public and risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or
financial system.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)   added 0.8 percent to $18.35. The
world’s largest drugmaker won U.S. approval to sell a drug to
treat  lung cancer . The treatment, crizotinib, is the leading
candidate among more than 20 tumor-fighting medicines the
company is developing to help replace sales expected to be lost
to generic drugs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
