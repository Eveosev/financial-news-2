The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose 75.60, or 0.3 percent, to 29,425.05 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, bringing the week’s gain to 0.2 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
gold company, added 80 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 91 rand. Gold
rose in New York for a second straight day after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  offered no plan for further monetary
easing, sending equities lower and boosting the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
biggest platinum miner, increased 3 rand, or 1.8 percent, to
168.50 rand. The group may invest as much as $10 billion in
Zimbabwe to expand production if the government backs down on a
demand that its business there be controlled by black citizens
of the country, Chief Executive Officer  David Brown  told
Bloomberg.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producing unit of
Anglo American, rallied for a third day, adding 6.88 rand, or
1.6 percent, to 447.91 rand. The group may decide on the next
stage of its Sishen-Saldanha expansion in 2014, it said in a
presentation on its website today.  MMI Holdings Ltd. (MMI)  , the South African insurance
company created last year from the merger of Metropolitan Group
Ltd. and Momentum Group Ltd., closed at its lowest in a week,
falling 24 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 15.80 rand. The insurer was
downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at Deutsche Bank AG by
equity analyst Larissa Van-Deventer.  Naspers Ltd. (NPN)  , Africa’s largest media company,
advanced 7.95 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 337.45 rand. The group
will invest in new acquisition opportunities rather than
returning cash to investors through share buybacks, Finance
Director Steve Pacak said at the company’s annual general
meeting in  Cape Town  today.  Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd, a coal producer, rose
to its highest in four months, gaining 1.50 rand, or 5 percent,
to 31.50 rand. The miner confirmed it had received bids for a
controlling interest in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
