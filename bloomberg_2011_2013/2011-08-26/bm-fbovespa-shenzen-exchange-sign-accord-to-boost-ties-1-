BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
Brazil’s largest bourse, and  China ’s Shenzen Stock Exchange
signed an agreement to exchange information, personnel and
training as the Brazilian stock exchange seeks ways to bring
more small and medium-sized companies to capital markets.  BM&FBovespa wants to study how the Shenzen exchange caters
to companies that list on its platform, which are exclusively
small and medium-sized firms, Edemir Pinto, chief executive
officer of the Brazilian company, said today at an event in
Campos do Jordao, Brazil.  “Our goal is to have exchanges with this Chinese market
that shows a spectacular potential for growth,” Pinto said.  Bovespa and Shenzen executives will also study differences
in Chinese and Brazilian regulatory laws to lay the groundwork
for cross-listings of securities in the future, Pinto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
