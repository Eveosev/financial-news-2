What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that U.S. growth will
slow, reducing demand for food, fuel and livestock feed,  Rich Nelson , the director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
Illinois, said in a telephone interview. Investors are awaiting
word from Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on whether he
has a plan to stimulate the economy.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago, on concern that U.S. and world demand will decline
after prices climbed early this week, Nelson said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open down 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound,
and soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1 lower for 2,000
pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand for U.S. exports will
slow as production increases in Russia and the European Union,
Nelson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
