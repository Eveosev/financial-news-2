Banco Popolare SC (BP) ,  Italy ’s fifth-
biggest bank, said second-quarter profit fell 63 percent because
tax gains from a year-earlier weren’t repeated.  Net income declined to 131.4 million euros ($190 million)
from 359.8 million euros a year earlier, when the Verona, Italy-
based lender booked a 285 million-euro gain from deferred tax
assets related to its Banca Italease unit. The quarterly profit
figure beat the 65.6 million-euro average estimate of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Pier Francesco Saviotti plans to
sell real-estate assets and cut more than 1,000 jobs to boost
capital and profit as part of its five-year business plan. The
bank, which passed the European stress tests in July, sold 2
billion euros in shares through a rights offer in February.  The bank approved today a plan to merge some units into the
holding company as part of measures to increase efficiency and
reduce costs. The lender’s core tier 1 ratio, a key measure of
financial health, was unchanged at 6.5 percent as of June 30.  Loan-loss provisions in the quarter declined to 192 million
euros from 211 million euros. Net interest income fell 1 percent
to 442 million euros.  Banco Popolare fell 2.9 percent to 1.12 euros in Milan,
giving the company a market value of about 2 billion euros. The
stock has declined 54 percent this year compared with the 32
percent decline in the 46-company  Bloomberg Banks and Financial
Services Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
