Sector Investment Managers Ltd.,
which manages gold and energy funds, plans to move its Junior
Oils Trust back into equities fully in the next “couple” of
months, reducing its holding in cash and bonds.  “We have been taking advantage of recent weakness to add
to our positions,” Chief Executive Officer Angelos Damaskos
said yesterday by phone from  London . About 17 percent of the
fund is in cash and bonds, down from 30 percent at the beginning
of the year.  The 45 million-pound ($73 million) fund, which holds stock
in Caza Oil & Gas Inc. and Dragon Oil Plc, dropped 32 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
