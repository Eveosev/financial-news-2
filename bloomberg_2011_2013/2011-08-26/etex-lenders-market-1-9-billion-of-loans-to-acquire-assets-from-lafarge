Lenders to  Etex Group (ETEVP) , a Belgian
manufacturer of building products, are marketing 1.3 billion
euros ($1.9 billion) of loans to help fund its purchase of
gypsum assets from  Lafarge SA. (LG)   The financing includes a five-year 550 million-euro
revolving credit, a three-year 300 million-euro term loan, and a
one-year 450 million-euro bridge loan due to be refinanced with
bonds, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.  The loans are being arranged by banks including Credit
Agricole CIB, BNP Paribas SA, ING Groep NV, KBC Bank NV, Lloyds
Banking Group Plc and Banco Santander SA, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Etex is forging an alliance with Lafarge in  Latin America 
in an attempt to boost its profit from emerging markets as
demand for building products remains subdued in  Europe . Gypsum-
based wallboard is increasing in popularity in the region
as an alternative material for walls and ceilings. Officials in
Etex’s finance and communications departments didn’t immediately
respond to calls seeking comment.  The transaction is valued at 1 billion euros, and Lafarge
will get cash proceeds of about 850 million euros from the sale
of the European and South American assets, the Paris-based
cement maker said when it entered exclusive negotiations with
Etex on July 14. It will retain a 20 percent stake in the
combined business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
