India ’s benchmark stock index had
the longest weekly losing streak since 2008 before a speech by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , which may signal
measures to boost the world’s biggest economy.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, plunged the most in 22 months.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the
nation’s biggest developer, retreated 6.3 percent. Tata Power
Co., the largest generator outside state control, plunged to a
27-month low after its rating was cut at Morgan Stanley.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
280.77, or 1.7 percent, to 15,865.56, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. Mumbai time. The gauge declined 1.7
percent this week, its fifth week of losses, the longest such
run since October 2008 when the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. froze credit markets.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange fell
1.9 percent to 4,749.55, the lowest level since Feb. 5, 2010,
and its September futures settled at 4,747.60. The BSE 200 index
retreated 2 percent to 1,966.15.  -- With assistance from Tanya Ashreena. Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
