Sky Network Television Ltd. (SKT)  surged
to an almost seven-week high in Wellington after  New Zealand ’s
largest pay-TV operator reported full-year profit rose 17
percent on a recovery in subscriber growth.  Net income rose to NZ$120.3 million ($99 million) in the
year ended June 30 from NZ$103 million a year earlier, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement. The stock climbed
1.7 percent to NZ$5.85, the highest close since July 11.  Subscriber numbers gained 27,000 to 829,400 as of June 30,
rebounding from the weakest growth in 11 years in 2010 as New
Zealand’s economy began to accelerate. The company, 44 percent
owned by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., stoked revenue per
customer 4.2 percent by adding new channels and shifting users
to its MySky box, a digital recorder that encourages viewing and
pay-for-view services.  Earthquakes in the southern city of Christchurch led to
about NZ$1.3 million of lost revenue as residential and
commercial customers disconnected or sought temporary
downgrades, the company said. The temblors closed hotels and
other properties in the central business district and at least
5,000 homes are condemned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
