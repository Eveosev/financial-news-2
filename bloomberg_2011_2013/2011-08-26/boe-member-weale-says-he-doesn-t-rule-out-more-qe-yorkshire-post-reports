Bank of England  policy maker  Martin Weale  said while he doesn’t see the need to expand the central
bank’s 200 billion pound ($326 billion) bond-purchase plan now,
he would change his mind if the U.K. economy weakened
“substantially,” the Yorkshire Post reported, citing an
interview.   “As I see things at the moment, I don’t think there’s a
case for it,” Weale told the newspaper when asked if he saw the
need to extend the bank’s emergency asset-buying program. “If I
thought the economy was likely to weaken substantially further
and therefore inflation was likely to come in well under target,
then obviously I would change my mind.”  “One of the things that could create a need for more
quantitative easing would be if banks did become more reluctant
to lend again,” the Yorkshire Post cited Weale as saying in an
 article  on its website. “It’s not the most likely outcome I see
happening, but I would hesitate to say that things are
impossible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
