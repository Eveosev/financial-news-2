The euro region’s economy slowed for
a third month in August as stock markets fell and executive and
household sentiment weakened, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic expansion in the 17-nation
region declined to 0.22 percent from 0.45 percent in July, the
London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of
Italy , which co-produce the index, said in an e-mailed report.  “The decline reflects a worsening in a large number of the
series which contribute to the indicator,” according to today’s
report. “In particular share prices and business and confidence
registered a significant drop.”  The August reading is the lowest since September 2009.
“The indicator is now consistent with an underlying annualized
growth rate of under 1 percent,” today’s report said.  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
