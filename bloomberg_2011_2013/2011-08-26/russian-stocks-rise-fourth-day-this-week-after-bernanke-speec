Russian stocks rose for a fourth day
this week, extending the first weekly rally in five weeks, as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s prediction that
growth will resume reassured investors.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 1.1 percent to 1,458.84 at the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, taking its weekly gain to 1.4
percent. OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, rallied 3.3
percent. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the country’s largest mining
company, jumped 5.3 percent. OAO Transneft, the oil pipeline
monopoly operator, advanced 4 percent.  Stocks rallied in the U.S., with the  Standard & Poor’s 
rebounding from a 2.2 percent drop, and oil pared declines as
Bernanke said growth fundamentals were not “permanently
altered” and that the Fed has tools to provide stimulus.
Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, slipped 0.7 percent to
$84.72 a barrel, after tumbling as much as 2.8 percent.  The Micex has dropped 14 percent this year and at 4.2 times
earnings. That compares with a 23 percent slide for  Brazil ’s
Bovespa Index, which trades at 8.1 times earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
