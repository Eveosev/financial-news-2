Berendsen Plc, a U.K. provider of
textile cleaning and supply services, said first-half profit was
little changed as the company incurred exceptional costs
relating to the restructuring of its German Healthcare unit.  Net income for the six months to June 30 was broadly
unchanged at 21.8 million pounds ($35.6 million) from 21.1
million a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service. Revenue
gained 2 percent to 495.9 million pounds.  “The Board expects first half trends to continue for the
balance of 2011 resulting in good year on year progress,”
Chairman Christopher Kemball said in the statement.  Berendsen raised its half-year dividend 14 percent to 7.4
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
