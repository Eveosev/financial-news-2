The Libor rate that London-based
banks say they can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months
dropped to a record low 0.005 percent today from 0.00667 percent
yesterday, the British Bankers’ Association said.  Credit Suisse AG submitted a negative three-month Libor for
a seventh straight day, unchanged at minus 0.10 percent, BBA
data show. Citigroup Inc. submitted a rate below zero for the
fifth day, unchanged at negative 0.05 percent.  Societe Generale SA, the third lender to submit a negative
rate among a panel of twelve contributors, offered to borrow at
minus 0.05 percent today, also unchanged from yesterday.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3 as it
attempts to restrain the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
