Stocks could recoup all of the past
month’s losses before reaching “very fair” prices, according
to  David Bianco , chief U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ought to be valued at 14
times to 16 times earnings because 10-year Treasury notes yield
next to nothing after adjusting for inflation, Bianco wrote two
days ago in a report. The index, which fell 13 percent in the
last month, closed yesterday at about 12 times his profit
projection for this year.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares Bianco’s price-earnings range
with annual ratios during the past half-century, as cited in his
report. The figure for 2011 is an estimate, based on his
projections that the index will end the year at 1,400 and  S&P
500  companies will earn a combined $97 a share.  “Low rates benefit P/E more” than slowing economic growth
hurts the ratio, he wrote. Each one-percentage-point decline in
the real yield on 10-year Treasuries increases the fair P/E by
as much as 20 percent, by his calculations.  This year, the note’s unadjusted yield fell 1.07 points
through yesterday to 2.23 percent. Bianco assumed a 3 percent
year-end yield and inflation rate in his report, resulting in
zero real return.  Bianco’s P/E range points to a 6 percent to 7 percent
annual return on the S&P 500 after inflation, which he called
“both fair and attractive” in the report. During the past
half-century, the index’s real return averaged 5.4 percent
annually, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
