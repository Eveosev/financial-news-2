Shipping rates for dry-bulk vessels
are being boosted by rebuilding efforts after the Japanese
earthquake and tsunami increased imports of  iron ore  and
coal since July, Lorentzen & Stemoco AS said.  “From our perspective, the market is better positioned for
a recovery now than at any time during the last three years,”
analyst Nicolai Hansteen at the Oslo-based company wrote in a
report e-mailed today.  Hire costs for capesize vessels that move iron ore and coal
gained 26 percent since July 1, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange. The exchange provides shipping costs on more
than 50 maritime routes.  Japan ’s steel mills and power plants needed ships to import
coal and ore to power industries and rebuild infrastructure,
according to Lorentzen & Stemoco. The higher rates meant owners
of the vessels earned enough to cover all, or nearly all, of
their costs, Hansteen wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
