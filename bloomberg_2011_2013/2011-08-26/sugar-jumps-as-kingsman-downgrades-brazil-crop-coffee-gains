Sugar jumped in London, trimming the
first weekly drop in three, as further downgrades of the crop in
 Brazil , the biggest producer, added to supply worries. Coffee
and cocoa also gained.  Brazil’s sugar cane production in the Center South, the
world’s biggest producing region, will be 498 million metric
tons in the 2011-12 season, down from 525 million tons estimated
in July after last year’s drought and heavy rains this year,
Kingsman SA said. The sugar production estimate was reduced to
30.63 million tons by Kingsman.  “The reduction of the Center South Brazil production this
year has taken many of us by surprise,”  Jonathan Kingsman ,
managing director of the consulting group, wrote in today’s
report.  White, or refined, sugar for October delivery rose $10.40,
or 1.3 percent, to $781.60 a ton by 10:37 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.27 cent, or
0.9 percent, to 29.93 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York.  Investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd. lowered their
estimates for the Center South crop on Aug. 22. Sugar output in
Brazil’s Center South fell 3.4 percent in the first half of
August, industry association Unica said yesterday.  Farmers in the Center South have reaped 297.6 million tons
of cane in the harvest so far, a drop of 12 percent from the
same period a year earlier, Unica said. Mills in the region have
produced 17.4 million tons of sugar this year, down 11 percent
from last year. The harvest usually runs from March through
November.  Robusta for November delivery rose $33, or 1.4 percent, to
$2,395 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for December delivery
rose 0.365 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.7915 a pound in  New
York , the highest since May 11.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 16 pounds, or 0.8 percent,
to 1,926 pounds ($3,145) a ton in London. Cocoa for December
delivery was up $32, or 1 percent, at $3,062 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
