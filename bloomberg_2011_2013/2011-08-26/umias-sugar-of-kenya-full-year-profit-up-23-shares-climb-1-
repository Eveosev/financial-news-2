Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
miller of the sweetener, said full-year profit rose 23 percent
after a one-time gain from asset revaluation. The shares rose
more than 10 percent.  Net income advanced to 1.93 billion shillings ($20.8
million), or 1.26 shillings per share, for the year ended June
30, from 1.57 billion shillings, or 1.03 shillings a share, a
year earlier, the company said in a statement e-mailed out by
the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  today. Net revenue rose to 15.8
billion shillings from 15.6 billion shillings, the company said.  The company gained 3.1 billion shillings after reassessing
assets including property, plant and equipment, Mumias said,
without specifying. Two calls to the mobile phone of managing
director Evans Kidero today didn’t connect.  A 10 percent increase to 353 million shillings in sales of
electricity generated from sugar fiber at a co-generation plant
operated by Mumias helped boost revenue, the company said.  The company is diversifying into ethanol distilling and
water-bottling and is cutting costs to become more competitive,
Mumias said. Safeguards against duty-free sugar imports to Kenya
from the 19-nation  Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa 
trade bloc are due to expire in March 2012.  The ethanol distillery, with a capacity of 22 million
liters annually, is due to start operating by the end of this
year, while the water bottling plant should be running by Sept.
30, according to the company.  “Product diversification will be a key growth driver and
other opportunities are being explored,” Mumias said in the
statement. “Acquisitions and Greenfield operations are being
reviewed and will be implemented where viable to add to
 shareholder value .”  Sugar Prices  Sugar prices in Kenya will likely remain “relatively
high” in the medium term because local processors are unable to
meet increasing demand, Mumias said. Kenyan retail prices for
sugar doubled this year, hitting a record 200 shillings a
kilogram, the Nairobi-based Business Daily reported on Aug. 23,
without saying how it got the information.  Mumias shares rose 10 percent, or 60 cents, to 6.55
shillings at 12:48 p.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
