Czech shares fell, led by banks, as
investors waited to see whether U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke will signal steps to boost the world’s largest
economy at a central bankers’ meeting in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid 0.9 percent to 1,015.5 as
of 10:30 a.m. in Prague, paring its gains so far this week to
2.7 percent.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined
more than 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
