Gutierrez told Bogota-based RCN in an interview.  Grupo Odinsa SA (ODINSA)  , the Bogota-based engineering

said Andres Jimenez, head of international sales at Interbolsa
SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , fell for a second
day by 1.5 percent to 44,120 pesos. The regulator, known as
Superintendencia de Sociedades, opened an investigation into
companies including 10 affiliates of Rubiales on whether they
should be included in a conglomerate for tax purposes, according
to an Aug. 24 statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
