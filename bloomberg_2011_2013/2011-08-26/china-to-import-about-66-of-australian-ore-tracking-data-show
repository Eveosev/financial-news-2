China  will import about 66 percent
of the  iron ore  loaded in the week ended Aug. 25 at  Australia ’s
two largest export facilities, according to ship-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg.  An estimated 35 bulk carriers with a combined capacity of
5.9 million deadweight tons left the ports of  Port Hedland  and
Dampier in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of iron ore.
The ports are the country’s biggest export facilities for iron
ore, used to make steel. Of the total, 23 vessels with a
capacity of 3.9 million tons are destined for ports in China,
according to data captured by satellites and shore-based
antennae.  Following are the ships, destinations and arrival date
where the information is available. Drafts are expressed as a
percentage of the maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size.  Sailings are little changed from a week earlier when 33
bulk carriers with a combined capacity of 5.95 million
deadweight tons left the ports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
