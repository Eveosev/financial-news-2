Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
company, is in talks to sell some exploration and production
assets in  France .  “Talks are ongoing but it is premature to provide further
details,” Total spokeswoman Phenelope Semavoine said today by
e-mail. The Paris-based company is poised to sell oilfields to
Vermilion Energy Inc. and Geopetrol, Bulletin de l’Industrie
Petroliere reported today, without citing anyone.  The company may cede Paris Basin fields to Vermilion, and
others in southwestern France to Vermilion and Geopetrol, with
the assets transferred possibly by end-2012, BIP said. Vermilion
may buy Total’s natural gas field at Lacq in 2013, it reported.  Total produced 5,000 barrels of oil a day in France last
year and 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent with natural gas and
condensate included, according to the company’s annual report.
Global production was 2.34 million barrels a day last year.  Total also holds the Montelimar exploration permit in
southern France on which executives including Jean-Jacques Mosconi, head of strategy, have said no fresh work has been
carried out to determine potential reserves.  The company had planned to probe the area for shale gas
until French lawmakers in June banned the use of hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, a technique needed to explore and
produce the energy trapped within underground rock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
