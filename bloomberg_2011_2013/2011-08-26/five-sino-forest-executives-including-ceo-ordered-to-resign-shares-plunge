The Ontario Securities Commission
ordered five executives of  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  to resign and
issued a halt in the company’s Canadian trading because the firm
may have misrepresented revenue and/or exaggerated its timber
holdings.  Canada ’s main securities regulator released the order
in an emailed statement today.  U.S.-traded shares of Sino-Forest dropped 65 percent to
$1.70.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
