Russian stocks slumped for a second
day, heading for a fifth weekly drop, as oil fell and analysts
forecast crude may retreat further next week after Libyan rebels
consolidate their hold on the North African producer.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 0.7 percent to 1,432.02 as of 11:30
a.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would bring the index’s
weekly decline to 0.5 percent. OAO Lukoil, the country’s second-
biggest oil producer, fell as much as 1.1 percent. OAO
Surgutneftegaz, the fourth-biggest oil producer, and OAO
Novatek, the second-biggest gas producer, both dropped more than
1.6 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index declined 0.4
percent to 1,577.04, trimming its first weekly gain in five
weeks to 0.1 percent.  Crude for October delivery was 44 cents lower at $84.86 a
barrel in electronic trading in  New York . Oil may fall next week
as Libyan rebels consolidate their hold on the country, with 17
of 34 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey forecasting the
commodity’s price will decline through Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
