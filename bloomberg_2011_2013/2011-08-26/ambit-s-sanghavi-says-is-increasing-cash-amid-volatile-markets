Vaibhav Sanghavi, a  fund manager  at
Ambit Capital Ltd., comments on the outlook for the Indian stock
markets. Sanghavi spoke in a phone interview in Mumbai.  On investment strategy:  “We have increased cash and are looking how the global and
domestic scenario pans out. Investors are bearish because of
inflation,  interest rate  tightening, lesser credit growth and
higher non-performing assets. In times of uncertainty, nobody
wants to be overweight. Investment sentiment is cautious. There
is huge uncertainty in equity markets in this volatile global
situation and weakening global economy.”  On valuations:  “Valuations are looking attractive. But on sentimental
basis and immediate-term basis, things are not so good and there
are a lot of variables affecting markets from global to domestic
issues.  India  is still attractive and an investor can invest in
Indian equity markets.”  On QE3:  “If it comes like earlier bond purchases, then you might
see money flowing into commodities, such as oil. QE3 would give
an initial positive impact. But, if commodity prices go up, then
it might not be so good. If QE3 does not occur, it will be good
on a long-term basis for India. There will be downward pressure
on commodities. The U.S. would be prone to recession and fund
flows may reverse in emerging markets, including India.”  QE3 refers to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s third round of
asset purchases, known as quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
