Australia scrum-half Will Genia said
he’s confident of playing in tomorrow’s Tri-Nations rugby
decider against  New Zealand  following concussion concerns.  Genia, who was voted as the best Australian player in this
year’s Super Rugby competition, had been in doubt for the match
in Brisbane after getting hurt in two training-ground collisions
this week.  “All the signs look good,” the 23-year-old Genia said at
a televised news conference. “A lot’s been made of it but it’s
nothing too serious.”  Genia received six stitches to a head injury after
colliding with No. 8 Radike Samo three days ago and was hurt
again yesterday when second-rower  Rob Simmons  landed heavily on
him. Luke Burgess, Genia’s back-up, is yet to play a Test this
year after breaking his hand in June.  The Wallabies are tied with the All Blacks on nine points
atop the Tri-Nations standings as they seek a first southern
hemisphere rugby championship since 2001. The title was also on
the line when the teams last met in Brisbane three years ago.
New Zealand won that match 28-24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
