The Brazilian government may reduce
its estimate for economic expansion in 2011 as debt and growth
concerns in developed nations have led to a slump in stock
markets, a government official said.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s economic team expects Latin
America’s largest economy to expand 3.8 percent to 4 percent
this year, down from a previous forecast of up to 4.5 percent by
the  Finance Ministry , said the person, who asked not to be
identified as the forecast isn’t public.  Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported today that the
government expects 2011 expansion to be below 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
