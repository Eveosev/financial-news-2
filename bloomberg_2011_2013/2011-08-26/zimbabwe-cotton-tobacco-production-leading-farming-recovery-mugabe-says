Zimbabwe ’s agricultural industry is
starting to recover, with cotton and tobacco production
increasing this year, President  Robert Mugabe  said.  Cotton earnings will more than double to about $240 million
in the 2010-11 season compared with a year earlier when farmers
produced 268,800 metric tons of the crop, Mugabe said in a
speech today at an agricultural show in Harare, the capital.
Tobacco earnings rose 6 percent to $359 million this year, he
said.  Agriculture’s contribution to Zimbabwe’s gross domestic
product is 19 percent, Mugabe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
