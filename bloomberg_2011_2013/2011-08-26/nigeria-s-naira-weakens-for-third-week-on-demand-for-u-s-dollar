Nigeria ’s naira headed for a third
weekly drop on demand for the U.S. currency to pay for refined
petroleum and imports of manufactured goods.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
weakened 0.6 percent this week, bringing the naira’s three-week
slide to 1.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It strengthened 0.2 percent to 154.7 per dollar at 5:16 p.m. in
Lagos today.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer and most populous
nation, increased spending and wages this year as it held
elections. Recurrent spending accounts for 74 percent of the
country’s 4.5 trillion naira ($29 billion) budget, Finance
Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said on Aug. 24.  “There is significant, primarily fiscally sponsored,
liquidity that is chasing dollars, hence the surge in currency
demand,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging-market strategist
with Standard Bank Group Plc, said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  The central bank has been using foreign currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its bi-weekly auctions to help
check inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
