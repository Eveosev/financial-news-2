Media Markt founder Erich Kellerhals
plans to block a proposal to continue a cash pooling agreement
with parent company  Metro AG (MEO) ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The arrangement allows Metro subsidiaries to use excess
liquidity generated by Media-Markt for financing at special
rates, the newspaper said.  The move may be voted on at a corporate meeting on Aug. 29
and is part of a feud between Kellerhals and Metro Chief
Executive Officer Eckhard Cordes, Handelsblatt added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
