Colombia ’s peso fell, heading to its
second weekly drop this month, after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  didn’t signal new steps for stimulating growth
in the U.S. and a report showed the world’s biggest economy grew
less than estimated in the second quarter.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 1,794 per dollar at 11:42
a.m. New York time, from 1,790.50 yesterday. It has weakened 0.6
percent this week, after declining 0.6 percent in the period
ended Aug. 5.  The Fed “has a range of tools that could be used to
provide additional monetary stimulus,” Bernanke said in a
speech today to central bankers and economists gathered at an
annual forum in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, without providing details
or signaling when or whether policy makers might deploy them.
The  U.S. economy  expanded at an annualized 1 percent in the
second quarter, down from a previous estimate of 1.3 percent,
Commerce Department figures showed today.  “U.S. growth figures this morning were already prompting
 risk aversion  in markets and leading to declines in the peso,”
said Po Jeng, a currency analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s
biggest brokerage. “The declines continue, helped by the fact
Bernanke failed to announce the new stimulus investors had been
speculating on.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.41 percent.
The price fell 0.117 centavo to 121.032 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
