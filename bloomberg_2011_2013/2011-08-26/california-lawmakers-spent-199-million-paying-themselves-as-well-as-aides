California lawmakers spent almost
$199 million on pay and benefits for themselves and aides last
year, while cutting funds for schools and the poor, state
records show.  The 80-member Assembly went through  $103.3 million  in wages
and benefits from Dec. 1, 2009, through Nov. 30, 2010, according
to information released today by Speaker John Perez, a Los
Angeles Democrat. The 40-member Senate spent $95.5 million
during that same time, data from that chamber show.  The legislature, run by Democrats, has been under pressure
from media and government-watchdog groups such as  Common Cause 
to release its financial records. Until now, only a handful of
lawmakers had provided their payroll data, while Perez had
resisted. The information released today fell short, according
to California Common Cause in  Sacramento .  “We are still left with many unanswered questions,”
Phillip Ung, a policy advocate for the group, said in a
statement. “We have concluded that these documents bare little
new information and avoid detailed descriptions of how money is
spent in the Legislature. Common Cause will continue to advocate
both houses to release detailed spending records which
accurately account for how funds are allocated.”  Senators spent more than $2 million on travel, vehicle and
per-diem expenses during the report period, while the Assembly
spent more than $3 million for such purposes. The senate also
spent about $100,000 on meals and $593,700 on postage, the
records show.  During the period, lawmakers passed the latest budget in
state history after a 100 day impasse with then-Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican, over how to fill a $19 billion
budget gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
