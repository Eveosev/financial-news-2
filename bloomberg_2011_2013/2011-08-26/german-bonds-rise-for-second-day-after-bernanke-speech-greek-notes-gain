German bunds rose for a second day
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained from
signaling additional stimulus measures in a speech today,
maintaining demand for the euro region’s safest assets.  The 10-year bund yield fell to within seven basis points of
a record low. Bernanke said at a conference in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , that the Fed still has tools to stimulate the economy
without signaling when or whether policy makers may use them.
The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.7 percent. Greek
two-year notes advanced, paring their biggest-ever weekly loss.  “We didn’t get anything from Bernanke to justify the
quantitative easing speculation we saw earlier in the week, so
on that front it is a disappointment,” said  Michael Leister , a
fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in  London . “Equities are
suffering. Overall it’s negative for risky assets, which in turn
is positive for bunds and Treasuries.”  The 10-year bund yield dropped four basis points to 2.15
percent as of 4:20 p.m. in London, after earlier falling to
2.10. It fell to a record low 2.03 percent on Aug. 18. The 2.25
percent security due in September 2021 rose 0.350, or 3.50 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,442) face amount, to 100.920.  German two-year yields were unchanged at 0.65 percent. They
dropped to 0.54 percent on Aug. 18, the least since June 2010,
and were at 0.65 percent on Aug. 19.  Bernanke’s statement “gave the market nothing new of
substance, other than a reiteration that the Fed’s growth
outlook is grim and further policy tools are available to
them,”  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, wrote in an e-mailed
report. “Markets now have to wait until the next FOMC for any
possible action,” Chatwell wrote, referring to the Federal Open
Market Committee meeting scheduled in September.  Greek Bonds  Bernanke used his Jackson Hole speech last year to announce
the Fed would “do all that it can” to spur growth. He went on
to implement a $600 billion debt-purchase plan in November.  Greek two-year yields dropped 161 basis points, or 1.61
percentage points, to 43.83 percent, after rising to a euro-era
record 45.91 percent yesterday. They have gained 6.06 percentage
points this week amid concern  Finland ’s demands for loan
collateral will jeopardize a second bailout package for the
nation and may trigger a default.  The nation’s 10-year bond yields fell 43 basis points to
17.85 percent. They climbed to 18.55 percent yesterday, the most
since the introduction of the euro in 1999.  Greece received a three-year, 110-billion-euro rescue from
the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  last year.
The nation sought a second package this year as its economic
woes stymied plans to return to the capital markets in 2012.  Euro-area finance ministry officials will today discuss a
new version of the collateral agreement with Greece that allows
other European creditor countries to participate, the Financial
Times said, citing three European officials it didn’t identify.  Seeking Solution  Euro-area governments are “looking for a solution” to the
dispute over collateral, said  Bertrand Benoit , a spokesman for
the German  finance ministry . Benoit declined to comment in an e-
mailed statement on the Financial Times report.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the issue
of providing collateral to Finland was an obstacle to the new
Greek aid program, as well as to the European Financial
Stability Facility activating its new role.  Venizelos told lawmakers in  Athens  today that Greece was
effectively told by the EU summit on July 21 to seek a bilateral
solution to Finland’s demands for collateral. Greece is aware
there are “very serious, delicate” legal issues involved in
the matter, he said. He repeated that any agreement was pending
approval by euro area finance ministers.  The  European Central Bank  has bought  government bonds  in
the past three weeks in a bid to stop the debt crisis -- which
has engulfed  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  -- from spreading to
Spain and  Italy .  Italian Auction  Italian securities were little changed after the nation
sold 10.5 billion euros of short-maturity debt.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed less than one basis point to
5.07 percent, while the yield on similar-maturity Spanish yields
slipped one basis point to 4.99 percent.  Italy sold six-month bills at an average yield of 2.14
percent. Investors bid for 1.66 times the amount on offer. That
compares with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.56 at the
previous auction of similar-maturity bills on July 26, which
were sold at 2.269 percent. The nation also sold zero-coupon
notes due in April 2013 at an average yield of 3.408 percent.  The country plans to sell as much as 3.75 billion euros of
a new 10-year bond on Aug. 30, and up to 4.25 billion euros of
securities maturing in 2014 and 2018.  Irish two-year notes advanced, pushing the yield on the
securities down as much as 74 basis points to 7.82 percent, the
least since March 3, before settling at 8.41 percent. The
nation’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points to 8.82 percent.  German government bonds have returned 5.5 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have returned a gain of 7.1 percent. Greek bonds have lost 23
percent and Spanish bonds have gained 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
