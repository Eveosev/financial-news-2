Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
 Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  failed
to sell 500 million euros ($721 million) in loans granted to
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for the leveraged buyout of German clothing
retailer Jack Wolfskin to investors,  Reuters  reported yesterday,
citing people familiar with the matter.  The banks are now evaluating to try again in half a year
when markets may have calmed down, or issue high-yield bonds,
Reuters said. Should the transaction fail, it would be the first
time the placement of an LBO loan in Europe falters, Reuters
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
