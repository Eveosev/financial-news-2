Insurers may face as much as $1.1
billion in losses in the Caribbean from Hurricane Irene,
according to catastrophe risk-modeler AIR Worldwide.  The storm may cause at least $500 million in damage,
Boston-based AIR said today in an e-mailed statement. Between
$300 million and $700 million of damages could occur in the
Bahamas, according to the statement.  “Irene’s large size meant that almost all of the Bahamas
was subject to strong winds for more than a day,” said Scott
Stransky, a scientist at AIR, in the statement.  Irene, which whipped through the Bahamas yesterday, is
forecast to strike the coast of  North Carolina  with winds of 105
miles (169 kilometers) per hour tomorrow before turning toward
the U.S. Northeast. The storm has forced evacuations along the
coasts of  New Jersey  and North Carolina and prompted governors
of states from North Carolina to  Connecticut  to declare states
of emergency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
