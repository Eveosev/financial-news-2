Amtrak , the U.S. long-distance
passenger railroad, canceled all trains on its Northeast
Corridor between  Washington  and Boston for Aug. 28 as Hurricane
Irene approaches.  Amtrak, based in Washington, will reduce service in areas
north of Washington tomorrow and eliminate it the next day, it
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Amtrak yesterday canceled train service for today and
through the weekend south of Washington as the storm was
forecast to travel north along the U.S. East Coast.  Cancellations in Northeast states include all trains on the
Northeast Corridor including the Acela Express; the Keystone
Corridor between New York and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; the
Springfield Line between New Haven, Connecticut, and
Springfield, Massachusetts; the Empire Service between  New York 
and Albany, New York; the Vermonter between St. Albans, Vermont
and Washington; and the Piedmont Service between Raleigh and
Charlotte, North Carolina.  Passengers with tickets to travel on trains that are
canceled may receive refunds or rebook for future travel with
no penalty, Amtrak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
