Indian Oil Corp. and state-run rival
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. led refiners in boosting the country’s
crude processing for the eighth straight month in July.  Refiners turned 14.5 million metric tons of crude into
fuels, 3.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the oil ministry
said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing by state-owned Indian Oil, the nation’s largest
refiner, rose 4 percent to 4.7 million tons after its plant at
Haldia in West Bengal state increased production by 40 percent.
Hindustan Petroleum, based in Mumbai, raised output 60 percent
to 1.5 million tons.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, processed 3 million tons, an increase of 0.1
percent. Smaller rival  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)  cut output 14 percent.
Reliance didn’t provide data for its newer, 29 million ton-a-
year refinery, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
