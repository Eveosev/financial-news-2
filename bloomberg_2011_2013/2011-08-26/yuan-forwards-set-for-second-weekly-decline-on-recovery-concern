Yuan forwards completed a second
weekly decline before a report that economists predict will show
U.S. growth in the last quarter was less than previously
forecast, adding to evidence the global recovery is faltering.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the reference rate for yuan
trading at 6.3950 per dollar today, the second consecutive day
it has been weakened. The Chinese currency is not ready for
rapid appreciation because of the “immaturity” of  Asia ’s
largest economy, Nobel laureate Myron Scholes said in an
interview, according to a report published late yesterday by the
official Xinhua News Agency.  “The general condition of risk appetite is quite poor at
the moment,” said  Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong. “We do
expect more yuan appreciation, but it may not be forthcoming
until the final quarter of this year.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.08 percent
this week to 6.2934 as of 4:36 p.m. in  Hong Kong , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were little changed
today. The premium to the onshore spot rate was 1.5 percent.  The yuan strengthened 0.1 percent this week and 0.05
percent today to close at 6.3868 per dollar, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the currency was little changed this week and rose 0.03
percent today to 6.3745.  Data to be released today will show the world’s biggest
economy grew an annualized 1.1 percent in the second quarter
from the previous three months, less than last month’s estimate
of 1.3 percent, according to the median estimate of 80
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Yuan Undervalued  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said today
the yuan is undervalued using “any objective gauge,” three
days after  Japan  said the Group of 20 nations should discuss the
Chinese currency.  “It would be beneficial to the global economy, and indeed
beneficial to the Chinese people, for there to be more
flexibility,” Stevens said. The Chinese central bank “would do
more on this immediately if it were their call, but it isn’t,”
he said. “Exchange-rate regimes are a government decision.”  --Judy Chen, Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
