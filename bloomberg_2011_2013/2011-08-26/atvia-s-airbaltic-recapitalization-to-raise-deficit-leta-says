The Latvian government must find
additional savings in next year’s budget if it decides to invest
in the capital of airline AirBaltic AS, the  Leta  newswire
reported, citing Finance Ministry spokesman Aleksis Jarockis.  The government is considering providing capital for the
majority state-owned airline following a loss of about 34.2
million lati ($69.5 million) last year if the chief executive
officer steps down and the state assumes management control,
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview on
 Latvijas Radio  on Aug. 24.  The state owns 52.6 percent of AirBaltic while Baltic
Aviation Systems has 47.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
