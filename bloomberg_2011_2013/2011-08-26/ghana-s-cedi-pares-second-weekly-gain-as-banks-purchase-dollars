Ghana ’s cedi weakened against the
dollar, paring a second week of increases, as banks bought the
U.S. currency to meet demand from their corporate clients.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much 0.3 percent to 1.5307 per dollar before
trading at 1.5247 per dollar as of 1:30 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That took the
currency’s advance this week to 0.2 percent.  “The cedi weakened slightly today amid dollar buying by
banks,” Kobla Nyaletey, a currency trader at the local unit of
Barclays Bank Plc said in a telephone interview. “The purchases
were on behalf of corporate clients,” Nyaletey said, declining
to comment further.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
