Ethanol surged to a four-week high
in  Chicago  on concern hot weather in the Midwest will lead to
higher production costs and amid robust export demand.  Futures gained on speculation that the heat damaged the
corn crop, affecting the supply of the primary ethanol
feedstock. U.S.  exports  of the biofuel averaged 62,000 barrels a
day through May, according to the Energy Department, more than
twice the average of 26,000 for all of last year.  “We’ve seen export business and blending business,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “Corn is part of it. If we have a short corn crop that’s
going to make it hard for processing.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 3.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.929 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since July 28. Futures are up 23 percent this
year.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York  at
$3.03 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $3.02, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago declined 5.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$2.90 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.06.  Blackford said demand is also buoyed by refiners looking to
capture the 45-cent tax credit provided for each gallon of the
fuel blended into gasoline as they anticipate it expiring at the
end of this year.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 3.33 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.9346 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 23.5 cents, or
3.2 percent, to settle at $7.67 a bushel in Chicago. The grain
is up 74 percent in the past year.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 19 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
