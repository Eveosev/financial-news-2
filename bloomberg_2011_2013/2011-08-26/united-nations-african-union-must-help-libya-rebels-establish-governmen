The  United Nations  and  African Union 
must help  Libya ’s “new leaders to establish an effective,
legitimate government” in the country, Asha-Rose Migiro, UN
deputy secretary-general, said.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has “taken note of the
chairman of the National Transitional Council’s and the other
NTC leaders’ public affirmations of their intent to build a new
nation founded on the principle of freedom, equality and
transparency,” Migiro told reporters in  Ethiopia ’s capital,
 Addis Ababa , today. She was speaking at the opening of the AU’s
security panel meeting.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
