Kevin Pietersen  will be rested
during the England cricket team’s one-day series with  India .  Pietersen, who plays all three formats of the game, will be
part of the Twenty20 squad to face India on Aug. 31 in
Manchester. He’ll then sit out the five-match one-day series
that starts Sept. 3 in Durham.  “The decision to omit Kevin Pietersen from the one-day
squad is in line with our policy of managing player workloads
and will give the opportunity to another batsman to test himself
at number four,” Geoff Miller, England cricket’s national
selector, said in a statement.  Jos Buttler and Alex Hales were named to the Twenty20 squad
for the first time. Ben Stokes, who made his debut in
yesterday’s win over Ireland, was also included.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
