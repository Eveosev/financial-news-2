Boeing Co. (BA)  is replacing its
commercial-jet sales chief, Marlin Dailey, a month after rival
Airbus SAS made inroads into one of the U.S. planemaker’s top
customers,  American Airlines , a person familiar with the matter
said.  Ray Conner, who had been head of sales before Dailey’s
appointment to the job in December 2008, will return to the
post, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.
Dailey has been offered another job with Boeing, the person
said. The move may be announced today, the person said.  Mark Hooper, a spokesman at Chicago-based Boeing’s commercial
headquarters, declined to comment.   American, which had been an exclusively Boeing customer,
last month split an order for 460 new jets between the two
planemakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
