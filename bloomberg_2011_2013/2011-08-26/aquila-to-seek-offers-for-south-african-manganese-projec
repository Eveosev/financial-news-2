Aquila Resources Ltd. (AQA)  will seek bids
for its Avontuur manganese project in  South Africa  as part of a
plan to raise about A$1 billion ($1 billion) selling assets.  An information document will be sent to more than 20
potential bidders in the next two weeks, Perth-based Aquila said
in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg. The project
is valued at about A$500 million, according to a June estimate
from Patersons Securities Ltd.  Aquila is seeking to sell three assets, including Avontuur,
to help fund its share of the A$5.2 billion West Pilbara Iron
Ore joint venture project with AMCI Inc. to be built in  Western
Australia . Avontuur, in which Aquila has a 74 percent stake, may
produce as much as 2 million metric tons of manganese, the
company has said.  Separately, Aquila has drawn up a shortlist of bidders for
the Washpool coking coal project in Queensland, and hopes to
announce a sale by early November, according to an e-mailed
response to questions. The project is valued at about A$366
million, Patersons said in June. The company declined to comment
on the number of bidders.  Aquila fell 1.3 percent to A$6.13 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
Sydney trading. The stock has declined 16 percent in the past 12
months.  Peabody Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal are among companies
seeking to buy coal assets in  Australia  as demand rises in China
and  India , the worldâ€™s fastest-growing major economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
