The Turkish lira strengthened after
trade data for July showed a lower-than-expected deficit,
backing the central bank’s efforts to try and narrow the
current-account gap without hampering growth.  The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.7538 to the  U.S. dollar  at
5:51 p.m., posting the biggest weekly gain since June.  Turkey ’s
trade deficit was $9 billion in July, the statistics office in
Ankara said today, below the average estimate of $9.5 billion
forecast by six economists on Bloomberg.  “London sharks had big exposure long U.S dollar against
the lira, and it looks like they chose to reduce their
positions,” said Henza Tukel, a currency trader at Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi AS in Istanbul.  The Turkish lira this year has been the world’s worst-
performing of 31 major currencies measured by Bloomberg, losing
14 percent. It has gained 1.9 percent in the past week.  Turkish markets will close for a religious holiday on the
afternoon of Aug. 29 and re-open on Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
