Cyprus’s parliament approved a 220
million euro ($319 million) austerity package today in a bid to
prevent rising borrowing costs from forcing the euro area’s
third-smallest economy into an international bailout.  The package cuts public payrolls and requires civil
servants to make contributions toward their pensions. Lawmakers
also raised tax rates on dividends, interest and income,
introduced an annual business registration fee and increased
property taxes.  Cyprus, rocked by a July 11 explosion that destroyed its
largest power station and knocked out more than half of its
electricity-generating capacity, is trying to slash this year’s
budget deficit to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product from a
projected 6.5 percent and cut it below 2 percent in 2012.  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings have all downgraded Cyprus’s credit rating since the
blast amid concern it would become the fourth European Union
nation to require a bailout.  Lawmakers today postponed a vote on an increase in the
value-added tax that had been urged by Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias. He said on Aug. 24 that the fiscal package “may not
be sufficient” and promised additional budget cuts for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
