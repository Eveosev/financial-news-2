Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate strengthened to a record as the U.S.
benchmark’s discount to Brent widened the third day in a row.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts gained 90
cents to $26.22 a barrel at 1:24 p.m. in  New York . The spread
settled Aug. 19 at a record margin of $26.21.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added $2.25 to $28.25 a barrel over
WTI at 12:19 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained $1.25 to $25 a
barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 50 cents to $23.25 while Poseidon strengthened $1.50
to $23 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.50 to $21 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 15 cents to 85 cents.
Thunder Horse’s premium added 90 cents to $26.50 above the
benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude added $1 to $13.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The spread for Western Canada Select narrowed 70 cents to a
discount of $11.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
