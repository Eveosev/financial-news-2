Bunge Ltd. (BG) , Argentina’s second-
biggest corn exporter, must be returned to the Argentine tax
agency’s grain exporters’ registry, an  appeals court said .  The tax agency, known as AFIP, must “refrain from
suspending or excluding,”  White Plains , New York-based Bunge
from its registry, federal judges Ignacio Velez Funes, Luis
Martinez and Roque Rebak said in a ruling dated yesterday. AFIP
didn’t give Bunge enough time to defend itself against its
exclusion from the registry in May, the judges said.  Exclusion from the registry means the company lost certain
sales tax breaks within Argentina and had limited access to
permits required to transport grain. AFIP has said Bunge
underpaid about $252 million in taxes between 2007 and 2009.  Cargill Inc. is Argentina’s biggest corn exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
