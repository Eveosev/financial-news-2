KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
a London-listed Kazakh oil producer, said it “‘stabilized’’
output at its Uzenmunaigaz unit after replacing fired workers.  Employees at Uzenmunaigaz’s transport division went on
strike on July 9 over pay. About 900 of Uzenmunaigaz’s 9,000
employees were fired because of their ‘‘illegal” action,
Mikhail Dorofeyev, an Astana-based KazMunaiGas EP spokesman,
said today by telephone. The company has hired about 500 workers
as a replacement, he said.  KazMunaiGas EP’s oil output may miss its target for the
year by 800,000 metric tons, or 6 percent of its total
production, the oil producer said in a statement, citing the
strike among reasons for the decline. That is the same level
expected in July, compared with a June estimate of 600,000 tons.  About 25 employees are still refusing to work compared with
a peak of around 2,500 people in June, Dorofeyev said.
KazMunaiGas EP said it hired workers from among the residents of
nearby areas.  The company has also fired about 400 protesting workers,
out of the 4,500-strong workforce, at its Karazhanbasmunai
venture with  China ’s Citic Group in western  Kazakhstan , he said.  Natalya Sokolova, a lawyer who led a strike at
Karazhanbasmunai, was sentenced to six years in prison this
month, the Vremya newspaper  reported  on Aug. 9.  KazMunaiGas EP shares have dropped 24 percent since May 17,
when the strike started at Karazhanbasmunai. The stock rose 0.5
percent to $15.45 at close in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
