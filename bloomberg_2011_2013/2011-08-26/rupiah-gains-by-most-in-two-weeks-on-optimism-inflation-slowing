Indonesia ’s rupiah had its biggest
gain in more than two weeks on speculation foreign investors are
buying the nation’s assets as consumer-price gains ease.  The currency rebounded from a two-week low after Perry Warjiyo, director of economic research at the central bank, said
inflation in 2011 may be less than 4.9 percent as commodity
prices decline, compared with 6.96 percent last year. Offshore
funds have increased holdings of government bonds by 26 percent
this year through Aug. 23 to 246 trillion rupiah ($28.7 billion).  “We saw some foreign buying today,” said Wirianto
Hadiputra, senior assistant vice president at PT Bank Panin in
Jakarta. “Overseas investors certainly take a view of inflation
before purchasing bonds and currency.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,568 against the
dollar as of 5:26 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 8,605 earlier, the weakest level since Aug.
9. The currency was little changed from the end of last week.  The yield on the 8.25 percent  government bonds  due July
2021 declined nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, this
week to 6.85 percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate was little changed.  Local markets will be closed next week for the Id-ul-Fitr
holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
