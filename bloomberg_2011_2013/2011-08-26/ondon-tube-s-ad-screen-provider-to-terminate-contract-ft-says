CBS Outdoor Inc., which provides a
digital-screen advertising system for the  London  Underground
subway, said yesterday it will terminate its contract in March,
three years early, the Financial Times reported.  The company is suing London Underground for tens of
millions of pounds, claiming that screen-installation was
delayed by subway construction projects, causing CBS Outdoor’s
costs to overrun, the newspaper said.  London Underground, known as the Tube, says it met all its
obligations and any delay was the sole responsibility of CBS
Outdoor, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
