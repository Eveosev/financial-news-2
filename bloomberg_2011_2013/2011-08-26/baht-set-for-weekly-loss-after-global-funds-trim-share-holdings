Thailand ’s baht was poised for a
third weekly loss this month after global investors reduced
holdings of the nation’s assets.  The baht touched a two-week low today after exchange data
showed international funds sold $471 million more shares than
they bought this week through yesterday, taking net sales this
month to $1.2 billion. The currency may be supported by official
data released yesterday that showed exports rose 38.3 percent in
July from a year earlier, the most in 13 months, according to
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.  “The global economic uncertainties are making investors
risk averse and put downward pressure on Asian currencies
through stock sales,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on
the Asian and emerging-markets team at  Mizuho Corporate Bank  in
 Tokyo . “Money may eventually return to Thailand as its economy
looks quite solid.”  The baht slid 0.5 percent this week to 29.98 per dollar as
of 8:25 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which was little changed today, touched
30.03 earlier, the lowest level since Aug. 9. It may trade
between 29.80 and 30.20 next week, Shiroki said.  The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.40 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, declined 1.5 basis points
to 3.42 percent today, trimming this week’s advance to 29.5
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
