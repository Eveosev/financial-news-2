Switzerland ’s economic barometer
fell in August, adding to signs the franc’s rise and a faltering
euro-region economy may hurt the country’s economic growth.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead dropped to 1.61 from a revised
1.98 in July, the  KOF Swiss Economic Institute  in Zurich said in
an e-mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since November
2009. Economists expected the gauge to decline to 1.8, the
median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Switzerland’s economy is showing some signs of cooling as
the franc’s 14 percent gain versus the euro over the past year
and faltering demand in the single-currency area are curbing
export growth.  Consumer confidence  fell to the lowest in more
than two years in July as exports declined 3 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
