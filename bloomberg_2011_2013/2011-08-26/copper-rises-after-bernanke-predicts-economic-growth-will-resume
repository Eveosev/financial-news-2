Copper rose, capping the first
weekly gain in a month, as investors took assurance from Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s prediction that growth will
resume in the U.S.  “The growth fundamentals of the  United States  do not
appear to have been permanently altered,” Bernanke said today
in a speech at an annual forum in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. “We
can reasonably expect to see a return to growth rates and
employment levels consistent with those underlying
fundamentals.” He didn’t signal new steps for stimulating
growth. The U.S. is the world’s largest copper user after China.  “The fact that Bernanke didn’t need to act tells people
that maybe we are not going to fall into a recession,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a strategist at MF Global in Chicago, said in an
e-mail.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 1.95 cent, or 0.5
percent, to close at $4.1175 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . The price gained 2.9 percent for the week, after
dropping 11 percent in the previous three weeks on concern the
global economic recovery is faltering.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery added $45, or 0.5 percent, to $9,075 a metric ton
($4.12 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also gained in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
