 JPMorgan Chase & Co. sees  Mexico â€™s
central bank cutting  interest rates  by 25 basis points in
December of this year, said  Gabriel Casillas , chief Mexico
economist.  The forecast is a change from the previous expectation of a
long pause before an increase in the second half of next year,
Casillas said today in a telephone interview from Mexico City.  Banxico, as the central bank is known, may be concerned
with economic fundamentals and the risk of slower growth, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
