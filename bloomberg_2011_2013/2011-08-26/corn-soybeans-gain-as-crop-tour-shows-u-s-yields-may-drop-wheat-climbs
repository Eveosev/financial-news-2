Corn futures rose to an 11-week
high, and soybeans jumped to the highest in almost five months
on concerns that hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest is eroding
crop yields. Wheat also gained.  U.S. farmers may harvest 12.484 billion bushels of corn
this year, the Professional Farmers of America newsletter said
today after completing a four-day tour of Midwest fields. The
estimate was 3.3 percent below the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s forecast. Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest growers
of corn and soybeans, had the hottest July since 1955, and
rainfall has been below normal this month.  “The markets are more and more focused on the supply side
of the grains and the threats there,”  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana , said in a
telephone interview. “There’s a lot of nervousness as to what’s
out in those fields.”  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 23.5 cents, or
3.2 percent, to settle at $7.67 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.685, the
highest for a most-active contract since June 9. The commodity
is up 15 percent this month.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 30.75 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $14.235 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed touched
$14.26, the highest since March 31.  Pro Farmer projected soybean production at 3.083 billion
bushels, or 0.9 percent above the USDA’s estimate. The forecasts
were released after markets closed in Chicago.  ‘A Little Bearish’  The higher soybean forecast was “a little bit bearish,”
and may push prices lower next week, said  Christian Mayer , a
market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in
 Minneapolis .  “August is still an important time for beans,” Mayer said
in a telephone interview. “We haven’t seen a lot of great rain
lately, so there are still areas that are concerning. They could
surely use some rain, or we may see things deteriorate
further.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $7.97 a bushel on the CBOT. The price is
up 4.7 percent this week, the fifth straight weekly gain.  Futures were supported by speculation that U.S. spring-crop
yields will be lower than the government expects, and concerns
that dry weather will harm plants in the Great Plains, Mayer
said.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show. Wheat ranks fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
