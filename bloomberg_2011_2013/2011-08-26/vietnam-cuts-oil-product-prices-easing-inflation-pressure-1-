Vietnam  reduced the price of oil
products by as much as 2.3 percent after inflation surged to a
33-month high.  The cost of 92-RON gasoline, the most commonly used fuel
grade, was cut to 20,800 dong ($1) a liter from 21,300 dong,
effective 9 p.m. local time today, according to a  statement  on
the government’s website. Diesel was lowered to 20,800 dong a
liter from 21,100 dong and kerosene to 20,500 dong a liter from
20,800 dong, the statement showed.  The Southeast Asian nation has been trying to slow  Asia ’s
fastest inflation, stoked by increases in fuel and electricity
prices. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung’s government has shifted
its focus from growth to taming rising prices through reducing
targets for credit growth and the  budget deficit .  The cut in petroleum prices “would help slow the growth
pace of food and goods prices, which might help ease inflation
pressure,” Giang Trung Kien, head of research at FPT Securities
Joint Stock Co. in Hanoi, said before the announcement.  Petroleum is a “very important” commodity as it goes into
the production of many products, said Alan Pham, chief economist
at VinaCapital Investment Management Ltd.  Consumer prices increased 23.02 percent in August from a
year earlier, the fastest rate among 17 Asian economies tracked
by Bloomberg.  The Southeast Asian nation will find it “very difficult”
to slow inflation to 17 percent by the end of 2011, Ha Van Hien,
former head of the National Assembly’s Economic Committee, said
on July 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
