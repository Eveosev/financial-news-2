Sociedad Comercial del Plata SA (COME) , an
Argentine holding company that defaulted on $350 million of debt
in 1999, surged on speculation there will be an agreement over
the restructuring of its obligations.  The shares jumped 11 percent to 72 centavos at 2:35 p.m. in
 New York , and earlier increased to 73 centavos, the highest
price in two weeks.  “There’s probably speculation surrounding the repayment of
their defaulted debt,” said Juan Jose Vazquez, an equity
analyst at Bull Market Brokers SA. “The market cap is very
small so it has very big fluctuations easily.”  Shares could plunge after a Sept. 20 vote on a proposal to
issue stock equivalent to 80 percent of the company to repay
creditors, according to Thomas Mullen, a general partner at TWM
Capital LP, who holds about 10 percent of the debt. Bond holders
are seeking to obtain 95 percent of the company, he said.  Shares would be diluted as a result of the issuance, said
Mullen. “If no agreement is reached, the company will be
liquidated, so there is a big incentive to negotiate,” he said.  Shares have increased 22 percent this year.  Press officials at Sociedad Comercial del Plata weren’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
