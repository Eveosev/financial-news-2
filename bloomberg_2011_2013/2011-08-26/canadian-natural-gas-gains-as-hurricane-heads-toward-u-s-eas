Canadian natural gas rose on concern
that Hurricane Irene bearing down on the U.S. East Coast will
disrupt local supplies and increase the need for exports.  Irene, with winds now at about 105 miles (169 kilometers)
per hour, will probably strike the coast of  North Carolina 
tomorrow with winds of 115 miles (169 kilometers) per hour
before turning toward states in the northeast, according to the
National Hurricane Center. The storm may cause some pipelines
and gas-consuming chemical plants to shut, said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  “The market is trying to determine if Irene is bullish or
bearish,” Flynn said. “Gas has been a little bit oversold.”  Alberta  gas for September rose 3.25 cents to C$3.45 per
gigajoule ($3.32 per million British thermal units) as of 2:10
p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Gas for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 0.7 cent to $3.924 per million Btu.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet, 294 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.99 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.87 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.25 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.51 billion cubic feet today, about 55
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.74
billion cubic feet at 11:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
