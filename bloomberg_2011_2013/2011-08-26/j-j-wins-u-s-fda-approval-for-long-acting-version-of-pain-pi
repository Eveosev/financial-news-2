Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  won U.S. clearance
to sell an extended-release version of the Nucynta pain drug.  The  Food and Drug Administration  approved the twice-daily
pill, also known as tapentadol, to treat chronic pain in adults,
the company said today in a statement. The therapy, an opiate,
has crush-resistant properties to deter abuse.  The shorter-acting version of  New Brunswick , New Jersey-
based J&J’s drug gained FDA approval in November 2008 for acute
pain. The  Drug Enforcement Administration  classifies Nucynta as
a schedule II  controlled substance , meaning distribution is
restricted because of a high potential for abuse. Sales of
Nucynta may reach $262 million next year, according to the
average estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  J&J, the world’s second-biggest maker of health products,
said in October that the extended-release version had failed to
win approval because the FDA wanted more information about the
drug’s tamper-resistant formulation. The company submitted the
additional data in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
