Total SA (FP)  is poised to sell French
oilfields to Vermilion Energy Inc. and Geopetrol, Bulletin de
l’Industrie Petroliere said today, without citing anyone.  It may cede fields in the Paris Basin to Vermilion, and
others in southwestern  France  to Vermilion and Geopetrol, with
assets transferred possibly by end-2012, it reported. Vermilion
may buy Total’s natural gas field at Lacq in 2013, BIP said.  Total produced 5,000 barrels of oil a day in France last
year and 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent with natural gas and
condensate included, according to the company’s annual report.
Global production was 2.34 million barrels a day last year.  Total spokeswoman Phenelope Semavoine declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
