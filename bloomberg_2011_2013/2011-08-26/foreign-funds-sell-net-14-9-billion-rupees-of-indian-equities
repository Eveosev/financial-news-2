Overseas funds sold a net 14.9
billion rupees ($323.9 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
turning net sellers of the nation’s stocks this year, the
country’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 31.3 billion rupees of shares and sold
46.2 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold a net 5.04 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their flows into debt this year to 186.7 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from equities in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.466 trillion rupees in stocks and 968.4 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
