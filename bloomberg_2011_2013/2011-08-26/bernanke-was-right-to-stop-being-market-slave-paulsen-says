James Paulsen , chief investment
strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management,
comments on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
statement today in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  Bernanke said the central bank still has tools to stimulate
the economy. He didn’t provide details or signal when or whether
policy makers might deploy them. Paulsen, whose company oversees
$340 billion, spoke in a telephone interview.  On the Fed’s relationship to the stock market:  “The Fed basically started to break the precedent that was
established where it has become a slave to the market. The
market whines, and the Fed jumps. That’s a dangerous precedent.
If they can stick to this and let the market find its own
bottom, they will come out of this stronger. People will start
to develop some confidence that this thing can recover on its
own without Fed assistance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
