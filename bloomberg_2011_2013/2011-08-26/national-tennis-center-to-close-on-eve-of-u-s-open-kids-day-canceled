The  U.S. Open  tennis tournament will
close its grounds starting tomorrow afternoon and stay closed
through Aug. 28, the day before the event is to start, because
of the threat posed by Hurricane Irene.  “The tournament site will close no later than 5 p.m. on
Saturday, Aug. 27,” the season’s final Grand Slam tournament
said in a statement. Its Flushing Meadows,  New York , site will
remain closed on Aug. 28. The event is scheduled to begin on
Aug. 29.  Tournament organizers also canceled their annual Arthur
Ashe Kids’ Day, scheduled for tomorrow.  The hurricane is forecast to hit the New York area on
Sunday.  The U.S. Open has been hampered by bad weather in recent
years. The past three men’s finals have been played on the
Monday after the finals weekend because of rain.  Unlike Wimbledon and the Australian Open, the  U.S. Open 
doesn’t have a roof over its main stadium court. The  French Open 
is planning to build a retractable roof over its main court,
which will leave the New York tournament as the only tennis
major without a roof.  To contact the reporter on this story:
