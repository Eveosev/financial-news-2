Oltchim SA, a Romanian chemical
company, said it will cut output for the second month in
September after it reduced production to 30 percent of installed
capacity in August, according to a statement to the Bucharest
Stock Exchange today.  A shortage in working capital and a lack of row materials
led to the lower output, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
