Evergreen Marine Corp., part of
 Asia ’s second-biggest container line, suffered a 98 percent
decline in second-quarter profit after cargo rates fell.  Net income was NT$81 million ($2.8 million) in the three
months ended June 30, compared with NT$4.12 billion a year
earlier, based on first-half results announced today by the
Taipei-based company. The figure was in line with the NT$81.9
million average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Container rates have tumbled this year as expansion in the
global fleet outpaces demand for shipments of Asian-made toys,
furniture and auto parts to the U.S. and Europe. Fuel prices
also averaged 35 percent higher than a year earlier,
contributing to losses at China Cosco Holdings Co. and Neptune
Orient Lines Ltd., the parents of Asia’s first and third-ranked
container lines.  Evergreen climbed 0.8 percent to NT$18.60 at the 1:30 p.m.
close in Taipei trading, before the earnings announcement. The
stock has fallen 39 percent this year, compared with the
benchmark Taiex Index’s 17 percent decline.  First-half net income was NT$1.39 billion, compared with
NT$4.03 billion a year earlier, Evergreen said in a Taiwan stock
exchange statement today.  China Cosco’s container revenue fell 3.4 percent in the
first half, even as volumes increased 9.8 percent. Its average
rates on trans-Pacific routes declined 4 percent, while Asia-
 Europe  rates dropped 28 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
