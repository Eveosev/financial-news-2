Bank of Korea  Governor Kim Choong Soo said he was concerned with rising core inflation in South
Korea and would have to continue to “normalize” monetary
policy unless the global economy returned to recession.  “As long as the world economy is not facing the so-called
double dip or recessions we have to continue our efforts to
normalize our interest rate,” Kim said from  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  Earlier this month the Bank of Korea kept  interest rates 
unchanged for a second month after an increase in June. Kim and
his board held the benchmark seven-day repurchase rate at 3.25
percent. Consumer prices in South Korea rose 4.7 percent last
month from a year earlier, the biggest gain in four months and
exceeding the central bank’s 4 percent target limit for a
seventh straight month.  “Of course, CPI as a whole is a matter of concern but what
I’m concerned more about is rising  core inflation ,” Kim said,
referring to costs excluding food and fuel. “Our projection is
that the CPI is likely to fall whereas core inflation is likely
to remain. The impact on the future inflation is more from the
core inflation rather than CPI.”  South Korea should raise its benchmark interest rate to at
least 4 percent over time and allow its currency to appreciate
further to help fight inflation, the  International Monetary Fund 
said on Aug. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
