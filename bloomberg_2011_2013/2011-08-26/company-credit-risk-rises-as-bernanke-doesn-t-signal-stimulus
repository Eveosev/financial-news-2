Investor confidence in U.S.
corporate credit extended a decline after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank has tools to
stimulate the economy without saying if they will be deployed.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 3.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 129 basis points as of 10:13 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Traders pushed the benchmark gauge to the highest since
June 2010, signaling a deterioration in credit confidence. The
index is poised for its fifth weekly increase and is up from
92.6 on July 22 as economists at Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut estimates for growth. Bernanke is speaking today
at a central bank symposium in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
