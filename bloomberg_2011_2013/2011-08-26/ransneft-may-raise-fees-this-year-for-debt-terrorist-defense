OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, may gain approval to raise rates this year to pay off
expansion costs and ward off “terrorists.”  The Federal Tariff Service will review proposed increases
in pumping rates of an average 2.8 percent on Sept. 1 and 5
percent from Nov. 1 at a meeting on Aug. 31, Denis Volkov, the
regulator’s head of oil and gas regulation, said by phone today.  Transneft asked for rate increases at it repays debt raised
to build pipelines to deliver crude to the  Baltic Sea  and across
Siberia to the Pacific coast, Igor Dyomin, a Transneft
spokesman, said by telephone today.  The operator also plans to develop a security system to
defend its pipeline network from “terrorists” and “thieves,”
Dyomin said. Transneft earns its revenue from pipeline fees.  Transneft won’t get to raise rates next year after the
September and November increases, the Vedomosti newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
