The  International Olympic Committee 
has lifted the suspension of  Ghana ’s national Olympic
organization after the country adopted new sports legislation,
the organization said.  The west African nation had been banned since January after
the IOC said its government had intervened in the running of its
Olympic committee.  “The Ghanaian parliament’s recently adopted new sports
legislation is compatible with the Olympic charter,” the IOC’s
executive board said in an e-mail after its meeting today in
Daegu,  South Korea .  The ban has been lifted with immediate effect, ensuring
Ghana will be able to send a team to next year’s  London
Olympics . The country has won four Olympic medals, three in
boxing and one in soccer, but never a gold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
