Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd.,
owned by Essar Energy Plc and the East African state, has
secured a $13.5 million loan from  Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL)  to
build a 9.3 megawatt power plant, said Bimal Mukherjee, the fuel
company’s chief executive officer.  The plant will help ensure stable electricity supply to the
refinery, Mukherjee said in an interview yesterday in the port
city of Mombasa.  The sole fuel processor in  East Africa ’s biggest economy
often suffers power outages due to a national shortage of energy
and aging infrastructure. Shutdowns due to electricity issues
reduced fuel output by about 9 percent at the start of this
year, according to Mukherjee.  The planned conversion to a merchant refinery from a
tolling refinery is estimated to cost the company $450 Million
by January, he said. KPRL, as the company is known, said
yesterday it will end all tolling deals and sell its fuels
directly to distributors. In a tolling arrangement a company
provides the feedstock and collects the finished product, paying
a fee for processing.  The KPRL refinery has a capacity to process 90,000 barrels
a day of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
