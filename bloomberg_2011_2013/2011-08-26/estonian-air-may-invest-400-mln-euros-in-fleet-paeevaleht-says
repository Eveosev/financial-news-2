AS Estonian Air, the countryâ€™s
national carrier, may invest as much as 400 million euros ($577
million) to enlarge its fleet to 15 aircraft,  Eesti Paeevaleht 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The airline wants to double the fleet in four years and
increase the number of destinations to 30 cities from about 20,
the newspaper said, citing Chief Executive Officer Tero Taskila.
Taskila declined to confirm the size of the planned investment,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
