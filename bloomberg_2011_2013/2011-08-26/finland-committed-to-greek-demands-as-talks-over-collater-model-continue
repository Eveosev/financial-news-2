Finland  remains committed to its
demand for collateral in exchange for Greek bailout guarantees,
two government officials close to the talks said.  The AAA rated euro member is still in negotiations over the
final model the collateral arrangement will take, two aides to
the Helsinki-based government, who requested anonymity in line
with policy, said by telephone today. A report today in the
newspaper EU Observer saying Finland had abandoned its
collateral demands was incorrect, both aides said.  Finland’s cash collateral arrangement with  Greece , unveiled
on Aug. 16, triggered a backlash of criticism and prompted calls
for similar deals from countries including  Austria  and the
Netherlands, which both share Finland’s AAA rating. The
northernmost euro member is seeking collateral in order to
protect its right to extra assurances that its bailout
commitment will be repaid.  Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said yesterday euro
members critical of the deal must devise an “acceptable”
model. Euro-area governments are “looking for a solution” to
the dispute over collateral for further aid to Greece,  Bertrand Benoit , a German Finance Ministry spokesman said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
