England batsmen Alastair Cook and
 Jonathan Trott  are among the four finalists for the
International Cricket Association’s player-of-the-year award.  India’s Sachin Tendulkar, last year’s recipient, and South
Africa’s Hashim Amla are the other two nominees for the  honor ,
which will be presented Sept. 12 in London.  Cook and Trott are also on the short list for Test player
of the year with teammate James Anderson and South Africa’s
 Jacques Kallis . Amla is a finalist for the top one-day player,
along with India’s Gautam Gambhir, Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara
and Shane Watson of Australia.  Cook, Trott and Anderson are among five players from top-
ranked England named to the Test team of the year. All-rounder
Stuart Broad and spin-bowler Graeme Swann were also selected.  England  moved atop the  ICC Test rankings  after completing a
4-0 sweep of former No. 1 India four days ago. It’s the first
time it’s held the top spot since the ICC introduced the current
rankings in 2003.  Second-ranked South Africa placed three other members on
the team: AB de Villiers, Jacques Kallis and Dale Steyn, who was
chosen for the fourth straight year. Tendulkar and Sangakarra
were also named, while India’s  Zaheer Khan  was chosen as the
12th man.  To contact the reporter on this story:
