Croatia’s economy returned to
expansion in the second quarter as domestic consumption and
exports increased.  Gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent from a year ago
after declining 0.8 percent in the first quarter, the  statistics
office  said today on its website, citing preliminary data. It
will release detailed data on Sept. 20.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which concluded negotiations with
the European Union in June and expects to join the bloc in July
2013, is recovering from a two-year recession. The economy
shrank 1.2 percent last year and 5.8 percent in 2009 after
growth averaged 4.6 percent a year between 2000 and 2007.  “Mild growth in domestic consumption and exports will
continue to have a beneficial effect on the economy,” Zdeslav Santic, chief economist at Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d., said in
a phone interview before the data release. “However, the
recovery will be limited by a continued decline in capital
investments and the threat of a renewed global recession.”  The economy should grow 1.1 percent for the entire year,
Santic said. The government on July 27 forecast an expansion of
1.5 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.  Croatia had its long-term sovereign  credit rating  reduced
in December to one step above junk at  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited the country’s “deteriorated fiscal position and
continuously weak external financing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
