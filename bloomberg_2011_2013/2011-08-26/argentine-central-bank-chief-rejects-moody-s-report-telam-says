Argentina ’s central bank President
Mercedes Marco del Pont rejected Moody’s Investors Service’s
decision to change its outlook for the country’s banks to
negative from stable, state-run news agency  Telam  said.  The decision was irresponsible and showed a lack of
professionalism, Telam cited Marco del Pont as saying in an
interview.  Argentine banks have sufficient liquidity and are showing
signs of “extraordinary profits,” Telam reported, citing the
central bank’s Vice President Miguel Pesce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
