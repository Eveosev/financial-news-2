Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil
producer, charged Ralph Uwazurike, the leader of a Biafra
separatist movement, and 280 members, with treason in a court in
the southeastern city of Enugu, police said.  “They were charged yesterday and remanded in prison,”
Enugu state police commissioner, Dan’azumi Doma, said today in a
telephone interview.  The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State
of Biafra, known as Massob, was formed in 1999 by lawyer
Uwazurike to push for an independent Republic of Biafra. The
oil-rich southeast region tried to secede from Nigeria as a
separatist state in 1967, triggering a three-year civil war that
led to more than a million deaths and Biafra’s defeat in 1970.  About 78 members of the group charged yesterday had
previously been accused of treason, according to court
documents. Massob claims Igbos, the dominant ethnic group in the
region, are discriminated against.  Nigeria  is Africa’s most populous country with 140 million
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
