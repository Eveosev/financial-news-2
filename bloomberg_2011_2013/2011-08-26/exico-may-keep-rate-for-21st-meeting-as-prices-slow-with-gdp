Mexico ’s central bank will probably
hold its benchmark interest rate at a record low today as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and the prospect of a U.S. recession
restrain economic growth and inflation.  The central bank’s board, led by Governor Agustin Carstens,
will keep the overnight rate at 4.50 percent for a 21th straight
meeting, according to all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The bank announces its decision at 10 a.m. New York time.  Since Banco de Mexico last met July 8, global markets have
tumbled as the European debt crisis and  Standard & Poor’s 
downgrade of  U.S. debt  shook investor confidence. While these
developments have led some traders to wager on an  interest rate 
cut this year, Latin America’s second-biggest economy continues
to expand and prices and inflation expectations are anchored
within policy makers’ target range, said Joel Virgen, macro and
markets analyst at Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  The central bank “will be careful with expectations. We
don’t think the statement will feed market speculations about a
rate cut,” Virgen said in a phone interview from Mexico City.
“Nobody is talking of recession or considering a recessionary
scenario.” The bank has room to keep the rate at 4.5 percent
until the first quarter of 2013, he said.  Signs of economic weakness in the U.S., which buys about 80
percent of Mexico’s exports, has prompted JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB to cut their Mexican economic growth
forecasts.  Volatility, Fed  In its most recent quarterly inflation report published
Aug. 10,  Banco de Mexico  cut its 2011 economic growth forecast
to a range of 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent from a range of 4
percent to 5 percent, while keeping the 2011 and 2012 consumer
price forecasts at 3 percent to 4 percent.  Mexican peso bonds have rallied in the last month on
speculation slowing economic growth will keep inflation in check
and prompt the central bank to cut interest rates.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.40 percent, according to
Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell 0.23 centavo
to 132.13 centavos per peso.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts for December
delivery, known as TIIE, fell two basis points to 4.78 percent,
indicating that the central bank may cut the benchmark rate on
the last month of this year.  “We are recommending clients to stay on the sidelines as
volatility is high,” said Alejandro Morales, associate director
of fixed income at Scotia Capital in Mexico City. The central
bank “doesn’t have inflation pressures and it will pay to see
what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do next.”  Growth Trajectories  Mexico’s economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the last three
months of 2009, as agriculture and mining contracted.  The median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the economy to expand 3.6 percent. Growth eased from  4.6
percent  in the first quarter, the national statistics agency
said Aug. 19 on its  website .  The 25 economists surveyed bi-weekly by Banamex are
tempering an earlier optimism about growth in  Latin America ’s
second-biggest economy.  After projecting 2011 economic growth of as much as 4.5
percent in April, the economists have cut their estimate to 3.95
percent in the most recent survey released Aug. 22.  For this year, “4 percent is still a reasonably strong
pace for a country that on averaged has grown 2 percent in the
last decade,” said Delia Paredes, chief economist at Grupo
Financiero Banorte, in Mexico City.  Prices, Expectations  Consumer prices rose 0.09 percent in the first half of
August, the  government  said Aug. 24, which was the slowest pace
in two months and lower than all but two forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of 13 economists. percent.  The annual rate fell to 3.55 percent in July from 3.64
percent in July 2010. The central bank has a long-term target of
2 percent to 4 percent.  In the Aug. 22 Banamex survey, the economists cut their
2011 inflation forecast to 3.56 percent from 3.60 percent and
their 12-month forecast to 3.78 percent from 3.93 percent.  Policy makers in Colombia, Chile and  Peru  have paused this
month in part on concern about the risks posed by slowing global
growth.  Banco Central do Brasil meets next week amid mounting
speculation that bank president Alexandre Tombini may elect to
pause for the first time since 2010.  Mexico’s central bank, which next meets on Oct. 14, has
kept borrowing costs at 4.5 percent since July 2009 amid slowing
growth and inflation.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 12.5100 per U.S. dollar
yesterday from 12.4811 on Aug. 25. The currency has declined 1.3
percent this year against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
