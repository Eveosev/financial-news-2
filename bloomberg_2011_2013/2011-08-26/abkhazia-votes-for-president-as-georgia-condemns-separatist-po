Abkhazia is voting to elect a new
president for the second time since  Russia  recognized Georgia’s
separatist region as an independent state three years ago. The
Georgian government condemned the vote.  Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba, Vice President
Alexander Ankvab and Raul Khajimba, a former vice president,
will compete in the snap elections after the late PresidentSergei Bagapsh died in a Moscow hospital in May. Bagapsh won a
second term as president in a 2009 vote.  The Black Sea region’s 172 polling stations opened at 8
a.m. and will close at 8 p.m., according to Abkhaz state news
agency  Apsnypress . Turnout was 48.78 percent at 2 p.m. local
time, Russian state television  reported . More than 100 observers
from 27 different countries are monitoring the election,
according to Apsnypress  Abkhazia declared independence from  Georgia  after a war in
the early 1990s that left hundreds of thousands displaced. In
August 2008, Russia routed Georgia’s army in a war over another
breakaway region,  South Ossetia , and then recognized both
regions’ independence, agreeing to defend their borders. Georgia
considers both regions part of its territory.  Abkhaz elections are “illegitimate” unless the displaced
people are allowed to return to the region, Georgian
Reintegration Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili said in a telephone
interview from the capital, Tbilisi, today.  “It doesn’t matter who wins the elections because we are
concentrating on restoring human relations between the Abkhazian
and Georgian people,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
