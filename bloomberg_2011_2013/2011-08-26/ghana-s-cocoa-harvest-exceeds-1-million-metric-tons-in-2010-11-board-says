Ghana ’s cocoa harvest exceeded 1
million metric tons for the first time, as increased fertilizer
use and pest and disease control spurred output in the ongoing
2010-11 crop season.  The total harvest in the world’s second-biggest producer of
the beans, including the October-to-May main crop, reached an
“unprecedented” 1,004,194 tons by Aug. 18, the Ghana Cocoa
Board said in an e-mailed statement today. The 10 weeks of the
light crop, which started in June, produced 87,384 tons, it
said.  The record output was as a result of “adherence to good
agronomic practices, payment of remunerative producer price,
application of fertilizers, disease and pest control, use of
hybrid cocoa seedlings and scientific research,” according to
the Accra-based board, also known as  Cocobod .  Ghana  set a minimum price that farmers would be paid for a
ton of beans at 3,200 cedis ($2,098) at the start of the harvest
in October, 33 percent higher than a year earlier. Cocobod also
cut prices for fertilizers and provided disease- and pest-
controling chemicals to farmers.  Ghana initially forecast reaching the 1 million-ton mark in
the 2012-13 season, said Kwabena Asante-Poku, deputy chief
executive officer of Cocobod, in an interview on Aug. 24.  The board, which oversees the cocoa industry in the West
African nation, plans to raise production to 1.1 million tons
next year, Asante-Poku said. Favorable weather could enable
output of as much as 1.2 million tons, he said.  Ivory Coast  is the world’s biggest producer of the
chocolate ingredient. Deliveries to ports in the country, which
neighbors Ghana, reached 1.376 million tons by Aug. 14,
according to a document obtained from the industry regulator.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained 1.5 percent, or
28 pounds ($45.54) to 1,938 pounds by 1:39 p.m. on the NYSE
Liffe market in  London  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
