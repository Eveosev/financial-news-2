Meikles Ltd. will give employees 10
percent of the company’s shares in a deal worth about $6.5
million, the  Daily News  said, citing Onias Makamba, the
company’s finance director.  Meikles, which owns retail, leisure and agricultural
businesses, is negotiating a black empowerment deal with
government, the Harare-based Daily News said on its website.  By law, foreign and white-owned companies in  Zimbabwe  must
cede 51 percent of their shares to black citizens of the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
