Ukraine raised its forecast for
exports of grains by 1 million metric tons to 25 million tons,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  This yearâ€™s harvest probably will come to more than 50
million tons, the Kiev-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. Farmers have reaped 34.5 million tons of grains
so far, and the rapeseed crop has reached 1.4 million tons, it
said.  Farmers will seed 8.3 million hectares (20.5 million acres)
with winter grains for the 2012 harvest, an increase of 200,000
hectares, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
