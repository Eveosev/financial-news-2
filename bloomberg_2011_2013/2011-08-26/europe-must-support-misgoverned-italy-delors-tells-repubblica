Former European Commission President
Jacques Delors said European institutions need to support  Italy 
at a time the country is “misgoverned’ amid the euro debt
crisis, la Repubblica reported, citing an interview.  ‘‘Misgovernment is Italy’s problem, but the concern for the
progress of Europe has a priority on any partisanship and Europe
needs to help Italy, whoever is in government,” Repubblica
cited Delors as saying. “Italy’s economic situation hasn’t
changed, with the same strengths and weakness” of the past.  To contact the reporter on this story:
