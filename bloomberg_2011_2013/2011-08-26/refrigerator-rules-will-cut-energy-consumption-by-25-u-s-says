U.S. efficiency standards for home
refrigerators and freezers will cut the appliances’ energy use
25 percent by 2014, the Energy Department said.  The standards, which take effect in about three years, will
reduce U.S. energy bills at least $21 billion through 2043 and
avoid more than 340 million metric tons of carbon emissions
during the next three decades, the agency said today in a
 statement .  “These standards reflect a consensus among manufacturers,
consumer groups and environmentalists,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in the statement.  The Energy Department is issuing efficiency standards for
more than 30,000 home and commercial products, according to the
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
