Though a flaming sword may keep us
out forever, that has not stopped people from searching for the
Garden of Eden. Paradise has been “found” in places as far-
reaching as  Iraq , Turkey, Sri Lanka,  Florida , Missouri and the
North Pole.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  On his third voyage to the new world in 1498, Christopher
Columbus was sure he’d discovered Paradise in  Venezuela . The
weather was balmy, the mountains high, the flora lush and
exotic, while the Orinoco perfectly fit the Biblical reference
to a river flowing out of Eden to water the garden.  The devout explorer wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella, “If
the water does not proceed from the earthly paradise, it seems
to be a still greater wonder, for I do not believe that there is
any river in the world so large and deep.”  For Columbus, the earth was shaped like a giant breast. The
nipple, highest and nearest the sky, was the lost Garden of
Eden, and the great Orinoco River flowed from it.  I spoke with Brook Wilensky-Lanford, author of “Paradise
Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden,” on the following
topics:  1. Genesis Geography  2. Medieval Exploration  3. Columbus in the New World  4. Darwin Spurs Searches  5. 20th Century Quests  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
