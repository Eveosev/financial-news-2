A federal appeals court in New York
affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit against  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  by
the former generic-drug maker Interpharm Inc. over claims the
bank used restrictive credit agreements and exorbitant fees to
force the company into an unprofitable sale.  Interpharm, which sold most of its assets in June 2008,
sued Wells Fargo in December 2008, saying it lost about $40
million of value when the San Francisco-based company reduced
its credit limit based on allegedly erroneous income
projections.  The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in an opinion dated
today affirmed U.S. District Judge Richard J. Holwell’s decision
to dismiss the case in May, saying that Wells Fargo wasn’t
obligated to extend any further credit to Interpharm after the
drugmaker defaulted on a credit agreement.  “To the extent it agreed to do so in a series of
forbearance agreements imposing stricter conditions and costs on
Interpharm, these demands by a lender otherwise under no
obligation to continue extending credit cannot constitute the
‘wrongful threat’ required to establish economic duress under
 New York  law,” Circuit Judge Reena Raggi said in the opinion.
“Nor can a wrongful threat be based on Wells Fargo’s exercise
of discretion specifically conferred by the Credit Agreement.”  The case is Interpharm Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank NA, 08-
cv-11365, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ). The appeal is Interpharm Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank
NA, 10-1801-cv, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (New York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
