Turkish champion Fenerbahce asked
the country’s soccer federation to demote it from the top league
in protest of a decision to ban it from the  Champions League .  The Istanbul club asked to compete in the second-tier Bank
Asya First Division, Vice President Ali Koc said in televised
remarks after a meeting today. A final decision on the matter is
likely to come next week after consultation with the federation,
he said.  The Turkish Football Federation two days ago barred the
team from the Champions League saying European governing body
UEFA had warned of disciplinary action against the entire
Turkish league if Fenerbahce didn’t pull out. The club is
involved in a police investigation into alleged match-fixing
that also involves other Turkish sides. Police have yet to make
any formal charges.  “If Fenerbahce is barred from going to the Champions
League, we think it’s wrong to compete in the Super League,”
Koc said in a statement on the club’s website late yesterday.
“We’re viewed as guilty by our own federation.”  UEFA selected Trabzonspor, which finished second in the
league last season, to take Fenerbahce’s place in this season’s
Champions League group stage.  The federation yesterday set the schedule for new season in
the top league, with Fenerbahce to play Orduspor at home on the
opening week of games starting Sept. 11.  Koc said the club was innocent of the match-fixing
allegations and the decision to request demotion was backed by
players, officials and fans.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
