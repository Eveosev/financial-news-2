Wheat fell in  Chicago  on speculation
improved crops in  Europe ,  China  and Russia will boost supplies.
Corn and soybeans also declined.  World wheat production will be 0.4 percent higher than a
July estimate at 677 million metric tons on better production in
the European Union, Russia and China, the International Grains
Council said yesterday. The EU estimate was increased 0.5
percent to 137.5 million tons.  “The optimistic estimate for the EU is particularly
surprising,” said  Carsten Fritsch , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Commerzbank, in a report today. The IGC estimate was “too
high.”  Wheat for December delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.8225 a bushel by 10:51 a.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Milling wheat for November delivery fell
1.50, or 0.7 percent, to 207.25 euros ($299.46) a ton on NYSE
Liffe in Paris.  Farm group DBV German Farmers Association said yesterday
that production in the country would fall 12 percent on
“terrible” weather. French farmers will produce 7 percent less
wheat, Fritsch said. France is the EU’s largest grower of the
grain, followed by Germany and the U.K.  The quality of the EU crop is deteriorating as rainfall
hinders collection, the Home-Grown Cereals Authority said Aug.
15, citing Strategie Grains.  “A distinction has to be made between crop volume and crop
quality,” Fritsch said. “Last year, for example, Australia
registered a record crop of 26 million tons, but 40 percent of
it could not be used for  food production .”  Corn for December delivery dropped 0.5 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $7.43 a bushel in Chicago. Soybeans for November
delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $13.8975 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
