Japan  bought 22,500 metric tons of
food wheat and 45,206 tons of food barley today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the total wheat, 19,500 tons were from  Canada , 2,000
tons were from  Australia  and the reminder was from  France ,
Masafumi Otsuka at the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said by
phone. All the barley was from Australia, and shipments for the
grains must be made by Nov. 30, he said.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
