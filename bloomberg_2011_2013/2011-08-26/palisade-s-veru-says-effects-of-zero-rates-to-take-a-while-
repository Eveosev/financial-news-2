Dan Veru , chief investment officer
at Fort Lee, New Jersey-based Palisades Capital Management LLC,
comments on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
statement today in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  Bernanke said the central bank still has tools to stimulate
the economy. He didn’t provide details or signal when or whether
policy makers might deploy them. Veru, whose firm oversees
$3.8 billion, spoke in a telephone interview.  “There’s a risk appetite that’s building in the
marketplace. At some point people are going to see interest
rates are going to stay at zero for some time so we should
probably buy financial assets. It takes a while to digest what
this all means.  ‘‘He’s reiterated rates are going to be at zero for much
longer than you originally thought, he’s saying no change. That
should be good for financial assets in the long run. In the
short run, we have all this other noise coming out of  Europe ,
and in the U.S., it’s feeling like a recession because there’s
very little growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
