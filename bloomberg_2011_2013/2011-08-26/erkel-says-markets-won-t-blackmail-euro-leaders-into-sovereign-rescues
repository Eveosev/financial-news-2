German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
investors are trying to “blackmail” governments into helping
debt-strapped European countries, underscoring the need for all
euro-area governments to reduce debt.  “After the states bailed out the banks, the financial
markets are again trying to blackmail states and tell them,
‘You’ve made so much debt,’” Merkel said today at a rally of
her  Christian Democratic Union  in the eastern city of
Brandenburg, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Berlin.  The solution is to press “countries that are highly
indebted to really do their homework and get their debt down,”
she said. “A  Europe  with a common currency requires common
duties.”  Merkel is underlining her stand on the euro region’s debt
crisis in local election rallies in August before national
lawmakers vote next month on a second aid package for  Greece  and
an expansion of the powers of the European Union’s crisis fund.  She stood firm in rejecting euro bonds, joint debt issuance
by euro countries, which is supported by Germany’s two main
opposition parties, the  Social Democrats  and Greens.  “That’s where we have to put up a clear stop sign and say
we won’t do that,” Merkel said. “Everybody has to do their
homework. Responsibility has to be pointed out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
