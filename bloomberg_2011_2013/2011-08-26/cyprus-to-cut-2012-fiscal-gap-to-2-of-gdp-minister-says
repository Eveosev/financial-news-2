Cyprus’s 2012 budget proposal will
include a clause that will restrict the country’s fiscal deficit
to 2 percent of gross domestic product and for a zero deficit by
2013, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  “I stress the government’s commitment for a fiscal
framework to limit the  budget deficit  to 2 percent of GDP in
2012 and for a balanced budget in 2013,” he told reporters in
Nicosia today.  The euro area’s third-smallest economy, rocked by a July 11
explosion that destroyed its largest power station and knocked
out more than half of its electricity-generating capacity, is
trying to contain a budget deficit that Kazamias says will reach
6.5 percent of economic output this year.  Kazamias urged lawmakers not to delay approval of a
proposed increase of the value added  tax rate  to 17 percent,
included in an austerity package that is expected to be put to
the vote later today. Cyprus, which must make a 1 billion-euro
($1.44 billion) payment to bondholders in the first quarter of
next year, will be in a position to service its maturing debt
“when required,” Kazamias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
