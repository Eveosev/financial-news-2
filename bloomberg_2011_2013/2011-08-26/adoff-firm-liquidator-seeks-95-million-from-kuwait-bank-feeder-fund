The liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s
firm sued the  National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)  S.A.K. in one of five
lawsuits demanding return of about $95 million in funds
withdrawn from a so-called feeder fund to the  Ponzi scheme .  The Kuwait bank withdrew $18.7 million from Fairfield
Sentry Ltd., one of the larger feeder funds, taking money that
belonged to customers of the jailed con man, trustee  Irving Picard  said in a complaint posted on his website yesterday.
Separately, he sued Delta National Bank & Trust Co. for $20.6
million and demanded $26.8 million from Unifortune Asset
Management Sgr SpA with smaller amounts from two other fund
companies.  Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits, is pursuing
comparatively small amounts from investors who redeemed money
from the feeders before Madoff’s 2008 arrest. The trustee’s
settlement with Walter Noel’s Fairfield Sentry was approved in
court in June.  The trustee last month lost the right to claim almost $9
billion in damages from  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and feeder funds after
a ruling by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who said Picard was
free to pursue bankruptcy claims. Madoff is serving a 150-year
sentence in a prison in North Carolina.  A call to the Kuwait bank’s main number went unanswered
after regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
