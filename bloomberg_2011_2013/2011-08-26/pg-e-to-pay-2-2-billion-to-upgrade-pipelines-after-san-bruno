PG&E Corp. (PCG)  will pay $2.2 billion
to replace natural-gas pipelines in the wake of its fatal 2010
explosion in San Bruno,  California .  The utility will pay $1.4 billion in  capital costs  and $750
million in expenses between 2011 and 2014, according to a filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PG&E has
applied for permission to pass some of the costs to customers.
Shareholders will absorb $535 million, according to the filing.  PG&E, based in  San Francisco , said in the filing that parts
of its system have never been pressure-tested, a process that
allows the operator to determine the line’s safe operating
pressure. PG&E will replace at least 186 miles of pipeline,
conduct strength tests on 783 miles of line, conduct inspections
of 234 miles of line and retrofit 199 miles of pipe, according
to the filing.  The 55-year-old pipeline that ruptured last September in
San Bruno had welding flaws, federal investigators have said.
Eight people were killed and 38 homes were destroyed.  PG&E had misidentified its construction design and poor
record-keeping may have meant the line was operated at a higher
pressure than it was built to withstand, investigators said.  The  National Transportation Safety Board  is scheduled to
hold a hearing Aug. 30 to determine the cause of the accident
and recommend safety improvements, according to today’s filing.  PG&E this month named Anthony Earley as its new chief
executive officer, replacing Peter A. Darbee, who resigned in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
