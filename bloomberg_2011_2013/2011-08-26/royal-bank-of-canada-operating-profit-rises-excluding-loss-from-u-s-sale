Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s
largest lender, said  consumer lending  and investment banking led
to a 13 percent increase in third-quarter operating profit,
excluding a loss from the sale of its U.S. consumer bank. The
results missed analysts’ estimates.  Royal Bank had profit from continuing operations of C$1.57
billion ($1.59 billion), or C$1.04 a share, in the quarter ended
July 31, compared with profit of C$1.38 billion, or 92 cents, in
the year-earlier period, the Toronto-based lender said today in
a statement. The net loss was C$92 million, including C$1.57
billion in costs from selling RBC Bank.  Profit from the RBC Capital Markets investment-banking unit
was lower than analysts including  John Aiken  of  Barclays Capital 
expected, as trading missed estimates. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index dropped 3.7 percent in the quarter.  Capital markets had “a weak quarter predicated on a
significant drop in trading revenues and weakness in
commissions,” Aiken said today in a note to clients. “Advisory
fees were quite strong and provided a partial offset.”  The company said it earned C$1.06 a share excluding items
such as the RBC sale, missing the C$1.08 a share estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Royal’s miss on wholesale earnings was generally expected
given the weakness in capital markets,” said  Bob Decker , a  money
manager  at Aurion Capital Management in Toronto who oversees
about C$5.5 billion. “Market conditions weakened significantly
in the August timeframe, so I think investors will take a wait-
and-see attitude on this bank until the year-end numbers are
released.”  U.S. Loss  The lender estimated in June it would post a loss of C$1.6
billion from the sale of its money-losing RBC Bank unit to PNC
Financial Services Group Inc., which included a C$1.3 billion
write-off. PNC agreed to pay $3.62 billion in cash and stock to
buy the Raleigh, North Carolina-based bank and credit-card
assets in a deal expected to be completed in March.  Royal Bank fell 1 percent to C$50.76 yesterday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 3 percent this
year, compared with the 2.8 percent decline of the eight-company
S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.  Revenue rose 2 percent to C$6.79 billion. Provisions for
loan losses fell to C$275 million, from C$277 million a year
earlier.  Canadian banking profit rose 12 percent to C$855 million,
from C$766 million, on lending growth and lower provisions for
credit losses.  Money Management  Wealth management fell 3.2 percent to C$179 million, while
insurance earnings dropped 5.9 percent to C$144 million.  Profit at the  investment-banking  business rose 38 percent
to C$277 million, from C$201 million a year earlier, on higher
trading and fees.  Revenue from trading rose 46 percent to C$337 million from
the year-earlier period, on interest-rate contracts and
equities.  International banking, including Caribbean banking and its
RBC Dexia partnership and excluding the U.S. RBC Bank, fell 14
percent to C$31 million from a year earlier.  Royal Bank is the first Canadian bank to miss analysts’
estimates this quarter. Bank of Montreal, the fourth-biggest
bank, said Aug. 23 that profit rose 19 percent to C$793 million,
or C$1.27 a share, driven by higher investment-banking earnings.
Montreal-based  National Bank of Canada , the sixth-biggest
lender, yesterday said profit rose 15 percent.  Bank of Nova Scotia reports results Aug. 30, followed by
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Aug. 31 and Toronto-
Dominion Bank on Sept. 1.  ( Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  will hold a conference call to
