Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-biggest U.S. phone company, will resume labor contract
negotiations next week, one of the two unions involved in the
talks said.  The discussions will get under way Aug. 31, said Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the  Communications Workers of
America . The CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers are representing about 45,000 employees of the New York-
based company in the talks.  The workers were on strike for two weeks before returning
to their posts Aug. 22 under the terms of their previous
contract. Verizon has been seeking concessions including changes
in health-care benefits and greater flexibility in rules for
deploying workers on service calls.  The unions have said their members shouldn’t have to make
substantial concessions as earnings rise and executive pay
remains healthy. The negotiations mostly involve workers in
Verizon’s land-line phone business. The company has about
196,000 employees.  Verizon spokesman Rich Young didn’t immediately respond to
phone and e-mail messages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
