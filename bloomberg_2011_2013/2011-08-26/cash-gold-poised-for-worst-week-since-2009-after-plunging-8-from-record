Gold gained in  New York  as falling
equities and the metal’s biggest weekly drop in more than three
months spurred investor demand before a speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  Gold futures slumped as much as 11 percent in the three
days through yesterday after touching a record $1,917.90 an
ounce on Aug. 23. European equities fell and the dollar weakened
versus most major currencies as traders waited to see whether
Bernanke will signal further steps to support the economy when
he speaks at 10 a.m. New York time. He’s said the central bank
will keep borrowing costs near zero at least through mid-2013.  “It’s going to be about what Bernanke says or doesn’t
say,”  Peter Fertig , owner of Quantitative Commodity Research
Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany , said by phone today. Lower equities
“are providing support for gold as a safe haven. There is, of
course, some bargain-hunting” after this week’s drop, he said.  Gold for December delivery gained $26.30, or 1.5 percent,
to $1,789.50 an ounce by 8:06 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices are down 3.4 percent this week, the most since May.
Immediate-delivery gold was 0.7 percent higher at $1,787.30 in
London.  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. Before this
week, gold climbed for seven consecutive weeks, the longest run
of gains since April 2007.  Weekly Survey  Thirteen of 26 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg said gold will rise next week. Eight predicted a drop
and five were neutral.  Gold futures tumbled 5.6 percent on Aug. 24, the most since
March 2008, as reports on durable-goods orders and  home prices 
beat analyst estimates and equities climbed, prompting CME Group
Inc. to raise margins on futures contracts for a second time
this month. The 10-day historical volatility for gold futures
this week jumped to about 41 percent, the highest level since
March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors will look for indications of whether the central
bank will embark on further stimulus when Bernanke speaks in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . He used last year’s speech to say the Fed
would “do all that it can” to spur growth. The Fed bought $600
billion in Treasuries from November through June.  Stimulus Measures  “Bernanke probably will hint that he is ready to use
further stimulus if the economy deteriorates,”  Pu Yonghao ,
chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management, told
Bloomberg Television. “People are concerned the probability of
recession has increased. Gold is a kind of insurance, to insure
against the potential quantitative easing.”  UBS AG’s physical gold sales to India yesterday were more
than twice the daily average and are set for the best week since
May, Edel Tully, a London-based analyst at the bank, wrote in a
report. “We expect a stronger buying response today,” she
wrote.  Exchange-traded-product holdings were little changed
yesterday after falling the previous four days. Assets declined
0.3 metric ton to 2,154.4 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Holdings reached a record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Silver for December delivery in New York rose 0.9 percent
to $41.15 an ounce. It dropped 3.1 percent this week and is up
33 percent this year.  Platinum for October delivery was up 0.2 percent at
$1,825.90 an ounce, cutting its weekly loss to 2.6 percent.
Palladium for December delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $750.65
an ounce. Prices are up 0.2 percent this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
