Scientists discovered a planet 20
times denser than Jupiter that they say has the chemical
composition, pressure and dimensions to suggest a crystalline,
or diamond, makeup.  The planet’s density implies it’s made of carbon and
oxygen, rather than hydrogen and helium, which are the main
components of gaseous planets like Jupiter, according to a
report published online yesterday by the journal  Science .  The planet was discovered orbiting a dead star spinning
hundreds of times a second. The finding may shed light on this
class of neutron stars, called millisecond pulsars, thought to
be the leftovers of stellar explosions, said researchers led by
 Matthew Bailes , a professor at Swinburne University of
Technology in  Australia .  While 30 percent of these pulsars are discovered alone,
most evolve with companions that in special circumstances can be
“transformed into exotic planets unlike those likely to be
found anywhere else in the universe,” the researchers wrote.  The researchers spotted the planet and its millisecond
pulsar using the Parkes radio telescope in New South Wales,
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
