French President Nicolas Sarkozy
will go to Libya with U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  as soon
as Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  is captured,  Le Parisien  said
today, citing unnamed people at the French leader’s office.  In any case, the visit probably won’t come before the
Libyan summit to be held in Paris on Sept. 1, according to the
newspaper. Sarkozy would visit Tripoli as well as the rebel-held
towns of Benghazi and Misrata, Le Parisien said, citing the
unnamed Sarkozy advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
