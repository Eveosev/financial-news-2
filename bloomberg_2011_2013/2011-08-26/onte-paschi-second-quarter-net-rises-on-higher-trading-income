Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) ,
 Italy â€™s third-biggest bank, said second-quarter profit rose
almost 2 percent after the bank earned more from trading.  Net income increased to 121.1 million euros ($175 million)
from 118.9 million euros a year earlier, the Siena, Italy-based
lender said in a statement today. That beat the 108.8 million-
euro average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Monte Paschi, which passed the European stress tests in
July, is cutting costs and selling assets to boost profitability
and strengthen finances. The bank sold 2.15 billion euros of
stock in June to repay  government aid  and boost reserves before
the implementation of stricter rules on capital.  Its Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial health, fell
to 8.9 percent as of June 30 from 9.1 percent three months
earlier, the lender said. The ratio is at 9.5 percent as of
today, including the planned sale of real estate asset which
will be reflected in the third-quarter earnings.  Loan-loss provisions in the quarter rose to 295 million
euros from 283 million euros. Net interest income fell 10
percent to 818.7 million euros, while net trading income swung
to a profit of 118.5 million euros.  Monte Paschi fell 3.1 percent to 43.28 cents in Milan,
before the announcement, giving the company a market value of
4.8 billion euros. The stock has declined 40 percent this year
compared with the 32 percent decline in the 46-company Bloomberg
Banks and Financial Services Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
