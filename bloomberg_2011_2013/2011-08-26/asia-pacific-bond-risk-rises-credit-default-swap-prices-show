The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against default increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 6.5 basis points
to 175.5 basis points as of 10:01 a.m. in Sydney, Credit
Agricole CIB prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 4 basis points to 163 as of 8:01
a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit Agricole prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1 to 154 as of 9:00
a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. Five-year swaps on
Japanâ€™s sovereign debt advanced 1 basis point to 110, Deutsche
Bank prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
