OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, said second-
quarter profit fell 81 percent after foreign-exchange losses and
a writedown of the value of some assets.  Net income dropped to $10 million in the three months ended
June 30 from $54 million a year earlier, the company said on its 
website  today. That missed the mean  estimate  of $85.7 million of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Higher  iron ore , coking coal and other raw materials
prices, together with lower production contributed to the drop
in earnings,  George Buzhenitsa , a Deutsche Bank analyst, said by
phone from Moscow today.  Magnitogorsk’s cash cost of producing a steel slab rose 10
percent in the second quarter compared with the first three
months, said Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at Uralsib Capital.  Revenue rose 17 percent to $2.42 billion. Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell 13 percent to
$380 million, Magnitogorsk said. The steelmaker reported a
foreign-exchange loss of $25 million and fixed asset writedowns
of $20 million. Without the one-time items, profit would have
been $58 million, it said.  Magnitogorsk’s production of crude steel in the second
quarter fell 10 percent from the previous three months to 2.79
million metric tons, the company said July 29. Production
dropped 6.7 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
