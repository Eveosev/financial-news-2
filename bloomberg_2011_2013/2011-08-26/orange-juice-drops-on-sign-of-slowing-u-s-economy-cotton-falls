Orange-juice  futures dropped to a
two-week low as signs of slowing U.S. economic growth fueled
concern that commodity demand will ease. Cotton declined.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1 percent annual rate
from April through June, less than previously estimated, capping
the weakest six months of the recovery that began in mid-2009,
Commerce Department data showed today. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities slumped as much as
0.8 percent, led by crude oil and gasoline.  “There are a lot of macroeconomic concerns out there, and
people are holding off instead of taking on too much risk right
now,” Ricardo Scaff, a trader at Rabobank International in New
York, said in a telephone interview.  Orange juice for November delivery fell 2.05 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $1.587 a pound at 10:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Before today, the commodity had risen 16 percent in
the past year.  Also weighing on prices was the diminished threat to
Florida citrus groves from Hurricane Irene, expected to make
landfall in  North Carolina  tomorrow, Scaff said.  Cotton futures for December delivery slipped 0.13 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $1.0286 a pound on ICE. Before today, prices
tumbled 29 percent this year as demand slumped in  China , the
leading importer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
