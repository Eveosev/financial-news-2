The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a second week, as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
advanced in London.  Russia’s currency rose 0.3 percent against the dollar this
week, its second week of gains against the U.S. currency. It was
little changed at 28.945 per dollar and 41.57 per euro at the 7
p.m. close in Moscow today. That left it steady at 34.6263
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude  climbed for a fourth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
