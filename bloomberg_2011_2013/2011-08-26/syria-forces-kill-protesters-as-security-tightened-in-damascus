Syrian security forces killed four
people after stepping up security around Damascus before Friday
prayers, which have been followed by protests against President
Bashar al-Assad’s government for the last five months.  The protesters were killed in the eastern town of Deir al-
Zour and Douma, a suburb of the capital, said Mahmoud Merhi,
head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights. Security is
“tight” around the Rukneddine, Harasta, Douma and Muadamiya
neighborhoods of Damascus, he said by telephone today. The
deployment follows raids and arrests of dissidents late
yesterday in Homs, Deir al-Zour and Daraa, where the uprising
began in mid-March, Merhi said.  The protests are part of the wave of unrest across the
 Middle East  and North Africa this year that has unseated the
leaders of Egypt and  Tunisia . Assad, who succeeded his father as
president after his death in 2000, has blamed the demonstrations
on foreign-inspired plots.  At least 2,400 people have been killed in  Syria  since the
protests started, according to Merhi and Ammar Qurabi of the
National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. The UN puts the
death toll at more than 2,200. More than 500 members of the
security forces have died, the government has said.  The  UN Human Rights Council  ordered an investigation on
Aug. 23 into the crackdown on protesters, including possible
crimes against humanity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
