Asian stocks swung between gains and
losses ahead of a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  at a meeting of central bankers and before reports
expected to show growth is slowing in the world’s largest
economy.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent
of its sales abroad, dropped 1 percent in Tokyo.  Billabong
International Ltd. (BBG) , a surfwear maker whose sales come about half
from the western hemisphere, slumped 3.9 percent in Sydney after
U.S. initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose.  Fairfax Media
Ltd. (FXJ) , a newspaper publisher in  Australia  and  New Zealand , jumped
8.7 percent after saying it’s preparing an initial public
offering of one unit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.3 percent to 120.07 as
of 10:22 a.m. in Tokyo, after falling as much as 0.2 percent.
About four stocks rose for every three that fell on the gauge,
which is headed for its first weekly advance in five weeks.
Investors are awaiting a speech by Bernanke today in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, for any indications of whether the central bank
will signal further economic stimulus amid worsening economic
data in the U.S.  “Recent U.S. economic reports have shown mixed results,
failing to boost confidence,” said Yutaka Yoshii, a strategist
at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Expectations have waned about
the possibility that Bernanke will signal further monetary
easing.”  U.S. Futures  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average was 0.2 percent lower
after swinging between gains and losses more than eight times.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index climbed 0.4 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6
percent today. The  S&P 500  fell 1.6 percent to 1,159.27 in  New
York  yesterday, snapping a three-day rally, after a report
showing an increase in jobless claims added to signs the  U.S.
economy  is weakening, and selling in German futures sparked a
rout in global equities.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.8 percent drop by the S&P
500 and an 18 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.6 times for the S&P 500 and 9.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
