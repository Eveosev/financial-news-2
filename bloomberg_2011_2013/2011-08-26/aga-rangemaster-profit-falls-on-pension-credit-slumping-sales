AGA Rangemaster Group Plc (AGA) , a U.K.
range-cooker and kitchen specialist, said first-half profit fell
83 percent after a pension credit from freezing salaries wasn’t
repeated and sales dropped. The shares declined.  Net income fell to 2.1 million pounds ($3.4 million), or
4.3 pence per share, from 12.2 million pounds, or 17.6 pence per
share, a year earlier, the Warwickshire, England-based company
said today in a statement. Sales declined 1.6 percent to 121.4
million pounds.  “It does remain pretty tough, but we have seen a
stabilization,” Chief Executive Officer William McGrath said in
a telephone interview. “In the second half, our focus is on the
premium end of the market.” Sales from new products may boost
earnings by next year, he added.  Sales may suffer more in the coming months as consumers
spend less as a result of the economic slowdown, McGrath said.
AGA added 16.3 million pounds to its balance sheet last year by
freezing about 600 U.K. employees’ salaries. Operating profit
more than tripled to 2.9 million pounds and net cash rose 12.5
percent to 25 million pounds as the company cut costs by closing
two plants in  North America .  The company is raising its interim dividend to 0.8 pence
per share, from 0.7 pence a year earlier. AGA shares have
slumped 8 percent in the year to date, giving the company a
market value of 64.4 million pounds. The shares
were down 1.3 percent to 93 pence as of 8:21 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
