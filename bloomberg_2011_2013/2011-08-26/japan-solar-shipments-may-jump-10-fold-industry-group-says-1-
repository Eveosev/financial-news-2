Japanese domestic shipments of solar
panels may increase by as much as 10 times in “a fairly short
period” after the government approved renewable energy
subsidies, a solar industry group’s chairman said.  “Legislation passed today will secure purchase of power
generated by solar panels for a long time period,” Mikio
Katayama, chairman of the  Japan  Photovoltaic Energy  Association ,
told reporters in  Tokyo  today. “That will help a rapid
expansion of industry-use and utility-use solar systems.”  The legislation allows for a “feed-in tariff” or
incentives that guarantee above-market rates for producers of
wind, solar and geothermal energy. The subsidies are part of
government efforts to cut Japan’s reliance on atomic energy
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami led to radiation leaks
from a nuclear power plant.  Domestic solar battery shipments are about 1 gigawatt a
year in Japan, compared with 8 gigawatts in Germany, said
Katayama, who is also the president of Sharp Corp., Japan’s
biggest maker of photovoltaic cells.  Panel shipments gained 31 percent from a year earlier to
258.6 megawatts in the three months ended June, according to the
association. Residential-use systems accounted for about 87
percent of the shipments during the quarter.  When implemented in  Germany  and  Spain , feed-in tariffs
boosted installations of solar panels.  Renewable energy, including solar accounted for 2.9 percent
of Japan’s power generation in 2010, compared with 15 percent in
Germany, according to the  International Energy Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
