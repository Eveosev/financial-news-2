The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options decreased, erasing a 10 percent gain, after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the world’s largest
economy will resume growth.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 9.3 percent to 36.06 at 11:44 a.m. in New
York after rising as high as 43.84. The index measures the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, which rose 0.7 percent after falling as much
as 2 percent. October VIX futures dropped 1.9 percent to 31.15.  The Fed still has tools to stimulate the economy, Bernanke
said in a speech today to central bankers and economists at an
annual forum in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . He stopped short of
indicating that the central bank will move ahead with a third
round of government bond-buying.  “There’s still uncertainty in the market, especially about
economic data and how weak the recovery is going to be,” said
Philippe Trouve, the VIX options trader and director for equity
derivatives at Bank of America Corp. in  New York . “But recent
moves in the market have been less volatile so we would expect
VIX to start coming in next week, especially going in to the
Labor Day weekend.”  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1 percent annual rate
in the three months through June, down from an earlier estimate
of 1.3 percent and compared with a Bloomberg News survey
forecast of 1.1 percent. The expansion capped the weakest six
months of the economic recovery that began in mid-2009. GDP rose
at a 0.4 percent pace in the first quarter.  Last Year  At last year’s Jackson Hole conference, Bernanke said the
Fed would “do all that it can” to ensure a continuation of the
economic recovery and that buying more debt might be warranted
if growth slowed. Two months later, policy makers announced a
$600 billion second round of asset purchases that ended in June.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
fell after surging 11 percent. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures
the cost of protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, dropped 1.9 percent to 43.55 in  Frankfurt , after
rising to 49.11, almost reaching its 14-month high of 49.50 from
Aug. 10. The Euro Stoxx 50 stock index retreated 1.2 percent,
while the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
