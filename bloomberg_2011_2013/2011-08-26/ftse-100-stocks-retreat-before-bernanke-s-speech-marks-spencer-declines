U.K. stocks declined for a second
day, trimming the FTSE 100 Index’s weekly advance, before a
speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke today.  The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 0.7 percent to 5,094.29 at
8:49 a.m. in London as all but 14 of the gauge’s companies fell.  Investors are awaiting Bernanke’s speech in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, today at 10 a.m. New York time and will look for
indications of whether the central bank will embark on further
stimulus to help drive the world’s largest economy.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  paced the retreat in London
trading, falling 2.9 percent to 306.8 pence.  Amec Plc (AMEC)  dropped
2.8 percent to 851.5 pence and  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  slid 3.2 percent
to 248.3 pence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
