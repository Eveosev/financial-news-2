Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it’s shutting
Slide, the social-gaming business it bought for about $200
million last year, and that Max Levchin, the chief executive
officer of the acquired company, is departing.  “Max has decided to leave Slide and Google to pursue other
opportunities, and we wish him the best,” Google said in an e-
mailed statement today. “Most of the team from Slide will
remain at Google to work on other opportunities.”  The Slide deal reflected Google’s effort to make its
services more social, to repel a threat from Facebook Inc., the
world’s largest social-networking service. CEO Larry Page more
recently is shifted attention to Google+, a service introduced
in June to help users interact online. By the end of last month
it had 29 million users, according to  ComScore Inc.   While terms weren’t disclosed for the Slide acquisition,
the price was about $200 million, two people familiar with the
matter said last year. Slide, founded in 2005, raised $50
million from investors that valued the company at more than $500
million, BusinessWeek.com reported in 2008.  The decision to close Slide was reported earlier by the
AllThingsDigital blog.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , fell $3.25 to
$520.04 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have fallen 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
