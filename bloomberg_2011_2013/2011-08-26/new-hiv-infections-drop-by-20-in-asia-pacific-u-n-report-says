New HIV infections in Asian and
Pacific countries fell by 20 percent between 2001 and 2009, and
the number of people receiving anti-AIDS drugs tripled since
2006, the  United Nations  said in a  report  today.  Still, more than 60 percent of those who needed treatment
in the region werenâ€™t getting it at the end of 2009, the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS, said in the
report. About $1.1 billion was spent on fighting AIDS across the
region in that year, about a third of the amount required to
provide treatment for all those who need it, according to the
report.  About 4.9 million people in the region had HIV in 2009, and
that number has been relatively stable since 2005, the Geneva-
based agency said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
