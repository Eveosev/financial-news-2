Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, the state
oil company, and state miner  Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana 
will form a joint venture to develop gold mines in Venezuela,
the Information Ministry said today.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, will hold 40
percent of the venture to develop mines including Las Cristinas
and Las Brisas, the ministry said in a statement, citing Mining
Minister Jose Khan. CVG, as the state-run heavy industry holding
company is known, will hold the rest.  The South American country will have “more precise
control” over its gold industry, and all output will be handed
over to the  Central Bank , Khan said.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  on Aug. 23 said that PDVSA
would begin gold mining operations in the country after the
industry was nationalized this month. Venezuela took control of
the Las Cristinas mine, which may hold 27 million ounces of gold
reserves, in February after canceling a license held by
 Crystallex International Corp. (KRY) , a Canadian gold producer. The
Toronto-based company is currently seeking as much as $3.8
billion in damages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
