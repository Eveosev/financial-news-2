India ’s rupee headed for a fourth
weekly loss on speculation slowing economic growth and inflation
that has held above 9 percent this year will deter investors.  Foreign funds sold $348 million more Indian shares than
they bought in the first three days of this week, according to
data published yesterday by the Securities & Exchange Board of
India. A government report due Aug. 30 may show the economy
expanded 7.6 percent last quarter, the least since 2009,
according to the median estimate of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Wholesale-price gains averaged 9.5 percent in the
first seven months of 2011, government data show.  “Inflation continues to prevail at higher levels and
growth is also softening,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a currency
trader in Mumbai at Development Credit Bank Ltd. “This has led
to capital outflows as investors aren’t happy.”  The rupee dropped 0.7 percent this week to 46.075 per
dollar as of 11:49 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was little changed today. The rupee’s 4 percent
loss this month is the worst performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-
traded currencies.  Offshore forwards indicate the Indian currency will trade
at 46.50 to the dollar in three months, unchanged from
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
