PTT Chemical Pcl (PTTCH) ,  Thailand â€™s biggest
petrochemical maker by market value, maintained a revenue target
of 100 billion baht ($3.3 billion) this year, even as it plans
to shut an ethylene cracker for maintenance in the third
quarter, President Veerasak Kositpaisal said.  PTT Chemical shares climbed as much as 4.4 percent to
129.50 baht and traded at 128.5 baht as of 4:05 p.m. local time,
the largest increase since July 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
