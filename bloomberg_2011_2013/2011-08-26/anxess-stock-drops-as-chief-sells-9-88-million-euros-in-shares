Lanxess AG (LXS)  stock dropped as much as
9.3 percent in Frankfurt trading after Chief Executive Officer
Axel Heitmann sold 9.88 million euros ($14.3 million) of the
German chemical maker’s stock.  Lanxess fell to as low as 38.30 euros and was down 5.8
percent as of 11:07 a.m. Heitmann sold 253,691 shares at 38.95
euros apiece on Aug. 19, the Leverkusen-based company said in a
statement released yesterday after German markets closed.  Heitmann’s move marks only the second time that a board
member has sold shares since Lanxess went public in 2005,
according to the company’s website. The chemical maker, which
raised its full-year profit forecast two weeks ago, has plunged
35 percent from this year’s peak on May 4 as German stocks
retreat amid investors’ concern that European Union leaders will
fail to contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Rudolf Eickeler, a spokesman for Lanxess, declined to
comment on the CEO’s stock disposal.  Lanxess has fallen 33 percent this year, valuing the
manufacturer at 3.3 billion euros.  Matthias Zachert, who held the post of chief financial
officer until April, sold 584,416 euros in shares in January,
according to the  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
