Iraq’s Oil Ministry said it signed a
preliminary agreement with Egyptian company Al Qalaa to build a
150,000-barrel-a-day refinery in the northern city of Mosul.  Crude oil for the plant will come from the two nearby
fields of Najma and Qaiyarah, Iraqi Deputy Oil Minister Ahmed
al-Shamaa said today in a statement on the ministry’s website.  Al Qalaa will conduct design studies for three years prior
to construction of the refinery, he said. He did not disclose
the value of the contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
