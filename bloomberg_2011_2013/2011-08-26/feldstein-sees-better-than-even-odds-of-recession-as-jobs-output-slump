The  U.S. economy  may slip back into
a recession and will probably suffer more declines in production
and employment, according to  Martin Feldstein , a professor of
economics at Harvard University.  “My base forecast is that we’ve got a better-than-even
chance that we’ll be sliding into a recession,” Feldstein said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming. “I buy that we could easily tip into recession.”  There’s little that the  Federal Reserve  could do to boost
growth, so it’s unlikely they’ll undertake additional stimulus
measures, he said. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s speech today
suggested “they don’t have great plans” for action, he said.  “I don’t think there’s anything they can do,” Feldstein
said. “We’re not going to see them trying to do anything to
spur this economy in the near term.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Caroline Salas Gage in
