Posco (005490) , the world’s second-biggest
stainless-steel maker, will cut domestic prices of the alloy
used mostly in buildings by as much as 2.7 percent next month,
following a decline in the cost of nickel, a key raw material.  Prices of 300-series hot-rolled coils will decline by
100,000 won ($92) a metric ton to 3.6 million won in September
from this month, the Pohang, South Korea-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. Prices of 300-series cold-rolled
products will be reduced by the same amount, or 2.5 percent, to
3.87 million won, it said.  Nickel declined about 16 percent this month along with
losses in copper and aluminum on concern the cut in the U.S.
credit rating by  Standard & Poor’s  will dampen the global
economy, eroding demand for industrial metals. Stainless-steel
companies are the world’s biggest users of nickel.  “The domestic stainless steel market has weakened as
nickel prices fell sharply following the U.S. credit rating
downgrade in early August,” Posco said in the statement. “The
weakness in the market is regarded as a result of concerns about
a global fiscal crisis not as a result of demand reduction, and
market conditions are expected to improve in the peak-demand
season in September and October.”  Prices for 400-series stainless steel, used in home
appliances and cars, will be left unchanged next month, Posco
said. The 400-series uses ferrochrome as the key raw material.  Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.9 percent to $21,030 a ton at 4:16 p.m. in  Seoul .  Posco shares dropped 0.4 percent to close at 385,500 won in
Seoul trading, compared with a 0.8 percent advance in the local
benchmark  Kospi index. (KOSPI)  The price reduction announcement came
after the stock market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
