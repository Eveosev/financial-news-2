China ’s money-market rate had its
first decline in three weeks on speculation cash supply will
improve as the central bank adds capital to the financial system.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of interbank funding
availability, slid as the People’s Bank of China pumped in a
total of 219 billion yuan ($34.3 billion) of capital in the past
six weeks. The central bank this week kept the yields on one-
year and three-month bills unchanged, after pushing them up for
the first time in seven weeks at the previous sales on Aug. 16
and Aug. 18.  “It’s getting easier to borrow money in the  interbank
market ,” said Peng Hao, a bond analyst at Fudian Bank Co. in
Kunming. “As the central bank keeps injecting capital, there
will probably be more declines early next month. But in the
second half of September, the cash shortage may return as banks
hoard cash for the long National Day holiday.”  The seven-day repo, dropped 44 basis points this week to
4.07 percent as of 5:03 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It declined 42 basis points today.  Inflationary expectations in China may continue to grow,
making price-control targets harder to achieve, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing Zhang Ping, head
of the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top
planning agency.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose
23 basis points this week to 3.94 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 13 basis points today.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government bond due July 2012
increased two basis points this week to 3.71 percent, according
to quotes provided by the Interbank Funding Center. The rate
advanced one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  -- Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editor: Sandy Hendry, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
