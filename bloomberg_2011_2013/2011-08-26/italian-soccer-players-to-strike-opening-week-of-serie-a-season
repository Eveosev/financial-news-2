Players in Italian soccer’s Serie A
will strike the opening weekend of the season after failing to
reach a new collective bargaining agreement with the league.  The players had hoped for a new labor accord in order to
start the season tomorrow, the National Association of Italian
players said on its  website . Italy’s soccer federation FIGC also
confirmed the strike on its website.  “We acknowledge that the National League hasn’t signed the
labor agreement,” the association said after talks with the
clubs failed.  One of the main demands from the players is for teams to
pay a new national tax on high earners.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s austerity plan approved
by the Cabinet Aug. 12 includes an extra 5 percent tax on income
over 90,000 euros ($130,000) and 10 percent on income of more
than 150,000 euros in the years through 2013.  It’s second straight week a player strike delayed the start
of a European league season. Players in  Spain ’s top two
divisions struck last week’s opening games before reaching an
agreement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
