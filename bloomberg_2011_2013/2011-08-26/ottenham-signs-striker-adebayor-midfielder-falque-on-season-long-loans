Tottenham signed Manchester City
striker Emmanuel Adebayor and Juventus midfielder Yago Falque on
loans for the rest of the English Premier League season.  Adebayor, 27, joins Spurs after spending the second half of
last season on loan at Real  Madrid , where he scored eight goals
in 22 appearances. He’s netted 81 times in 186 games in English
soccer during spells with City and Arsenal following his move to
the Gunners from  Monaco  in 2006.  Tottenham also said on its website late yesterday that
Falque, a Spanish under-21 attacking midfielder, would join
until the end of the season. Falque, 21, began his professional
career at Barcelona before moving to Juventus, where he has been
loaned out to Bari and Villarreal’s second-string team over the
last two seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
