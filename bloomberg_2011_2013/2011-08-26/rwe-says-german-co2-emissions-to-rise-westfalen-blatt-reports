Johannes Lambertz, head of  RWE AG (RWE) ’s
power unit, said emissions of carbon dioxide will rise in
 Germany  as the country phases out nuclear energy,  Westfalen-
Blatt  reported today, citing an interview with Lambertz.  It will take 10 years until Germany has the same
amount of power plants that don’t emit carbon dioxide as it had
before the phase-out, Lambertz said, according to the German
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
