Russia ’s government may decide this
month to reduce the cost of hauling grain destined for export by
rail to help farmers in the country’s interior sell their crops,
according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  Officials are discussing coefficients of between 0.3 and
0.5 that may be applied to reduce the cost for rail shipments of
grain to export terminals in ports from distant areas such as
the Ural region and central Russia, Sergei Sukhov, deputy head
of the ministry’s department of agriculture market regulation,
