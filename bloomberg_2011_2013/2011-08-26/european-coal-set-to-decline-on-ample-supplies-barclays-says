Coal prices in  Europe  are set to
drop in the next few weeks as stockpiles at ports remain ample
and more shipments arrive from Colombia and the U.S.,  Barclays
Capital  said.  Inventories at the EMO terminal in Rotterdam, Europe’s
busiest port, are at an “elevated” level of 3 million metric
tons, Barclays Capital said in an e-mailed report today.
Deliveries of the commodity from Colombia and the U.S. continue
to buoy European supply, the report showed.  “We expect coal prices to soften from present levels until
the end of September and expect demand from both basins to pick
up from October,” the bank said.  Benchmark European coal prices declined for a second day.
Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp
with settlement next year slipped 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$126.75 a ton by 3:14 p.m. in  London .  Colombia is the world’s fourth-biggest coal exporter.
Shipments from the U.S. jumped 49 percent in the first quarter,
according to the Energy Information Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
