(Corrects CME’s CEO name in the first and second
paragraphs.)  A tax on currency derivatives
imposed by the Brazilian government last month to curb the
real’s appreciation won’t cause a migration of derivatives
trading offshore, said Craig Donohue, chief executive officer of
 CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest futures market.  The 1 percent tax on some bets against the dollar “is a
function of the larger dynamics of the currency appreciation,”
Donohue said today in an interview at the BM&FBovespa
derivatives conference in Campos do Jordao,  Brazil . “I don’t
expect it to be permanent so I think it won’t result in that
outcome,” Donohue said.  The government on July 27 levied a 1 percent tax on some
net short dollar positions by investors in the country’s futures
market. The government may increase the tax by up to 25 percent
if needed, according to the decree signed by President  Dilma
Rousseff . Brazil will begin collecting the tax on Oct. 5,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  BM&FBovespa SA, the operator of Latin America’s biggest
securities exchange, holds a five percent stake in CME and CME
holds a five percent stake in BM&F Bovespa, according to the Sao
Paulo-based exchange. CME Group is based in Chicago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
