Mauritius’s rupee declined against
the dollar, paring a third weekly advance as investors weighed
whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will extend measures to shore
up the economy.  The currency weakened as much as 1.2 percent and traded 0.3
percent down at 27.85 per dollar at 2:15 p.m. in  Port Louis , the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, trimming its
increase this week to 0.4 percent. Versus the euro, the rupee
depreciated as much as 1.5 percent, before trading 0.7 percent
down at 40.1924.  Investors are awaiting a speech by Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for any indications on
whether the U.S. central bank will embark on further stimulus,
including a third round of asset purchases which would boost
investor appetite for riskier assets. The speech is at 6 p.m.
Mauritian time.  “With the risk-on market backdrop having developed ahead
of today’s speech, were are being contrarian and growing
increasingly concerned about the risks of a negative market
response to  Jackson Hole ,” analysts led by  Benoit Anne  at
Societe Generale SA in  London  wrote in an e-mailed research
notes to clients. “On this basis, we maintain a bearish
bias toward emerging-market currencies.”  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.1843 to 27.3495
rupees, while the selling price was 28.6446 per dollar, compared
with 28.6553 on Aug. 25, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
