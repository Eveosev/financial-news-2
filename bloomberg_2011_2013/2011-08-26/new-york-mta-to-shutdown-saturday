New York  Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
said New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Transit Authority will institute a
system-wide shut-down when trains and buses begin their final
runs starting at about noon on Saturday due to Hurricane Irene.  The shut-down will include subways, buses, Long Island Rail
Road, Metro-North Railroad and Access-A-Ride.  Also, if wind speeds exceed 60 mph, several bridges
including the George Washington Bridge and Tappan Zee Bridge
will be closed. The information was disclosed in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
