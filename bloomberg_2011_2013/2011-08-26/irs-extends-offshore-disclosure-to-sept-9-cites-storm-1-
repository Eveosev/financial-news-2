The  Internal Revenue Service 
extended the deadline for U.S. taxpayers to declare their
offshore accounts until Sept. 9, citing the potential effects of
Hurricane Irene, the  agency announced today .  The deadline had been Aug. 31, and tax lawyers have been
preparing submissions to the agency.  The program is the agency’s second attempt to let taxpayers
pay penalties related to their undeclared accounts to avoid
criminal prosecution. Under this year’s program, people who come
forward must pay up to 25 percent of the highest annual amount
in the account from 2003 through 2010, plus back taxes, interest
and other penalties.  In June, the IRS announced that taxpayers who were having
difficulty gathering the necessary information could seek a 90-
day extension by Aug. 31. In today’s announcement, the agency
said that extension requests must be filed by Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
