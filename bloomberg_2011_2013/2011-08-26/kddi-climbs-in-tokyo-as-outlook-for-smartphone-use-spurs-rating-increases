KDDI Corp. (9433) , Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, jumped the most in more than two months
in Tokyo trading as expectations smartphone use will push up
revenue per user prompted analysts to raise their ratings.  The shares advanced as much as 3.9 percent to 563,000 yen,
the biggest intraday gain since June 10, and traded at 560,000
yen at the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo stock exchange. The
benchmark Topix index gained 0.1 percent.  KDDI data revenue surpassed voice for the first time in the
three months ended in June as the carrier sold more smartphones
that use Google Inc.’s Android operating system, luring users to
play games and download music and software. Data revenue per
user will probably grow 7 percent this fiscal year in  Japan ,
compared with 4 percent in the previous 12 months, according to
estimates by New Street Research LLC analysts including Kirk
Boodry.  “KDDI’s data ARPU is expected to increase because of
smartphones,” Hideaki Tanaka, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. Cost reductions in the fixed-line telecommunication
segment will also benefit the company, he wrote.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Mizuho Securities Co.
raised their ratings on KDDI to “outperform” from “neutral.”
Tanaka boosted his target price for KDDI to 670,000 yen from
610,000 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
