Ukraine seeks to get $1 billion of
Chinese investments to develop its coal-mining sector, President
 Viktor Yanukovych  said.  Agreements have been made with the Asian country to start a
joint pilot project to upgrade the Melnykova mine in the Luhansk
region, Yanukovych said today in Donetsk, also in east Ukraine,
according to a  statement  on the presidentâ€™s website.  Ukraine is actively looking for investments in coal mining
as it seeks to increase safety, Yanukovych said. Coal production
should rise by at least 10 percent a year, according to the
president.  The eastern European country has about 12 trillion cubic
meters of coal-bed methane, the president said. Coal-bed methane
is a type of so-called unconventional natural gas that
originates in coal seams and is drained from surface boreholes
before mining starts.  To contact the reporter son this story:
