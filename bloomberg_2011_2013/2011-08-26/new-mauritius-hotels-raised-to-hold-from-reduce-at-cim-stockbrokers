New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s biggest leisure operator by market value, was raised
to “hold” from “reduce” at Cim Stockbrokers Ltd. on
expectations profit will rise.  “We forecast that earnings for financial year 2012 would
improve by 53 percent,” Kishen Nadassen and Madhvi Bhylagee,
analysts at the Port Louis-based brokerage, said in an e-mailed
report today. “Should share prices continue to weaken, the
stock could reach potential good entry points from a long-term
perspective.”  New Mauritius Hotels has declined 23 percent this year, the
biggest drop among leisure stocks on the Mauritius stock
exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
unchanged at 84.50 rupees as of the 1:30 p.m. close.  Tourism and textiles are the Indian Ocean island nation’s
largest foreign-currency earners. Tourist arrivals rose 5.1
percent to 542,638 in the seven months through July compared
with a year earlier, according to the government.  New Mauritius Hotels operates resorts under the Beachcomber
brand and has an airline-catering unit. The group’s nine-month
profit increased 12 percent to 769.5 million rupees from a year
earlier, it said on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
