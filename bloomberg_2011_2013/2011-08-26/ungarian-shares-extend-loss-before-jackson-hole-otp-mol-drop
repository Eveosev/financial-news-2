Hungarian shares extended declines
after a U.S. report showed the worldâ€™s largest economy grew less
than previously estimated and before a speech by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  The BUX gauge of 13 companies slid 1.7 percent to 17,468.40
as of 3:31 p.m. in Budapest. OTP Bank Nyrt. and oil refiner Mol
Nyrt., which have a combined 56 percent weighting in the index,
each retreated more than 1.5 percent.  European stocks and U.S. equity futures fell after the U.S.
Commerce Department said the American economy expanded an annual
1 percent in the second quarter, down from its earlier estimate
of 1.3 percent. Bernanke, scheduled to speak later today, may
hint at what tools policy makers can still use to spur growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
