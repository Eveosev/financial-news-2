Oil may fall next week as Libyan
rebels consolidate their hold on the country after deposing
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and begin taking steps to restore crude
exports, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Seventeen of 34 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
decline through Sept. 2. Nine respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted prices will increase and eight estimated there will be
little change during the period. Last week 42 percent of
surveyed analysts projected a decline.  Libya ’s National Transitional Council plans to resume
production “in a few weeks,” Ahmed Jehani, chairman of the
rebels’ stabilization team, said Aug. 23 in Dubai. Output may
take a year to reach the previous total of 1.5 million barrels a
day, he said. Production from Libya, which holds  Africa ’s
largest oil reserves, slumped to 60,000 barrels a day in July,
according to the Paris-based  International Energy Agency .  “We haven’t really seen a drop reflecting the Libyan
news,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “We’re going to
see some production restored relatively soon, and I think that
will have a moderate impact on the market next week.”  Libya could boost output to 200,000 barrels a day by mid-
September, then increase to 500,000 barrels a day by the end of
the year and reach 900,000 at the end of 2012, according to a
forecast this week by  Edward Morse , head of commodities research
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and analyst Faisel Khan, both
based in  New York .  $90 Forecast  Standard Chartered Plc cut its third-quarter price forecast
this week on weaker-than-expected demand in the U.S. New York-
traded West Texas Intermediate crude may average $90 a barrel in
the three months ending Sept. 30 from a previous forecast of
$98, according to a report dated Aug. 24 by Helen Henton, a
London-based analyst.  Total products supplied, a measure of fuel consumption, has
fallen 5.2 percent to 19.2 million barrels a day in the two
weeks ended Aug. 19, according to an Aug. 24 report from the
U.S. Energy Department.  Crude oil for October delivery increased $2.96, or 3.6
percent, to $85.37 a barrel this week on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures have fallen 6.6 percent this year.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 48 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
