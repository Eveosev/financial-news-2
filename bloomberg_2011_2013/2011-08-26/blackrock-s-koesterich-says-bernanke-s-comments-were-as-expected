Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-
based global chief investment strategist for the IShares unit of
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , comments on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s statement today in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Bernanke said the central bank still has tools to stimulate
the economy. He didn’t provide details or signal when or whether
policy makers might deploy them. Koesterich, whose firm oversees
$3.66 trillion, spoke in a telephone interview.  “This is pretty much what we expected. At least, the
market can stabilize. It’s a very different circumstance from
last year when you had the threat of deflation. You lost that
economic rationale for another round of quantitative easing. You
have a case where interest-rates are very low. It was not clear
what the Fed expanding their balance-sheet would do in the near-
term.  “The economic data points are likely going to continue to
be weak, but the market already knows that. If you have period
when economic data is poor, but not as bad as people expect, you
can actually see some relief in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
