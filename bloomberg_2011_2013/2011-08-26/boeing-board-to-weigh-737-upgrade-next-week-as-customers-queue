(Corrects ninth paragraph of story published Aug. 26 to
remove outlook for conversions of existing 737 orders.)  Boeing Co. (BA)  has customers lined up
for an upgrade of its best-selling 737 with more fuel-efficient
engines as it awaits board approval for the project as soon as
Aug. 29, the planemaker’s business-development chief said.  Demand should be similar to that for the new A320neo from
Airbus SAS,  Nicole Piasecki  said today in an interview. Airbus
decided in December to update its single-aisle jet with new
engines and racked up more than 1,000 orders and commitments
within seven months as airlines scrambled for production slots.  “We’re heavily engaged with customers across the world
right now who are excited about the product,” Piasecki said.
“A lot of our customers are going to want to get access to it
as fast as possible. That dynamic will exist for us in the same
way it existed for Airbus.”  Boeing’s board is scheduled to meet Aug. 28 and 29 in
 Chicago , the corporate headquarters, and will consider
management’s decision last month to offer new engines on the 737
rather than wait to develop an all-new single-aisle plane that
wouldn’t be ready until the end of the decade.  The redesigned 737 would officially be launched this fall
and enter service mid-decade. Airbus plans to start delivering
its neo in 2015.  American Order  The 737 upgrade makes up half of the 200-jet order Boeing
won from  American Airlines  in late July. The  Fort Worth , Texas-
based carrier split its purchase of 460 aircraft between the
U.S. company and Airbus. That broke American’s exclusive
arrangement with Boeing since 1987, compelling the planemaker to
shift from its stated preference for an all-new jet.  Piasecki said Boeing is still working with carriers on
changes to the 737, the world’s most widely flown plane. The
only engine option will be the Leap-X from  CFM International , a
partnership of Safran SA and  General Electric Co. (GE)   Engineers have been trying to devise an engine-fan size for
the new 737 that will be bigger than the current ones, to reduce
fuel consumption, while still small enough to minimize changes
to the plane’s fuselage, which sits low to the ground.  Boeing still expects to sell more of its current 737s,
though it also will work with customers should they want to
convert their orders into contracts for the model with new
engines, she said. Boeing beat Airbus this week for an order for
100 737-900ERs from Delta Air Lines Inc.  Boeing climbed $1.70, or 2.8 percent, to $62.80 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
increase on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  To contact the reporter on this story:
