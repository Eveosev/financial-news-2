Peruvian bonds extended their
longest winning streak in at least five years as investors bet
inflation pressures will ease and the central bank will keep
 interest rates  on hold for longer than previously expected.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 5.65 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields have fallen for 14 straight days,
the longest streak since at least February 2006. The security’s
price rose 0.05 centimo to 115.21 centimos per sol. Yields fell
25 basis points this week, the most in three months.  Peru’s central bank has kept its benchmark rate unchanged
at 4.25 percent since June as the $153 billion economy began to
slow. Investors expect rates to stay on hold for the rest of
this year as inflation pressures ease, said Manuel Aldave, head
of investments at Banco Internacional del  Peru  in Lima.  “The whole curve has fallen on expectation global growth
will affect the Peruvian economy and inflation will return to
the central bank’s target range,” Aldave said. “Sol-
denominated papers at current rates remain attractive for some
investors.”  Monthly inflation accelerated 0.79 percent in July, the
most in three years, as annual inflation reached a two-year high
of 3.35 percent. The central bank targets annual inflation in a
range of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Interest-Rate Policy  Peruvian central bank President Julio Velarde said that
policy makers stand ready to adjust their interest-rate policy
if the global economy worsens.  “ Monetary policy  will remain focused on returning
inflation to the target range,” Velarde said in comments posted
on the  Finance Ministry ’s website. “However, if external
conditions deteriorate, the bank will react in a proactive
way.”  Banco de Credito del Peru, the country’s largest bank, said
in an Aug. 17 report that interest rates will stay on hold after
previously forecasting a quarter-point rise to 4.50 percent
before the end of this year.  The central bank purchased dollars for a fifth straight day
today to temper gains in the sol, which rose to a three-year
high.  The sol strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 2.7308 per
 U.S. dollar , from 2.7320 yesterday. The currency gained 0.1
percent this week.  Dollar Purchases  The central bank purchased $600 million this week,
including $147 million today, as Peruvian banks cut back their
holdings of the U.S. currency. That’s the bank’s biggest weekly
purchase in a year.  Bets the sol will appreciate even as the global economy
loses steam boosted demand for local currency bonds in the short
end of the sovereign yield curve, Aldave said.  The government Aug. 23 sold bonds for the first time in
five months, issuing 425 million soles ($156 million) of bonds
due 2013 and 2042.  Demand for the securities was more than six times the
initial amount offered, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla told
lawmakers yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
