A yacht part-owned by  Tony Hayward ,
 BP Plc (BP/) â€™s former chief executive officer, may be given to an
unidentified charity, the Financial Times reported, citing a
person familiar with the matter.  A final decision on the future of the boat, which is also
owned by  Centrica Plc (CNA)  CEO Sam Laidlaw and banker Rob Gray, will
be taken in the next few weeks, the newspaper said.  Hayward drew criticism in June 2010 when he took part in a
yacht race less than three months after the accident which led
to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill crisis, the FT said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
