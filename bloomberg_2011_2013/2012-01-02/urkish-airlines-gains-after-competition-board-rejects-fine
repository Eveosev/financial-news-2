Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, or Turkish
Airlines, rose after  Turkey â€™s competition board ruled alleged
violations of competition rules were groundless.  The shares climbed 2.8 percent to 2.18 liras at 10:35 a.m.
in Istanbul trading, rising for the first day in five.  The competition board investigated if the airline violated
competition rules through actions that hurt low-cost carrier
Pegasus Airlines, the board said in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
