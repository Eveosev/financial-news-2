Deutsche Bahn AG (DBHN)  will create about
10,000 jobs this year as the state-owned rail company expands,
Handelsblatt  reported , citing company documents.  The new staff would mean  Deutsche Bahn  will employ nearly
296,000 people globally by 2013, Handelsblatt said. The company
needs more employees in part because unions gained an additional
vacation day for workers and the company plans to perform more
security and information technology itself, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
