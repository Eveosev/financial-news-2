Russian equities in New York rose as
investors purchased shares from the world’s cheapest emerging
market and oil capped a third year of gains, trimming a 2011
decline for the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index (RUS14BN) .  The index of Russian companies traded in New York added 0.7
percent to 90.56 on Dec. 30, led by  Polyus Gold International
Ltd. (PLZLY) , the country’s biggest gold producer. The gauge dropped 10

decline in 2008. Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index, trading at 5

the year 17 percent lower.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest
aluminum producer, rose 0.6 percent to HK$4.95 in Hong Kong
trading as of 11:32 a.m. local time.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, advanced 8.2 percent
last year on speculation a U.S. economic recovery will bolster
demand and concern escalating tension in the  Middle East  may
disrupt supplies. The Micex has lost 6.9 percent since
parliamentary elections on Dec. 4 sparked the biggest anti-
government protests in more than a decade. Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  aims to win a first-round vote in a March

which oversees $1 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“Looking into 2012, shares will continue to get a discount
because of concerns about the quality of local corporate
governance and growing political instability. If oil drops from
here, it’s only going to make a bad situation worse.”  Oil’s Advance  Crude for February delivery retreated 0.8 percent to settle

commodities fell 0.1 percent to 4,885.30 on Dec. 30 as the gauge

crisis in Europe and a cooling Chinese economy will sap demand
for raw materials.  Russia ’s economy, which grew 4 percent in 2010, may have
expanded as much as 4.5 percent in 2011 and gross domestic
product may rise 3.7 percent this year, the government

Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 22 percent last
