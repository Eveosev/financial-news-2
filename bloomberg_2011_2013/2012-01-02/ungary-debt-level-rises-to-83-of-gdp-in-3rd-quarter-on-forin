Hungary’s public debt level rose to
82.6 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the third
quarter, the central bank said today.  The nominally calculated gross, consolidated debt level
rose from 76.8 percent of GDP in the second quarter, the  Magyar
Nemzeti Bank  said on its website today.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  effectively nationalized $13
billion of private pension funds to reduce the eastern European
Union’s highest debt level. The policy, part of the government’s
“unorthodox” measures, hurt investor confidence and weakened
the forint, raising the debt level, half of which was
denominated in foreign currencies.  The forint dropped 16 percent against the euro in the
second half of 2011, the worst performance among more than 170
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It traded at 314.07 at 4:31
p.m. in Budapest.  The central bank is “trying to compare apples and pears
since gross domestic product is measured in forint while a
significant portion of the debt is in foreign currencies,” said
Gabriella Selmeczi, a spokeswoman of Orban’s Fidesz party,
according to MTI state news service. She said previous Socialist
governments were to blame for the foreign currency debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
