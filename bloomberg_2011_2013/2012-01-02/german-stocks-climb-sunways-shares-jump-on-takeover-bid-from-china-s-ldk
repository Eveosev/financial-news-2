German stocks (SXXP)  advanced on the first
trading day this year, following a 15 percent annual loss for
the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index in 2011, as the country’s manufacturing
output beat estimates in December.  Henkel AG and  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  rose more than 3 percent.
 Sunways AG (SWW)  surged 21 percent after  China ’s LDK Solar Co. said it
intends to take over the company.  Solarworld AG (SWV)  climbed after a
report that Chief Executive Officer Frank Asbeck called fourth-
quarter sales “pleasantly good.”  The DAX increased 3 percent to 6,075.52 at the close in
Frankfurt, its highest price since Dec. 5. The gauge retreated
last year, for its first full-year loss after the 40 percent
plunge in 2008, amid speculation that the euro area’s fiscal
crisis will force at least one nation to default on its debt.
The broader HDAX Index added 2.9 percent today.  “Big crises have a habit of creating big investment
opportunities,” said John Chatfeild-Roberts, chief investment
officer of London-based Jupiter Asset Management Ltd., which
manages 20 billion pounds ($32 billion). “ Europe  is having an
especially big crisis. Therefore, over time, we can expect to
see some wonderful opportunities unfolding. The point will come
when the scales start to tilt back to favor increasing risk
levels but we are not there yet.”  A manufacturing  gauge (PMITMGE)  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in  Germany  rose to 48.4 in December, beating the
initial estimate of 48.1 published on Dec. 15. A reading below
50 indicates contraction.  Today’s trading volume on the DAX was 42 percent of the
average in the last 100 days.  European Debt  Some 157 billion euros ($203 billion) in debt will mature
in the 17-member euro area in the first three months of 2012,
according to UBS AG. National leaders have pledged to draft a
stricter rulebook for controlling  government spending . German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
will meet in Berlin on Jan. 9 to work out the details.  In her New Year’s address, Merkel said she expects
turbulence in 2012 as she does “everything” to save the euro
and end the sovereign-debt crisis. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said in his New Year’s message that the country faces
a difficult year and must continue efforts to stay in the euro.  The preferred shares of  Henkel (HEN3) , the maker of industrial
adhesives and Soft Scrub cleaners, increased 3.3 percent to
46.06 euros. ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s biggest steelmaker, gained
4.5 percent to 18.52 euros.  Daimler AG increased 4.3 percent to 35.37 euros. The
carmaker said that it has delivered more than two million
Mercedes sport-utility vehicles since their introduction.  Target for 2012  The company wants to produce a record 988,110 Mercedes-Benz
brand vehicles in Germany in 2012, Automotive News Europe
reported yesterday, citing internal company documents.  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest utility, advanced 5.3
percent to 28.60 euros, a third day of gains for the longest
winning streak since Oct. 10. The company is among stocks on CA
Cheuvreux’s German selected list for 2012. Larger competitor  EON
AG (EOAN)  jumped 4.5 percent to 17.42 euros.  Sunways (SWW)  jumped 21 percent to 1.87 euros, the largest
advance since June. The company said LDK Solar would buy 33
percent in the company and offered to purchase the remaining
stake for 1.90 euros per share.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  rose 5.2 percent to
54.5 euro cents.  Solarworld climbed 3.1 percent to 3.35 euros as Asbeck told
Euro am Sonntag that the company will meet its full-year target
of more than 1 billion euros in sales.  -- With assistance from  Jeff Black  in  Frankfurt . Editors:
