Australia  reached 116-3 in reply to
India’s first-innings 191 as fast bowlers took all 13 wickets to
fall on day one of the second cricket Test in Sydney.  Zaheer Khan removed Australia batsman David Warner, Shaun
Marsh and Ed Cowan in the final session to extend the pacemens’
dominance after  James Pattinson ,  Ben Hilfenhaus  and Peter Siddle
combined to bowl out India shortly after tea.  Australia captain Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting finished
the day with an unbeaten 79-run partnership to guide their team
to the close without further loss as it seeks a 2-0 series lead
after winning last week’s opener.  Clarke will resume day two on 47 and Ponting 44 having led
Australia’s recovery from 37-3.  Zaheer removed Warner to end the first over of Australia’s
reply and then dismissed Marsh with the first ball of his next
over to reduce the home team to 8-2 as VVS Laxman took the
catch. Ponting fended off the hat-trick ball from Zaheer, who
trapped Cowan leg-before-wicket for his third wicket.  Pattinson earlier removed  Gautam Gambhir ,  Virender Sehwag ,
Laxman and  Sachin Tendulkar  for figures of 4-43, lifting his
tally to 24 wickets in his first four matches at cricket’s elite
level. Hilfenhaus took 3-51 and Siddle 3-55, while Cowan snared
three catches at short leg.  Pattinson reduced India to 124-6 when he got Tendulkar to
play onto his stumps for 41, extending the Indian batsman’s wait
for his 100th international century.  Hilfenhaus then dismissed Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer and
Ishant Sharma before Siddle ended the Indian innings by having
Umesh Yadav caught behind for his 100th Test wicket. Dhoni top
scored with 57 not out.  Both teams were unchanged from the first Test in Melbourne,
which Australia won by 122 runs to go 1-0 up in the best-of-four
contest. That victory ended Australia’s eight-match winless
streak against  India  in Tests going back to January 2008.  India, which holds the Border-Gavaskar Trophy contested by
the teams after winning its last two home Test series against
the Australians, has never won a series in Australia since it
began touring there in 1947.  To contact the reporter on this story:
