Public Affairs, the smallest party in
the  Czech Republic â€™s ruling coalition, wants to raise income
taxes,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Premier Petr Necas.  Necas is against raising direct taxes and would prefer an
increase in levies including value-added tax if the government
needs to boost revenue to meet its budget-deficit target, the
newspaper cited him as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
