An Iranian judge may issue a verdict
this week in the case against Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of
former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is accused of
propaganda against the government, the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency  reported.  Final defense arguments were heard on Dec. 24, IRNA said,
citing the country‘s Prosecutor General Golamhossien Mohseni-
Ejei. The trial judge now has a week to issue the verdict,
according to IRNA.  Hashemi has been arrested twice for joining anti-government
rallies. In an interview with the magazine  Foreign Policy  last
year, she accused the government of making up statistics and
criticized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s handling of the
country’s affairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
