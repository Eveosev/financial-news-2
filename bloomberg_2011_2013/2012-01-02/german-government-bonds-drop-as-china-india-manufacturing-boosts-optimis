German  government bonds  fell, pushing
the 10-year yield higher for the first time in five days, as
European stocks gained and a Chinese manufacturing gauge rose in
December, fueling optimism the global economy may stabilize.  The losses pushed the bund yield up from the lowest since
Nov. 17 as  India ’s manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in six
months. Germany’ economy,  Europe ’s largest, will improve during
2012 even as financial markets experience “considerable
uncertainties,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann was quoted
as saying in German newspaper Tagesspiegel. Spanish 10-year
bonds were little changed after the government said last week
the 2011  budget deficit  would be higher than forecast.  “The move down in 10-year bund yields was, of course, in a
very illiquid market and may have been a bit exaggerated,” said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “ Asia  is a stronghold for growth and we
are grateful they kept us going last year. The crucial question
is whether they will continue.”  The German 10-year yield increased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 3:48 p.m. London time.
The 2 percent bund due January 2022 fell 0.66, or 6.60 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,294) face amount, to 100.89. The yield dropped 13
basis points last week to 1.83 percent. The two-year rate was
six basis points higher at 0.20 percent.  China, India Manufacturing  The Spanish 10-year yield was two basis points higher at
5.11 percent. The Italian 10-year yield fell 22 basis points to
6.89 percent, after rising for seven consecutive days.  China ’s purchasing managers’ index was at 50.3 from 49 in
November, the Beijing-based logistics federation said in a
statement yesterday. The reading exceeded all forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey of 15 analysts, where the median estimate
was 49.1. India’s PMI Index rose to 54.2 in December from 51 in
November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in a
statement.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced for a third straight
day, gaining 0.9 percent. It slid 11 percent in 2011, for its
first annual drop since losing 46 percent in 2008.  Stocks stayed higher and bunds lower even as a Markit
Economics report affirmed that European manufacturing output
contracted for a fifth month in December.  The gauge, based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
17-nation euro region rose to 46.9 from 46.4 in November, the
London-based research company said today. That was in line with
an initial estimate published on Dec. 15. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  French Bonds Decline  French bonds declined for a fourth day, leaving the yield
on the 10-year security eight basis points higher at 3.23
percent. That left the extra yield, or spread, that investors
get for holding the securities instead of similar maturity bunds
at 133 basis points. The spread widened from 42 basis points a
year ago, partly on concern that the country’s AAA rating would
be threatened by potential losses at its banks amid the
sovereign debt crisis.  Germany ’s government declined to comment on a report that
it may push for creditors to accept bigger losses on Greek debt
than previously agreed upon, saying only that talks on lowering
 Greece ’s debt level may end soon.  The country is studying a proposal to write down 75 percent
of Greek government bonds held by private creditors as part of a
planned debt swap to ensure greater debt sustainability, Greek
news website  Euro2day.gr  reported today, without citing anyone.  2011 Returns  Germany is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of additional
10-year bonds on Jan. 4. A sale of January 2022 securities on
Nov. 23 generated bids covering just 65 percent of the debt
issued, fueling concern that investors would desert even the
region’s most credit-worthy nation.  The loss of confidence proved to be temporary and this
week’s sale may be “reasonably successful,” Ulrich Wortberg,
an analyst at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt ,
wrote in a client note today.  German bonds returned 9.7 percent in 2011, the most since
the financial crisis of 2008, when they made 12 percent, indexes
developed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch show. Italian debt
declined 5.7 percent.  Gains by German bonds last year pushed the 10-year yield to
a record low 1.636 percent in September as investors sought
refuge from a sovereign debt crisis that forced Greece, Ireland
and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. Italian yields climbed to a euro-
era high of 7.48 percent in November as the crisis threatened to
infect the euro area’s third-biggest economy.  Spain’s budget deficit for 2011 may exceed 8 percent of
gross domestic product, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in
an interview with Cadena SER radio today. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced 14.9 billion euros of spending cuts and tax
increases on Dec. 30.  Spain ’s previous government had targeted a
deficit of 6 percent.  Volatility on Italian sovereign debt was the second highest
in euro-area markets today, followed by  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps. Austria was the highest, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
