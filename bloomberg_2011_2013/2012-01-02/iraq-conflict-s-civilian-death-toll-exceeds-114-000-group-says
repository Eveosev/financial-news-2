More than 114,000 civilians have died
in violence in  Iraq  since the 2003 U.S. invasion, according to a
group that tracks the number of people killed in the conflict.  A total of 4,059 Iraqi civilians were reported killed last
year, slightly more than in 2010, London-based Iraq Body Count
said in an analysis released today. The last U.S. combat troops
left Iraq in December.  “The rate of Iraqi civilian deaths caused by U.S.-led
coalition forces has declined steadily from 2009, while the rate
caused by Iraqi state forces has increased,” the group said in
an e-mailed news release.  Recent trends point to a “persistent low-level conflict in
Iraq that will continue to kill civilians at a similar rate for
years to come,” Iraq Body Count said. “Time will tell whether
the withdrawal of U.S. forces will have an effect on casualty
levels,” the group said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
