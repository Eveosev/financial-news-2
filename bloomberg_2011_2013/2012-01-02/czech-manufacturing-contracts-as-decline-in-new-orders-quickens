Czech manufacturing contracted for a
second month in December as new orders declined at a faster
pace, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 49.2,
compared with 48.6 in November, “indicating a slower overall
contraction of the sector” the bank said today in an e-mailed
report. A result greater than 50 signals overall growth.  “New business has fallen for two months running, and the
latest contraction was the strongest since July 2009,” the bank
said in  the report, compiled by Markit, a financial information
services company. “New export orders also declined for the
second successive month, with firms commenting widely on the
crisis in  Europe  affecting demand for goods.”  Czech economic  growth (CZGDPSAY)  depends on demand for its products
from the European Union as the bloc buys about 80 percent of the
country’s exports, with Germany accounting for a third. The
central bank weighed a worsening economic outlook against
accelerating  inflation (CZCPYOY)  when its board voted unanimously to leave
the benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent for a
13th meeting on Dec. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
