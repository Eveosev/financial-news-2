Chile’s peso gained to a two-week
high, outpacing the region’s other currencies, on buying by
local pension funds.  The currency gained 0.2 percent to 518.65 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago, the strongest since Dec. 16.  Chile’s pension funds had $133 billion of assets under
management at the end of November, the equivalent of 65 percent
of the country’s gross domestic product. The funds must take
long peso positions to offset their foreign currency exposure
when they buy assets abroad.  “It’s not moving on external markets,” said Sebastian Momberg, a trader at BCI Corredor de Bolsa SA in Santiago.
“There is buying from local financial institutions: pension
funds.”  The move occurred amid light volumes. As of 12 p.m. $329
million of trades had occurred, compared with a daily average of
$1.3 billion in December, according to data from the Electronic
Stock Exchange.  Interest-rate swap rates climbed. The one-year interest-
rate swap rate increased five basis points to 4.38 percent.  Offshore investors increased their short position in
Chilean peso forwards to $6.1 billion from $6 billion on Dec.
29, according to central bank data.  Short-term borrowing costs, which spiked last month amid a
liquidity squeeze, slid today. The interest rate banks must pay
to borrow for between 90 and 365 days fell to a two-week low of
5.88 percent on Dec. 29.  The average monthly yield of a term deposit due in less
than 30 days fell to 0.44 percent today from 0.46 percent on
Dec. 30, according to the Santiago stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
