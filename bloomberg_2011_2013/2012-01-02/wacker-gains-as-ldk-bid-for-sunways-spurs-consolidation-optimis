Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-biggest
maker of solar-grade silicon, rose to the highest in almost
three weeks in Frankfurt after LDK Solar Co.’s bid for panel-
maker  Sunways AG (SWW)  spurred the prospect of industry consolidation.  Wacker rose as much as 4.6 percent to 65 euros, the highest
price since Dec. 13. LDK Solar Co. said on Dec. 31 that it
intends to make a voluntary public takeover offer for Sunways,
based in Konstanz,  Germany .  Solar-panel makers in Germany have been struggling with
falling demand in their home market, the world’s biggest in
2010, amid rising foreign competition. Chinese peers have
increased production capacity even as international prices
slumped, tipping Germany’s  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and  Solon SE (SOO1)  into
insolvency in December.  “The hope has arisen that consolidation of the solar
industry has started,” said Erkan Aycicek, an analyst at
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg who has a “sell” rating on the
stock. “The recent insolvencies also mean that overcapacity is
being reduced.”  Wacker, based in Munich, was trading up 3.8 percent at
10:02 a.m. local time for a market value of 3.36 billion euros
($4.35 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
