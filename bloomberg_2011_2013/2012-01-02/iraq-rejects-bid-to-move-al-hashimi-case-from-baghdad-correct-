(Corrects status of Tariq al-Hashimi in first paragraph.)  Iraqâ€™s judicial supreme council ruled
that the terrorism case against Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi
will stay in  Baghdad , Sumaria News said.  Iraq issued an arrest warrant against al-Hashimi last
month. In a televised press conference on Dec. 20, al-Hashimi
denied the charges and requested that the case be transferred to
the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, where he fled after a
warrant for his arrest was issued.  A panel of nine judges has been assigned to the case,
Sumaria said, citing council spokesman Abdel Sattar al-
Bairaqdar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
