Two Credit Mutuel-CIC units were
inspected by  France ’s data protection authority following a data
system failure reported on Dec. 28 by weekly newspaper Canard
Enchaine, the Paris-based watchdog said today.  The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes
searched an information-technology unit in Strasbourg, France,
and a newspaper belonging to the bank in the French town of
Woippy, CNIL said on its  website .  “The commission is now analyzing the numerous pieces of
evidence gathered during the inspections to decide what to do,”
CNIL said.  Credit Mutuel-CIC declined to comment on the searches,
Bruno Brouchiquan, a spokesman for the bank, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
