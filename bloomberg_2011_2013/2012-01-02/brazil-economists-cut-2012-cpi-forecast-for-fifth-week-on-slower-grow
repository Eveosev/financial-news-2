Economists covering  Brazil  cut their
forecasts for 2012 inflation for a fifth straight week as growth
slows in  Latin America ’s biggest economy.  Consumer prices will increase 5.32 percent this year,
according to the median forecast in a Dec. 30  central bank
survey  of about 100 economists published today, from a forecast
of 5.33 percent the previous week. Consumer prices, as measured
by the  IPCA index (BZPIIPCY) , rose 6.55 percent in 2011, the survey showed,
from a forecast of 6.54 percent last week.  Economists expect the central bank to cut interest rates
half a percentage point to 10.5 percent at its Jan. 17-18 policy
meeting, and to 9.5 percent by the end of the year, the survey
found. In November, central bank President Alexandre Tombini cut
 interest rates  for a third straight meeting, to 11 percent, to
help protect Brazil from the European debt crisis.  “Economists are seeing that economic activity in 2012
won’t be as great as previously forecast, and that will affect
inflation,” said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao Paulo-
based Gradual Investimentos. Slow global growth, a weaker jobs
market and government spending curbs will help ease inflation to
5.1 percent by the end of the year, Perfeito said.  Economists cut their estimate for economic growth last year
to 2.87 percent, from 2.90 percent. Brazil’s economy will expand
3.3 percent this year, from a previous forecast of 3.40 percent,
according to the survey.  Economic Contraction  Brazil’s economy contracted in the third quarter for the
first time in more than two years, while retail sales stalled in
October and industrial output shrank for a third month. The MSCI
All Country World Index of equities lost 6.9 percent last year,
after accounting for reinvested dividends, as European debt
turmoil spread to Spain and  Italy .  Annual inflation slowed for a third straight month in mid-
December, to 6.56 percent. Brazil targets consumer price rises
of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Inflation
has exceeded the upper limit of the target range since April.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, was unchanged
at 10.04 percent at 6:32 a.m. New York time. The real
strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.8608 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
