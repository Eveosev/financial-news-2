At least one country will pull out of
the euro area this year as the breakup of the single currency
begins, according to the Centre for Economics and Business
Research.  “It now looks as though 2012 will be the year when the
euro starts to break up,” the London-based  CEBR  said in a
statement today. “It is not a done deal yet -- we are only
forecasting a 60 percent probability -- but our forecast is that
by the end of the year at least one country (and probably more)
will leave.”  CEBR said the likelihood of a euro breakup in the next
decade has increased to 99 percent.  European leaders return to work this week seeking to buy
time for the Spanish and Italian governments to wrest control
over their debt and rescue the euro from fragmentation in its
10th anniversary year.  Ten years after euro bank notes replaced national
currencies on Jan. 1, 2002, the euro has for the first time
recorded two consecutive annual losses against the  U.S. dollar 
while plunging to a record low against the yen. That raises the
pressure on leaders as they struggle to hold the monetary union
together in the face of credit downgrades, European Union splits
and a looming recession that might compound rising debt.  The crisis may force “most of the French and German
banking systems” to seek bailouts to compensate for writedowns
on their holdings of sovereign debt, CEBR said. “They might
even be nationalized as well. Many other European banks will go
back into crisis.”  The euro was trading at $1.2946 at 1:26 p.m. in Brussels,
down 0.1 percent on the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
