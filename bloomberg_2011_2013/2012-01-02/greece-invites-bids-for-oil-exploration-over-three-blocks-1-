Greece  invited investors to bid to
explore for, and then exploit, hydrocarbon reserves in three
blocks, two of which are offshore and one onshore.  The three blocks, Patraikos Gulf and Katakolo, located off
the western coast, and Ioannina in the northwest of the
mainland, are estimated to hold oil reserves of around 250
million barrels, the Athens-based  Energy Ministry  said in an e-
mailed  statement  today.  The need to reduce Greece’s dependency on imported energy
and to secure its  energy supply  means the country must have “an
 energy policy  that strongly promotes the development of domestic
energy sources,” the statement cited Energy and Climate Change
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  as saying.  Investors, who must submit offers by July 2, may bid for
rights in more than one block, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
