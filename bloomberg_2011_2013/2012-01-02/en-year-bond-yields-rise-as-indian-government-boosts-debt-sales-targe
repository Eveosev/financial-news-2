India ’s 10-year bond yields fell the
most in almost 20 months amid speculation the central bank will
accelerate debt purchases to boost cash at banks after the
government increased its borrowing target to a record.  The  Reserve Bank  of India resumed open-market purchases of
sovereign securities in November and has purchased 412 billion
rupees ($7.7 billion) of notes via auctions since then, official
data show. Yields at the highest level in almost a month also
attracted buyers, said Killol Pandya, the Mumbai-based head of
fixed-income investment at Daiwa Asset Management (India) Pvt.  “Expectation is building up that the central bank may take
some measures to boost cash to support the borrowing program,”
Pandya said.  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 fell
19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, to 8.39 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system, the
biggest drop in benchmark  yields (GIND10YR)  since May 2010. It touched 8.60
percent earlier, the highest level since Dec. 7.  The  finance ministry  will expand its borrowing program for
the year ending March 31 by 400 billion rupees to 5.1 trillion
rupees, the central bank said in a statement after the financial
markets closed on Dec. 30. Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  is
boosting offerings to finance a  budget deficit  as the slowest
economic  growth (INQGGDPY)  since 2009 reduces revenue.  Boosting Growth  India’s central bank may reverse its record pace of
 interest rates  increases to boost growth as inflation shows
signs of easing, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported, citing
Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao .  India may also raise 400 billion rupees through a
divestment plan, Economic Affairs Secretary R. Gopalan said. The
central bank will take more steps to check depreciation in the
rupee,  Asia ’s worst performer last year, he said today.  The rupee dropped 0.5 percent to 53.3075 per dollar today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell for a
second day after data published Dec. 30 showed the current-
account deficit widened to near a record in the third quarter.
The rupee lost 16 percent last year, dropping to a record
54.3050 on Dec. 15.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
dropped three basis points to 7.71 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
