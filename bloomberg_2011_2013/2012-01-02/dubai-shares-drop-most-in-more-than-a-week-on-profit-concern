Dubai’s benchmark index retreated the
most in more than a week amid speculation some companies may
report slower fourth-quarter earnings growth.  Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) , the investment bank controlled by
Dubai’s ruler, tumbled 8.7 percent.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the biggest
low-cost carrier in the  Middle East , fell for the first time
since Dec. 27. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  dropped 0.9
percent, the biggest decline since Dec. 21, to 1,341.56 at the
close of trading. About 24 million shares were traded in Dubai
today, compared with a 12-month daily average of 100 million
shares, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg (VOLDFM) .  Fourth-quarter earnings in the United Arab Emirates will
show “insignificant growth,” said Tariq Qaqish, deputy head of
asset management at Al Mal Capital in Dubai. “There is no real
short-term catalyst for investors to look forward to.”  Shuaa, which reported a third-quarter loss of 156.2 million
dirhams ($42.5 million), may continue to suffer from “negative
or weak” profitability in the near-future as the investment
bank restructure its business, Moody’s Investors Service said in
a Dec. 28 report. The bank’s credit ratings were lowered one
level to Ba3, three ranks below investment grade. Emirates NBD
PJSC, the country’s biggest bank by asset, may need to set aside
as much as 8 billion dirhams in provisions between the fourth
quarter of 2011 and 2013,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in a
Dec. 7 report.  Shuaa tumbled the most since Dec. 26 to 50.2 fils. Air
Arabia lost 1.5 percent to 57.7 fils. There are 100 fils to the
dirham. Emirates NBD shares didn’t trade today.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  declined 0.2 percent.
Kuwait’s measure lost 0.4 percent and Bahrain’s BB All Share
Index retreated 0.5 percent, while Qatar’s QE Index and Oman’s
MSM30 Index gained 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share
Index rose 0.2 percent. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index dropped 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
