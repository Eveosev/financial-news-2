Japan ’s population dropped in 2011
for a fifth year, falling by the most since World War II, after
a record earthquake and tsunami killed thousands, according to
the health ministry.  The country’s population fell by 204,000 to 126.24 million
people last year, the biggest decline since at least 1947, the
earliest year for which government data is available, the
ministry said in a  statement  yesterday.  The number of deaths rose 5.3 percent from 2010 to 1.26
million people, according to the statement. The magnitude-9.0
earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan’s northeast coast on
March 11 killed 15,844 people and left 3,451 missing, according
to a Dec. 30 statement from the  National Police Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
