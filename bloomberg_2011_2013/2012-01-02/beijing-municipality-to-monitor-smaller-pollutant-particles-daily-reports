Beijing will start monitoring smaller
pollutant particles this year to ensure better  air-quality 
information, Beijing Daily  reported , citing the city’s
environment bureau.  China ’s  Environment Ministry  on Dec. 30 approved new air-
quality standards to include pollutants smaller than 2.5
micrometers in diameter, known as PM2.5, the newspaper said,
without giving a date when Beijing will begin monitoring.  The government currently uses an indicator known as PM10
that measures particulates as big as 10 micrometers in diameter
for its public pollution data. Air quality in all of the 32
Chinese cities that track pollution fall short of World Health
Organization guidelines. The air in Beijing is the fifth-worst
in China, based on the PM10 measure. The U.S. embassy in Beijing
monitors PM2.5, and releases the information via Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
