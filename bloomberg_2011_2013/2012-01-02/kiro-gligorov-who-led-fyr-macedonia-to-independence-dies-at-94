 Kiro Gligorov, a top Communist
official of the former  Yugoslavia  who became the first president
of his native Macedonia when the Balkan federation fell apart,
died at the age of 94, local  MIA  newswire reported.  Assuming the leadership in the country’s first democratic
vote in 1991, Gligorov oversaw Macedonia’s transition to
independence without the warfare that raged in other Yugoslav
republics. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1995
and later retired. He died in his sleep last night, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
