Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest airline, said European Union emissions-trading
expenses will add 130 million euros ($168 million) to costs in
2012, prompting the carrier to raise ticket prices.  Spending that results from the EU’s carbon-emissions cap-
and-trade program, which start for airlines this year, will be
taken into account when Lufthansa calculates fuel surcharges,
the Cologne, Germany-based company said today in a  statement .  The trading program “burdens European airlines with yet
another cost which makes flying in and over Europe more
expensive for passengers,”  Carsten Spohr , head of the company’s
German airlines division, said in the statement.  The EU decided in 2008 to include aviation in the project
after the industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions in the region
doubled over two decades.  Germany  has allocated 3 billion euros
of free carbon permits until 2020 to airlines operating in the
country, and the carriers have to pay extra for their needs
beyond that.  Of the 42.8 million free permits the country is
distributing to the industry for 2012, 12.6 million have been
 granted  to the Lufthansa brand, 2 million to the Lufthansa Cargo
division and 498,536 to the Germanwings low-cost unit, according
to Germany’s Emissions Trading Authority.  Lufthansa’s brands outside its home market, including
Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Brussels Airlines, will be covered
by free allocations in their base countries,  Peter Schneckenleitner , a spokesman for the carrier, said by phone.  Free certificates will represent 82 percent of those that
established  airlines (BWAIRL)  across the region will trade, with carriers
responsible for buying another 15 percent and 3 percent reserved
for startup companies, Lufthansa said today. The German carrier
will have to buy 35 percent of its certificates because the free
allocation doesn’t account for how much the company has  grown (LHA) 
since the 2004-to-2006 period that’s the basis of emissions
measurements, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
