Dutch manufacturing fell for a fourth
consecutive month in December while employment shrank for a
third month.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region rose to 46.2 from 46 in December when
adjusted for seasonal swings, the Zoetermeer-based Dutch
institute for purchasing and supply management  NEVI  said on its
website today. In September, it dropped below the 50 mark for
the first time since July 2009, indicating a contraction.  The Dutch economy probably shrank in the second half of
2011 because of decelerating world trade, budget cuts and
subdued household income growth, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said on Nov. 28.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
