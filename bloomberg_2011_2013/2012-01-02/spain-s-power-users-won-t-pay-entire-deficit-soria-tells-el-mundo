Spanish electricity consumers won’t
have to cover all the power system’s deficit, Industry Minister
Jose Manuel Soria was cited as saying in the  El Mundo  newspaper.  The government led by  Mariano Rajoy  plans to change the
electricity pricing system, which has accumulated debts of 22
billion euros ($28.5 billion) financed by utilities and bond
investors and guaranteed by the state, Soria said in an
interview, according to El Mundo.  “Consumers will pay something, but not everything,” the
newspaper cited him as saying. Soria didn’t specify whether he
was referring to the debt or the ongoing deficit, which was 3.3
billion euros in the first 10 months of last year, according to
El Mundo’s account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
