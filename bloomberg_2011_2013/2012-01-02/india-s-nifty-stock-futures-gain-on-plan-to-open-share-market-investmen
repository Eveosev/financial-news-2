Indian stocks advanced on the first
trading day this year, following the benchmark index’s second-
worst annual decline, amid optimism the central bank will halt
rate increases to stimulate economic growth.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar Land Rover, climbed after
sales rose 22 percent in December.  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS)  and  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the two biggest software exporters,
climbed at least 1.5 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, rebounded from its lowest
level since March 2009.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.4 percent
to 15,517.92 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its first gain in
five days. The measure swung between gains and losses at least
22 times earlier in the day.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may reverse its record pace of
rate increases to stimulate economic growth as inflation shows
signs of easing, the British Broadcasting Corp. cited Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao. The bank’s approach to managing inflation and
growth will be different in 2012, Subbarao was cited as saying
in an interview posted on its website today.  “One major thing that needs to be done is to start cutting
 interest rates  aggressively,” Sunil Singhania, head of equities
at Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd., India’s second-
biggest money manager with $17 billion in assets, told Bloomberg
UTV today. “Hopefully, the Reserve Bank will face some heat
from industrialists who have been asking for it. Even government
departments have started asking for it.”  Worst Performer  The Sensex plunged 25 percent in 2011 and was the worst
performer among the world’s biggest markets in dollar terms on
concern a weak rupee, high inflation and record interest-rate
increases would compound the effects of  Europe ’s debt crisis on
earnings. The 30-stock  gauge (SENSEX)  trades at 13.5 times estimated
profits, down from 21.5 times in March 2010. The  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF)  is valued at 10.1 times, after the measure dropped
20 percent last year.  Tata Motors, the maker of the world’s cheapest car, the
Nano, surged 2.9 percent to 183.95 rupees. The stock plunged 32
percent last year.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest
carmaker, increased 2.2 percent to 938.9 rupees, halting a five-
day 5.9 percent drop. Its sales have rebounded in November and
December after plunging 53 percent in October due to labor
unrest, according to company data.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker,
tumbled 7.3 percent to 1,475.5 rupees, its steepest slide since
August 2009, leading a decline among peers after two-wheeler
sales in December grew at the slowest pace in at least six
months. Hero MotoCorp Ltd., the biggest, slid 3.5 percent to
1,838.85 rupees. TVS Motor Company Ltd. plunged 7.1 percent to
48.3 rupees, its biggest fall since December 2010.  Export Earnings  Tata Consultancy Services gained 1.6 percent to 1,178.6
rupees. Infosys increased 1.5 percent to 2,808.95 rupees. Both
companies get more than 90 percent of their sales from abroad.
The rupee’s 16 percent plunge last year, the most among Asian
currencies, is likely to boost the value of their repatriated
earnings. Infosys is scheduled to announce earnings for the
quarter ended Dec. 31 on Jan. 12.  Reliance climbed 2 percent to 706.55 rupees, halting a
four-day 7.2 percent decline.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-
biggest lender, gained 1.7 percent to 696.55 rupees. The stock
dropped 40 percent last year.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. added 0.3 percent to 4,636.75. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200) 
increased 0.1 percent to 1,853.46.  India’s manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in six
months. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 54.2 in December
from 51 in November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said
today. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  Fund Flows  The Reserve Bank last month kept rates unchanged for the
first time in eight meetings as Europe’s debt woes threatens to
curb exports. The repurchase rate stands at 8.5 percent after 13
increases since mid-March 2010.  Overseas  funds (FIINNET)  sold a net  $16.3 million (FIINNET$)  of local stocks on
Dec. 30, according to the  market regulator . They withdrew $512
million from local equities last year, compared with a record
inflow of $29 billion in 2010.  The government said yesterday it would allow individual
overseas investors to directly buy local stocks as the nation
seeks to boost inflows and tame volatility in the stock market.
The new rule is expected to take effect by Jan. 15.  “The government has started to understand that it needs
solutions and is taking small steps like allowing foreigners to
invest directly,” Reliance Capital’s Singhania said.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
