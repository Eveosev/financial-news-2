million rupees (FIINNET$)  ($16.3 million) of Indian stocks on Dec. 30, the
nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 9.79 billion rupees of shares and sold
10.7 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They sold a net 8.13 billion rupees of bonds.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 21 percent last
year, as global investors withdrew 27.1 billion rupees from
equities, on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt
crisis may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.
Foreigner purchased 421 billion rupees of bonds last year.  India’s $1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fourth-biggest, is

a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds (FIINFIIN)  have placed 4.443 trillion rupees in stocks
