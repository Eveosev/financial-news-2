Crude oil futures in  New York  will
average $92 to $96 a barrel in 2012 as slowing economic growth
curbs fuel demand, according to Again Capital.  Prices may slip from 2011’s record average of $95.11 as the
euro declines against the dollar amid the European debt crisis
and uncertainty about the economic recovery,  John Kilduff  and
 Michael Fitzpatrick , Again Capital analysts based in New York,
said in a Dec. 29 report distributed today.  “The austerity is going to be a problem for growth around
the world,” Kilduff said in a telephone interview.  The strengthening of the dollar against the euro curbs
commodities’ appeal as an alternative investment to U.S.
currency.  Unrest in the  Middle East  may cause a supply disruption
that could send prices to records above $150 a barrel,
triggering a recession or depression, Kilduff and Fitzpatrick
said. The analysts cited the possibility of civil war in Iraq
and  Libya  and the threatened closing of the Strait of Hormuz by
Iran.  Brent oil in  London  will average $100 to $105 a barrel this
year, down from $110.91 a barrel in 2011, Kilduff said.  “If supply is suddenly shut in, the consequences could be
devastating,” the analysts said in the report. “Price spikes
to upwards of and beyond the 2008 high near $150 have been
discussed, which if sustained, even briefly, would push Europe
and the U.S. over the cliff into recession, possibly
depression.”  Oil in 2011 reached its highest annual average price since
trading began on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983.
Futures for February delivery slipped 82 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $98.83 a barrel on Dec. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
