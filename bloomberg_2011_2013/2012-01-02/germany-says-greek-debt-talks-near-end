Germany ’s government declined to
comment on a report that it may push for creditors to accept
bigger losses on Greek debt than previously agreed upon, saying
only that talks on lowering Greece’s debt level may end soon.  Germany is studying a proposal to write down 75 percent of
Greek government bonds held by private creditors as part of a
planned debt swap to ensure greater debt sustainability, Greek
news website  Euro2day.gr  reported today, without citing anyone.  Under the terms of Greece’s 130 billion-euro ($168 billion)
second bailout backed by European leaders in October, investors
would take a 50 percent hit on the nominal value of 206 billion
euros of privately owned debt.  Talks are ongoing about the specifics of the role of the
private sector and Germany assumes that the negotiations will
end soon, the  Finance Ministry  in Berlin said in an e-mailed
response to the Greek report, without elaborating. The ministry
didn’t respond to a question on the 75 percent writedown as
reported.  Greece’s creditors are resisting pressure from the
 International Monetary Fund  to accept bigger losses on holdings
of the nation’s government bonds, three people with direct
knowledge of the discussions said last month. Greece’s debt will
balloon to almost twice the size of its economy this year
without a write-off accord with investors, the IMF said Dec. 13.  At a Dec. 9 European summit, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  backed away from a prior demand that bondholders shoulder
losses in any future euro-area rescue, saying that  Greece  was a
“special case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
