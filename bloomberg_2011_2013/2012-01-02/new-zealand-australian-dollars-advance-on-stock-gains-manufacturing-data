The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced to the strongest since November versus their
U.S. counterpart as global manufacturing gauges climbed,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The New Zealand currency, nicknamed the kiwi, rose against
most of its 16 most-traded peers as U.S. data showed
manufacturing in the world’s biggest economy expanded at the
fastest pace in six months and stocks rallied. The Aussie and
the kiwi strengthened for a fourth day versus the greenback as a
report showed  China ’s service industries grew in December, after
a Chinese index of manufacturing increased earlier this week.  “There’s a bit of optimism and a bit of risk appetite
coming into the early part of the new year,” said  Thomas Averill , managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a
currency and interest-rate risk-management company. “For the
next week or so, they’re going to be fairly well supported,” he
said, referring to the Australian and New Zealand currencies.  Australia ’s dollar rose 1.4 percent to $1.0372 at 12:25
p.m. New York time, and touched $1.0386, the strongest level
since Nov. 9. The Aussie climbed 1.1 percent to 79.58 yen.  The New Zealand dollar added 1.5 percent to 78.97 U.S.
cents and reached 79.06 cents, the most since Nov. 14. The kiwi
gained 1.2 percent to 60.59 yen.  The MSCI World Index of stocks and the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index both rallied 1.8 percent.  A Chinese purchasing managers’ index for non-manufacturing
industries rose to 56 last month from 49.7 in November, the
National Bureau of Statistics and the Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The
December PMI for manufacturing was 50.3, compared with 49 in
November, according to a statement Jan. 1 from the statistics
bureau and China’s logistics federation.  Manufacturing in the U.S. grew in December at the fastest
pace in six months, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index showed today. It rose to 53.9, from 52.7 in
November, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
