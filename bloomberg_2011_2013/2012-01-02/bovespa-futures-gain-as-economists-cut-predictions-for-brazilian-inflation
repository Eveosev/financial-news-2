The Bovespa stock index advanced the
most in two weeks, following its first annual loss since 2008,
as  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  led a rally by homebuilders after economists cut
their forecast for  Brazil ’s inflation for a fifth-straight week.  Gafisa, Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue, was
the best performer on the gauge, and the  BM&FBovespa Real Estate
Index (IMOBBV)  jumped the most in two months. Plane builder  Embraer SA (EMBR3) 
rose for a fourth day after the company and Sierra Nevada Corp.
were awarded a $355 million contract to provide 20 A-29 Super
Tucano aircraft to the U.S. Air Force.  The Bovespa rose 1.9 percent to 57,829.27 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. Forty-seven stocks climbed on the gauge
today, while 22 fell. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8714
per  U.S. dollar . Brazil’s benchmark equity index fell 18 percent
in 2011, the biggest drop since 2008, when it plunged 41
percent.  Consumer prices will increase 5.32 percent in Brazil this
year, according to the median forecast in a Dec. 30 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today, from a forecast
of 5.33 percent the previous week.  “I don’t see major problems in the Brazilian economy, as
the global slowdown will probably help to curb inflation,”
 Alvaro Bandeira , a director at Ativa Corretora brokerage, said
in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “The main source
of uncertainty is still the international markets. A better
performance for the Bovespa in 2012 will depend on what happens
in  Europe  and in the U.S.”  Growth Outlook  European stocks gained on their first trading day this year
as a measure of German manufacturing beat estimates. U.S.
markets were closed today for the New Year’s holiday.  Economists covering Brazil also cut their forecast for 2011
economic growth to 2.87 percent, according to the central bank
survey, from 2.90 percent the previous week.  Latin America ’s
largest economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, from a
previous forecast of 3.40 percent, according to the survey.  Embraer rose 0.3 percent to 11.80 reais after earlier
gaining as much as 2 percent. Gafisa surged 8.7 percent to 4.48
reais. The BM&FBovespa Real Estate  index (IMOBBV)  added 3.8 percent, the
most since Oct. 6.  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  in October after gaining
22 percent from a two-year low on Aug. 8 as interest-rate cuts
in Brazil and signs of progress in solving Europe’s debt crisis
buoyed demand for equities. The measure has since pared its
advance to 17 percent.  The index trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings estimates,
in line with the ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing
nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders moved 3.89 billion reais ($2.08 billion) in stocks
in Sao Paulo today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a daily average in 2011 of 6.51 billion reais
through Dec. 27, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
