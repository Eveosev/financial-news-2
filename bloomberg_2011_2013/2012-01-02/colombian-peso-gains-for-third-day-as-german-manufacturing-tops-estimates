Colombia ’s peso rose the most in four
weeks as higher-than-forecast manufacturing in Germany and  China 
buoyed appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 1,929.35 per  U.S. dollar  in
the next-day market, according to the stock exchange’s foreign-
exchange electronic transactions system, known as SET-FX. With
markets closed in the U.S., Colombia’s currency trades in the
so-called next-day market, in which payment and delivery are
made the following trading day. Colombian markets were closed
Dec. 30 for the year-end holiday.  “The peso is following gains abroad,” said Santiago Melo,
an analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores SA. Low trading volume
is leading to swings in prices today, said Melo.  European stocks gained after a manufacturing gauge based on
a survey of purchasing managers in  Germany  rose to 48.4 in
December, beating the initial estimate of 48.1 published on Dec.
15. In China, a manufacturing gauge was at 50.3 from 49 in
November, the Beijing-based logistics federation said in a
statement yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.62
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.167 centavo to 118.765.  To contact the reporter on this story:
