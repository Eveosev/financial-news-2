German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  wrote
a letter last month to Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
encouraging his government to decide in favor of a bid by a
Eurofighter partnership to build fighter jets.  Writing on behalf of  Germany , the U.K., Italy and Spain,
Merkel said a successful Eurofighter bid would mark a “deeper
technological and economic partnership,” between  India  and the
four countries, a chancellery spokesman said today in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
