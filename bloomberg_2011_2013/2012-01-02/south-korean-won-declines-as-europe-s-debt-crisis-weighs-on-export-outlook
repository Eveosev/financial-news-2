South Korea’s won declined on concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis will weigh on the Asian nation’s overseas
sales.  Government bonds  retreated.  Export growth will probably slow to 6.7 percent this year,
compared with 19.6 percent in 2011, the Ministry of  Knowledge
Economy  said yesterday. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in a
statement today that the economic outlook will be more uncertain
and difficult in 2012 and called for a strengthening of
contingency plans to prevent contagion from the European crisis.  “Investors are demanding dollars as they are wary of the
ongoing European debt crisis,” said Ha Jun Woo, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Daegu Bank in Seoul. “Contrary to the
beginning of last year, we don’t see many investors betting the
won will strengthen.”  The won declined 0.3 percent to 1,155.86 per dollar from
Dec. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Local
financial markets were closed on Dec. 30. The currency, which
weakened 2.2 percent last year, may drop 1.2 percent to 1,170
per dollar by the end of March, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey.  South Korea ’s  consumer prices (KOCPIYOY)  rose 4.2 percent from a year
earlier last month, matching November’s gain, government data
showed on Dec. 30. Inflation exceeded all forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey, limiting the scope for an interest-rate
cut in January even as threats to growth mount. The median
estimate of 12 analysts was 4 percent.  Spain ’s new government said on Dec. 30 that its  budget
deficit  for 2011 would reach 8 percent of output, more than the
6 percent target set by the former administration and the 6.9
percent forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Some 157
billion euros ($203 billion) of euro-area debt is due in the
first three months of 2012, according to UBS AG.  The yield on the 3.5 percent bonds due September 2016
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.47
percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  Benchmark (GVSK5YR) 
five-year rates dropped 62 basis points in 2011, the second year
of declines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
