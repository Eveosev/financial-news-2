Boko Haram has given a three-day
ultimatum for Christians to leave the majority-Muslim north of
 Nigeria  and has called for Muslims living in the south to move
north,  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing the extremist
Islamic sect’s spokesman, Abu Qaqa.  Qaqa, in a conference call with journalists, also said Boko
Haram will fight government troops in the parts of the country
where President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency
after a series of bombs killed more than 50 Christian worshipers
on Dec. 25, Christmas Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
