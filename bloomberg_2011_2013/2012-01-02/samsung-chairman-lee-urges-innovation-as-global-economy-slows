Samsung (005930)  Electronics Co. Chairman Lee Kun Hee said his business should embrace more openness and
innovation to continue expanding amid slow growth in the global
economy and increasing competition.  “Samsung’s future hinges on new businesses, new products
and new technologies,” Lee said, according to a summary of a
speech he gave to employees today. “We should make our
corporate culture more open, flexible and innovative.”  Low growth in the global economy is likely to continue this
year, Lee said, according to the summary, which was distributed
by  Samsung Group  via e-mail. Samsung Group, whose 2010 sales
were equivalent to one-fifth of  South Korea ’s gross domestic
product, should expand investment and hiring, the chairman said.  Samsung Electronics, the flagship unit of the group, posted
a record 154.6 trillion won ($133.7 billion) in revenue in 2010.
The television, computer-chip and mobile maker’s revenue is
forecast to increase to 163.9 trillion won in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
