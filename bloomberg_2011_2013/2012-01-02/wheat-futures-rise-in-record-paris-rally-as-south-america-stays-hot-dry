Milling wheat futures rose for a 12th
day in Paris, the longest rally for the most-active contract
since the grain started trading in the French capital in 1999,
amid concern dry weather will damage South American grain crops.  Parts of  Argentina  and south  Brazil  were forecast to have
more dry and hot weather early this week, resulting in crop
stress for corn and soybeans, AccuWeather Inc. said in a Dec. 30
report. Argentina is the world’s second-largest corn shipper
after the U.S.  “The markets are again demonstrating firmness, still in a
context of a very dry weather situation for the South American
continent,”  Agritel , a Paris-based farm adviser, wrote in a
note today. “There’s little change expected in Argentina this
week, with high temperatures and little or no precipitation.”  March-delivery wheat advanced 1.4 percent to settle at 198
euros ($256) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris, rising 12
percent over a 12-day period. Wheat fell 23 percent in the
French capital last year, the biggest slide in three years.  Texas , which grows about 6 percent of U.S. winter wheat
according to government data, will remain dry this week and
possibly longer after rain in December brought drought relief,
AccuWeather said. More than 80 percent of the state is still
under severe drought conditions, according to the forecaster.  Rapeseed for February delivery added 0.9 percent to 442.25
euros a ton, after the oilseed slipped 12 percent last year.
Corn for March delivery traded in Paris climbed 1.8 percent to
200.75 euros a ton, following a 16 percent slide in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
