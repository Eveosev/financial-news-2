The  New York Giants  beat the Dallas
Cowboys 31-14 to earn a spot in the National Football League
playoffs as the National Football Conference East division
winner.   Eli Manning threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns for
the Giants (9-7), who won three of their final four regular-
season games -- including a pair of victories over the Cowboys -
- to return to the playoffs for the first time in three years.  Ahmad Bradshaw had a pair of touchdowns, while Hakeem Nicks
and Victor Cruz each caught scoring passes for the Giants at
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Giants will
host the  Atlanta Falcons  on Jan. 8 in the first round of the
playoffs.   The Cowboys end the season with an 8-8 record and miss the
playoffs for the second straight year.   The  Denver Broncos  and Cincinnati Bengals took the final
two playoff berths in the American Football Conference earlier
today. The New York Jetsâ€™ chances for a third straight
postseason appearance ended with a loss in Miami.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
