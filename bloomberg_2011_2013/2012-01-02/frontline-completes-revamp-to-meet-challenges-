Frontline Ltd (FRO) ., the world’s biggest
operator of the largest crude tankers, completed a restructuring
as it sold vessels, pared commitments for new ships and
eliminated its bank debt to tackle a shipping market slump.  The company sold five very-large crude carriers new-
building contracts, six modern VLCCs including one-time charter
agreement and four modern Suezmax tankers to Frontline 2012 Ltd.
at “fair market value” of $1.12 billion, the Bermuda-based
company said today in a statement. Frontline 2012 assumed $666
million in bank debt attached to the vessels and new-building
contracts and $325.5 million in new-building commitments.  Frontline (FRO)  last month said it would split the company to
withstand the worst shipping rates since 1999 and that the 2012
company would take control of the newest vessels and outstanding
shipyard orders. Frontline 2012 completed a private sale of
shares that raised $285 million on Dec. 16 and was registered on
the Norwegian over-the-counter list on Dec. 30.  “Frontline should have significant strength to honor its
obligations and meet the challenges created by a very weak
tanker market,” the company said. “Through the sale of a
limited number of the company’s assets, Frontline has avoided a
heavy dilutive new equity offering and will thereby keep
significant upside for the existing Frontline equity holders if
the market recovers in the years to come.”  Frontline will get payment for working capital related to
the assets sold, and the estimated book value of those assets,
including the remaining new-building commitments, is $1.43
billion, according to today’s statement.  Frontline was little changed at 25.46 kroner as of 9:41
a.m. in Oslo trading. The  shares (FRO)  plunged 83 percent last year,
the fourth straight year of losses.  Frontline’s fleet, excluding the subsidiary Independent
Tankers Corporation Ltd., is reduced to 40 vessels from 50 after
the restructuring. The new-building commitments were cut to
$112.4 million from $437.9 million and bank debt is reduced to
zero from $679 million. The cash proceeds for Frontline from the
deal is about $70 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
