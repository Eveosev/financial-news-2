Poland’s central bank may buy
 government bonds  as a “short-term measure” if an economic
crisis boosts yields, Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said.  “There’s no ban on the central bank buying government
bonds on the secondary market,” Rostowski said in an interview
with the Polish edition of Newsweek, published today. “If
yields increased as a result of panic or contagion from an
external virus, and not poor public-finance management, it might
be expedient for the central bank to intervene.”  The central bank’s primary goal is  price stability  and it
“can’t replace the government, particularly on issues connected
with public debt management,” the Warsaw-based  Narodowy Bank
Polski  said in a statement today. Any public speculation on the
central bank buying bonds may trigger an “unwanted perception”
by financial markets, it said.  “In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to
uncertainty resulting in an increase in the volatility of
government bond prices and the zloty  exchange rate ,” according
to the central bank.  Economic Growth  Poland’s  economy (POGDYOY)  may grow between 3 percent and 4 percent,
even if the euro area has a “lost decade” of zero economic
growth, as long as the currency bloc doesn’t fall apart,
Rostowski said in the interview.  European Union treaties need to be changed to allow the
 European Central Bank  to buy bonds of EU members whose ability
to finance debt is threatened by financial market contagion,
rather than fiscal mismanagement, Rostowski said, according to
the  magazine .  “The truth about this crisis is that Italy, Spain, France
and Germany are all solvent at 3 percent yields, while none of
them -- not even Germany -- are solvent at 8 percent,”
Rostowski said, according to  Newsweek .  To contact the reporters on this story:
