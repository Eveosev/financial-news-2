Coffee exports from  India ,  Asia ’s
third-biggest grower, may decline as much as 15 percent this
year as inventories fall and the European credit crisis curbs
demand, an exporters’ group said today.  Shipments will drop from a record 346,850 metric tons in
2011, Ramesh Rajah, president of the Coffee Exporters
Association of India, said by phone from Bangalore. Domestic
stockpiles have fallen after exporters boosted shipments in
December to benefit from a decline in the rupee, he said.  Lower exports from India may help stem a decline in robusta
coffee futures in  London ,  which have slumped 32 percent since
reaching a three-year high of $2,672 per ton on March 18. Weak
demand and higher global supplies may spur a sharper decline in
arabica futures, which lost 5.7 percent in 2011.  “The economic conditions in  Europe  are not looking good,”
Rajah said. “ Italy , which is our largest buyer, is having
problems.  Greece , another major buyer, is also in trouble.”  Economies in the euro region will contract 0.2 percent in
2012 from 1.6 percent growth last year, according to the median
of 21 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. India exports
around 70 percent of its total coffee output mainly to Europe.  “None of the buyers want to carry inventories and
everybody is in the wait and watch mode,” Rajah said. “Arabica
coffee prices may remain around current levels, while robusta
may drop 10 percent by March on a higher crop globally.”  Global Supplies  Global robusta production will outpace demand by 2.5
million bags this season, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.
Output in  Vietnam , the biggest exporter of beans used in instant
drinks and espressos, will rise 9 percent to 21.25 million bags
weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds) this season, according to a
Bloomberg News survey conducted last month.  Arabica coffee for March delivery jumped 1.2 percent to
settle at $2.2685 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  on
Dec. 30. Robusta coffee for delivery in March gained 0.2 percent
to $1,810 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London on Dec. 30.  India’s arabica exports climbed 6.9 percent to 54,103 tons
last year, while robusta shipments increased 24.6 percent to
193,175 tons, the  Coffee Board of India  said today.  Exports were valued at $1.05 billion in 2011 compared with
$634 million a year earlier, the data from the board showed.  India’s coffee output may total 320,000 tons this crop year
compared with a government estimate of a record 322,250 tons,
Rajah said. Production was 302,000 tons last year, according to
the board.  “The new coffee crop is just trickling in and will pick up
pace by mid January or February,” Rajah said. Unseasonal rains
in December delayed the new crop arrivals, he said.  Inventories are almost negligible this year compared to
40,000 tons carried over into the 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
