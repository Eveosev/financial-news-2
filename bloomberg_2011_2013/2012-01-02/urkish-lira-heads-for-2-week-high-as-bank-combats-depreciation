Turkey’s lira headed for the
strongest level in two weeks after the central bank sold dollars
directly in the  currency market  for a second day.  The lira gained for a third day, adding 0.5 percent to
1.8823 per dollar at 2:44 p.m. in Istanbul. It dropped 18
percent last year, the biggest decline among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank said in an e-mailed statement that it was
selling dollars in the market, following a similar intervention
on Dec. 30 that it said was spurred by “unhealthy price
formations.” The bank may have sold between $300 million and
$500 million today, according to traders and strategists
including Tufan Comert at Garanti Securities and Fatih Keresteci
of HSBC Holdings Plc.  The lira fell to a record 1.9224 per dollar last week on
concern that  Turkey ’s monetary policy will fail to contain a
burgeoning current-account deficit and accelerating inflation.
Inflation in December may be a “little above” 10 percent, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The central bank has reduced funding to lenders at the
benchmark interest rate of 5.75 percent for a “temporary
period.” It may also use foreign exchange sales to support
monetary tightening and cut benchmark funding even on days it
classifies as “normal,” it said.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt rose 17 basis points, or
0.17 percentage points, to 11.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
