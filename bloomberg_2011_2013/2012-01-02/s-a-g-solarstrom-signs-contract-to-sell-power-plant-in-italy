S.A.G. Solarstrom AG (SAG) , a German solar-
project developer, signed a contract to sell a power plant in
 Italy  to an unidentified institutional investor.  The company will dispose of the 48-megawatt Serenissima
photovoltaic plant for a “three-digit-million-euro” figure,
Freiburg-based S.A.G. Solarstrom said in a statement dated
yesterday. The developer signed the contract Dec. 31 and will be
paid in the current quarter, it said.  S.A.G. Solarstrom  rose (SAG)  as much as 2.4 percent to 3.48 euros
at 1:23 p.m. in  Frankfurt . That pared the stock’s decline in the
past 12 months to 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
