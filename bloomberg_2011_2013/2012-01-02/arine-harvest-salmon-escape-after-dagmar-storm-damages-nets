Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
biggest salmon farmer, started re-catching fish that escaped
from an enclosure in Nordfjord, northern  Norway , after the storm
Dagmar damaged nets over the Christmas holidays.  It isn’t clear how many fish escaped from one enclosure,
which held 139,000 salmon with an average weight of 4 kilograms
(8.8 pounds), the Oslo-based company said on its website today.
The size and location of two net tears don’t indicate that a
large number of fish escaped, it said. Local fisherman caught
150 fish, while the company recovered 30 close to the site,
according to the statement.  The fish are considered safe to eat, the company said. The
breakout from the enclosure was the fourth-largest escape in
2011, Marine Harvest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
