Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea ’s two largest automakers, aim to
increase global sales by 6.1 percent this year by improving
quality and investing in research and development.  The carmakers are targeting combined sales of 7 million
vehicles,  Chung Mong Koo , chairman of the companies, said today
in a speech to employees in Seoul. Hyundai and Kia sold an
estimated 6.6 million units combined last year, exceeding their
target of 6.3 million, Chung said.  Hyundai and Kia have  boosted (005380)  their global sales as Japanese
rivals including Toyota Motor Corp. were hampered by a strong
yen and production disruptions after the March quake and record
flooding in Thailand. The Seoul-based automakers also benefited
from demand for models including Hyundai’s Sonata sedan and
Kia’s Forte compact.  “Compared to the last two years, the growth target is
conservative,” said Park In Woo, an analyst at LIG Investment &
Securities Co. Hyundai is taking this year to control areas that
may be overlooked after a rapid growth, such as quality, to
avoid the recalls that hurt Toyota, said Park.  “The  auto industry  in 2012 is expected to show slow growth
and intense competition between companies,” said Chung, who
didn’t give separate target figures for Hyundai and Kia.  Research and Development  Hyundai and Kia plans to invest 5.1 trillion won in
research and development, an 11 percent increase from the
previous year, according to an e-mailed statement in Dec 29.  Hyundai sold 4.05 million vehicles last year, according to
a regulatory filing in South Korea today. The company said it
boosted overseas sales by 14 percent, selling an estimated
730,000 units in  China  and 610,000 in  India .  Kia sold 2.54 million units in 2011, helped by a 24 percent
jump in overseas sales from a year earlier, according to a
separate filing. The company plans to establish a new China-only
brand with its partners in the country to boost sales, spokesman
 Michael Choo  said by phone on Dec 27.  Hyundai fell 0.2 percent to 212,500 won in Seoul trading as
of the close today, and Kia declined 0.3 percent to 66,500 won.
Hyundai shares jumped 23 percent in 2011 while and Kia shares
surged 32 percent, compared with the benchmark Kospi index’s 11
percent fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
