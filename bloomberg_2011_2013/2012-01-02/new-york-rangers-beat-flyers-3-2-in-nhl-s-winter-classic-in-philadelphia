The  New York Rangers  beat the
 Philadelphia Flyers  3-2 in the National Hockey League’s Winter
Classic as Mike Rupp scored twice and goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stopped a penalty shot with 19.6 seconds left.  Rupp and Brad Richards scored third-period goals as the
Rangers rallied from a 2-1 deficit yesterday in the outdoor game
played at Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park, the home of  Major
League Baseball ’s Phillies.  The Flyers were awarded a penalty shot in the closing
seconds when Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh was penalized for
falling on the puck in the goal crease. Lundqvist made the save
on Philadelphia’s Daniel Briere, who skated in and tried to fire
a shot through the goaltender’s legs.  “There was a lot of pressure on me there,” Lundqvist, who
finished with 34 saves, told reporters. “The whole game was
exciting, but the end certainly was.”  The Rangers improved to 24-9-4 in winning the matchup
between the two top teams in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic
Division. The Flyers, who got goals from Brayden Schenn and
Claude Giroux, fell to 22-11-4.  The visiting team has won the NHL’s Winter Classic in four
of the five years it has been held. The only home team to win
was the  Boston Bruins  in 2010 at Fenway Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
