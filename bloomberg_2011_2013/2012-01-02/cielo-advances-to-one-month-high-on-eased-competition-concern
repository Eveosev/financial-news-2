Cielo SA (CIEL3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest card-
payment processor by market value, rose to a one-month high
after Bradesco Corretora added the stock to its recommended
portfolio as competition concern fade.  Shares gained 0.3 percent to 48.35 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest price since Dec. 1, after
earlier rising as much as 2.1 percent.  “Competition is unlikely to destabilize the market,”
Bradesco analysts including Carlos Firetti, head of equity
research, wrote in a note to clients today. “We believe the
bulk of renegotiations with large merchants is over.”  Net fees Cielo charges retailers to process debit and
credit cards payments, known as the merchant discount rate, or
MDR, fell to 1.03 percent in the third quarter from 1.21 percent
a year earlier, the company said in a statement Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
