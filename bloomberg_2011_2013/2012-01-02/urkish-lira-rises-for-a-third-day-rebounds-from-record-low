The Turkish lira strengthened for a
third day after it depreciated to a record low of 1.9224 per
dollar last week.  The lira rose 0.4 percent to 1.8833 per dollar at 8:49 a.m.
in Istanbul after weakening 17.7 percent last year in the worst
performance among emerging market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The central bank sold dollars directly on the market Dec.
30 after seeing "unhealthy price formations," it said in an e-
mailed statement that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
