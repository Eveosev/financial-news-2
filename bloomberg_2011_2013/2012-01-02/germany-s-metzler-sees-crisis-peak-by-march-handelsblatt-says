Europe ’s crisis should peak by March,
when members of the euro region and banks have clarity about
their refinancing, Friedrich von Metzler, partner of family-
owned German private bank B. Metzler Seel Sohn & Co. KGaA, said
in an interview to be published in  Handelsblatt  tomorrow.  Metzler recommends a three-step approach to ending the debt
crisis that includes government budget cuts, reallocation
through higher taxes and higher inflation, he is quoted as
saying in a preview of the interview. The euro will remain, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
