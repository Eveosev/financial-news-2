European (SXXP)  stocks gained on their first
trading day this year, following the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s
first annual loss since 2008, as a measure of German
manufacturing beat estimates and a gauge of utilities rose.  Siemens AG (SIE)  increased 2 percent for the second-biggest
contribution to the  Stoxx 600’s advance (SXXP) .  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany’s
second-largest utility (RWE) , climbed after Cheuvreux included the
stock in its selected list of German stocks for 2012.  The Stoxx 600 rose 1.1 percent to 247.15 at the close in
 London . The U.S. and U.K. markets are closed today for the New
Year’s holiday.  “On the first day of the year, a lot of investors, having
cleaned their portfolios, have liquidity to invest,” said
 Arnaud Scarpaci , a  fund manager  at Agilis Gestion SA in Paris,
which oversees about $84 million. “Germany can be seen as a
safe haven because it has stronger growth than other countries.
People are investing in industries with a lot of visibility,
such as utilities.”  A measure of German manufacturing climbed to 48.4 in
December, beating the  median economist estimate (PMITMGE)  for a reading of
48.1. The  purchasing managers’ index (PMITMGE)  compiled by Markit
Economics had a reading of 47.9 in November.  European (SXXP)  stocks climbed in the last week of 2011 as reports
from the U.S. showed the recovery in the world’s largest economy
is gathering pace and as optimism grew that euro-area policy
makers will contain the debt crisis. The second straight week of
gains helped trim last year’s  loss to 11 percent (SXXP) .  The index entered  a bear market (SXXP)  in August and had its worst
third quarter since 2002,  dropping 17 percent (SXXP) , as U.S. leaders
wrangled over cutting the deficit and euro-area policy makers
remained divided on their response to the debt crisis.  Euro-Area Debt  Some 157 billion euros ($203 billion) in debt will mature
in the 17-member euro area in the first three months of 2012,
according to UBS AG. National leaders have pledged to draft a
stricter rulebook for controlling  government spending . German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
will meet in Berlin on Jan. 9 to work out the details.  In her New Year’s address, Merkel said she expects
turbulence in 2012 as she does “everything” to save the euro
and end the debt crisis. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
said in his New Year’s message that the country faces a
difficult year and must continue efforts to stay in the euro.  In the U.S., the  S&P 500 (SPX)  was virtually unchanged last year.
The benchmark gauge lost 0.04 points to 1,257.6 in 2011, its
smallest annual change since 1947.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 14 of the 15 western
European markets that opened today. Germany’s DAX Index added 3
percent. France’s CAC 40 Index gained 2 percent.  U.S. Payrolls Report  A report this week will probably show that hiring in the
U.S. accelerated in December for a second month, a sign that the
country’s improving labor market will bolster  consumer spending 
in early 2012, economists said. Payrolls climbed by 150,000
workers after rising 120,000 in November, according to the
median forecast of 62 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the Labor Department release on Jan. 6.  Another  report (NAPMPMI)  this week may show manufacturing picked up
in the U.S., economists said.  Siemens, Henkel Climb  Siemens,  Europe’s largest engineering company (SIE) , added 2
percent to 75.44 euros. A  gauge of chemical makers (SXXP)  increased 1.8
percent, with the preferred shares of Henkel AG, the maker of
industrial adhesives and Persil washing powder, increasing 3.3
percent to 46.06 euros.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Germany’s biggest steelmaker (TKA) , jumped 4.5
percent to 18.52 euros.  RWE advanced 5.3 percent to 28.60 euros, its largest gain
in two months. The company is among German stocks on Cheuvreux’s
selected list for 2012.  Sunways AG (SWW)  surged 21 percent to 1.87 euros as  China ’s LDK
Solar Co. said it intends to take over the company. Sunways said
LDK will buy a 33 percent stake and has offered to purchase the
remaining equity for 1.90 euro per share. Q-Cells SE rallied 5.4
percent to 54.6 euro cents.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-biggest maker of solar-grade
silicon, jumped 6 percent to 65.85 euros.  SolarWorld AG (SWV)  climbed 3.1 percent to 3.35 euros as Chief
Executive Officer Frank Asbeck told Euro am Sonntag that the
company will meet its full-year target of more than 1 billion
euros in sales. Asbeck described fourth-quarter sales as
“pleasantly good.”  Automakers Rise  Carmakers rose 3.4 percent for the biggest gain among the
19 industry groups in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP) .  Daimler AG (DAI)  increased 4.3
percent to 35.37 euros. The carmaker said that it has delivered
more than two million Mercedes sport-utility vehicles since
their launch. The company wants to produce a record 988,110
Mercedes-Benz brand vehicles in Germany in 2012, Automotive News
Europe reported yesterday, citing internal company documents.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest wind turbine
maker, jumped 9.6 percent to 67.95 kroner. Jyske Bank A/S raised
its estimate for the company’s 2011 order intake to 7,025
megawatts from 6,600 megawatts.  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  added 5.5 percent to 8.94 euros,
the stock’s biggest gain in more than a month. The company has
drawn interest for its U.K. water business from bidders
including Allianz SE and Canada’s Borealis pension fund, the
Sunday Times reported, without citing anyone.  Enel SpA climbed 2.6 percent to 3.23 euros. Terna SpA
jumped 6.1 percent to 2.76 euros, its biggest increase since
2008. Mediobanca SpA said that Italy’s new regulatory framework
for electricity transport and distribution tariffs is overall
positive.  Nutreco, Icade, Storebrand  Nutreco NV (NUO)  advanced 2.3 percent to 51.99 euros, a sixth day
of gains for the longest winning streak in six months. The
world’s biggest maker of fish feed had its shares upgraded to
 “selected list” (NUO)  from “outperform” at Cheuvreux.  Icade SA slipped 1.4 percent to 59.93 euros. Groupama SA,
the French insurer hurt by Greek sovereign-debt losses and
declining stock holdings, said its board agreed to merge its
stake in Silic SA with Caisse des Depots et Consignations’ Icade
unit.  Storebrand ASA (STB)  fell 3.5 percent to 30 kroner. Norwegian
insurance companies received 6,000 claims after storm Dagmar
swept over Norway during the Christmas holiday.  Separately, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance yesterday
proposed cutting a  tax exemption  on equities held in some life
insurance portfolios, Pareto Securities AS said in a note to
clients. The proposal will weigh on Storebrand’s earnings,
Pareto said.  YIT Oyj (YTY1V)  advanced 3.4 percent to 12.80 euros, the highest
price in more than two months. The company won an order to make
foundations and provide maintenance for 90 wind-power plants in
Finland from TuuliWatti Oy.  -- With assistance from Julie Cruz in Frankfurt. Editors: Will
