The dollar fell the most in more than
a month against the euro as signs manufacturing is expanding in
the U.S. and  China  damped the appeal of safer assets.  The greenback weakened versus all of its most-traded peers
as a U.S. factory gauge indicated the fastest growth in six
months. Manufacturing indexes for China and  India  also showed
gains this week. The euro snapped a seven-day losing streak
versus the yen, its longest since December 2010, after German
unemployment fell. The Australian and New Zealand dollars
advanced to their strongest since November.  “The data that came out today was pretty positive,” said
 Mary Nicola , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New
York. “It helped boost risk sentiment.”  The dollar depreciated 0.9 percent to $1.3050 per euro at 5
p.m. in  New York  after dropping as much as 1.1 percent earlier
in its biggest intraday decline since Nov. 30. The U.S. currency
slipped 0.2 percent to 76.74 yen. The euro gained 0.7 percent to
100.14 yen after falling to 98.66 yesterday, the weakest level
since December 2000.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks climbed 1.6
percent and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials added 2.6 percent.  The greenback remained weaker after minutes released today
of the  Federal Reserve ’s last policy meeting showed U.S. central
bankers will for the first time make public their own forecasts
for the benchmark  interest rate  at their Jan. 24-25 meeting.  U.S. Manufacturing  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index (NAPMPMI)  rose to
53.9 in December from 52.7 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s data showed today. Fifty is the dividing line
between growth and contraction, and economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected the gauge would increase to 53.5.  “You get a good number like this and it continues” the
trend, said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “The dollar is falling
off, and it’s a little bit more risk-on.”  Brazil ’s real gained the most against the dollar among its
16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg, adding 2.2 percent
to 1.8307 per greenback. Mexico’s peso appreciated 2 percent to
13.6468 to the dollar.  China’s purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing
increased to 50.3 last month from 49 in November, the logistics
federation said Jan. 1. The reading exceeded all forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey. India’s PMI for manufacturing rose to the
highest in six months, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said yesterday.  Dollar Index (DXY)   The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, dropped 0.8 percent to 79.648.  The dollar has fallen 0.7 percent in the past week,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The greenback gained 1.1 percent
last year, snapping two years of losses. The euro was the worst
performer in 2011, sliding 2 percent.  U.S. employers added 150,000 jobs in December, compared
with an increase of 120,000 in November, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The Labor
Department will report the data Jan. 6.  “There’s a somewhat more optimistic growth picture, and
markets are just reacting to that,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a
currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “If we do
get a jobs number above 150,000, it should be good for risk
sentiment.”  Fed policy makers “decided to incorporate information
about their projections of appropriate monetary policy” into
their Summary of Economic Projections starting this month,
minutes of their Dec. 13 meeting showed.  Rate Bets  The move is another effort toward greater transparency
under Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke . By releasing their own
forecasts, central bankers may alter expectations for the timing
of the first increase in their benchmark rate, which has been
kept near zero since December 2008.  The euro extended gains after  Germany ’s Federal Labor
Agency said the number of people out of work last month slid a
seasonally adjusted 22,000 to 2.89 million. Economists forecast
a drop of 10,000, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars tumbled to
the lowest level in almost two months, according to a money-
markets indicator. The three-month cross-currency basis swap,
the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into
dollars, reached 1.04 percentage points below the euro interbank
offered rate, the least expensive since Nov. 9 on an intraday
basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It closed
yesterday at 1.14 percentage points below Euribor.  Canadian Dollar  Canada ’s dollar may appreciate to a two-month high against
its U.S. counterpart if it closes stronger than its 100-day
moving average of C$1.0143, according to  MacNeil Curry , head of
foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank
of America Corp. in New York. Such a close may spur the currency
to parity with the greenback, a level it hasn’t been at since
Nov. 1. The currency gained 0.8 percent today to C$1.0104.  The Australian and New Zealand currencies climbed as
equities rallied.  Australia ’s dollar strengthened 1.4 percent to $1.0378
after climbing to as high as $1.0387, the strongest level since
Nov. 9. The New Zealand dollar advanced 1.5 percent to 78.99
U.S. cents. It reached 79.08 cents, the most since Nov. 14.  Futures traders (.ECLRG)  last week boosted bets the euro will
weaken. The number of wagers made by  hedge funds  and other large
speculators betting on a drop in the 17-nation currency
increased to a record 127,879 contracts more than those
anticipating a gain, according to the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
