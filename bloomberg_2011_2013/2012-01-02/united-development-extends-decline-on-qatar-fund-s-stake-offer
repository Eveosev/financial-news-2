United Development Co. (UDCD)  tumbled to the
lowest level in three weeks after Qatar’s pension fund last week
offered to buy a stake in the investment company for less than
its trading price.  The shares dropped 6.8 percent to 22.81 riyals, the lowest
since Dec. 8, extending the decline since the Dec. 29
announcement to 16 percent. The benchmark  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.1
percent at the close of trading.  Qatar’s state-owned Pension and Social Insurance Authority
said it seeks to become a “strategic shareholder” in the
energy and infrastructure investor by offering to buy 80 million
shares at 20 riyals each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
