Hungarian Premier  Viktor Orban  is
“abusing” his power and eroding democracy, which may lead to
the country losing its European Union membership, former U.S.
ambassador to Budapest Mark Palmer told  Nepszabadsag .  “ Hungary ’s ejection from the European Union is now no
longer unthinkable,” Palmer, the ambassador to Hungary between
1986 and 1990, the time of transition to democracy from
communism, told the Budapest-based newspaper. The country
“won’t be tolerated if it no longer counts as a democracy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
