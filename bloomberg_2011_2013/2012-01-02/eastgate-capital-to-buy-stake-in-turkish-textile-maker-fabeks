Eastgate Mena LP , a private equity
fund controlled by Eastgate Capital Group, will buy a 49.8
percent stake in Fabeks Dis Ticaret AS, a Turkish textile maker,
 Turkey ’s antitrust board said.  Eastgate applied to the Ankara-based regulator on Dec. 28
for approval to buy the Fabeks stake from owners Aysen Zamanpur
and Bijen Zamanpur, according to a statement on the board’s
 website . Members of the Zamanpur family and other owners will
continue to hold the remaining 50.2 percent, it said.  Fabeks has about 30 shops in Turkey,  France , Algeria and
 Switzerland , under the brand  Silk & Cashmere , according to the
company’s website.  “In our five-year strategic plan we have a more aggressive
growth strategy,” Aysen Zamanpur said in an e-mailed statement
today. “We believe that partnering with Eastgate Capital Group
would contribute to that goal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
