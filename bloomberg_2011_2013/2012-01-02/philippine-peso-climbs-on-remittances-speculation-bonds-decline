The Philippine peso weakened on
speculation the central bank may reduce borrowing costs, while
local-currency bonds fell ahead of a debt auction.  Monetary-policy easing in early 2012 is possible as
inflation slows and the growth outlook deteriorates, central
bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on Dec. 21. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas will review its benchmark  interest rate  on Jan. 19.
The Bureau of the Treasury will offer 9 billion pesos of
securities due August 2018 tomorrow.  “Slowing global growth and a possible rate cut early this
year will not favor gains in the peso,” said Ricky Cebrero,
head of treasury at  Philippine National Bank  in  Manila .  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 43.92 per dollar from Dec.
29 at the close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
Local financial markets were shut on Dec. 30. The currency
strengthened as much as 0.4 percent earlier. It will probably
trade between 43 and 44 this quarter, Cebrero said.  The yield on the 7.375 percent peso bond due March 2021
advanced 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, from Dec. 28
to 5.30 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.
Local debt markets were closed on Dec. 30 and no prices are
available from Tradition for Dec. 29.  The government said today it’s ready to start 141.8 billion
pesos ($3.2 billion) worth of road, bridge, port, irrigation,
flood control and school-building projects this month as
 Europe ’s worsening debt crisis slows global growth. The nation
allotted 182.2 billion pesos for public works this year, 26
percent more than the 2011 plan, the budget department said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The nation is assessing “market appetite and pricing” for
the sale of as much as $1.5 billion of dollar-denominated
securities approved by the central bank, Finance Undersecretary
Rosalia de Leon said on Dec. 29. The  Philippines  may offer bonds
with maturities shorter than the 15-year global debt sold in
2011 if the euro-area debt crisis persists, de Leon said last
week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
