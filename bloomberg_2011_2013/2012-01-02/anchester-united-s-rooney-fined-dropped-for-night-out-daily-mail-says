Manchester United  striker  Wayne Rooney  was fined 250,000 pounds ($387,425) and dropped for
Saturday’s match against Blackburn after a night out with his
wife and two fellow-players, the  Daily Mail  reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  Rooney, his wife Coleen went out for dinner on Dec. 26 with
fellow players  Darron Gibson  and  Jonny Evans  and their partners
to celebrate the club’s 5-0 win over Wigan; Rooney and Gibson
turned up for training the next day looking lethargic,
infuriating Sir  Alex Ferguson  who’d advised them to rest after
the Wigan game, the newspaper said.  Manchester United wouldn’t comment on the report, the Mail
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
