Russian oil production rose 1.25
percent in 2011 to a record level for the post-Soviet era, as
companies in the world’s largest crude-producing nation took
advantage of higher prices and boosted output at new projects.  Production grew to an average of 10.27 million barrels a
day, according to preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s
CDU-TEK unit. Output in December slipped to 10.32 million
barrels a day from 10.35 million in November, the data showed.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who will seek re-election as
president in March, has called for  Russia  to pump more than 10
million barrels a day for at least the next decade. Taxes on oil
and exports are the biggest contributor to the national budget.  The average price for Urals crude, Russia’s benchmark
grade, for delivery to Northwest  Europe  jumped 40 percent to
$109.30 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Demand for Urals rose after the revolution in  Libya  halted crude
exports from that nation and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in
 Japan  led many countries to reconsider use of atomic energy.  Putin cut the  tax rate  on crude exports on Oct. 1 to spur
investment in Russian oil fields and facilities. Production
reached 10.35 million barrels a day that month and again in
November, reaching its highest level since Soviet-era output
peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in 1987, according to data
from  BP Plc. (BP/)   Vankor Field       OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest producer, raised average
output from its Vankor field, one of the country’s largest, by
18.1 percent last year to 300,000 barrels a day from 255,000
barrels a day in 2010, according to the Energy Ministry’s
statistics.  OAO TNK-BP, a Russian joint venture between BP and a group
of billionaires, increased average production by 0.7 percent to
1.64 million barrels a day in 2011. TNK-BP pumped 1.65 million
barrels a day in December, including its share of crude from OAO
Slavneft, a venture with OAO Gazprom Neft.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia’s second-largest producer after Rosneft,
pumped 5.31 percent less crude in the country last year,
averaging 1.71 million barrels a day, ministry statistics
showed. December output was little changed from November at 1.69
million barrels a day.  Russia’s natural-gas output rose to 2.03 billion cubic
meters a day in December from 2.02 billion cubic meters a day in
the same month a year earlier, according to the statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
