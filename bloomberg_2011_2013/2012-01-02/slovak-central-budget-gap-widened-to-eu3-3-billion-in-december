Slovakia’s 2011 cumulative central
budget  deficit (SLSBTBAL)  remained below the government’s target after
widening to 3.3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) at the end of
December from a month before, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Revenue totaled 12 billion euros, trailing spending of 15.3
billion euros, the ministry in Bratislava said on its  website 
today. The shortfall widened from 2.67 billion euros at the end
of November and compares with a full-year target of 3.81 billion
euros.  The administration of Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  has cut
spending to meet the budget target as the lingering euro-region
debt crisis is weighing on the economy. The shortfall was 4.44
billion euros a year ago.  The 2011 spending plan targeted the deficit of the whole
public sector, which includes balances of municipalities and
welfare funds, at 4.9 percent of gross domestic product, down
from 7.9 percent a year earlier.  The public-sector deficit was probably slightly better than
the target, Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Tvaroska said at a
press conference in Bratislava today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
