4Energy Invest SA (ENIN)  said KBC Bank NV
and ING Belgium agreed to waive some credit covenants for units
of the Belgian operator of combined heat-and-power plants.  KBC Bank agreed that 4Energy’s Renogen unit will start the
redemption of the long-term credit facility related to Amel III
on March 31, 2012, instead of Dec. 31, 2011, 4Energy said today
in an e-mailed statement. The bank also agreed to spread over
2012 the principal payment that was due by Renogen on Dec. 31 on
the long-term credit facilities related to Amel I and II.  In addition, KBC Bank and ING Belgium “agreed to waive the
non-respected credit covenant” by 4Energy’s 4HamCogen
subsidiary on Dec. 31, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
