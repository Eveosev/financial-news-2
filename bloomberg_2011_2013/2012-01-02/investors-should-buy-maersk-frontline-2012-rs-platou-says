Investors should buy shares of
shipping companies A.P. Moeller- Maersk (MAERSKB)  A/S,  Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX) 
and  Frontline 2012 Ltd (FRNT) ., RS Platou Markets AS said.  “The strategy is to invest in companies with good balance
sheets that can unlock long-term value through investments at
the low-point of the cycle,” Frode Moerkedal and Rahul Kapoor,
analysts at Platou, wrote in a note today. “Such examples are
A.P. Moeller-Maersk, Diana Shipping and Frontline 2012.”  Copenhagen-based Moeller-Maersk is the owner of the world’s
largest container line, while Athens-based Diana Shipping owns
and operates 27 dry-bulk vessels. Frontline 2012 was formed as
part of a reorganization by tanker operator Frontline Ltd.,
which today completed a restructuring as it sold vessels, pared
commitments for new ships and eliminated bank debt to tackle a
slump. The Bermuda-based company last month said it would split
the company to withstand the worst shipping rates since 1999.  The industry this year will still “struggle” with high
fleet growth for tankers, dry bulk and containers and with lower
rates on average in 2012, the analysts said. The “tide should
start to turn and a bottom be reached during 2012 with a gradual
improvement of fleet utilization and earnings as fleet growth
slows and demand recovers the next few years.”  Maersk (MAERSKB)  dropped 25 percent last year, while Diana Shipping
declined 35 percent and Frontline Ltd. 83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
