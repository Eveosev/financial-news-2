Abraaj Capital, the  Middle East ’s
biggest private equity firm with about $7 billion in assets,
said it made “very significant” returns from the sale of its
50 percent stake in  Turkey ’s largest hospital chain.  Khazanah Nasional Bhd (KNBZ) .,  Malaysia ’s state investment
company, bought a 75 percent stake in Turkey’s Acibadem Saglik
Yatirimlari A.S. and affiliated companies from Dubai-based
Abraaj and Turkey’s Aydinlar family. The sale valued Acibadem
Holding at about $1.68 billion for its entire Class A and Class
B share capital, the companies said in December. The transaction
was completed last week.  “We’ve made very significant returns,” Mustafa Abdel Wadood, chief executive officer of Abraaj Capital Ltd., said in
an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland.
Abraaj’s 2007 investment in the company “was probably at the
highest point in the cycle and the world then went into a deep
financial crisis, but the business has grown.”  Since Abraaj’s investment, Acibadem expanded its hospital
network from six to 14, and raised its bed capacity to 1,850
from 750, Abraaj said in a statement Jan. 24.  Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortization grew “by three to four times,” Abdel Wadood said.  Founded in 2002, Abraaj has raised more than $7 billion and
has distributed about $3 billion to investors. Abraaj’s funds
have holdings in more than 35 companies, including Air Arabia
PJSC, the Middle East’s biggest low-cost airline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
