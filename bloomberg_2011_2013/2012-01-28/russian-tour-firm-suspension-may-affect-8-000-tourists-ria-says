More than 8,000 Russian tourists may
be affected by the suspension of sales at Lanta-Tur Voyage, one
of the country’s largest tour operators, RIA Novosti reported,
citing Oleg Moseyev, spokesman for  Russia ’s Tourism Agency.  Lanta-Tur, which sold foreign tours to about 100,000
Russians last year, said yesterday on its  website  it halted
operations because of a lack of funds to pay for the services it
booked, RIA Novosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
