Saudi Arabian shares rose to a six-
month high in the first trading day this week after the U.S.
Federal Reserve signaled it would keep interest rates low
through at least late 2014.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemicals maker, jumped the most in more than seven weeks,
while  National Industrialization Co. (NIC) , known as Tasnee, gained
more than 2 percent.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.9 percent to 6,537.12 at
the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Riyadh, the gauge’s highest
close since July 11. The 150-member measure has gained  1.3
percent in the past four days. More than three shares climbed
for every one that dropped.  The Fed said Jan. 25 it sees “exceptionally low” interest
rates continuing through 2014, having earlier pledged to refrain
from raising borrowing costs until at least the middle of 2013.
Policy makers are considering more bond purchases to boost
growth, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 0.2 percent in New
York yesterday, boosting its advance for the week to 2.2
percent.  Saudi Arabian stocks are “gaining momentum from Bernanke’s
pledge,” said Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-based
Albilad Investment Co.  Sabic contributed the most to  the index’s rally , adding 2.5
percent, the largest increase since Dec. 5, to 94 riyals. The
Riyadh-based company plans to construct a new unit in the fourth
quarter to store petrochemicals in Jubail,  al-Watan  reported
today, citing an unidentified source at the company. The new
unit will increase the company’s petrochemical storage capacity
to 18 million tons a year, the newspaper said.  Tasnee strengthened 2.4 percent to 39.20 riyals.  Etihad
Etisalat Co. (EEC) , which trades as Mobily, advanced 0.9 percent to
56.50 riyals, its highest price since February 2008, after the
phone company’s board recommended distributing quarterly
dividends in fiscal 2012.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
