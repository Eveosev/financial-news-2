Mobile Telecommunications Co. Saudi
Arabia (ZAINKSA)  jumped the most in more than 10 months after the phone
company known as Zain Saudi said investors approved extension of
its 9.75 billion-riyal ($2.6 billion) Murabaha facility for an
additional six months.  The  shares  surged 8.9 percent, its largest gain since March
13, to 6.70 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The shares
rallied 19 percent in four days.  Extension of the facility, which will now mature on July
27, “places the company in a better liquidity position to meet
its financial and operational obligations in the near future,”
Zain Saudi said in a statement to the  Saudi bourse  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
