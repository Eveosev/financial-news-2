Undergraduate tuition and fees to
attend  Princeton University  will rise 4.5 percent for the 2012-
2013 academic year, the biggest increase in six years.  Tuition will be $38,650, up from $37,000 in the current
year, the Ivy League school in Princeton, New Jersey, said today
in a  statement . Room costs will increase 5.4 percent to $6,950
from $6,596 and board will climb 3.8 percent to $5,680 from
$5,473.  The increase in tuition and fees at Princeton exceeds the
benchmark U.S. inflation measure. The  consumer price index  rose
3 percent in the 12 months ended in December, according to the
U.S. Labor Department. Surging tuition costs nationwide over the
past decade led the Obama administration last week to announce
plans to help make colleges more affordable.  “The University accordingly must continue to seek creative
ways to find efficiencies and reduce expenditures,” Provost
Christopher Eisgruber said in a statement.  The increase is the largest since the 2006-2007 academic
year, when costs rose 4.9 percent. Last year, the school raised
tuition and fees by 1 percent. Princeton’s endowment was valued
at $17.1 billion as of June 30, making it one of the largest in
U.S. higher education after Ivy League rivals Harvard University
and Yale University.  Princeton was founded in 1746 as the College of  New Jersey .
