qualified for the 2012 Olympics with a 3-0 victory over  Costa
Rica  in the semifinals of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament in
Vancouver, British Columbia.  As a regional finalist, the U.S. guaranteed its place in
the 12-team field at the Summer Games in  London , its fifth
straight trip to the Olympics.  Tobin Heath scored in the 16th minute to give the U.S. a 1-
0 lead last night. Carli Lloyd added a second goal in the 72nd
