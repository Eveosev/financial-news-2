France  may raise 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) annually from a transaction tax on stock trades,
 Le Figaro  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The 0.1 percent tax would also cover the most standardized
derivatives products, while bonds and transactions on capital
instruments would not be taxed, Le Figaro said. The tax project
will be presented at a Feb. 8 French government cabinet meeting,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
