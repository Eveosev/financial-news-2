Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg  said he’ll walk away from a plan to merge his power
generating assets with  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s if a deal isn’t completed
during this quarter.  “We cannot be in uncertainty for a long time, as this is
detrimental to the company,” Vekselberg said in an interview at
the  World Economic Forum  in Davos today. His Integrated Energy
Systems will continue to operate as an independent company if no
agreement is reached by March 31, he said.  Gazprom,  Russia ’s state-run gas export monopoly, and
Vekselberg agreed in July to merge electricity assets, forming a
utility that would control as much as 25 percent of the
country’s power-generating capacity. In December, the companies
withdrew their merger request with Russia’s antitrust watchdog
after failing to agree on terms. Gazprom said on Jan. 18 that it
plans to file a new request with amended terms “in a few
days.”  Integrated Energy Systems, Russia’s largest privately-owned
utility according to Forbes magazine, owns stakes in the  TGK-5 (TGKEG) ,
TGK-6, Volga TGK and TGK-9 power companies. Gazprom
Energoholding controls OAO  Mosenergo (MSNG) , OGK-6,  OGK-2 (OGKB)  and TGK-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
