Japan ’s government will look for
investments from oil and gas companies to renew some thermal
power-generating plants as a part of its plan to reorganize
Tokyo Electric Power Co., the Mainichi newspaper reported.  The plan includes setting up a unit to operate the
utility’s power distribution business separately from power
generation, Mainichi said, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Older plants the government will look to renew include
facilities in Tokyo’s Oi district and in the neighboring
prefectures of Kanagawa and Chiba, the newspaper said. The
government will also promote joint procurement of liquefied
natural gas for Tepco, as the utility is known, and Japan’s
other power producers to reduce costs, the report said.  The government won’t nationalize the nuclear power
business, according to the Mainichi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
