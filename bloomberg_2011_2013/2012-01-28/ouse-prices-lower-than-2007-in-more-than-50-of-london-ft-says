London  house prices are below 2007
levels in more than half of the city’s 243 postcode districts,
the Financial Times reported, citing data from property
researcher Hometrack Ltd.  Average property values in 193 Greater London postcodes are
20 percent lower than four years ago, the newspaper said, while
prices have risen in 40 areas including affluent neighborhoods
Knightsbridge and Belgravia. House prices in certain areas are
being inflated by demand from overseas buyers, the FT cited
Hometrack’s director of research  Richard Donnell  as saying.  Luxury-home prices in London gained for the 14th
consecutive month in December, according to broker Knight Frank
LLP, even as a weakening economic recovery drags U.K. average
property prices down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
