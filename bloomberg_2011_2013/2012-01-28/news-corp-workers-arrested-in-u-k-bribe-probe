Four current and former employees of
 News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. tabloid newspaper The Sun and a serving police
officer were arrested as part of a bribery investigation.  Officers searched company offices and made the arrests with
the help of a News Corp. committee set up to assist Operation
Elveden, a probe into inappropriate payments to police, the
London-based media company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Four men were arrested in London on suspicion of corruption
under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, the Metropolitan
Police said in a separate statement. The fifth, a serving
officer in the Territorial Policing command, was detained at the
central London station where he works.  “Today’s operation is the result of information provided
to police by News Corp.’s Management and Standards Committee,”
the Met Police said. “It relates to suspected payments to
police officers and is not about seeking journalists to reveal
confidential sources in relation to information that has been
obtained legitimately.”  News International spokeswoman Miranda Higham declined to
comment beyond the statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
