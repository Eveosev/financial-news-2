Arc Exploration Ltd. (ARX)  lost its
license to look for gold in  Indonesia ’s Sumbawa island after
violent protests against the company, Tempo reported on its
website.  The exploration license was revoked by the head of Bima
Regency Ferry Zulkarnain, the newspaper said, citing the head of
the local mining and energy office, Ilham Sabil.  Zulkarnain didn’t answer two calls to his mobile phone and
a text message. Three calls to Arc’s office in Jakarta weren’t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
