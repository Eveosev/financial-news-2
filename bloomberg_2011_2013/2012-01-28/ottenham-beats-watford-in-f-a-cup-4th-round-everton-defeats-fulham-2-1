Tottenham beat Watford 1-0 last
night in the fourth round of English soccer’s F.A. Cup, as
Everton also advanced with a 2-1 win over Fulham.  Rafael van der Vaart  scored three minutes before halftime
at Vicarage Road stadium in Watford as Tottenham advanced to the
fifth round for just the second time in five years. Spurs hasn’t
won the cup since 1991.  The Dutch midfielder hit the cross bar, although Watford
came close to scoring twice, the ball hitting the goal post and
bouncing away each time.  Tottenham has won all four previous F.A. Cup matches
against Watford, which plays in the second-tier Championship.  Everton came back to defeat Fulham at home after Marouane
Fellaini scored with a header in the 73rd minute.  Danny Murphy ’s
14th minute penalty put the visitors ahead at Goodison Park
although Everton was able to tie the match 13 minutes later when
Denis Stracqualursi headed in a Landon Donovan cross.  Everton is now unbeaten in past five matches against
Fulham, with 4 wins. Coming into the match, the Toffees had
scored more than one goal just once in past 11 games, 2-0 over
Tamworth in 3rd round of FA Cup on Jan. 7.  Fulham is winless in its last eight away games overall. The
Cottagers had won all four previous F.A. Cup meetings with
Everton.  Liverpool hosts Manchester United and Chelsea visits Queen
Park Rangers in the all-Premier League matchup among today’s 12
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
