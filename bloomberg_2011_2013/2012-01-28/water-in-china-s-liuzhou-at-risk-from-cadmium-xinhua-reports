Drinking water in Liuzhou city in
southern  China ’s Guangxi province is under increasing risk from
cadmium pollution, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing
a level 2 environmental emergency reported by the provincial
government.  Cadmium contamination in the Liujiang River spread
downstream, prompting Liuzhou residents to buy bottled water,
Xinhua reported on Jan. 26.  A level 2 environmental emergency in China is defined as
one where an important river, lake, reservoir or sea is affected
or a situation where more than 10,000 people and fewer than
50,000 may need to be evacuated, according to guidelines posted
on the Guangxi government’s website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
