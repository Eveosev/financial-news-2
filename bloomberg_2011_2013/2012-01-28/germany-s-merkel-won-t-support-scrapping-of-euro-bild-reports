German Chancellor Angel Merkel won’t
support the scrapping of the euro because Germans have benefited
from the common currency,  Bild am Sonntag  reported in an e-
mailed copy of a story to be published in tomorrow’s newspaper.  “If the euro fails,  Europe  fails,” the newspaper cited
Merkel as saying. “The euro was a decisive step toward deeper
European integration, that couldn’t be undone without serious
consequences and great risks.”  Merkel also expects the euro region to expand from its
current size of 17 members, the newspaper said, citing the
chancellor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
