A collection of mature top-name
Bordeaux fetched $2.5 million in  London  in the latest test of
auction demand for fine wines.  The sale was 95 percent successful by lot, according to
Sotheby’s, which said it “breathes fire into the wine market” at
the start of the Chinese year of the dragon. Still, dealers
noted yesterday that the total raised was close to auction-house
forecasts, and the selling rate was helped by lower estimates.  Asian demand for prestige wines has cooled, leaving prices
20 percent down on the market highs of mid-2011. In this week’s
sale, Sotheby’s was offering more than 6,000 bottles, ranging in
vintage from 1953 to 1995, from the holdings of an unidentified
European client.  “The wine market remains volatile, though it’s leveling
out,”  Miles Davis , partner at Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in
an interview. “It’s following the classic pattern of a 20
percent decline after a global shakeup.”  The presale estimate at hammer prices was 1.5 million
pounds ($2.3 million). Though private collections tend to fetch
optimum auction prices, the final hammer total was 1.4 million
pounds, or 1.6 million pounds with fees included.  The 665-lot sale followed a year in which the benchmark
 Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 index  (LIVX) declined 15 percent. Asian
buyers, who have dominated the international auction market
since 2008, were unwilling to pay ever-higher prices for status
labels such as Chateau Lafite, Latour and Petrus.  Older Vintages  “The market for these older types of wine seems to have
stabilized,” Stephen Mould,  Sotheby’s (BID)  London-based senior
director, said in an interview. “At this level, the prices seem
to be holding, if the bottles are in good condition. We weren’t
offering a lot of younger vintages.”  U.K.-based traders, sensing an opportunity to buy stock at
an attractive price, captured the seven most valuable lots on
Jan. 25. The most expensive was a 12-bottle case of  Chateau
Petrus  from the highly rated 1982 vintage. This sold for 39,100
pounds with fees, against a low estimate of 36,000 pounds.  In June 2011, when Asian buyers were still paying records
at auction, a case of the same wine sold at Sotheby’s London for
59,800 pounds.  Case prices for the 1982 vintage of Chateau Lafite --
 Asia ’s favorite fine-wine label -- were also at least 20 percent
down on mid-2011 highs.  Lafite Case  A case of Lafite 1982 sold for 32,200 pounds including fees
at Sotheby’s, at the top end of its presale estimate, compared
with the 40,640 pounds fetched by a similar case at Acker
Merrall & Condit in  Hong Kong  in May.  U.K. bidders bought 58 percent of the lots. Asians took 29
percent. In 2011, two-thirds of all the lots valued at more than
10,000 pounds at Christie’s auctions in the U.S.,  Europe  and
Hong Kong fell to Asian bidders, according to David Elswood, the
company’s London-based head of wine.  “There’s still plenty of demand in Asia,” Davis said.
“They’ll be back.”  The Sotheby’s sale provided further evidence of demand for
Bordeaux second-growth wines, which have attracted interest from
Asian buyers as prices of the more expensive first-growths have
become more volatile in recent months.  One such second growth is Leoville Las Cases, a Saint-
Julien estate in the Medoc just to the south of  Chateau Latour 
which has been a top wine producer of the region for more than
250 years. Three cases of Leoville Las Cases 1982 sold for 3,680
pounds each, above their upper estimate and close to the $6,100
achieved at an Acker auction in Hong Kong in November, while
others in the sale achieved their estimated range.  U.S. Christie’s  Christie’s International (CHRS)  also held an auction Jan. 25 in
 New York , selling $1.18 million of wine, with buyers taking up
96 percent of lots. The event accompanied a sale of paintings
and was an addition to its regular calendar of wine auctions.  The three top Christie’s lots in New York comprised a case
each of Petrus 1982 and Petrus 2000 which fetched $58,080 and
$45,980 respectively, and a dozen bottles of Lafite 1982, for
which a private Asian buyer paid $45,980.  The past week’s auctions in the U.K. and U.S. followed
Chinese New Year sales earlier this month by Sotheby’s, Zachys,
and Acker, Merrall & Condit in Hong Kong, which taken together
brought in a total of $22.4 million. Acker was also scheduled to
hold a sale in  Chicago  before the end of January.  The total so far this year compares with $36.9 million sold
by the same group of auction houses in January last year, when
the market was more buoyant.  (Scott Reyburn and Guy Collins write about the art and wine
