The  Institute of International
Finance , which represents private holders of Greek debt in talks
with the Greek government, said further progress was made in
discussions in  Athens  today and that a final deal will be
concluded in the coming week.  “Further progress was made, building on the understandings
reached yesterday on the key legal and technical issues,” the
IIF said in an e-mailed statement today. “We are close to the
finalization of a voluntary PSI within the framework expressed
publicly earlier this week by Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker in his capacity as chairman of the Eurogroup. We
expect to conclude next week as discussions on other issues move
forward.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
