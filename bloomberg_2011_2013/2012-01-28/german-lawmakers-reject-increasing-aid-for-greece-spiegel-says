Lawmakers from German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’scoalition rejected increasing aid for Greece,
 Der Spiegel  said, citing members of the parliament in Berlin.  There can be no further aid if Greece doesn’t implement the
agreed adjustment programs, the magazine said, citing Horst Seehofer, chairman of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union.  Greece must show evidence that it’s serious about
implementing structural reforms, the magazine cited Rainer Bruederle, head of the Free Democratic Party’s group in
parliament, as saying.  All Greek parties must show the desire for fundamental
change because there is increasing “annoyance” in Berlin,  Der
Spiegel  said, citing CDU lawmaker Gunther Krichbaum, head of the
European Affairs committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
