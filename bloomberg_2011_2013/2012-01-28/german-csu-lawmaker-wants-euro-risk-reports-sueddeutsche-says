German lawmakers should get monthly,
easy-to-read status reports on financial risks to the German tax
payer stemming from the euro regionâ€™s sovereign-debt crisis,
Christian Social Union lawmaker Johannes Singhammer told
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  The reports should state up-to-date figures on liabilities
from the financial backstops, the European Financial Stability
Facility and the future European Stability Mechanism, the
newspaper cited the deputy parliamentary group leader as saying.  They should also notify risks from two programs for Greece,
aid provided by the  International Monetary Fund , bond purchases
by the  European Central Bank  and from the liabilities of the
central banks of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain within the
system of European central banks, Singhammer told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
