Turkey ’s Foreign Ministry
recommended a Jewish Turk represent the country at the
Eurovision song contest, Haberturk newspaper  reported , without
saying how it got the information.  The ministry sent a letter to state television channel TRT
on Jan. 3 recommending that pop singer  Can Bonomo  represent
Turkey at the yearly event, Haberturk reported. The move was
intended as an opening to Jews amid the worst period in Turkish-
Israeli relations in the countries’ histories, the Istanbul-
based newspaper said. Bonomo was announced as Turkey’s
representative for the contest by TRT on Jan. 6, it said.  Turkey will also be the first Muslim country to air a
documentary about the Holocaust as part of the same cultural
opening toward Jews, Haberturk reported. French director Claude
Lanzmann’s 9.5-hour documentary “Shoah” began airing with
Turkish subtitles on TRT on Jan. 26 and will continue in
episodes to be aired each Thursday, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
