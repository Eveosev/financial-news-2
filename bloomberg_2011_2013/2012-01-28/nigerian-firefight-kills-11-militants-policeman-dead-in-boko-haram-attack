Fighting between Islamic militants
and armed forces in northern  Nigeria  during the last two days
has killed 12 people, including a policeman, according to
military and police officials.  Nigerian soldiers today killed 11 members of Boko Haram, an
Islamist militant group, in a gun battle in Maiduguri, in the
northeast of the country, according to army spokesman Victor
Ibhaleme. The men, “high profile” members of Boko Haram, were
shot after a gunfight broke out during a routine stop-and-search
operation, he said by phone from the city, declining to give
further details.  In Kano, also in the north of the country, gunmen suspected
of being members of the group attacked a police station
yesterday, killing one policeman, spokesman Musa Magaji Majiya
said by phone from the city. “Our men repelled the attack and
hit some of the attackers,” he said.  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
whose name means “Western education is a sin,” for bombings
and attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital Abuja
during the past year.  The group claimed the Christmas Day bombing of a church
near Abuja that killed 43 people and the Aug. 26 suicide-bombing
of the United Nations building in the capital that killed 24. It
also claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on government
buildings in Kano on Jan. 20, in which at least 165 people died.  To contact the reporters on this story:
