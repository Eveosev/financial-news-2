Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  is recalling
almost 52,400 Tribute sport-utility vehicles from the 2001 and
2002 model years because leaking brake fluid could corrode
connectors and possibly cause a fire.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
disclosed the  recall  today on its website. The Japanese
automaker alerted the agency to the recall on Jan. 19.  NHTSA said the brake master cylinder reservoir cap can leak
fluid, which may corrode the anti-lock braking system moduleâ€™s
wiring harness and cause melting, smoking or even fire. A total
of 52,390 vehicles built between April 2000 and July 19, 2002,
may be involved, the agency said.  The recall is set to begin Jan. 30. Dealers will replace
the master cylinder reservoir cap and modify the anti-lock
braking system free of charge, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
