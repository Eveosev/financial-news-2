Cyprus’s economy has a “solid
foundation” and “excellent prospects,” the  Finance Ministry 
said after  Fitch Ratings  downgraded the nation’s debt to the
lowest level in its investment-grade structure.  “The ministry, in collaboration with the Central Bank of
Cyprus, is systematically monitoring management of the
challenges to the financial system,” the Nicosia-based ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Fitch cut Cyprus’s sovereign credit rating by one level to
‘BBB-’ from ‘BBB’ yesterday and maintained a negative outlook,
citing large capital needs of Cypriot banks after a
restructuring of Greek debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
