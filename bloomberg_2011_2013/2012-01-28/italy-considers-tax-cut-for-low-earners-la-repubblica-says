Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti â€™s
Cabinet is evaluating a plan to cut taxes for low earners with
funds recovered from tax evaders, La Repubblica reported without
saying where it got the information.  Monti may finance the reduction of income taxes with as
much as 15 billion euros ($19.8 billion) recovered from a
crackdown on  tax evasion , the Italian paper said.  The government may reduce to 20 percent from 23 percent the
income levy on the lowest tax bracket, La Repubblica said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
