Hungarian Premier  Viktor Orban  is
said to have told his cabinet this week it’s “unimaginable”
for him to change the flat personal income tax regime to meet
possible International Monetary Fund requests related to a loan,
Magyar Nemzet reported, without citing anyone.  It is “99.9 percent” certain that the government won’t
introduce changes to the flat tax, the Budapest-based newspaper
said, citing Lajos Kosa, the governing party’s vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
