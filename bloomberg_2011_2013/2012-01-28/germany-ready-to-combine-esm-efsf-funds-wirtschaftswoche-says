German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government is ready to add unused funds from the euro region’s
financial backstop to its permanent successor,  WirtschaftsWoche 
reported, citing government officials it didn’t name.  The government would support combining the lending power of
the European Financial Stability Facility and the 500 billion-
euro ($661 billion) European Stability Mechanism, the euro
region’s future permanent financial backstop, the magazine said.  The two facilities together would have a lending volume of
about 790 billion euros, the magazine said. The ESM alone would
be insufficient if Italy and  Spain  were to seek financial
assistance, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
