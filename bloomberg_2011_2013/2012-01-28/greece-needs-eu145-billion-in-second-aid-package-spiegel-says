Greece  requires 145 billion euros
($192 billion) as part of a second aid package for the cash-
strapped country, 15 billion euros more than was agreed in
October 2011,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an unidentified
official from the so-called troika of European Commission,
European Central Bank and  International Monetary Fund .  Greece needs more money because the country’s economic
situation is worsening, the German magazine cited the official
as saying. The gap can’t be filled by contributions from private
creditors alone, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
