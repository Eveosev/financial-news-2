At least 26 people were killed and
another 125,000 displaced in  Mozambique  as tropical cyclones
Funso and Dando hit the country in the past two weeks, according
to daily Noticias.  Some of the victims drowned, while others were electrocuted
in their homes or killed by walls of their houses caving in, the
state-controlled newspaper reported, citing Dulce Chilundo,
director of the national emergency operations center.  About 94,000 hectares of crops were lost, as well as 6,000
cashew nuts trees and 300 coconut trees, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
