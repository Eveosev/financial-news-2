Rachel Alexandra , 2009 Horse of the
Year, and her 6-day-old colt were hospitalized yesterday for
pain management following the birth.  Rachel Alexandra and the foal were admitted to the Rood and
Riddle Equine Clinic in Lexington, Kentucky, where Dr. Bonnie
Barr is supervising their care, Caroline Shaw, a spokeswoman for
stable Stonestreet Farm, said in an e-mail.  “Rachel has proven to be an extraordinary mother and
taking to her feisty colt right away,” owner Barbara Banke,
widow of  Jess Jackson  and proprietor of Kendall-Jackson Wine
Estates Ltd., said in a separate e-mail. ‘I’m a Rachel-chondriac.
We are taking every precaution to ensure that Rachel and her
colt are healthy and happy.”  Rachel Alexandra and the colt are expected to be released
in a few days, Shaw said.  The mare gave birth to her 125-pound colt on Jan. 22 at
Stonestreet Farm. The bay colt, emblazoned with a white star,
resembles his mother, Shaw said.  Rachel Alexandra went undefeated in 2009, including a 20
1/2-length win in the  Kentucky  Oaks and then a victory in the
 Preakness Stakes , the second event in racing’s Triple Crown.
Jackson bought her after the Kentucky Oaks victory.  Sired by Curlin  Rachel Alexandra opened 2010 with two runner-up finishes
before claiming the Fleur De Lis Handicap and the Lady’s Secret
Stakes. She finished second in the Personal Ensign Stakes on Aug.
29, her final race. She was retired in September 2010 without
ever competing against Zenyatta, the 2010 Horse of the Year, who
won 19 of her 20 starts including the male-dominated Breeders’
Cup Classic in 2009.  The colt’s sire is Curlin, who in 2008 became the first
thoroughbred since Cigar in 1996 to retain Horse of the Year
honors. He won 11 of 16 starts in two years and amassed $10.5
million in prize money, capturing the 2007  Breeders’ Cup Classic 
and the Preakness.  Rachel Alexandra will be bred this year to Bernardini, who
won the 2006 Preakness in which Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro
was fatally injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
