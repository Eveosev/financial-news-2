Victoria Azarenka  beat  Maria
Sharapova  in the Australian Open final to win her first Grand
Slam title and take the No. 1 ranking in women’s tennis.  Azarenka, the No. 3 seed from Belarus, won nine games in a
row on her way to defeating the fourth-seeded Russian 6-3, 6-0
at Rod Laver Arena. Sharapova, 24, was seeking her first major
championship since winning in Melbourne four years ago.  Azarenka, 22, had moved to the final by ousting defending
champion Kim Clijsters of Belgium in the semifinals. The victory
over Sharapova lifts Azarenka into the top spot in women’s
tennis above Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki and Petra Kvitova of
the Czech Republic.  Defending men’s champion Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  faces No.
2 seed Rafael Nadal of Spain tomorrow in their third straight
meeting in a Grand Slam final. Djokovic won the previous two to
secure the Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
