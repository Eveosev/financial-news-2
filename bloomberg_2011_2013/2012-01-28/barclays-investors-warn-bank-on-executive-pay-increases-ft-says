Barclays Plc (BARC)  shareholders have told
the bank they won’t accept large pay increases for its chief
executive officer or senior bankers, the Financial Times
reported today, citing unidentified investors.  U.K. investors including Legal & General Group Plc and F&C
Asset Management Plc have been petitioning for banks to award
“moderate” pay increases as share prices fall, the newspaper
reported.  Jerry Del Missier and  Rich Ricci , who run the investment
banking unit at London-based Barclays, and Chief Executive
Officer  Bob Diamond  together received more than 100 million
pounds ($157 million) last year in compensation, according to
the FT.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the state-owned lender,
awarded CEO  Stephen Hester  a 963,000-pound bonus this week,
sparking criticism from lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
