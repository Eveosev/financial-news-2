State Bank Of India (SBIN)  may start
offering mortgages to U.K. borrowers from August this year, the
Financial Times reported, citing Rajnish Kumar, the head of its
U.K. unit.  Kumar said that SBI, which has 10 branches in the U.K., may
benefit as greater regulation in the country following the
financial crisis has provided an opportunity for smaller
lenders, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
