German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she will discuss Iran’s nuclear program and sanctions against
the oil-producing country when she visits  China  next week.  “There are areas in which we have differing opinions, for
example as regards sanctions against Iran and its nuclear
program,” Merkel  said  in her weekly video message on the
Internet. “Talks and visits always serve the purpose of
discussing issues on which we aren’t yet of the same opinion.”  Merkel will meet Chinese President Hu Jintao and Prime
Minister Wen Jiabao in Beijing on Feb. 2, before holding a
speech on global finance issues at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, the Berlin-based government press office said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
