United Co. Rusal (486)  Chief Executive
Officer Oleg Deripaska said he is “very concerned” with the
Russian central bank’s policy, according to an interview on
state television Rossiya 24, posted on Rusal’s  Facebook  page.  The central bank has largely suspended  money supply  and
frozen the development of the financial system in Russia’s
regions as 75 percent of loans are provided by the five largest
banks, Deripaska said in the interview.  Central bank policy makers have failed to promote
employment and economic growth and they don’t take any examples
from either developed countries or from China and India,
Deripaska told Rossiya 24. As a result, interest rates in Russia
are higher than those in the countries it competes with, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
