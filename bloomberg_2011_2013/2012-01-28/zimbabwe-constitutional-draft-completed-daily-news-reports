A draft copy of  Zimbabwe ’s new
constitution should be completed by the end of this month,
ending two years of national debate, the  Daily News  said, citing
the Constitution Select Committee, known as Copac.  The newly drafted constitution will be submitted to a
stakeholders’ conference held by Zimbabwe’s political parties
and civil society organizations before being sent to parliament,
the Harare-based Daily News said on its website. Following
parliamentary approval, Zimbabwe will hold a national referendum
to either reject or approve the constitution.  The  Southern African Development Community  ordered
Zimbabwe’s political parties to share power after elections in
2008 were deemed flawed. SADC also demanded a new constitution
be drafted and approved by referendum before elections are held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
