The U.S. Defense Department is
seeking to boost spending on its largest bomb to make it capable
of destroying  Iran ’s fortified facilities built deep
underground, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The Pentagon has spent $330 million so far on about 20 of
Boeing Co.’s Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, which were
specifically designed to penetrate deep into rock, concrete and
steel before exploding. The Pentagon has requested about $82
million more from Congress to enhance the bomb’s capabilities as
tests have shown the bomb probably isn’t yet powerful enough,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
