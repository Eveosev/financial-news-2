Wegelin & Co., the Swiss private
bank that yesterday agreed to a sale, got a letter from the U.S.
Justice Department about 10 days ago asking the bank to disclose
data on American clients or face charges, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bank’s partners considered various options together
with the Swiss regulator Finma before deciding on the sale to
Raiffeisen Group, the newspaper said. Finma declined to comment
on the letter from the U.S. Justice Department, it said.  Wegelin agreed to a sale to  Switzerland ’s Raiffeisen after
being investigated in the U.S. for allegedly helping Americans
evade taxes. The private bank said this month that three bankers
were charged with conspiring to help U.S. clients hide more than
$1.2 billion from American tax authorities.  Joerg Denzler, a spokesman for Wegelin, declined to comment
on the article when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
