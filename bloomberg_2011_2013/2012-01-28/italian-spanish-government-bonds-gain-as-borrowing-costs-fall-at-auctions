Italian and Spanish bonds advanced
this week as borrowing costs fell at debt sales amid optimism
loans provided by the  European Central Bank  are helping to stem
the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  Italian 10-year bonds gained for a third week, and Spanish
two-year yields dropped to the lowest since November 2010 amid
speculation banks are buying them with funds borrowed from the
ECB’s longer-term refinancing operation, or LTRO. German bunds
advanced this week as  Greece  and its creditors struggled to
reach agreement over a debt-swap.  “The market is slowly turning optimistic,” said Mohit Kumar, head of European fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG in London. “To begin with, the market probably
underestimated how good the three-year LTRO was. Clearly the
market is realizing it is a powerful tool. It has been
supporting the auctions.”  Italian 10-year yields dropped 35 basis points this week to
5.9 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time yesterday. The 5 percent
security due in March 2022 gained 2.44, or 24.40 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,318) face amount, to 93.855.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of bunds slid 28 basis points to 4.04 percentage points,
its fourth weekly drop.  Spain ’s two-year yield slid 79 basis points this week to
2.53 percent after dropping to 2.52 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 5, 2010. The yield has dropped 82 basis points since
Dec. 20, the day before the ECB lent European financial
institutions 489 billion euros of three-year loans.  Bond Returns  German bunds gained this week as Greece’s creditors, led by
the  Institute of International Finance , pursued talks with the
government on a debt swap to lower the nation’s borrowings and
avert economic collapse.  The 10-year yield fell seven basis points to 1.86 percent.  Italian debt has returned 5 percent this month, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds gained 1.3 percent
this year and bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.4 percent.  Auctions next week “will be a good gauge of appetite for
the peripheral bonds,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.  Italy will sell bonds due between 2016 and 2022 on Jan. 30.
France auctions bills on Jan. 30, and will offer bonds maturing
2018, 2020 and 2022 on Feb. 2.  Germany  plans to sell 5 billion
euros of 10-year bunds on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
