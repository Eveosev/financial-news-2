Otmar Issing , the former chief
economist of the  European Central Bank , said he wouldn’t rule
out exits from the euro area, Neue Zuercher Zeitung reported,
citing an interview.  “The Greek case is obvious,” Issing told the newspaper.
He added that the risk of contagion has fallen because countries
like Ireland and Spain escaped “the line of fire” because of
reforms. For the highly-indebted nations there is “no
alternative” to fiscal consolidation, he said, Neue Zuercher
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
