Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  will try to gain
a stronger foothold in  Asia  through joint ventures should a
planned merger with  NYSE Euronext (NRX)  collapse,  Euro am Sonntag  said
in an advance copy of an article in tomorrow’s edition, citing a
Deutsche Boerse manager it didn’t identify.  The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange would also
seek to increase the range of its products, including
agricultural commodities derivatives, the newspaper said.
Deutsche Boerse would be under no pressure to look for a “Plan
B” or seek alternative merger options, it said.  European antitrust regulators are likely to formally oppose
the merger of  NYSE Euronext (NRX)  and Deutsche Boerse on Feb. 1, the
newspaper said.  Deutsche Boerse  has spent between 100 million
euros ($132 million) to 120 million euros on the deal, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
