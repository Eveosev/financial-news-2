Pakistan  beat top-ranked England by
72 runs in their second cricket Test in Abu Dhabi to take an
unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three contest.  Abdul Rehman took 6-25 as England, chasing 145 for the
victory, collapsed to 72 all out -- its lowest Test score
against Pakistan -- after 36.1 overs on day four. Captain  Andrew Strauss  (32) and Matt Prior (18) were the only England batsmen
to reach double figures.  “I wish I could explain it,” Strauss said afterwards.
“We came up short, but ultimately you’ve got to congratulate
Pakistan. They were outstanding.  After Monty Panesar’s 6-62 helped to bowl Pakistan out for
214, England lost Alastair Cook,  Ian Bell , Kevin Pietersen and
Eoin Morgan in the first 21 overs before tea. The remaining
wickets fell in less than 15 overs, with Rehman claiming four.  “That was a much-needed victory for us,” Pakistan captain
Misbah-ul-Huq said. “It was a wonderful team effort, everyone
performed, everyone put 100 percent effort in.”  Azhar Ali  top-scored for Pakistan with 68, teaming with
Asad Shafiq for an 88-run, fifth-wicket stand. Shafiq scored 43.  The third Test in Dubai starts Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
