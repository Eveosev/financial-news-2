Spanish 10-year bonds had their worst
week since October, sliding with stocks around the world, after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers may
reduce the pace of asset purchases designed to boost growth.  Spain’s borrowing costs increased as it auctioned 4.08
billion-euro ($5.27 billion) of debt, while Italian bonds fell
for a third week and Portuguese and Greek securities also
tumbled. German bunds declined, pushing yields to a two-month
high, as reports signaling the economic recovery is picking up
pace curbed demand for the safest fixed-income assets. Bernanke
told the  U.S. Congress  on May 22 that the central bank may begin
to slow bond purchases in the next few policy meetings.  “ Risk aversion  has had an adverse effect on the peripheral
bond markets,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist
at RIA Capital in Edinburgh, referring to the region’s high-debt
and -deficit nations. “Fears that the Fed could start slowing
the pace of quantitative easing and the significant supply we’ve
had both in  Spain  and  Italy  recently have led to a little bit of
a correction.”  Spain’s 10-year  yields  climbed 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, since May 17 to 4.42 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. That’s the biggest weekly increase since Oct.
26. The 5.4 percent bond due in January 2023 fell 1.755, or
17.55 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 107.57.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of European equities slid 1.7
percent in the week as data yesterday showed a jump in American
durable-goods orders, adding to speculation the Fed will begin
to taper stimulus measures that had helped boost markets around
the world.  Economic Confidence  The Ifo institute’s German  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 105.7 in May from 104.4
last month, a report showed yesterday. The European Commission
will say on May 30 that  economic confidence  in the euro area
improved this month, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose 10 basis points in the
week to 1.43 percent. It reached 1.47 percent yesterday, the
highest since March 15.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed 24 basis points to 4.14
percent. The country is scheduled to sell as much as 3.5 billion
euros of conventional and inflation-linked notes on May 28. The
Spanish Treasury sold five-year notes at an average yield of
3.001 percent on May 23, up from 2.789 percent at a previous
auction on May 9. It also sold debt due in 2016 and 2026.  Portugal ’s 10-year  yield  jumped 28 basis points to 5.53
percent and the rate on similar-maturity Greek debt increased 57
basis points to 8.86 percent.  Spanish government debt handed investors a loss of 0.8
percent this month through May 23, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian securities dropped 0.2 percent and German
bonds declined 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
