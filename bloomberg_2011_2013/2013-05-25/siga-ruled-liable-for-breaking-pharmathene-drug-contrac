Biological warfare defense firms  Siga
Technologies Inc. (SIGA)  and PharmAthene Inc. soared after a mixed
ruling by the Delaware  Supreme Court  affirmed Siga’s liability
over a smallpox medicine licensing agreement while setting aside
a potential multibillion-dollar damages ruling for PharmAthene.  The court’s decision yesterday mirrored Delaware Chancery
Judge Donald Parsons Jr.’s 2011 ruling on liability while
ordering him to reconsider the amount of damages. Siga rose as
much as 41 percent after the close to $5.15 before it was halted
at $4.40. PharmAthene rose as much as 53 percent to $2.45 before
falling back to $2.37.  PharmAthene, a developer of biological and chemical defense
products based in Annapolis,  Maryland , sued New York-based
competitor Siga in 2006, claiming it had a licensing agreement
for the medicine. PharmAthene said it should share in as much as
$5 billion in  potential sales , mostly from government contracts
for ST-246. The antiviral drug is intended for use in case of a
biological attack.  Parsons ruled in 2011 that PharmAthene was entitled to 50
percent of profit from sales of ST-246 once Siga earned a profit
of $40 million. The state high court yesterday affirmed his
decision that Siga is liable for breaking its contractual
obligations to negotiate a licensing agreement in good faith.  Siga officials said last year that the company won a five-year U.S. government contract for 2 million doses of ST-246 in a
deal that could be worth as much as $2.8 billion.  In its lawsuit, PharmAthene argued it had a claim to ST-246’s profits because it helped fund the drug’s development and
Siga reneged on promises to grant a licensing agreement.  Stephen Lamb, a lawyer for Siga, and Stacey Jurchison, a
spokeswoman for PharmAthene, didn’t immediately respond to phone
and e-mail messages yesterday after regular business hours
seeking comment on the decision.  The case is Siga Technologies v. PharmAthene, 12-00314,
Delaware Supreme Court. The Chancery Court case is  PharmAthene
Inc. (PIP)  v. Siga Technologies Inc., CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
