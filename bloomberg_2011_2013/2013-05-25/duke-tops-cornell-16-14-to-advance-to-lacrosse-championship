Duke University  defeated Cornell
University 16-14 to advance to the national men’s college
lacrosse championship.  Duke will play top-seeded Syracuse or No. 4 Denver in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association title game at Lincoln
Financial Field in Philadelphia.  Duke had a 7-6 halftime advantage before scoring seven
goals while holding the Big Red to one in the third quarter.
Cornell answered with seven goals to Duke’s two in the fourth
period.  “Cornell was a great team. With 16 seniors you knew they
weren’t going to give up,” said Duke coach John Danowski in a
televised interview.  Jordan Wolf had four goals and Jake Tripucka scored three
goals for the seventh-seeded Blue Devils.  Cornell attackman Rob Pannell had five goals and two
assists to set an NCAA record with 354 career points. He
surpassed Duke’s Matt Danowski, who had 353 points and watched
the game from the sidelines as a first-year assistant coach for
the Blue Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
