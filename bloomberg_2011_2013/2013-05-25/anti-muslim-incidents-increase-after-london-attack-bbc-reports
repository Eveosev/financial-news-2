The killing of a 25-year soldier in
 London  on May 22 has prompted a large increase in anti-Muslim
incidents, the organization Faith Matters told the  BBC .  The group, which works to reduce extremism, said about 150
incidents had been reported in the last few days, including
attacks on mosques. Before the attack, about four to eight cases
a day were reported to its helpline.  “What’s really concerning is the spread of these
incidents,” Fiyaz Mughal, a director of Faith Matters, told BBC
Radio Five Live. “They’re coming in from right across the
country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
