Dylan Hartley  is set to miss the
British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Hong Kong and  Australia 
after being red-carded yesterday for verbally abusing a referee.  Northampton Saints captain Hartley was banned for 11 weeks
today by a Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel. The hooker
was dismissed as his team lost 37-17 to Leicester Tigers in the
Premiership rugby final at Twickenham in London. He’s the first
player to be sent off in the title match.  Hartley has the right of appeal against the decision after
he was found guilty of abusing the match official, the RFU said
in a release today.  Hartley was red-carded just before halftime with his team
trailing 13-5. The British Broadcasting Corp. reported he swore
at referee Wayne Barnes and called him a “cheat” after a
penalty decision went against the Saints.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
