Asian currencies had a third weekly
loss on concern the Federal Reserve will scale back stimulus
that has spurred fund flows to  emerging markets .  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index touched a six-week
low on May 23 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said on May 22 its $85 billion a month of bond-buying, known as
quantitative easing, may be tapered if the U.S. economy shows a
sustained improvement. The yuan reached a 19-year high yesterday
as the central bank set a record fixing even after data
indicated manufacturing in Asia’s largest economy will contract

Philippine peso fell 1 percent to 41.595. The  yuan  rose 0.17

comments on the QE exit plan,” said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst
at Woori Futures Co. in Seoul.  The won had a third weekly decline, the longest losing

between expansion and contraction.  The peso completed its biggest decline since the five days
ended Aug. 17. The drop is due to “dominant external factors”

yesterday.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reiterated the country was
making progress in opening up its capital account. Industrial

markets are positive for the exchange rate,” said Bruce Yam, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. in

driving demand for the currency.”  Taiwan Forwards  Taiwan dollar forwards advanced as a plan to cut taxes on
