Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
slid for the first time in seven days, following global markets.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , or Sabic, the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, dropped the most since April 20, while
 Jabal Omar Development Co. (JOMAR)  slid to the lowest level since May
15.  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , known as Mobily, fell the most since
April 28.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  lost 0.4 percent, the steepest
fall since May 13, to 7,333.83 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.
The Arab world’s biggest bourse has gained 7.8 percent this
year.  “The market is taking a cue from some negative
macroeconomic news flow last week, particularly regarding IMF
comments on the country,” Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at
Riyad Capital, said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Also, as we are approaching the summer season, this is
historically a period of subdued activity in the market as
people go on vacations.”  The International Monetary Fund said on May 20 it expects
Saudi Arabia’s economic growth to slow to 4.4 percent this year
from 6.8 percent in 2012 because of lower oil output and
 government spending .  Sabic lost 0.8 percent to 93.5 riyals, while Jabal Omar
fell 2.4 percent to 28.3 riyals. Mobily declined 0.9 percent to
79.5 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
