Perrigo Co.’s Tel Aviv-traded stock
is at the biggest discount to its U.S.  shares (PRGO)  of any dual-listed
Israeli company after the drugmaker snapped a six-day decline in
 New York .  Shares of Perrigo rose 0.9 percent in New York May 24,
widening its premium to the stock traded in  Israel  to $1.77, the
biggest since May 15. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of
U.S.-traded Israeli equities dropped 2.1 percent last week, led
by an 8.6 percent slump in  Allot (ALLT)  Communications Ltd.  Perrigo dropped as much as 2.6 percent since reaching a
record on May 15 and traded at 18.2 times estimated earnings at
the end of last week, or 3.6 percent above its five-year
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock is
“extremely stretched,” Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at Miller
Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote in a May 21 note. The shares fell
for six days in New York before rebounding on May 24, on bets
sales will jump to a record $3.58 billion this year, based on
the mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “People correlate Perrigo as a defensive play,”  Randall Stanicky , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc., who rates the
shares a buy, said by phone from New York May 24. “You’re going
to get first-time fiscal 2014 guidance when they report mid-August, which I think is going to be a strong year.”  The  drugmaker’s sales  will jump 13 percent to $4.03 billion
in 2014, according to the average of 16 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Perrigo reported third-quarter sales of
$919.8 million, an increase of 18 percent from 2012, the biggest
gain in two years, according to a May 7 statement.  ‘Very Sensitive’  Perrigo’s consumer health-care business, which made up 57
percent of its revenue in 2012, will not be strong enough to
drive shares to outperform, according to Jason Gerberry, an
analyst at Leerink Swann & Co.  “This is a stock that trades around the quarters and is
very sensitive to its consumer business,” Gerberry, who has a
hold rating for the shares, said by phone from  Boston  on May 24,
“We expect results to be in line and don’t expect them to be
anything major for the stock.”  Perrigo, which entered  Tel Aviv ’s TA-25 Index after buying
B’nei Brak, Israel-based Agis Industries Ltd. in 2005, advanced
1.5 percent to 439.4 shekels, or $118.88, at 10:04 a.m. in
Israel. Israel’s benchmark gauge gained 0.3 percent to 1,219.51.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index declined 2.1 percent
last week to 91.70.  Orbotech Rallies  Orbotech Ltd. (ORBK) , based in Yavne, Israel, surged 14 percent
last week, the most in four years, to $11.60. The maker of gear
used to test consumer electronics had the biggest gain on the
Israel-US Equity Index.  Allot, a maker of technology used by telecommunications
providers to track wireless traffic, slumped to $12.15, a three-week low. The Hod Hasharon, Israel-based company’s shares in Tel
Aviv this morning dropped 3.2 percent to 45.25 shekels, or
$12.24.  The shekel fell for a third-straight week, retreating 0.8
percent to 3.6962 versus the dollar. The Israeli currency
weakened on investor bets that the central bank will cut
 interest rates  for a second time this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
