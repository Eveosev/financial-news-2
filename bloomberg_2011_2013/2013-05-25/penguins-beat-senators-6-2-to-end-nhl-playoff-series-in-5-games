James Neal scored three goals and the
Pittsburgh Penguins advanced to the National Hockey League’s
Eastern Conference finals with a 6-2 win against the Ottawa
Senators, wrapping up their playoff series in five games.  The Penguins, who won the best-of-seven series by four
games to one, will face either the  Boston Bruins  or the  New York
Rangers  for a spot in the Stanley Cup finals. The Bruins lead
that series 3-1 with Game 5 today in Boston.  “We gave them the respect they deserved and we came out
and I think we surprised ourselves,” Neal said. “We played
with a lot of speed and got it behind them and got to the net.”  Brenden Morrow, Kris Letang and Evgeni Malkin also scored
last night for the Penguins at Consol Energy Center in
Pittsburgh. Milan Michalek and Kyle Turris had the goals for
Ottawa.  “I hope they don’t bill us for the clinic,” said Ottawa
coach Paul MacLean. “But they really showed the step you have
to take to continue to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs.”  In the other game tonight, the  Detroit Red Wings  will try
to eliminate the host Chicago Blackhawks with a victory in Game
5 of their Western Conference series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
