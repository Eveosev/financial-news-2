German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the tally of unemployed youth in Europe has climbed to an
“unimaginable” level that requires urgent action, including
spending trade bloc cash effectively to create jobs.  Addressing a congress of her Christian Democrats in the
city of Muenster, Merkel said Germany is co-leading efforts with
partners to assess how best to spend 6 billion euros ($7.7
billion) in European Union allocations after youth unemployment
grew more than 50 percent in several countries.  “We have to act quickly,” she said. “We’re not a poor
continent and must succeed in making headway.” EU labor
ministers due to meet in Berlin on July 3 won’t discuss an
increase to the 6 billion euros allocated to battle the problem,
Merkel said today.  Youth unemployment -- defined as youngsters below 25
without work -- rose in March to 24 percent in the single
currency area, according to Eurostat. The average masks rates of
56 percent in  Spain  and 38 percent in  Portugal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
