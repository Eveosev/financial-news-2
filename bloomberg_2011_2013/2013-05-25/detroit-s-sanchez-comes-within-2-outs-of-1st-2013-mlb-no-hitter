Anibal Sanchez of the Detroit Tigers
came within two outs of throwing the first no-hitter of the
Major League Baseball season, striking out 12 and settling for a
one-hitter in a 6-0 defeat of the visiting Minnesota Twins.  Joe Mauer  had a line-drive single up the middle with one
out in the ninth inning to end the bid by Sanchez for his second
career no-hitter. Sanchez, 29, threw a no-hitter as a member of
the Florida Marlins against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sept. 6,
2006.  Sanchez’s one-hitter last night came four weeks after he
set a franchise record with 17 strikeouts in a 10-0 victory
against the Atlanta Braves at Detroit’s Comerica Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
