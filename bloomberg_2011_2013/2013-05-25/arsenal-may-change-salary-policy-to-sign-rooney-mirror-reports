Arsenal is ready to change its wage
structure in an effort to sign Manchester United striker  Wayne
Rooney , the Mirror said.  Manager  Arsene Wenger  has more than 70 million pounds ($106
million) available to sign players and the club’s hierarchy will
back him not only in terms of transfers, but also in salaries,
the Mirror said.  Theo Walcott is Arsenal’s highest-paid player at 90,000
pounds per week and the Gunners can push their boundaries to
well beyond 150,000 pounds per week, the newspaper said.  Rooney, 27, is also a target for Paris Saint-Germain,
Monaco and Chelsea, the Mirror said. PSG is ready to give the
England striker around 300,000 pounds a week but it remains to
be seen if he prefers a move to France, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
