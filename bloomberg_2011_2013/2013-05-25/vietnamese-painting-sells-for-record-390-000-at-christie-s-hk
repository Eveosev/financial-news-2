A painting that was initially valued
at just 50 pounds ($75) sold for HK$3.03 million ($390,000) in a
weekend auction by Christie’s International in Hong Kong,
setting a record for a work by a Vietnamese artist.  When the British seller of the 1932 work by Nguyen Phan
Chanh entitled “La Marchande de Riz” (The Rice Seller) took it
to Christie’s in  London , it was mistakenly identified by a
trainee as a Chinese work because the artist signed his name in
Chinese characters.  After it was forwarded to specialists in Asia, they
recognized the painting by the artist’s signature in romanized
characters on the back of the canvas and valued it at between
HK$800,000 and HK$1 million.  “The provenance is impeccable,” Jean-Francois Hubert,
Christie’s senior consultant for Vietnamese art, said in the
salesroom. “It’s in its original frame by Parisian framer Gadin
and it was exhibited in 1934 in Napoli.”  The buyer of the ink and gouache on silk painting, Kong 
Kong-based dealer  Pascal de Sarthe , said he and his wife Sylvie plan
to hang it in their bedroom.  “It’s a very rare piece and the condition is amazing,” de
Sarthe said yesterday at his gallery’s booth in Art Basel Hong
Kong. “You never overpay for a really good piece.”  The previous highest price for a Vietnamese artist at
auction was set in April 2012 when Le Pho’s work sold for HK$2.9
million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in Hong Kong.  Artist Records  Three other artist records were also achieved on May 25.
American-Chinese artist Yun Gee’s “Nudes on Horseback” sold
for HK$11.3 million, “Still Life with Tropical Fruits” by
Singaporean Georgette Chen fetched HK$5.05 million, and a
sculpture by 37-year-old Japanese artist Kohei Nawa went for
HK$2.79 million.  Christie’s Asian 20th-Century and Contemporary Art evening
sale on Saturday raised a total of HK$414.95 million with all
but five of the 50 lots offered sold, most of them well in
excess of their pre-sale estimates. The top lot was an oil by
Chang Yu (1901-1966), bought by an Asian collector for HK$44.67
million.  A painting by Chinese contemporary master Zhang Xiaogang
entitled “Two Comrades with Red Baby” failed to sell when the
highest bid of HK$26 million was below the reserve price. The
painting did not have a presale estimate.  Weekend Total  The spring season’s four sales of Asian 20th Century and
Contemporary Art during the weekend achieved HK$754 million.  The Christie’s sales marathon, which runs through May 29,
started with a wine auction on Saturday totaling HK$48.9
million, led by a top lot containing four six-liter bottles
(methuselahs) of Burgundy winemaker Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
that sold for HK$126,332.  Sotheby’s raised HK$329.3 million in a single-artist sale
of works on paper by modern ink painting master Zhang Daqian
from the Mei Yun Tang collection this evening in Hong Kong.  The top lot, an ink and color hanging scroll titled
“Daoist Goddess Playing Panpipe,” was sold to an Asian buyer
for HK$74 million including fees, four times its high presale
estimate of HK$18 million.  All but one of the 25 works by Zhang belonging to the sold,
the New York-based auction house said in a news release.  Earlier in the day, Sotheby’s sold HK$34.2 million worth of
snuff boxes from the Mary and George Bloch Collection in which
all 170 lots were sold.  Elsewhere in Hong Kong, Bonhams Spring Auction of whiskies,
wine, traditional and modern Chinese paintings, jewelry and
jadeite raised HK$170 million over the weekend.  Taipei-based Ravenel’s jewels, jadeite and modern and
contemporary art sales earned HK$96 million while Beijing-based
Poly Auction sold HK$25.2 million of fine Chinese paintings and
Calligraphy yesterday.  Muse highlights include Farah Nayeri on film,  Rich
Jaroslovsky  on tech, and John Mariani on wine.  To contact the reporter on the story:
