Doug Ford, a Toronto city councilor
and brother of Mayor Rob Ford, said allegations by the Globe and
Mail newspaper that he was a hashish dealer in the 1980s are
untrue.  “That’s a lie. It’s an outright lie,” Doug Ford said
today in an  interview  with the CP24 television channel. “As far
as I’m concerned, that’s irresponsible journalism.”  The  Globe and Mail , citing unidentified sources it
described as drug users and dealers, alleged that Doug Ford was
involved in the activity until he was about 22 years old. The
newspaper, based in Toronto and distributed nationally, said it
uncovered the information during 18 months of reporting on the
Ford family.  The newspaper said it found no evidence that Doug Ford was
ever charged with any illegal acts and didn’t implicate Mayor
Ford.  Today’s story comes after The Toronto Star newspaper
reported that two of its reporters watched a video allegedly
showing Mayor Ford inhaling from a crack cocaine pipe. Bloomberg
News hasn’t seen the video and can’t verify its authenticity.  Mayor Ford, 43, said yesterday that he doesn’t smoke crack
cocaine.  Doug Ford and his lawyer, Gavin Tighe, didn’t respond to
phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. Attempts to reach a
Globe and Mail spokesman were unsuccessful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
