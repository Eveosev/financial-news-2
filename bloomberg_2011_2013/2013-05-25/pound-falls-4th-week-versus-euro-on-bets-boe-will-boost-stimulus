The pound fell for a fourth week
against the euro as reports showing retail sales unexpectedly
declined in April and inflation slowed fueled speculation the
 Bank of England  will expand monetary stimulus.  The U.K. currency dropped for a third week versus the
dollar as minutes of the central bank’s May 8-9 meeting showed
Governor  Mervyn King  voted for a fourth month to expand asset
purchases, though the proposal was defeated 6-3 by the Monetary
Policy Committee. The pound has fallen against all except two of
its 16 major counterparts this year amid the prospect of more
quantitative easing. U.K. government bonds were little changed.  “We’ve had soft growth and inflation data this week,”
said Michael Sneyd, a London-based currency strategist at BNP
Paribas SA. “This lays the path for further easing from the
Bank of England and for the pound to be under pressure. We like
sterling lower.”  The pound dropped 1 percent this week to 85.42 pence at
5:05 p.m. London time yesterday, the biggest decline since the
period ending Feb. 22. Sterling weakened 0.3 percent to $1.5124
after dropping to $1.5014 on May 23, the lowest level since
March 14.  King was joined by David Miles and  Paul Fisher  in seeking
to boost stimulus by 25 billion pounds at this month’s meeting,
according to the minutes published May 22.  Provide Support  Policy makers must continue to provide support to economy
and rebuild confidence, Fisher said yesterday in a speech in
Cardiff, Wales. The MPC next meets on June 5-6.  “We should be doing a slow amount of QE over a period of
time,” Fisher said after an event hosted by the Cardiff
Breakfast Club. “Twenty-five billion pounds over three months is
a slow rate, so that would be what you’d kick off with and then
you would stop when conditions were looking a lot better.”  Annual  consumer-price inflation  slowed to 2.4 percent last
month from 2.8 percent in March, the  Office for National
Statistics  said May 21. Retail sales including fuel declined 1.3
percent from March, the biggest drop in a year, the Office for
National Statistics said the following day.  Sterling has weakened 3 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after the yen among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 5.1 percent and the euro gained 2.6 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed one basis point, or 0.1
percentage point, this week to 1.90 percent. The 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 fell 0.105, or 1.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.755. The yield rose to 1.95 percent on
May 15, the highest since March 15.  The Treasury will sell 1.75 billion pounds of two-year
gilts on May 29 and 2.5 billion pounds of bills on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
