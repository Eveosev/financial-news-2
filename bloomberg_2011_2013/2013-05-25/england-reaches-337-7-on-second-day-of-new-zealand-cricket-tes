Joe Root’s first Test century helped
push  England  to 337-7 at the end of the second day of the second
cricket Test with  New Zealand .  Root, playing on his home ground, Headingley in Leeds, hit
104 from 167 balls before being caught off the bowling of Trent
Boult, who took 3-48.  Matt Prior, on 38, and Graeme Swann, on 21, were batting at
the end of the day.  Rain wiped out play on the opening day yesterday with no
balls being bowled. England leads the two-match series 1-0
following its 170-run win at Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
