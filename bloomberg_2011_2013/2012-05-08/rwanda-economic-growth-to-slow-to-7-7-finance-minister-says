Rwanda ’s economic growth will decline
to 7.7 percent this year from 8.6 percent last year as a
slowdown in Europe curbs tourism and falling commodity prices
reduce revenue, Finance Minister John Rwangombwa said.  Tourism is the largest source of foreign currency for the
East African nation, accounting for about $200 million each
year, Rwangombwa said in an interview yesterday in  Addis Ababa ,
Ethiopia, where he is attending the World Economic  Forum  on
 Africa . The UBS Bloomberg index of commodities that tracks
prices of everything from metals to crops declined 10 percent in
the past year. Arabica coffee has dropped 34 percent.  “It is mainly about world economic shocks and how tourism
will be affected,” he said. “Commodity prices are affecting
our exports.”  Rwanda, which went through a genocide that left 800,000
people dead in 1994, is aiming to draw more foreign direct
investment as it seeks to reduce its dependence on commodity
exports. The economy of the exporter of coffee and tea has
expanded an average of 8.4 percent annually in the five-year
period that ended in 2011, according to the  United Nations .  The central bank has room to leave  interest rates  on hold
as the inflation rate should stay below 10 percent this year,
Rwangombwa said. Inflation accelerated to 8.2 percent in March
from 7.9 percent in February.  The Bank of Rwanda raised its key lending rate by 50 basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 7.5 percent on May 4. It was
the first increase in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
