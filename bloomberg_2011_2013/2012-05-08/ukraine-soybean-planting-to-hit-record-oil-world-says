(Corrects production year in first paragraph of story
originally published May 8.)  Soybean planting in  Ukraine  is
forecast to climb to a record in 2012 and production of the
oilseed is expected to rise in coming years, Oil World said.  Ukrainian farmers may plant 1.3 million to 1.35 million
hectares (3.21 million to 3.34 million acres) of soybeans this
year from 1.13 million hectares in 2011, the Hamburg-based
oilseed researcher said today in a report.  Soybean planting in Ukraine has risen in eight of the past
10 years, surging 15-fold, data from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture show. Farmers had planted 650,000 hectares until May
3 for harvesting this year, Oil World said.  “Soybean production is likely to grow further this year
and in subsequent years,” Oil World wrote.  Planting of sunflowers was completed on 2.5 million
hectares in Ukraine until May 3, from 2.1 million hectares at
the same time a year earlier. In  Russia , farmers had planted 1.3
million hectares of sunflowers, compared with 1 million hectares
in 2011, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
