Kuwait  resumed imports of liquefied
natural gas from April 1 and is receiving about 400 million
standard cubic feet a day of the fuel, Kuwait Petroleum Corp.â€™s
deputy managing director for marketing operations said.  The Persian Gulf state is importing the equivalent of five
LNG cargoes monthly and expects this to rise to seven shipments
a month to meet summer demand, Jamal Al-Loughani said today in
Bahrain. Kuwait plans to receive 40 to 45 deliveries of LNG from
April to October, he said at the Middle East Petroleum and Gas
Conference.  Kuwait signed four-year LNG supply contracts with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Vitol Group in 2010. The Persian Gulf
country began importing the chilled gas in 2009 to run
generators during the summer months, when power demand is
highest.  The LNG regasification vessel Exquisite has been off Kuwait
since April, according to shipping data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Galicia Spirit is headed toward Kuwait after a stop in
Damietta,  Egypt , where the North African country produces LNG.
The LNG tanker Seri Balhaf arrived in Kuwait earlier this month
after visiting the Melkoeya plant in Norway, where  Statoil ASA (STL) 
sends gas from Snohvit for liquefaction.  Kuwait is evaluating the possible construction of a
permanent facility to process LNG imports and will probably need
the terminal by 2017, Al-Loughani said. The fixed facility may
process as much as 400 million cubic feet a day, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
