Ford Motor Co. (F)  said it will boost
production by about 40,000 vehicles by idling 13 plants for one
week only instead of two as part of the company’s annual summer
shutdown.  The decision affects six vehicle-assembly plants and seven
engine and stamping factories, Ford said in a statement. The
additional output from the shorter shutdown is part of the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker’s plan to boost annual
production by 400,000 vehicles, Ford said.  “We are working most of our North American plants at
maximum capacity and we are adding production shifts in three of
our assembly plants this month alone,” Jim Tetreault, Ford’s
vice president of North American manufacturing, said in the
statement. “Requiring more capacity from our plants is a good
problem to have.”  Ford is the second U.S. automaker to curtail its
traditional summer shutdown. Chrysler Group LLC, based in  Auburn
Hills ,  Michigan , said May 2 that four North American plants
would skip their entire two-week summer shutdown to meet
increased demand.  Ford’s U.S. sales rose 4.8 percent in the first four months
of the year to 717,480 cars and light trucks, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. Deliveries of Chrysler, majority owned
by  Fiat SpA (F) , climbed 33 percent in the first four months of this
year to 539,216, according to Autodata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
