Kayak Software Corp., the online-
travel company that’s planning an initial public offering,
reported a profit for the quarter ended in March amid rising
demand for trip-planning information over the Web.  Net income was $4.15 million, or 11 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $6.91 million, or $1.33, in the same period the
previous year, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said today
in a U.S. regulatory  filing . Revenue rose 39 percent to $73.3
million.  Kayak is benefiting as consumers turn to the Internet for
deals on flights and hotels. The company had 310 million user
queries, up 45 percent from the same period a year earlier.
Kayak had 3 million mobile applications downloaded in the
quarter, up 43 percent.  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Stephen
Hafner received total compensation of $950,000 last year, down
from $1.62 million in 2010. His salary was unchanged at
$300,000, while last year’s package included a $650,000 bonus
and the 2010 payout was increased by a $1.32 million options
award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
