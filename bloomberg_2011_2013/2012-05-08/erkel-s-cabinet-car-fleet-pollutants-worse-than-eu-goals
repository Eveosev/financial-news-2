The car fleet of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s cabinet emits more carbon dioxide than recommended by
the European Union, according to a new study by the
environmental group  Deutsche Umwelthilfe .  None of the vehicles of the 10 ministers surveyed -- seven
Audi and three  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  cars with  diesel
engines  -- made the EU target of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer
or less for new cars, the Berlin-based group said. On average,
calculations show each car emitted 174 grams of pollutants,
ranging from 149 grams to 183 grams.  “While emissions of politicians’ cars won’t be the straw
that breaks the camel’s back, it’s about being a role model,”
Gerd Rosenkranz, Umwelthilfe’s policy head, said today at a news
conference in Berlin.  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest car market and its largest
carbon-dioxide emitter, seeks to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions
40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. Merkel shut eight of the
country’s 17 nuclear reactors last year and wants to run its
economy largely on renewable energy sources by 2050.  The Umwelthilfe also surveyed 159 governors and ministers
in Germany’s 16 federal states. Five were awarded a “green
card” for a car that made the EU target while 20 got “red
cards” for exceeding the target by 50 percent or more.  Emissions fell overall as Merkel’s Cabinet and 12 of 16
state car fleets lowered their CO2 output compared with the
previous year, the Unwelthilfe group said.  Audi, BMW  Winfried Kretschmann, the Green Party state governor in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to  Daimler AG (DAI) , drives a Mercedes-Benz
S340 that emits 195 grams of CO2, about 40 percent less than his
predecessor, Stefan Mappus of Merkel’s conservatives.  The biggest CO2 emitter in the list at 324 grams is a 450-
horsepower Audi A8 by North Rhine-Westphalia Interior Minister
Ralf Jaeger. That’s more than twice that of the most efficient
vehicle, a 184-horsepower BMW 520d by Hamburg Interior Minister
Michael Neumann that emits 123 grams of CO2.  The cars of Merkel, Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  and
Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere weren’t included because
they’re custom-made to meet higher security requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
