MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said its bank received two subpoenas from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development over federally
insured loans.  The subpoenas, from HUDâ€™s Office of the Inspector General,
were sent in April and May and involved loans insured by the
Federal Housing Administration, the New York-based firm said
today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
