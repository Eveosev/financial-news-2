Coffee consumption in  Germany , the
world’s third-biggest and Europe’s largest user, may rise by 9.2
percent by 2019, according to Tchibo GmbH.  Demand will be 640,320 metric tons by 2019, up from 586,320
tons last year, the Hamburg-based coffee roaster said in a
statement e-mailed today. The U.S. is the world’s biggest coffee
user followed by Brazil and Germany, according to the
International Coffee Organization in London.  Germany’s per capita coffee consumption was 153.4 liters
(40.5 gallons) in 2010, beating water and beer, the company
said. Table and spring water consumption in 2010 totaled 135.7
liters, and beer came to 107.4 liters, Tchibo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
