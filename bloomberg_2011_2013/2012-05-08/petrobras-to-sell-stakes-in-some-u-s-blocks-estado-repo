Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will sell
stakes in some of the 175 blocks it holds in the U.S., Orlando
Azevedo, head of the company’s U.S. unit, told  O Estado de S.
Paulo  in an interview.  Azevedo didn’t give a time frame or an estimate of how much
state-controlled Petrobras, as the company is known, plans to
raise with the sale, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  The sale is part of Petrobras’s plan to raise $13.6 billion
from asset sales and cost cuts, Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
