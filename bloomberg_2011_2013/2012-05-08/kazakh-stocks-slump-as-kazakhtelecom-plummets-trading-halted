Kazakhstan’s main share index headed
for its biggest decline in nine months as trading was halted in
Kazakhtelecom, which plunged 31 percent before it announced it
will pay almost a third of its net income as dividends.  The  Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KZKAK)  Index KASE fell 5.5 percent
to 1,144.72 by 2:56 p.m. in Almaty, the most since August on a
closing basis. Kazakhtelecom slumped to 20,000 tenge, leading to
a halt in trading, according to a statement on the exchange’s
website.  “The drop in Kazakhtelecom is due to the potential closure
of the register for acceptance of dividends on May 8,” Evgeniy
Popov, head of asset management at Troika Dialog Kazakhstan,
said by e-mail.  The company will pay 1,328.80 tenge per ordinary share as a
dividend for 2011, according to a statement posted on the
company’s website following a shareholder meeting today. This
amount translates into 30 percent of net income in 2011,
compared with 17.5 percent of profit in the previous year. The
total dividend earmarked for ordinary shareholders is 14.5
billion tenge and that for preferred is 535.8 million tenge,
according to the company.  The dividend payment date is to be decided over the next 20
days, the company said in the statement, adding the list of
eligible shareholders was determined today.  Index Weight  The telecom company accounts for a 10 percent weighting in
the country’s benchmark index. Stock exchange rules prohibit
trading in shares that have fallen 30 percent or more in a
session, according to the statement.  “On our estimate of 20% corporate tax, the company earned
almost $864 million from the sale of the Kcell stake, which had
a book value of $440 million,” Alexander Kazbegi, an analyst at
 Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed report on April 27
after the company recommended a dividend. “This supported the
higher total dividend amount.”  Kazbegi said he previously thought the proceeds from KCB
stake sale would be used to finance KazakhTelecom’s capex plans,
“although the higher payout instead seems very positive to
us”.  Kazakhtelecom sold a 49 percent stake in Kcell in December
2011 for $1.52 billion to Sonera Holdings B.V.,  a subsidiary of
TeliaSonera AB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
