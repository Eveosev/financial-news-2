Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a four-day
decline on speculation the central bank will tolerate faster
gains to stem inflation. Government bonds traded near the lowest
level in almost two months.  Consumer prices  on the island increased 1.44 percent last
month from a year earlier, following a revised 1.25 percent
advance in March, statistics bureau data showed yesterday.
Global funds sold $625 million more Taiwanese stocks than they
bought yesterday, the biggest net sell-off since September,
after French voters elected Socialist leader Francois Hollande
president, fueling concern the region’s debt crisis will worsen.
They cut holdings by $169 million today.  “The central bank may allow gains in the  Taiwan dollar  to
fight imported inflation,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “People will prefer
safer assets like  government bonds  if they see more
uncertainties in  Europe .”  Taiwan’s dollar closed at NT$29.370 against its U.S.
counterpart from NT$29.382 yesterday, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings traders use to price options, dropped 30 basis points to
4.20 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.972
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 0.967
percent yesterday, the lowest level for benchmark five-year
rates since March 13.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.513 percent
yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
