The fossilized remains of a crocodile
that measured longer than 27 feet and lived 2 million to 4
million years ago has been found in  Kenya .  While the animal resembles the current Nile crocodile, it
displays a different skull and jaw, suggesting it isn’t directly
related, said a report on the discovery published in the  Journal
of Vertebrate Paleontology.  The crocodile lived side-by-side
with humans, who at the time were about 4-feet tall, the
report's author said in a statement.  “It lived alongside our ancestors, and it probably ate
them,” said  Christopher Brochu , an associate professor of
geoscience at the University of  Iowa  and a study author. “We
don’t actually have fossil human remains with croc bites, but
the crocs were bigger than today’s crocodiles, and we were
smaller, so there probably wasn’t much biting involved.”  Today’s crocodiles can grow to about 16 feet, according to
 National Geographic . The largest recorded Nile crocodile was 21
feet, Brochu said in a  statement . The differences in appearance
and size between the two suggest today’s crocodile developed
later as an independent species than many think.  Today’s finding indicates that our modern reptile isn’t a
“living fossil,” as some scientists have suggested.  “We really don’t know where the Nile crocodile came from,
but it only appears after some of these prehistoric giants died
out,” Brochu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
