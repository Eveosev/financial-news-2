Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures rose from a record low as faster inflation eased
speculation the central bank would cut the benchmark lending
rate to below 8 percent.  The yield on the contract due in January 2014 increased for
the first time in five days, rising 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 8.38 percent. The yield has dropped 210
basis points this year. The real slid 1.1 percent to 1.9402 per
 U.S. dollar  after touching 1.9426, the weakest level since Sept.
22.  “Some prices are accelerating as an effect of the real’s
depreciation,” Thiago Carlos, an economist at Link SA CCTVM,
said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  Wholesale, consumer and construction  prices  rose 1.02
percent in April from a month earlier, compared with an increase
of 0.56 in March, according to the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s
IGP-DI Index. The median forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.88 percent gain.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index probably rose
0.59 percent in April, from 0.21 percent the previous month,
according to the median estimate of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The figures will be released at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow in
 Sao Paulo .  The yield on the January 2014 contract touched a record low
8.15 percent yesterday after Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  announced changes in savings-account rules last week to
facilitate further cuts in borrowing costs.  Savings-Account Returns  Savings-accounts  returns will be limited to 70 percent of
the benchmark lending rate if it falls to 8.5 percent or lower,
plus a fluctuating Reference Rate. Required minimum returns on
savings accounts had spurred concern further reductions in
borrowing costs by the central bank would drive investors out of
 government bonds  and into  bank deposits .  Policy makers cut the benchmark rate by 75 basis points to
9 percent on April 18 to revive growth that slowed to 2.7
percent last year from 7.5 percent in 2010.  Brazil  has lowered
its target rate 350 basis points since August.  The real extended its 2012 decline to 3.8 percent, the
worst performance among the most-traded Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It fell along with most
emerging-market currencies today as Greek leaders struggled to
form a government after inconclusive elections over the weekend.  “There’s still a lot of caution abroad, especially in
Europe,” Jose Carlos Amado, a foreign-exchange trader at
Renascenca DTVM Ltda., said by phone from Sao Paulo. “Investors
have sold the dollar a little, but the market is supporting a
level above 1.90.”  Weaker Real  The real has traded weaker than 1.90 since April 30 as
central bank interventions to debase the currency to aid
manufacturers coincided with concern political instability in
 Europe  will further weigh on global growth.  The central bank has bought $7.2 billion in the  spot market 
from April 1 through April 27, the most since $8.4 billion
purchased in March 2011 to help exporters by weakening the real.  Brazil’s real remains overvalued after an 11 percent plunge
in the past three months, according to Paulo Skaf, president of
the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries. A real weaker than 2 per
U.S. dollar would be “healthy,” Skaf told reporters today in
Sao Paulo. The real last traded at that level in July 2009.  “The real was and still is overvalued,” Skaf said. “So
this little adjustment has been a positive thing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
