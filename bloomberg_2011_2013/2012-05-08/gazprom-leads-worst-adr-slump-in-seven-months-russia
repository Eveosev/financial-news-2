OAO  Gazprom (OGZPY)  and  OAO Mechel (MTL)  fell,
pushing an index of Russian stocks in New York to the longest
run of declines in seven months, as concern the European debt
crisis will deepen cut demand for commodities.  Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest company and the world’s largest
natural gas producer, retreated the most in 2012 while  Mechel (MTLR) ,

palladium, got almost 50 percent of budget revenue from oil and
gas sales last year. Russian markets are closed for national
holiday today.  “There is a concern over global growth and  Europe  may be
heating up again,”  Alec Young , a global equity strategist at
S&P Capital IQ, said by phone from New York yesterday. “We may
revisit the entire Greek bailout process. Those concerns have
negative impact on commodities, which have so much weight in
Russia.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 0.7 percent, the most since Jan.
9, to $27.33 in the U.S. yesterday, trimming this year’s advance

to 10.1 times estimated earnings, 30 percent more than the
multiple for its competitor VimpelCom Ltd,  Alfa Bank  said.  MTS, VimpelCom  “MTS has been overpriced for quite some time and it is
still expensive compared with VimpelCom,” Iouli Matevossov, a
senior analyst in Moscow at Alfa Bank, said by phone from
Moscow.  VimpelCom (VIP) , which became the world’s sixth-largest wireless
operator by subscribers last year after merging with Italy’s
Wind Telecom SpA, dropped 1.3 percent to $9.59 in New York
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 4.  Investors also sold shares of MTS in preparation for OAO
MegaFon’s initial public offering, Matevossov said.  Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , who owns 50 percent
stake in MegaFon, the country’s second-biggest cell phone
company, said in an April 27 interview with Rossiya-24 state
television that the company should prepare for an IPO as soon as
possible.  “Megafon’s planned IPO is bad news for MTS, because the
two companies compete for the same investors’ money,” said
Matevossov, who recommends investors buy VimpelCom shares and
hold MTS stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
