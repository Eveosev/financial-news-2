The  New York  Rangers defeated the
Washington Capitals 3-2 in overtime to lead their National
Hockey League playoff series by three games to two.  Anton Stralman gave New York the lead midway through the
first period at Madison Square Garden in New York. Brooks Laich
tied it eight minutes, 15 seconds into the second period and
John Carlson put the Capitals ahead on a power play 4:20 into
the third.  Washingtonâ€™s Joel Ward was given a four-minute penalty for
a high stick with 22 seconds remaining. New York, who pulled
goaltender Henrik Lundqvist as they sought the tying goal,
forced overtime with eight seconds remaining as  Brad Richards 
slid the puck under Capitals keeper Braden Holtby.  Marc Staal sealed the win for the Rangers on a power play
1:35 into overtime.  The teams return to  Washington  for Game 6 in the best-of-
seven series on May 9. A decider, if needed, will be played
three days later in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
