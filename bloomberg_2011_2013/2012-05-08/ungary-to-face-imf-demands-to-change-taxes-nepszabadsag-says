Hungary will face demands from the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Commission to
change its “flat” income tax system in return for aid,
 Nepszabadsag  reported, citing an unidentified government member.  The international lenders will be “determined” in asking
for the tax amendments and will also request for a ban to be
lifted on building shopping malls and a cut in subsidies for
public transport in Budapest, Nepszabadsag said.  Hungary will probably pass amendments to central bank
legislation by May 21 or May 29 which may allow the Cabinet to
begin aid talks with the IMF as early as the first week of June,
Nepszabadsag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
