Pakistan’s president Asif Ali Zardari,
signed into law yesterday a bill to demutualize the nation’s
stock exchanges, a move aimed at bringing the bourses in line
with international peers.  Lawmakers approved the stock exchange corporatization,
demutualization and integration law on March 27. Approval of the
bill requires the nation’s three stock exchanges to be converted
into companies.  The main  Karachi Stock Exchange , home to companies
including  Oil & Gas Development Co. (OGDC)  and  Pakistan
Telecommunications Co. (PTC) , follows bourses from  India  to  Malaysia 
in demutualization. Under a reform plan started in 1997,
management independent of the government automated trading and
risk-management systems were introduced at the exchange.  The law allows the Karachi,  Islamabad  and  Lahore  stock
exchanges to convert themselves into for-profit entities owned
by shareholders from non-profit, mutually owned organizations.  “It will be a step forward in every way,” said Shahrukh Naqvi, head of equity sales at Invest Capital Markets Ltd. in
Karachi. “It will improve confidence among retail investors,
provide better price discovery and turn the market into a real
source of capital for companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
