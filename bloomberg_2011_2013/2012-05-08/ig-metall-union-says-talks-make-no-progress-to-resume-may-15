Germany ’s IG Metall union said no
progress had been made in talks with employers in the electrical
and metal industries in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the
union said in an e-mailed statement.  The talks will resume on May 15, before which a commission
of experts will devise proposals to find a solution to the wage
dispute, both the union and employers association Suedwestmetall
said in statements.  Suedwestmetall said it made a “fair offer” in the latest
round of talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
