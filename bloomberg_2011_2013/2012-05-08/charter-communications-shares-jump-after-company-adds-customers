Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable provider, jumped the most in more than
six months after reporting an increase in customers.  Customer relationships rose 99,000 in the first quarter,
Charter said today. The St. Louis-based company added 141,000
residential Internet customers and 20,000 video customers. That
compares with a loss of 24,000 video subscribers a year earlier.  Charter will continue to promote its “superior”  Internet
service  and improve its video offerings throughout its
territories in 25 U.S. states,  Tom Rutledge  said during his
first conference call as chief executive officer. Rutledge took
over as Charter’s CEO this year after leaving his job as
Cablevision Systems Corp.’s chief operating officer in December.  “It’ll be a superior product to satellite, a superior
product to U-verse,” Rutledge said. Charter, which emerged from
bankruptcy in 2009, competes with DirecTV, Dish Network Corp.
and AT&T Inc.’s U-verse to provide voice, video and data
services.  The shares rose 5.1 percent to $64.97, the biggest one-day
gain since Nov. 3. The stock has added 14 percent this year.  The advance may indicate investors are covering their short
positions after a “great” subscriber performance, said Rich Tullo, an analyst at Albert Fried & Co. in  New York . Tullo
estimated Charter would add 40,000 customer relationships and
45,000 Internet customers for the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
