Equity trading on  Deutsche Boerse  AG’s
Xetra system started about 80 minutes late today after a
technical fault.  Trading began at about 10:20 a.m. in Frankfurt today. The
exchange, which was blocked from buying NYSE Euronext by
European regulators in February, didn’t specify the cause of the
glitch in statements on its website today.  German stocks dropped for the fifth time in six days today
as Antonis Samaras, the leader of  Greece ’s biggest political
party, failed to form an agreement on a forming a government
after the May 6 elections. The benchmark DAX Index slid 0.6
percent to 6,530.92 at 10:41 a.m. in Frankfurt.  A Xetra malfunction halted trading on July 22. A week
later,  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  suffered its fifth breakdown in six weeks
when its equity indexes in  Europe  failed to update for almost
two hours.  In August, a glitch that halted derivatives trading on NYSE
Euronext’s Liffe system during Europe’s worst selloff in 15
months highlighted antitrust regulators’ concerns that the
proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse may reduce competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
