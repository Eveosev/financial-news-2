Kuwaiti Oil Minister Hani Hussein
referred a report on an agreement signed between Kuwait Oil Co.
and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to the Public Prosecution,  Al-Rai 
reported, citing the minister.  Former oil minister Mohammad al-Busairy formed a committee
in August to look into procedures leading up to the service
agreement signed in February 2010 to develop natural-gas fields
in the countryâ€™s north.  Al-Busairy formed the committee after lawmakers raised
questions about the contract award to Shell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
