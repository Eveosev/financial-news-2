Kenya ’s shilling weakened as the
central bank refrained from selling  repurchase agreements  and
concern deepened  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen, curbing
investor appetite for riskier assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated 0.2
percent to close at 83.33 per dollar after trading 0.3 percent
down at 83.40 earlier in the day, in Nairobi.  Emerging-market stocks fell for a fourth day, oil and metals
prices declined and the euro weakened. Greece’s New Democracy
leader Antonis Samaras said he failed to form a coalition
government following the weekend election, while French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy , German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
preferred partner for enforcing debt reductions, was defeated by
Socialist Francois Hollande.  “The shilling is trading within a narrow band as global
exit from risky assets after the election results in Greece and
France raised new concerns about the euro zone economy,” NIC
Kenya Ltd., a Nairobi-based bank, said in a note to clients
today. The elections “cast doubt on the political will and
commitment to austerity plans regarded as key to tackling the
euro zone debt crisis,” the bank said.  The central bank stayed out of the money market, an official
in the bank’s money market department who asked not to be
identified citing policy, said in a phone interview.  The average  interbank rate  decreased to 15.74 percent last
week, from 19.31 percent the previous week, the central bank
said May 4.  The Ugandan shilling gained for the first time in three days,
appreciating 0.2 percent to 2,475 versus the dollar, while
Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a second day, slipping less
than 0.1 percent to close at 1,590 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
