Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the
debt agency is the only borrower left in  Spain  that can finance
itself on markets as banks, companies and regional
administrations have been shut out.  “Today, the Treasury is practically the only one that
finances itself on the markets,” he said in the Senate in
Madrid today. Being locked out of debt markets isn’t
“theoretical” as it’s “happening to the immense majority of
regions, our whole financial sector and most big companies.”  Rajoy once again raised the threat of an international
bailout as he seeks to convince Spaniards to accept spending
cuts even as unemployment approaches 25 percent. His comments
also underline the challenge the government faces as it tries to
overhaul the banking industry without overburdening public
finances.  Rajoy, in power since December, declined to answer a
question from reporters as he left the Senate on how much public
money may be needed to shore up Bankia, the lender with the
biggest Spanish asset base and 38 billion euros ($49 billion) of
real-estate assets.  Alfonso Alonso, the head of Rajoy’s People’s Party in
Parliament, said today it seems “obvious” that Bankia will
need help cleaning up its balance sheet after the  Economy
Ministry  said it aimed to restructure the lender.  Rodrigo Rato 
said yesterday he was standing aside as chairman of the group
and proposed Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, former chief operating
officer of  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya SA (BBVA) , as executive chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
