Former  Australia  striker John Aloisi
was hired as head coach of the Melbourne Heart A-League soccer
club for the next three seasons.  Aloisi, 36, replaces John van ’t Schip, who stepped down
after leading the team through its first two seasons in
Australia’s elite soccer competition. Van ’t Schip is joining
Mexican club Guadalajara, where he’ll work with fellow Dutchman
Johan Cruijff.  “John van ‘t Schip has set a platform for this club and
also for myself,’’ Aloisi, who coached the Heart’s youth team
last season after retiring as a player, said at a televised news
conference. ‘‘That’s another reason why I’m not too nervous
about taking the role so soon. He’s set it up nicely for
everyone here.”  Aloisi, who scored 27 goals in 55 games for the Socceroos,
is the only Australian to have played in the English Premier
League, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
