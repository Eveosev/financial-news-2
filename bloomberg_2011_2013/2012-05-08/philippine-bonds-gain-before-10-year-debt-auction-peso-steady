Philippine bonds advanced on
speculation the government won’t allow borrowing costs to rise
at an auction of 10-year debt today. The peso was steady.  The government last sold securities due 2022 at an average
yield of 5.159 percent in March. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is
unlikely to change its monetary-policy stance soon, Governor
Amando Tetangco said yesterday. The central bank held its
benchmark rate at a record-low 4 percent in April after two cuts
earlier this year.  “There are expectations the government will not accept
higher bids, which would signal they’re comfortable with their
current cash position,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income
trader who helps manage the equivalent of $16 billion at BPI
Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “There would be room for
yields to go down.”  The yield on the 5.75 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.40 percent as of
10:57 a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The peso was little changed at 42.335 per dollar, prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
