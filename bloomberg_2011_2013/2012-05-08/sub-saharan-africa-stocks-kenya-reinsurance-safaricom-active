Ltd., said by phone today.  Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE)  , the state-owned

improved on high occupancy levels and sales by the state-run

based NIC Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , Kenya’s biggest mobile-phone
company, fell for the first time in seven sessions, dropping 4.3

index, which shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during
a specified time period, reached 72.7 yesterday, the highest in
more than three months. A reading of 70 or above signals to some
