Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11) , the Brazilian
bank buying Chile’s Celfin Capital SA, said it’s open to other
acquisitions as part of a plan to create an investment banking
“giant” in  Latin America .  BTG Pactual could increase its presence in Colombia and
will have a “strong” presence in Mexico soon, Chief Executive
Officer Andre Esteves told reporters in Santiago today. There
are concrete acquisition opportunities in the region, he said,
without elaborating.  BTG said in February it agreed to buy Chilean brokerage
Celfin Capital SA for $245 million in cash and 2.4 percent of
BTG equity. The deal was at least the fifth the company
announced since October, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BTG will continue to grow organically in London,  New York 
and Hong Kong, Esteves said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
