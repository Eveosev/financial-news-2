Soybeans dropped the most since
January on concern that an intensifying  European debt crisis 
will slow global economic growth, curbing investment demand for
commodities as a hedge against inflation.  The dollar extended its longest rally against the euro
since 2008 as  Greece  faced the prospect of becoming the first
developing nation to default on its debt. The prospect of
slowing demand cooled soybean prices that reached a 45-month
high last week as  hedge funds  made their largest  bet  on a rally
in prices since at least June 2006, government data show.  “The European debt crisis encouraged the funds to cut
their long positions,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst for
Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin,
said in a telephone interview. “People are nervous about demand
after the rally.”  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 1.9 percent to close
at $14.3775 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the largest decline since Jan. 30. On May 2, the most-active
futures touched $15.125, the highest since July 2008.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, valued at $38.9
billion in 2010, behind corn, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
