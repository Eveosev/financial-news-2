Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , a Serbian
oil company controlled by Russia’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said
Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, the former chief of  Austria ’s  OMV AG (OMV) ,
has joined its management board as an independent member.  He will help with the development of corporate management
and also “ensure greater transparency in the work of executive
bodies,” the Belgrade-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. Ruttenstorfer served as Austria’s deputy finance 
minister from 1997 to 1999 and led OMV from 2002 until March 
last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
