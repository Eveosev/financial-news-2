A unit of Ingenious Media Holdings
Plc, an investor that  backed films  including “X-Men” and
“Avatar,” raised more than 10 million pounds ($16 million) to
invest in U.K. energy-efficiency companies.  The Ingenious Clean Energy fund will target businesses that
provide energy-saving equipment to commercial and industrial
properties such as hotels, schools and hospitals, London-based
Ingenious said today in an e-mailed statement. The fund is an
Enterprise Investment Scheme, a U.K. government-backed system
that offers tax breaks to investors in higher-risk companies.  The U.K. is promoting efficiency measures as it seeks to
curb dependence on fossil fuels and reduce polluting emissions.
Its Green Deal program allows households to pay for home
improvements through savings on energy bills, while the planned
Green Investment Bank will also fund energy savings in business.  The fund has a “strong pipeline” of potential projects,
according to the statement, and Ingenious is working with
adviser Sustainable Development Capital LLP. It plans to start a
second energy efficiency fund and a clean energy fund
“shortly.”  Britain is working toward a European Union goal of getting
15 percent of its energy from clean sources by 2020. It’s also
planning to cut emissions 34 percent from 1990 levels by that
time, through renewables projects and efficiency improvements.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
