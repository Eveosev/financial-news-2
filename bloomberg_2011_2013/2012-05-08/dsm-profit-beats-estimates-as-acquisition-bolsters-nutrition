Royal DSM NV (DSM) , the world’s largest
maker of vitamins, reported first-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates as the acquisition of baby-food ingredient
maker Martek Biosciences countered rising raw-material costs.  Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and
depreciation from continuing operations declined 6 percent to
306 million euros ($398 million), the Heerlen, the Netherlands-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts predicted 294
million euros, on average. Sales increased 3 percent to 2.29
billion euros.  “We remain cautiously optimistic for 2012 despite the
uncertain macroeconomic situation,” Chief Executive Officer
Feike Sijbesma said in the statement today.  Sijbesma has transformed the company into a maker of
biofuels, specialty plastics and nutritional supplements by
making acquisitions and selling commodity chemical businesses.
Last week, DSM agreed to buy U.S. -based  Kensey Nash (KNSY)  to drive
expansion in the market for medical devices made from proteins
and synthetic polymers. That follows a cellulosic ethanol
venture with Poet LLC in January.  The company said it is on track to achieve its 2013 target
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
of 1.4 billion euros to 1.6 billion euros.  DSM reported a slowdown at its polymer-intermediates
division in the first quarter amid a faltering construction
industry and weaker prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
