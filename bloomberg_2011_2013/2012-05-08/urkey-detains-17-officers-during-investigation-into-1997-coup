Turkish prosecutors have held 17
retired and active military officers in connection with an
investigation of the so-called postmodern coup of 1997, when the
armed forces ousted an Islamist-led coalition government.  Authorities carried out raids across the country to detain
six serving and 11 former military members, according to the
special prosecutorsâ€™ office cited by the state-run Anatolia news
agency. Those arrested are being questioned in Ankara today, the
report said.  The operation is the fourth in a series that started on
April 12. More than 50 officers have been placed under
surveillance as a result of the probe and about 30 of them have
been arrested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
