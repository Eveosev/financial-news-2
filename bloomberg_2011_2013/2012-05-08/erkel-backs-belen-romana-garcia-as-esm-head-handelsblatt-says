Angela Merkel  is backing Spain’s Belen Romana Garcia to head the European Stability Mechanism when it
replaces the European Financial Stability Facility in July,
Handelsblatt reported in a preview of an article to be published
tomorrow, citing unidentified European Union diplomats in
Brussels.  The appointment of a Spaniard to the post would mean that
Spain would give up its seat on the European Central Bank
executive council, freeing the way for the head of Luxembourg’s
central bank, Yves Mersch, to take up the position, the
newspaper said.  Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is almost
certain to replace Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
as head of the group of euro finance ministers, Handelsblatt
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
