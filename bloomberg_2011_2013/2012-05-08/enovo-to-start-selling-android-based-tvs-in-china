Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of personal computers, said it will begin sales of
so-called smart televisions that can access the Internet in nine
Chinese cities this month.  Lenovo’s K-Series comes in four models with 42- or 55-inch
screens, and use  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android 4.0 operating system with
Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon dual-core processors, the Beijing-
based company said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing is stepping up
development of televisions, smartphones and tablets, to
challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  TV makers
including Samsung and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  are introducing
interactive features including voice-command searching for shows
and Web-based applications to lure buyers.  “As Lenovo continues to strengthen its position in the PC
industry, we are also further expanding into the field of
Internet devices,” Yang said at a briefing in Beijing today.
“The PC-plus era is a great opportunity.”  Apple may also be looking to the TV market to maintain its
growth. The company already sells Apple TV, a $99 streaming-
video set-top box. In his best-selling biography of Apple co-
founder  Steve Jobs , Walter Isaacson quoted him saying he had
“finally cracked” the challenge of creating “an integrated
television set that is completely easy to use.”  Lenovo will offer its TV products in cities including
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, the company said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
