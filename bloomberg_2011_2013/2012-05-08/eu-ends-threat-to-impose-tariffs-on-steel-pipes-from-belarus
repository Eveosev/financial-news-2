The European Union dropped a threat to
impose tariffs on steel pipes from Belarus after EU producers
withdrew a complaint alleging price undercutting.  The EU closed an investigation into whether Belarusian
exporters of iron or steel seamless pipes and tubes sell them in
the 27-nation bloc below cost, a practice known as dumping. The
inquiry excluded stainless-steel pipes and tubes.  A producer group called the Defence Committee of the
Seamless Steel Tubes Industry of the European Union withdrew its
dumping complaint on Jan. 26, the European Commission, the EUâ€™s
trade authority in Brussels, said today in the  Official Journal .  The commission opened the probe in  June 2011 . Such
investigations can last as long as 15 months and can lead the EU
to impose anti-dumping duties for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
