Chile ’s peso fell the most in two
weeks after the price of copper, the nation’s biggest export,
plunged as the dollar strengthened on concern Europe’s austerity
drive may falter.  “The dollar will probably appreciate against the peso in
coming months,” said Matias  Madrid , chief economist at Banco
Penta in Santiago. “Turmoil in Europe has an impact and will
have an impact. Industrial production and export numbers already
show slowing growth.”  The peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 484.8 per dollar at
10:14 a.m. in Santiago after earlier falling 0.6 percent, the
most since April 23. Copper for July delivery fell as much as
2.8 percent to $3.667.  A stronger U.S. currency saps demand for the metal, which
makes up more than half of Chile’s exports, undermining the
peso. Prospects for slower growth in  Europe  may hurt Chile’s
export-led economy. The dollar rose against the euro for a
seventh day after the mandate to form a Greek government went to
a party that has promised to renegotiate international aid.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $6.1 billion short position in the currency as of May 4, down
from $7.3 billion a day earlier and the smallest in a month. The
$1.2 billion one-day change in positioning was the biggest in
the central bank’s records since at least 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
