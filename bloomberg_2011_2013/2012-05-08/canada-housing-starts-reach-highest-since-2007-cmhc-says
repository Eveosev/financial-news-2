Canadian housing starts rose to the
highest since September 2007 last month on multiple-unit
projects, the federal housing agency said.  The annual pace of home starts was 244,900, Ottawa-based
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said today. The highest forecast
in a Bloomberg economist survey with 21 responses was a 222,600
rate.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has said he is concerned that
some condominium markets in major cities may be overheating and
Canadians should avoid taking on too much debt. He used a March
29 budget to put CMHC’s books under annual review by the
country’s banking regulator.  Multiple-unit starts in urban areas rose 27.4 percent to
158,500, while single-family starts rose 0.6 percent to a pace
of 67,700 units. Urban starts in  Quebec  jumped 56.5 percent, the
report said.  The increase in multiple-unit work “is partly a reflection
of the high level of pre-sales in large multi-unit projects
since 2011,” CMHC deputy chief economist Mathieu Laberge said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
