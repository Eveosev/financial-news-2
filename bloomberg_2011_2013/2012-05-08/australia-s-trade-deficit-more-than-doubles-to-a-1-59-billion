Australia ’s  trade deficit  widened in
March to the biggest in almost 2 1/2 years as a 5 percent rise
in imports outpaced export growth in an economy driven by the
mining industry.  Imports outpaced exports by A$1.587 billion ($1.6 billion),
from a revised A$754 million deficit in February, the Bureau of
Statistics said in a report in Sydney today. The gap was the
widest since a A$1.595 billion shortfall in October 2009 and
exceeded the A$1.3 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg News
 survey  of 20 economists.  The data add to pressure on central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  to extend interest-rate cuts as the economy slows and
inflation eases, and traders are betting on another cut next
month. Stevens last week reduced rates by half a percentage
point to a two-year low of 3.75 percent and the central bank
revised its export outlook lower in a quarterly statement.  “The global environment is under a fair bit of stress,”
said Tom Kennedy, economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney
who forecasts another RBA rate cut in August. “At the moment
the international story is outweighing the domestic strength in
the Australian economy.”  The Australian dollar fell after the report. It bought
$1.0175 as of 1:57 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0186 immediately
before the figures were released.  Weaker International Demand  Exports rose 2 percent to A$24.5 billion, led by an 8
percent gain in rural goods, today’s report showed. Imports
advanced 5 percent to A$26.1 billion on a 20 percent gain in
consumption goods, the report showed.  Overseas shipments were affected by weaker international
demand and disruptions on the supply side such as industrial
disputes in the coal industry, Kennedy said. Imports were in
part boosted by purchases of capital equipment by an expanding
 mining industry , he said.  “You have to look at this from a long-term perspective and
how the economy is going to unfold,” he said. “The mining boom
is continuing and the capex story is still alive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
