Brazil’s securities regulator paved
the way to the completion of a deal that will create the world’s
largest airline by market value.  CVM, as the regulator is known, approved  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ’s
plan to start a tender offer for shares of carrier  Tam SA (TAMM4) ,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  Santiago-based Lan has 10 days to make the offer for Tam
shares, the airline said in a statement posted on the website of
 Chile ’s securities regulator.  Tam shares will be swapped for stock in a holding company
called Holdco II, which will combine with Lan to form Latam
Airlines.  “This is another significant step in the combination
process between Lan and Tam, which should be completed in the
first half of 2012,” Lan’s Chief Financial Officer Alejandro de la Fuente said, according to the statement.  Tam’s acquisition by Lan, first announced in August 2010,
will create the world’s 12th largest carrier by revenue and
would be the biggest acquisition of an airline in at least two
decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
combination would have a market value of about $13.4 billion,
overtaking Air China Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. as the
world’s biggest carrier.  Brazil ’s CVM also approved the trading of Brazilian
depositary receipts in  Sao Paulo  of the combined company, Latam
Airlines SA. The BDRs will trade with the ticker symbol LATM11
in the Bovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
