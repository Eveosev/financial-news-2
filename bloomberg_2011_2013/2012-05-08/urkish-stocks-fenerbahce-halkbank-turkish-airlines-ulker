Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 0.1 percent to 58,749.33 at the close in Istanbul,
its lowest level since Jan. 31.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi & Ticaret AS (FENER)  , the merchandising arm for last year’s Turkish soccer
champion Fenerbahce, slumped 2.6 percent to 56.50 liras. The
team may withdraw from the country’s top competition after the
football federation said some of its executives were involved in
match-fixing, according to a statement from jailed club Chairman
Aziz Yildirim posted on the club’s website.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  , the national airline known as
Turkish Airlines, rose as much as 2.6 percent before paring
gains to close up 0.7 percent at 2.77 liras. Chairman Hamdi Topcu said he expects the company will agree to purchase
Poland’s state-owned airline within a month.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  , a Turkish state-run
bank, climbed 1.3 percent to 12.05 liras after saying first-
quarter profit rose 3.7 percent to 544.2 million liras ($307
million), exceeding estimates.  Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS (ULKER)  , Turkey’s largest
confectioner and part-owner of the Godiva chocolate brand,
closed at the highest in more than eight years, jumping 13
percent to 6.14 liras, after saying first-quarter profit more
than tripled and it will pay a gross 0.82 lira a share in
dividends on May 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
