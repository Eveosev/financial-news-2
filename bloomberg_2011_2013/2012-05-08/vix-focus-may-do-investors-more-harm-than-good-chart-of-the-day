Investors seeking to judge what’s
ahead for U.S. stocks may be better off without a “VIX fix,”
according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S.
market strategist.  The VIX, the most widely followed gauge of market
volatility, “has not been a great predictive indicator for
future stock-price direction” as a rule, Levkovich wrote in a
May 4 report.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, whose ticker symbol is VIX, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since stocks began a  bull market  in
March 2009. The so-called fear gauge for stocks is inverted for
easier comparison.  Share prices are more likely to rise than fall after a
surge in the VIX, according to data that Levkovich cited in the
report. He studied the  S&P 500 ’s swings after the VIX increased
25 percent from a low in one month.  More often than not, stocks showed gains three, six and 12
months later. The frequency of advances increased to 75 percent
after a year from 60 percent after three months. He described
the results as “random stock-price outcomes,” as the S&P 500
tends to rise over time.  Even if the VIX was a more insightful indicator, it’s so
commonly watched that investors can’t gain an edge by following
its moves, Levkovich wrote. The index has swung between 14 and
23 this year on a closing basis. Yesterday’s reading of 18.94
was near the middle of that range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
