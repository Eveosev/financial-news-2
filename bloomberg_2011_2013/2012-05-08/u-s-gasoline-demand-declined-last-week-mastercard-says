U.S. gasoline demand fell for a second
consecutive week to the lowest level in eight weeks, according
to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.59 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended May 4, down 0.7 percent from the week before,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  Fuel consumption was 5.8 percent below the year-earlier
level, the 36th straight decline in that measure. Fuel use over
the previous four weeks fell 6.1 percent below the same period
in 2011, a record 59th consecutive drop in that measure.  The average pump price declined 3 cents in the past week to
$3.81 a gallon, the lowest level since March 9. For the second
week in a row, prices were below a year earlier, dropping 4.3
percent under 2011 levels.  “While prices have fallen 13 cents in the past four weeks,
keep in mind that they do not always translate to an
instantaneous pickup” in demand, John Gamel, a gasoline analyst
and director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the
report.  The highest prices were on the West Coast, where the
average fell 1 cent to $4.12 a gallon. The lowest prices were on
the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon declined 6 cents to $3.68.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
