Jeremy Lin won’t play in the rest of
 New York  Knicks’ postseason series against the Miami Heat
because he isn’t sufficiently recovered from knee surgery,
CBSSports.com reported citing Knicks coach  Mike Woodson .  “He’s not ready,” Woodson told reporters today. The
Knicks, down 3-1 in the best-of-seven opening-round matchup,
again face elimination with a game in Miami tomorrow night.  Lin, the second-year National Basketball Association player
out of Harvard University who became a starter in February, last
played on March 24 before surgery to repair a torn meniscus in
his left knee.  The Knicks are thin at guard after Iman Shumpert sustained
a season-ending knee-ligament tear in the series opener and
 Baron Davis  was lost for about a year after severely damaging
his knee during New York’s 89-87 home win on May 6 at Madison
Square Garden, which snapped an NBA-record 13-game playoff
losing streak.  Lin, whose early February insertion into the lineup helped
turn around the struggling team, finished the regular season
averaging 14.6 points and 6.2 assists per game.  Woodson said on a conference call yesterday that he wasn’t
counting on Lin for Game 5. He also said then that  Mike Bibby 
and Toney Douglas may see increased playing time, and that
forwards  Carmelo Anthony  or J.R. Smith might handle the point
guard duties, depending on what lineup the Heat put on the
floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
