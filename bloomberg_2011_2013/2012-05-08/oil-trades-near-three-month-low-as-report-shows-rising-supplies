Oil fell for a sixth day in  New York ,
the longest losing streak in almost two years, after stockpiles
rose in the U.S. and  Saudi Arabia ’s Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi 
said the world is oversupplied with crude.  Futures slid as much as 0.7 percent after dropping 8.6
percent in the previous five days. U.S. inventories increased
 7.8 million barrels  last week to 378 million, the highest level
since August 1990, according to data from the  American Petroleum
Institute . A government report today may show supplies rose 2
million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. There is
surplus oil in the market, al-Naimi said in  Tokyo .  “The big API increase in crude-oil stocks should be
bearish for  oil prices ,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-
derivative sales manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo who forecast
New York oil will trade between $95 and $100 a barrel.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 66 cents to $96.35
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $96.51 at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time. It
slipped 1 percent yesterday to $97.01, the lowest close since
Feb. 6. Front-month prices are down 2.4 percent this year. The
six-day decline is the longest since July 2010  Brent oil for June settlement was at $112.26 a barrel, down
0.4 percent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas
Intermediate was at $15.75, from $15.72 yesterday.  Price Projections  The U.S. Energy Department reduced its 2012 price
projections for crude and gasoline as supply is forecast to
expand faster than fuel consumption. New York crude will average
$104.12 a barrel this year, down 1.5 percent from the April
forecast of $105.72, the department’s Energy Information
Administration said yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. The U.S. benchmark grade will average $103.75 in 2013,
down $2 from the prior month’s estimate.  Regular gasoline at the pump will average $3.71 a gallon
this year, down from a projection of $3.81 in April, the
department predicted. It will average $3.79 a gallon from April
through September, the peak demand period.  Pump prices may have reached their annual peak at the
earliest in 14 years amid rising oil supply, easing Middle East
tensions and the takeover of refineries that were threatened
with closing. Prices have slipped 15.1 cents since reaching a
2012 high of $3.941 a gallon on April 2, the Energy Department
said.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 5 million barrels last week,
figures from the industry-funded API show. They are forecast to
drop  750,000 barrels , according to the median estimate of 12
analyst surveyed by Bloomberg News before the government report.
Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, slid by 2.7 million barrels compared with a projected
gain of 125,000.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Commodities erased their gain for the year yesterday before
paring declines. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index fell as
much as 1.6 percent to 641.8, the lowest since Dec. 29, before
closing down 0.6 percent at 648.6. The last annual slump was in
2008. The measure was at 647.2 today.  Technical Support  Oil’s decline in New York may stall as the 14-day relative
strength index approaches 30, a threshold that typically signals
prices have fallen too far and further losses may not be
sustained. The measure was at 30.1 today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also have yet to settle lower
than the 200-day moving average, signaling technical support,
after trading below it the past two days. This indicator is at
$96.29 a barrel today.  Investors should buy  Brent crude  at $110 a barrel and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $95 a barrel, according to  Societe
Generale  SA. Prices will rise this month as refineries begin
buying more crude to process in June and July, while spare
production capacity by OPEC members remains tight, it said in a
report e-mailed today.  “By the end of May, crude prices will have turned north
again,”  Mike Wittner , the head of oil-market research at
Societe Generale in New York, said in the report. “The key
driver in putting a floor under prices and then pushing them
higher should simply be refinery crude demand.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
