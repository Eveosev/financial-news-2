Oil options volatility retreated as
the underlying futures slid to a three-month low after  Saudi
Arabia  said prices should come down and the euro declined.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.9 percent at 4:05 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 28.2 percent yesterday.  “Volatility closing lower today is a good sign that we
quite likely made a low in the market today and that we’ll go
higher,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida .  Crude oil for June delivery declined 93 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $97.01 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest
settlement in three months. Prices have slipped 12 percent since
Feb. 24, when they reached the 2012 high of $109.77.  Oil fell for a fifth day as Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali
al-Naimi  said prices are “still a little bit high.” The euro
fell for a seventh day as Greek politicians struggled to form a
new government and on the possibility of a conflict on economic
policy between Germany and  France , which elected Socialist
Francois Hollande president.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
