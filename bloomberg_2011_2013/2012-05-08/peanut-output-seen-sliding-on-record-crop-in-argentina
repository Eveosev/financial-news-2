(Corrects to prices from output in headline.)  Peanut prices are forecast to fall in
the second half of the year as a record crop in  Argentina  eases
a supply shortage, Oil World said.  Prices for peanuts, or groundnuts, in Rotterdam may fall to
about $1,800 a metric ton on the basis of cost, insurance and
freight from $2,800 now, the Hamburg-based oilseed researcher
said today in a report.  U.S. prices for  peanuts , used in Unilever’s Skippy peanut
butter and Mars Inc.’s Snickers bars, gained 54 percent in the
past 12 months to 34.6 cents per pound in the week ended April
27, government data show. Drought reduced the crop in the U.S.
and  Senegal , an exporter of groundnuts.  “The groundnut market will soon be in transition from a
severe shortage to relatively comfortable new-crop supplies,”
Oil World wrote. “Support still comes from the shortage of
high-quality groundnuts on the U.S. market.”  U.S. creamy peanut butter retail prices fell less than 1
percent to $2.738 a pound in March from a record $2.754 in
February, the first drop in nine months, according to the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics . The cost of peanut butter was up 37
percent from a year earlier.  “In April, groundnut prices received by U.S. farmers
rallied to an all-time high of 35 cents per pound,” Oil World
wrote. That is “providing incentive for a pronounced expansion
of plantings this year,” the researcher said.  U.S. farmers may boost planting by 25 percent to 575,000
hectares (1.42 million acres), Oil World said.  Argentina’s  peanut  production in the year through March
2013 is forecast to jump to 870,000 tons from 736,000 tons in
2011-12, as plantings climb to 340,000 hectares from 283,000
hectares, Oil World forecast.  “Prices of groundnuts are likely to ease and fall below
the highs seen in recent months once marketing of this year’s
large Argentine crop gains momentum,” Oil World said.  World peanut stocks are forecast to slip to 1.06 million
tons at the end of 2011-12 from 1.29 million tons 12 months
earlier, as use outpaces production for a third year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
