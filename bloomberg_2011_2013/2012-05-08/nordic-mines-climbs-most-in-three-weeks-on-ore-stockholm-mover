Nordic Mines AB (NOMI) , a Swedish gold
explorer, climbed the most in three weeks in Stockholm trading
after saying ore reserves at the Laiva mine in  Finland  are
larger than previously estimated.  It rose as much as 8.8 percent, the biggest advance since
April 18. It said proven and probable reserves were an estimated
16.9 million metric tons, up 4 million tons on the prior figure,
with an average gold content of 1.60 grams (0.06 ounces) a ton.  “This indicates that the Laiva mine, located outside Raahe
in central Finland, is one of the largest gold deposits in the
Nordic region,” the explorer said in a statement. The estimates
suggest it holds 27,000 kilos of gold, the Uppsala-based company
said, adding it will investigate the mine and nearby areas.  Nordic Mines rose 4.1 percent to 35.40 kronor by 1:07 p.m.
local time, the biggest gainer in the  Stockholm  All Share index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
