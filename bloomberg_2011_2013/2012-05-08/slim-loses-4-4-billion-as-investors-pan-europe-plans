Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s net worth
fell by $4.4 billion today as investors rejected the plan by his
America Movil SAB to further his foothold in Europe.  The largest wireless carrier in the Americas fell 8.2
percent, the biggest one-day drop since October 2008, in Mexico
City after saying it would spend as much as $3.4 billion to buy
additional shares of Royal KPN NV. Slim’s net worth fell to
$71.9 billion. He remains the richest man in the world,
according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  Slim, 72, is seeking a stake of almost 28 percent in the
Netherlands’s former phone monopoly to expand his empire beyond
 Latin America  as subscriber growth begins to slow in Mexico and
 Brazil . KPN called the offer too low. In the past, Slim had
explored acquisitions in Spain and Italy.  “We had hoped the company had given up expanding into
Europe and that it would return the excess cash to
shareholders,” said Carlos Sequeira, an analyst at Banco BTG
Pactual SA in Rio de Janeiro, in a research note today. “It
seems this is not the case.”  Slim’s fortune is up 16.7 percent year-to-date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
