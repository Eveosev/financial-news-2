Turkish armed forces killed five
members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, during fighting
in the country’s east, the state-run Anatolia news agency said.  A clash broke out as the security forces were conducting
reconnaissance in the Tatvan district of the Bitlis province
near Lake Van, the agency reported today.  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
 Turkey , the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
claimed more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
