BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest
mining company, named Ian Maxwell president of its energy coal
division, replacing Jimmy Wilson who will run the iron ore unit.  Maxwell, who joined Melbourne-based BHP in 2004 to lead
minerals exploration, will assume his post on July 1. Danny
Malchuk, currently a vice president of strategy and development,
will take over his post, according to the statement.  “Ian has invaluable global experience and a deep
understanding of  BHP Billiton ’s operating model and the energy
coal market,” Marcus Randolph, BHP chief executive ferrous and
coal, said in an e-mailed statement.  Energy coal contributed 7.7 percent of BHP’s  sales  during
fiscal 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wilson’s
appointment was announced on March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
