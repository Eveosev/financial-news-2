Japanese stock futures fell as
political tension in Greece heightened concern the region’s debt
crisis may worsen, weakening the outlook for exporters in Asia.
Australian equity futures declined as the government scrapped a
planned corporate  tax cut .  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s biggest
camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its
sales, declined 0.7 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. ADRs of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest consumer electronics
exporter, slid 1.4 percent.  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  may be active as the
world’s second-largest maker of flash memory chips forecast
profit will rise 83 percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,100 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,180 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,100 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Europe remains the biggest issue facing markets that we
need to have clarity on,” said Andrew Pease, Sydney-based chief
investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell
Investment Group, which manages about $150 billion. “It’s not
clear how deep the downturn is going to be and the effect this
is going to have elsewhere.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index declined 0.4 percent in New York
yesterday.  Greek Rejection  Speculation that  Greece ’s new government will reject terms
of its financial rescue grew as New Democracy leader Antonis
Samaras said he failed to form a coalition following weekend
elections, passing the opportunity to Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza
party. Tsipras said he plans to form a government of left-wing
parties that would nationalize banks, repeal recent labor
reforms and cancel the bailout accords.  Australian equity futures fell after the country’s
Treasurer Wayne Swan introduced the first cut in public spending
in at least 42 years and dumped a planned 1 percent reduction in
the company tax rate in yesterday’s  federal budget . Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  is ending four years of budget deficits,
giving the central bank flexibility to lower interest rates.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 6.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 8.4 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 2.5 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 13 for the S&P
500 and 10.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese Stocks  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. lost 1.9 percent to 99.92, its
weakest close since April 10.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum lost 0.8 percent
yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials also declined 0.8 percent yesterday.  Oil fell for a fifth day as Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali
al-Naimi  said prices should come down and the euro weakened
against the yen for a fourth straight day. Crude for June
delivery fell 93 cents to settle at $97.01 a barrel on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. The price has fallen 8.6 percent in a
five-day losing streak, the longest since Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
