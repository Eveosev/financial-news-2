Hong Kong  stocks  swung between gains
and losses as companies including  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  rose after
reporting higher profit, while mainland developers dropped amid
plunging land sales.  Macau casino operator SJM gained as much as 2.4 percent.
 Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates a port in Greece, rebounded
0.8 percent after slumping yesterday amid concern Europe’s debt
crisis may worsen after Greek voters flocked to anti-bailout
parties and France elected its first Socialist president in two
decades. Agile Property Holdings Ltd., a mainland developer,
sank 4.2 percent after a report residential land sales plunged
in major Chinese cities.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.1 percent to 20,525.95 at the
midday-trading break, after rising as much as 0.5 percent. The
same number of stocks gained as fell on volume 24 percent below
the 30-day intraday average. The gauge yesterday fell the most
in six months. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
stocks slid 0.4 percent to 10,532.65 today.  “In the short term, the Hong Kong market is still going
lower,” said  Alex Wong , asset-management director at Ample
Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The outlook isn’t too good.
Yesterday was oversold,” causing some rebound in the market,
Wong said.  Hong Kong’s  benchmark index  has risen about 11 percent this
year through yesterday as  China  eased its monetary policy and
the U.S.economy showed signs of recovery. Shares on the index

average on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is 10.6.  SJM, Man Wah  SJM rose as much as 2.4 percent to HK$17.26 after the

HK$4.07 after saying sales last year rose to $539.3 million from
$471.7 million from the previous year.  Cosco Pacific gained 0.8 percent to HK$10.62 and HSBC

China Ltd. (410) , a property developer in central Beijing and
Shanghai, retreated 3.2 percent to HK$5.79. Residential land
