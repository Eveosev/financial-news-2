Columbia University , the Ivy League
school whose endowment grew the most last year, sold $100
million of 30-year bonds in its first corporate-debt offering
since 1996.  The school’s 3.827 percent debt yields 80 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Columbia brought its largest corporate offering to date
following sales by schools including  Stanford University ,
Northwestern University and University of Pennsylvania. The
colleges are being enticed to forgo the tax-free  municipal
market  in lieu of greater flexibility with proceeds and record-
low corporate bond yields.  “The real benefit of issuing corporates is that they can
use the proceeds to support the endowment or other purposes that
are not allowed in the tax-free markets,”  Guy Lebas , chief
fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview.  Yields on investment-grade company debt rose to 3.344
percent yesterday after reaching a record 3.34 percent May 4,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index.  “They’re coming to market at a time when  interest rates 
are at extraordinarily low levels so issuance costs are cheap,”
Lebas said.  The bonds are expected to be rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors
Service, Bloomberg data show. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the offering, the data show.  ‘Instant Demand’  Columbia will use proceeds to pay off existing debt and to
fund  capital expenditures , according to a person familiar with
the offering, who declined to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the sale.  Stanford sold $143.2 million of 4.013 percent, 30-year top-
rated bonds at 70 basis points over similar-maturity Treasuries
in April, after  University of Pennsylvania  sold $300 million of
4.674 percent, 100-year debt graded Aa2 by Moody’s and AA+ by
S&P at a spread of 140 basis points.  “There is a dearth of AAA rated assets, so the highest-
rated universities have an instant demand,” Lebas said.  Columbia, whose main campuses are in New York, previously
issued debt in October 1996, selling $36.3 million of 7.36
percent bonds due October 2021, and $47 million of 7.19 percent
notes that mature in October 2016, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Robert Hornsby , a Columbia spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment about the sale.  The school’s endowment gained 24 percent in the year
through June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
