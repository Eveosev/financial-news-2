Michael Kors  Holdings Ltd., the Hong
Kong-based luxury-clothing company, dropped to a two-week low in
New York as  Fossil Inc. (FOSL)  reduced its 2012 earnings forecast,
leading a decline among retailers.  Michael Kors, named for its designer-founder, tumbled 5.3
percent to $41.75, the lowest since April 24, at the close in
New York. Trading totaled 5.8 million shares, more than twice
the stock’s daily average three-month volume, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  NYSE/ARCA Consumer Discretionary
Select Sector Index (IXY) , which includes Fossil, fell for a fourth
day, dropping 1.2 percent to 444.39.  Richardson, Texas-based Fossil, which obtained one-third of
its 2011 revenue from  Europe , fell 38 percent to $78.52, the
biggest decline on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after
reducing its full-year earnings forecast “amid a softening
macro environment” in Europe. Fossil, which manufactures Kors
watches along with other licensed brands, said sales of those
items  grew  48 percent in the first quarter.  “Kors is getting unfairly punished here,” Corinna Freedman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  New York  who
rates the stock outperform, said by phone. “For Kors, Europe is
a small part of its business though it is a growth area.”  Freedman has an outperform  rating  on Kors with a 12-month
price target of $48. Kors has 29 retail stores in the region and
plans to open 10 to 15 additional outlets per year, Kors Chief
Executive John Idol said during a February investor conference
call.  Earnings per share in 2012 will be as much as $5.33, Fossil
said today. Previously, it had forecast a maximum of $5.50.
Analysts projected $5.56, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
