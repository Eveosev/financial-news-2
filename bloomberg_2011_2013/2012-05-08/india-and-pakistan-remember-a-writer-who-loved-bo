Americans, it would seem, can never read  Ernest Hemingway 's fiction without a picture of Hemingway the man in mind; the writer's mythology threatens to supplant the force of his work. If there is a comparable figure in Indian literature, it is  Sadat Hasan Manto  (1912-1955), whose centenary is May 11. Manto, who wrote in  Urdu , was both the enfant terrible of his literary milieu and the sharpest and most disillusioned observer of the extraordinarily fascinating political currents of his age. These currents had their origins in the Hindu-Muslim tension that prominently marks (alongside a parallel history of coexistence and communion) the history of the  Indian subcontinent . They culminated in Manto's lifetime in the creation of the nation-states of  India  and Pakistan in 1947, based on the " two-nation theory ," and in the terrifying bloodbath and religious rancor of  Partition , an event that might be seen as the subcontinent's equivalent of the Holocaust. In the six decades since, it has been most unusual for India and Pakistan to agree on anything. But all this year, the literary cultures of both countries have been united in  marking  the memory of  Manto , whose life story -- the first 35 years spent in a colonial India, one year in independent India, and the final seven in the new country of Pakistan -- so vividly mirrors the dreams and fractures of his age. Among the events celebrating Manto's life and work this week will be one in  New York . A native of the north Indian city of Amritsar, Manto began his in letters in the 1930s as a translator of Russian and French literature into Urdu. In 1936, at 24, he  moved to Bombay  (now Mumbai), where he found his entire range of talents accommodated and made his mark both as a writer of vivid, lancing short stories in Urdu and of  film scripts  in Hindustani. He lived -- and his  stories are often set  -- in the cacophony and ethnic and linguistic diversity of Bombay's famous  chawls , the one-room tenements (often shared by several working men) with communal facilities that housed scores of migrant workers (in 1931, as much as three quarters of the city's population). In their essay " Manto's Life In Bombay ," Aftab Ahmed and Matt Reeck wr0te: Manto's stories were immediately noted, in a conservative culture and a literature awash with euphemisms, for their candid treatment of lust and sex and their interest in fallen, or falling, men and women. Many middle-class readers thought his work positively obscene, but at its heart was a powerful vision of a society distorted by a combination of hypocrisy and repression (the writer Nighat Gandhi makes a powerful case for Manto as " a spiritual feminist writer "). The political scientist  Ishtiaq Ahmed  recalled: Among the qualities of Manto's work that have stood the test of time is its signature combination of detachment, irony and concision -- a willingness to withhold judgment while studying the passions and frailties of human beings. Here are the vivid, silver-quick opening paragraphs of his essay on  Ashok Kumar , one of the many Bombay film stars whom he counted as his intimates -- an opening in which, while Kumar appears not at all, a whole world is realized through the narrator's coolly amused gaze: Bombay in the 1930s and 1940s was a hotbed of nationalist politics, and of competing visions of what kind of state and society would emerge from the agitation for independence. But no one, it seemed, could predict the mass killing, rape and looting that would flare up in 1947 among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs as the boundaries of colonial India were reorganized into India and  Pakistan . The subcontinent's spiral into atavistic violence and chauvinism inaugurated a new phase in Manto's work, one in which his disenchanted characters now enact in streets and killing fields the brutality and irony released by the forces and fault lines of history. In great stories such as " Toba Tek Singh ," " The Dog of Tetwal " and " Sahay ," the horrors of the age aren't so much decried as simply described, without recourse to caricature or stereotype. Alok Bhalla, one of Manto's many translators,  put it well : Among the many tragedies of newly independent India and Pakistan that Manto observed closely was his own. In 1948, a year after Partition, he decided to leave his beloved Bombay and move to Pakistan, where his wife and children were already resident. Why would such a man, in spirit one of the city's first citizens, leave behind  a world that he had so memorably brought to life  in his fiction? Because, terribly enough, he had begun to feel uncomfortable as a Muslim in the tense and scarred world of post-Partition India, even in a city as cosmopolitan as Bombay. In a  recent symposium on Manto  published in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, the Pakistani writer  Fahmida Riaz speculated : In Pakistan, Manto soon  fell into trouble  of all kinds, even as he wrote some of what were to become his best-known stories. For his story "Thanda Gosht" ("Cold Meat"), he was  prosecuted for obscenity  by the over-sensitive establishment (he is still published in  bowdlerized versions  in Pakistan). He fell into debt, and his love of the bottle, which in Bombay had seemed to enable his work, turned into a  debilitating alcoholism . Work for the Bombay film industry had paid his bills, but Pakistan's film industry was still nascent. (This is what gives Manto's splendid essays about the Bombay film world, first written for a Pakistani magazine in 1950, their poignancy: They are not pieces concurrent with the events which they describe, but rather attempts to fix in memory a world which had been left behind forever.) In a postscript to Yazid, a collection of stories he published in 1951, Manto  wrote nostalgically of Bombay : Having attained great fame in Bombay, Manto then, writes  Supriya Nair , became "even more famous for having left Bombay than having lived there." Manto died of cirrhosis of the liver in the Pakistani city of Lahore in 1955. His reputation today probably stands higher than at any point in his life or in the decades immediately after. Perhaps the people of India and Pakistan needed to first come to terms with Partition in order to come to terms with Manto. In the Dawn,  Zaheda Hina  observed: By bringing brightly observed human beings (especially women), candor about sexual desire, an unflinching gaze before violence, swiftness and lightness of style, sympathy for the lives of alienated figures, biting irony about the shibboleths of nationalism and religion, and skepticism about ideologies of all kinds into one literary matrix, Sadat Hasan Manto will always be real and relevant.
