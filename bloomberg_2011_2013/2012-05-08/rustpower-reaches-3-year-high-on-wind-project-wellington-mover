TrustPower Ltd. (TPW) , a New Zealand
electricity retailer, rose for a fifth day to the highest in
almost three years after securing a major expansion for its
Australian wind farm.  The Tauranga-based company on May 2 said it signed a power
sale and purchase agreement with  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)  for the
output from a planned wind farm next to its existing Snowtown
site near Adelaide in South Australia. TrustPower stock rose to
NZ$7.95 today, the highest since May 27, 2009.  TrustPower, which is majority owned by Wellington-based
 Infratil Ltd. (IFT) , is seeking a co-investor for the project, to be
called the Snowtown II Wind Farm, it said last week. The cost of
the total development is about A$570 million ($581 million),
Deutsche Bank AG analysts estimated in a report.  TrustPower shares rose 5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to NZ$7.65
at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington. They earlier gained as much
as 4.6 percent, the biggest advance since February 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
