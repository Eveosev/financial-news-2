Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, headed for the lowest in more than five
weeks after saying the probability that an oil field off the
coast of  Norway  starts production in January next year is
“very, very low.”  The shares declined as much as 1.7 percent to 27.91 zloty,
the weakest level on a closing basis since March 30, and traded
1.4 percent lower at 27.99 zloty as of 10:57 a.m. in Warsaw. The
benchmark  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell 1.1 percent.  The probability that the Yme field begins oil production in
January 2013 is “very, very low,” Chief Financial Officer
Mariusz Machajewski said on a conference call today.  The Polish refiner will run additional valuation tests on
the oil field once its operator Talisman Energy Inc. prepares a
timetable for the start of the production from the project, the
company said in a statement today. Lotos, which had planned for
Yme production to start in 2010, wrote down the value of the
field in its fourth-quarter earnings statement.  First-quarter net income fell to 597.1 million zloty ($185
million) from 636.4 million zloty a year earlier, Lotos said
today in a statement. That beat the 475 million-zloty mean
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
