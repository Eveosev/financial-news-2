DoubleLine Capital LP’s  Jeffrey
Gundlach  said he’s buying discounted assets from European banks.  “We’re participating in buying asset sales out of
Europe,” Gundlach, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based
DoubleLine, said today during a webcast.  The $24.2 billion  DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX) 
returned 3.9 percent this year as of yesterday, beating 96
percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last
year the fund returned 9.5 percent, ahead of 99 percent of
rivals.  Gundlach said he’s concerned about DoubleLine becoming too
large and investors no longer enjoying the same experience they
are now. Investors put a net $6.4 billion into the DoubleLine
Total Return Bond Fund in the first quarter, following deposits
of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, according to data from
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  The firm has $34 billion in assets under
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
