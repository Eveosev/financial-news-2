The U.S. is “troubled” by reports of
violence in Moscow in the wake of elections that returned
 Vladimir Putin  to the presidency, a State Department official
said today.  “We are troubled by reports of violence in Moscow during
the protests on May 6th and by the arrests that have been
carried out over the last three days,” spokesman Mark Toner
said today. “We are disturbed by images of police mistreatment
of peaceful protesters, both during the protests and after
detentions.”  Toner said the U.S. was also concerned about reports of
attacks by a “small group of protesters” against  law
enforcement .  “We want Russia to fulfill its own potential, and that
means giving people the chance to freely express themselves,”
Toner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
