Italian banks’ borrowings from the
 European Central Bank  reached a record high in April, as the
country’s lenders took up almost one-fourth of the funds offered
to lenders amid revived concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Total borrowing by Italian banks rose to 271 billion euros
($353 billion) from 270 billion euros in March, the Bank of
 Italy  said on its website today.  Most of the funding, about 268.4 billion euros, was from
longer-term refinancing operations, while 2.6 billion euros came
from the main refinancing operations, the data show. Lenders in
the entire euro area borrowed about  1.13 trillion euros  from the
ECB, according to the central bank.  Italian banks are struggling to fund themselves as the debt
crisis has pushed up the cost of borrowing and made it harder
for banks to access the  interbank market  and reach wholesale
investors. Lenders in the country took on more than 255 billion
euros from the ECB in two auctions of three-year loans in
December and February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
