Mexico ’s peso fell the most in five
months as concern Greece may renege on terms of international
assistance damped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency slipped 1.5 percent to 13.3673 per U.S. dollar
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, from 13.1632 yesterday. It was the
biggest daily drop since a 1.8 percent decline on Dec. 12.
Today’s slide pared this year’s rally to 4.3 percent, still the
biggest among it 16 most-traded peers tracked by Bloomberg.  “The topic is once again Europe,”  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said by phone from Mexico City.
“This is what is putting pressure on markets and the peso.”  Concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis would drag on
the market for Mexican exports helped make the peso Latin
America’s worst-performing major currency in 2011.  The peso extended its decline today as Mexico’s benchmark
equity gauge plunged. The  IPC index  slumped 2.1 percent to
39,214.64.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.22 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.54
centavo to 132.93 centavos per peso.  Greece’s political leaders met for a second day to form a
government after New Democracy’s Antonis Samaras, who won the
most seats in Parliament, said he couldn’t forge a coalition.
The stalemate is fueling concern the country won’t stick to the
terms of its European Union bailout and remain a euro member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
