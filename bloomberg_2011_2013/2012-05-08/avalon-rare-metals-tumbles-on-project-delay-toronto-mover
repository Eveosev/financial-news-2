Avalon Rare Metals Inc. (AVL) , the company
developing a rare-earth deposit in Canada’s Northwest Territory,
fell after delaying the target date for its first production.  Avalon dropped  23 percent  to C$1.67 at the close in Toronto
after announcing its first production may be in “late 2016.”
Avalon needs more time to complete metallurgical test work, the
Toronto-based company said in a statement yesterday after the
close of regular trading on North American markets.  “They are delaying their project for the second time
because of the metallurgy, so people are starting to think there
are real problems there,” said Luisa Moreno, an analyst at
Jacob Securities Inc. in Toronto. “Avalon is being punished in
a way for being the first. Because they are the advanced one,
they are having all the problems.”  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar metallic elements
used in batteries, mobile phones and computer hard drives.  China 
produces more than 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
