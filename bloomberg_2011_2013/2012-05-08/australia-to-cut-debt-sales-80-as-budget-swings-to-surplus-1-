Australia ’s  net debt  sales will drop
80 percent to A$9 billion in the fiscal year starting July 1, as
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s government cuts outlays to end
four years of budget deficits.  The amount of outstanding  government bonds  maturing in a
year or more will rise to A$214 billion by June 30, 2013, from
an estimated A$205 billion a year earlier, according to the
annual budget presented today by Treasurer  Wayne Swan  in
Canberra. That indicates gross sales of A$34.6 billion, with
about A$25.6 billion in debt due to mature during the coming
fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The government will sell about A$58 billion of bonds this
year, as the face value of the securities outstanding rises by
A$44 billion, official data show. Swan pledged to reduce outlays
in fiscal 2013 for the first time in 42 years.  Australian benchmark 10-year  yields  dropped about 2
percentage points over the past year and reached a record low of
3.39 percent on May 7 as investors sought a haven from fiscal
turmoil in  Europe , where voters from France to  Greece  are
turning against austerity measures. Overseas buyers snapped up
more than half of Australian bond sales in the final six months
of 2011, raising their holdings of the nation’s AAA-rated
sovereign debt to a record 75 percent, according to data from
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia.  Dollar Declining  The Australian dollar held earlier declines. The currency
traded at $1.0136 as of 8:01 p.m. Sydney time, a 0.6 percent
drop from yesterday in  New York . The so-called Aussie earlier
dropped to $1.0124, within 0.2 percent of the weakest this year,
after government data showed Australia’s trade deficit widened
in March to the biggest in almost 2 1/2 years.  Government bond futures were little changed near record
highs. The benchmark 10-year contract for June delivery advanced
to 96.675 from 96.635, and earlier touched 96.695, the highest
level in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1989.  The government will sell A$2 billion of indexed bonds in
the coming financial year, little changed from offerings in the
current period, to increase the amount of inflation-linked notes
to about A$18 billion by June 2013, the budget shows.  Government securities  due in less than a year will fall to
about A$15 billion by the end of next month, the budget shows.
There were A$16.1 billion outstanding as of June 30, 2011,
according to data from the Australian Office of Financial
Management.  Debt Ceiling  Today’s budget showed Swan will seek to amend legislation
to raise the debt ceiling to A$300 billion from A$250 billion,
while aiming to keep the amount of debt outstanding at less than
A$250 billion by June 30, 2013.  He also reiterated the government’s goal of maintaining the
federal  debt market  at a sufficient size to ensure liquidity. A
panel of regulators and market participants recommended
borrowings should stay at about 12 percent to 14 percent of
gross domestic product.  The federal government had A$228.8 billion of securities
outstanding as of May 4, according to the AOFM. That included
A$197.4 billion of bonds maturing in a year or longer, A$15.8
billion of inflation-linked notes and A$15.6 billion of bills
due in less than 12 months, data from the government funding arm
show.  Australia expanded debt sales in 2009 to fund stimulus
measures after maintaining the  bond market  at about A$50 billion
since 2003, when then-Treasurer  Peter Costello  decided not to
use budget surpluses to pay off outstanding debt.  Yields on all Australian notes maturing in three years or
longer fell to records this week, as elections in  France  and
Greece spurred concern popular discontent will derail austerity
programs aimed at resolving Europe’s debt crisis.  Australian sovereign securities due in one year or longer
have handed investors a 3.6 percent return since March 31, the
best performance among AAA-rated nations, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
