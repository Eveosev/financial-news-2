Anti private-equity rhetoric could
creep into discussions between managers and investors, affecting
the amount of money some firms can attract, said co-founder of
Searchlight Capital Erol E Uzumeri.  Uzumeri, who was speaking at a Bloomberg Canada Economic
Summit, said some investors are beginning to evaluate managers
based on criteria outside of their  investment performance . While
analysis is good, you have to make sure it isn’t politically
motivated, said Uzumeri.  Opponents of Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney 
are fueling a debate over private equity’s role in the economy,
calling into question whether the industry creates value and
jobs.  “Nobody wants to see their industry being tarred and
feathered,” said  Onex Corp. (OCX)  Managing Director David Mansell who
also spoke at the conference. “I could see why it might scare
off certain pension plans, especially those in the states that
have political pressure. If you’re successful and have a good
track record, you’ll be able to attract capital.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
