K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s biggest potash
distributor, agreed to sell its nitrogen fertilizer distribution
unit to OAO EuroChem in a transaction that values the business
at about 140 million euros ($182 million).  K+S anticipates closing the sale of K+S Nitrogen by the end
of the second quarter, depending on approval from European Union
regulatory authorities, the Kassel, Germany-based company said
in an e-mailed statement.  EuroChem, owned Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko,
purchased parts of  BASF SE (BAS) ’s Antwerp-based nitrogen fertilizer
business for 830 million euros earlier this month. K+S, which is
focusing on potash and salt, has an exclusive agreement to sell
output from the BASF plants being acquired by EuroChem.  “The acquisition of K+S Nitrogen represents a logical
extension to our latest acquisition in Antwerp,” EuroChem Chief
Executive Officer Dmitry Strezhnev said in the statement. “It
gives us a globally recognized platform and will further secure
our competitiveness in important markets globally.”  K+S Nitrogen had earnings before interest and taxes of 69.4
million euros on revenue of 1.16 billion euros in 2011,
according to the statement. The sales will generate a book
profit 70 million euros to 80 million euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
