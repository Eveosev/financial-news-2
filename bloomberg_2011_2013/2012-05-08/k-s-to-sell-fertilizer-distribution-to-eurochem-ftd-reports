K+S AG (SDF)  agreed to sell its nitrogen
fertilizer distribution unit to OAO EuroChem, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing people familiar with the
transaction.  The two sides signed an agreement last week, the newspaper
reported in an advance release of an article in tomorrow’s
edition. The business has 1.2 billion euros ($1.56 billion) in
revenue, and an enterprise value of 140 million euros, according
to the report.  Eurochem, owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko,
purchased parts of  BASF SE (BAS) ’s nitrogen fertilizer business for
830 million euros, and adding the K+S distribution business
complements those assets. K+S, which is focusing on potash and
salt, has an exclusive agreement to sell output from the BASF
plants being acquired by EuroChem.  To contact the reporters on this story:
