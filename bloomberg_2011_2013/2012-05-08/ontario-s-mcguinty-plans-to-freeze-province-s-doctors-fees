Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty plans
to freeze the fees that the province’s doctors charge for health
care.  Changes to various plans are expected to save C$338.3
million ($339.4 million) in the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the
government said today in a statement.  “Ontario is moving toward a real wage freeze for
doctors,” the government said in the statement. “The
government is updating and rebalancing OHIP fees to better
reflect current medical practices and new technologies and to
avoid double-payments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
