Vattenfall AB, Swedenâ€™s biggest
utility, won permission to build a 299-megawatt wind farm in
 Wales , the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The Pen Y Cymoedd project in south Wales will have the
highest generating capacity of any onshore wind farm in England
and Wales, producing enough electricity to power 206,000 homes,
the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
