Israeli government bonds dropped for
the first time in more than a week after early elections were
canceled, raising concerns about policy makers’ ability to
tackle a widening  budget deficit .  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark notes due January
2022 rose one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.56
percent at 11:13 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The shekel weakened 0.1
percent to 3.8006 a dollar, taking this month’s drop to 0.9
percent against the dollar.  Opposition party Kadima agreed to join Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu ’s ruling coalition in a surprise announcement
that nullified plans to hold national elections in September.
Elections are due to be held by November 2013.  Israel ’s budget
deficit will probably widen to 3.4 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012 from 3.3 percent last year as growth slows, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on April 2.  “The canceled elections puts policy makers back on track
to decide on raising taxes and increase debt offerings as the
budget deficit is expected to overshoot its target,” said Sagie
Poznerson, head of trading at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel
Aviv . “This is negative for government bonds pushing yields
higher.”  Fischer’s Warning  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  last month said
Israel shouldn’t widen its deficit to pay for any increase in
military spending, and warned of the risks of “populism”
before elections. Netanyahu is under pressure to expand his
budget amid calls for higher defense spending.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which tracks inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose less than 0.1 percent to
265.64.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectation for the  interest rates  in the next 12 months, rose
one basis point to 2.51 percent.  The Finance Ministry  plans to sell a combined 1.5 billion
shekels ($395 million) of bonds at an auction today. The
government will offer 250 million shekels each of notes due
January 2018 and the 2022 debt, according to sale data on
Bloomberg. It also plans to sell 350 million shekels of
inflation-linked securities due May 2017.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate  government bonds  of
similar maturity, fell two basis points to 281, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
