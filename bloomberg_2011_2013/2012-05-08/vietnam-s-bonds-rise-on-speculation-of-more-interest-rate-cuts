Vietnam ’s  government bonds  rose,
pushing the benchmark five-year yield to the lowest level since
September 2009, on speculation the central bank will cut
borrowing costs to support the economy. The dong weakened.  “The  State Bank  of Vietnam is likely to deliver more cuts
in the coming quarters to support spending” as domestic demand
may remain subdued, Trinh D. Nguyen, a Hong Kong-based economist
at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote today in a commentary accompanying a
manufacturing report. The HSBC Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing
Managers’ Index showed output declined in April for the sixth
time in seven months. Vietnam’s central bank cut interest rates
for the second time in less than a month in April.  “The  bond market  will continue to be active in coming
months because a large number of Vietnam’s government bonds will
mature in May and investors expect high profits from government
bonds as  interest rates  decline,” Tran Thi Thanh Thao, a fixed-
income analyst at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. wrote in
a research note yesterday.  The  yield  on five-year government notes fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.03 percent today,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
Yields have dropped for 15 straight days.  The dong fell 0.05 percent to 20,860 per dollar as of 3:16
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
