Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the
group of euro-area finance ministers, said Luxembourg seeks a
capital boost for the European Investment Bank.  A strengthened EIB could provide an investment push across
 Europe , Juncker told the parliament in Luxembourg today.
Luxembourg seeks more investment firepower for the European
Union and therefore backs the idea of joint bonds, he said.  “We are not one of those governments that campaigns for a
reduction of the European budget,” he said. “On the contrary,
we want more financial investment firepower for the European
Union.”  Luxembourg wants Europe’s tools for promoting growth to be
used “to the fullest,” Juncker said.  “We seek a capital increase for the  European Investment
Bank  that would allow for an investment push in Europe,” he
said. “We seek the more focused use of structural funds in the
European Union, targeting weaker countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
