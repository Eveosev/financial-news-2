Barcelona captain Carles Puyol may
miss soccer’s 2012 European Championship for defending champion
 Spain  because he requires knee surgery.  The 34-year-old, who has played 99 times for Spain, faces a
six-week layoff, Barcelona said on its website. Spain opens Euro
2012 with a June 10 game against Italy in Gdansk, Poland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
