Soybeans, the best performing
commodity this year, may be set to drop as the highest prices
since 2008 curb demand, said Ashish Misra, the head of
investment research at Lloyds TSB Banking Group Plc’s private
banking unit.  “We may well have seen the peak prices in soybeans,”
Misra, who helps manage 11 billion pounds ($17.8 billion) for
Lloyds, said by telephone today from  London . Soybeans slipped
about 4 percent since touching $15.125 a bushel on May 2 on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest for a most-active contract
since July 2008. Prices surged after drought cut South American
crops, spurring China to boost imports of U.S. supplies.  “The Chinese are rational investors, and they will not be
buying now as enthusiastically as they were,” Misra said.
“Demand is going to start tapering off. It may well be that at
these  price levels , there’s not much more steam behind this
rally.”  China, the world’s biggest soybean consumer, bought 921,642
metric tons of the oilseed from the U.S. in the four weeks ended
April 26, nearly triple the amount in the same period in 2011,
the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Soybeans have climbed about 20 percent this year, the biggest
gainer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities.  A strengthening  dollar , slower growth in  China  and  India 
and a recovery in South American production next year also may
pressure prices, Misra said.  “I’m generally negative on commodities as an asset class,
and particularly negative on agricultural commodities,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
