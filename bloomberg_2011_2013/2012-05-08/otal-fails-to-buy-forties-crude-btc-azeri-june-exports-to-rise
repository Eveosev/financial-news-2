Total SA failed to buy North Sea
Forties at a higher price. BP Plc booked the tanker Ice
Transporter to carry the crude to  Chile  this month, according to
Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. No bids or offers were made for Russian
Urals for a seventh session in Europe.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from a port in  Turkey 
will increase by 2.8 percent next month, according to a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Total didn’t find sellers for a Forties cargo for May 31 to
June 4 loading at parity to Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. The grade last traded at a discount of 10 cents
to the benchmark on May 2.  Morgan Stanley was unable to buy the blend for May 25 to
May 31 at 30 cents less than Dated Brent, while Phibro, a unit
of Occidental Petroleum Corp., failed to sell a shipment for May
20 to May 22 at 45 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent or a
discount of 40 cents to the cash cost of  North Sea  crude for
July, the survey showed.  The 274-meter (900-foot) Suezmax vessel is scheduled to
load 130,000 metric tons of crude at the Hound Point terminal in
 Scotland  on May 22, Athens-based Optima Shipbrokers said today
in an e-mailed report.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 34 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 44 cents on
May 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for June settlement traded at $111.07 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $112.24 on May 4. The July contract was at
$110.84, a discount of 23 cents to June.  Exports of North Sea Troll crude in June will drop to 14
cargoes versus 15 in May, a final shipping program obtained by

according to the plan.  Aasgard loadings will be eight cargoes of 855,000 barrels
each, unchanged from May, while shipments of Grane will drop by
one consignment to six lots of 600,000 barrels each, according
to separate schedules.  Crude shipments from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium will
decline to six cargoes of 600,000 barrels each in June, two less
than this month, and exports of Alvheim will be unchanged from

compared with 645,161 in May, the plan showed.  West Africa  Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Nigerian unit said two leaks were
reported yesterday on its Trans Niger Pipeline in Ogoniland in
the southern oil region after saboteurs cut the link with
hacksaws, causing spills.  “A joint investigation team will determine the cause and
extent of the leaks preparatory to repair work,”  Precious
Okolobo , Shell’s spokesman in  Nigeria , said by phone yesterday
from Lagos. Two similar leaks along the line caused by hacksaw
cuts were repaired during the weekend, he said. Okolobo couldn’t
