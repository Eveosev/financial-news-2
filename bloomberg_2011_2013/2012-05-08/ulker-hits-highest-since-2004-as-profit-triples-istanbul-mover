Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi AS (ULKER) ,  Turkey ’s
largest confectioner and part owner of the Godiva chocolate
brand, closed at the highest in more than eight years after
first-quarter profit more than tripled.  Ulker jumped 13 percent to 6.14 liras, the biggest rise
since February 2007 and the strongest level since March 2004.  Net income climbed to 55.8 million liras ($32 million) from
16.4 million liras a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market closed
yesterday.  “Ulker’s financials not only reflect the positive
contribution of the high-margin chocolate business, but also
operational efficiency improvement, which resulted in a margin
increase to 8 percent from 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of
2011,” Melda Agirdas, an analyst at Ekspres Invest in Istanbul,
said in an e-mailed report today. “The positive improvement in
efficiency implies better results ahead.”  Ulker will pay 0.82 lira a share in dividends on May 28, it
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
