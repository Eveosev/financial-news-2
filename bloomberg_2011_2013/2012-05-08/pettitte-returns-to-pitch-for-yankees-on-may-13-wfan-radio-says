Former All-Star pitcher  Andy Pettitte 
will make his 2012 debut for the  New York Yankees  on May 13
against the Seattle Mariners, the team said on Twitter.  Pettitte’s return to  Major League Baseball , which will take
place at Yankee Stadium, was announced yesterday by General
Manager Brian Cashman, the team said on the social networking
site.  The 39-year-old Pettitte ended his one-season retirement
March 16 and has been pitching in the organization’s minor
leagues.  “The reports that I’ve got have been pretty good,”
Yankees manager Joe Girardi told reporters. “He struggled a
little bit his last start with the command of some of his
pitches, but that doesn’t mean that he’s ready or he’s not
ready. We feel that he’s physically ready, he feels that he’s
physically ready and that’s why he’ll be here this weekend.”  Pettitte has a 240-138 career record and a 3.88 earned run
average, twice winning 20 games in a season. His 203 wins for
the Yankees are third most in franchise history, behind Whitey Ford (236) and Red Ruffing (231). He went 11-3 with a 3.28 ERA
for  New York  in 2010.  Mason Levinson in New York at +1-212-617-4753 or
