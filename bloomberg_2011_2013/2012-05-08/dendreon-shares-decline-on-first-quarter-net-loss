Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) , maker of the prostate
cancer drug Provenge, plunged 25 percent after the company said
growth this year will be “modest” and its first-quarter loss
fell short of estimates.  Dendreon fell to $8.75 at the close of  New York  trading,
its biggest drop Nov. 3. The net loss narrowed to $103.9
million, or 70 cents a share, from $112.8 million or 78 cents, a
year earlier, the Seattle-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The loss missed the 64 cent average of 11 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We continue to reiterate our guidance of modest quarter-
over-quarter growth for the remainder of 2012,” Chief Executive
Officer John Johnson said during a conference call with analysts
yesterday. “I believe, based on customer feedback, that the
long-term future for Provenge is very bright.”  Provenge was approved in April 2010 as the first therapy in
the U.S. that trains the body’s immune system to attack cancer
cells as if they were a virus. The treatment, which costs
$93,000, was cleared for patients with advanced cases of the
disease after the company’s three-year effort to persuade the
 Food and Drug Administration  to back the medicine.  Johnson said sequential growth in the second quarter would
be in the “low single digit” range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
