Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS (DOHOL) ,
owner of Turkey’s biggest listed media group, is staying out of
the market for syndicated loans as costs rise and international
banks scale back amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Dogan, which borrowed $160 million through a syndicated
loan together with  Yazicilar Holding AS (YAZIC)  in January last year,
hasn’t tapped the market this year.  “As compared to the past, underwriting is not possible in
syndications” because “banks are not sure if they can
distribute it,” Mehmet Yoruk, Dogan’s vice chairman for finance
and treasury, said in response to e-mailed questions yesterday.
“European banks have their own problems,” and “funding
everywhere became expensive,” he said.  The lack of appetite for underwriting is sending Turkish
companies in search of alternative financing, including
bilateral loans and local bonds, Yoruk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
