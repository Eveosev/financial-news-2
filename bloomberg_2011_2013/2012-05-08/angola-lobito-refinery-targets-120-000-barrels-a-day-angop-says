Angola ’s Lobito oil refinery, which is
yet to be completed, will produce as much as 120,000 barrels a
day during its first stage of operation, Agencia Angola Press
reported, citing Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos.  The processor is expected to increase its daily capacity to
200,000 barrels to help put an end to the oil-producing
country’s need to import refined petroleum products, Botelho de
Vasconcelos said,  according  to the Luanda-based news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
