Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Chief Executive Officer
 Scott Thompson  apologized to his staff for the fallout from
disclosures about his academic credentials, saying he takes
“full responsibility” for the matter.  “I want you to know how deeply I regret how this issue has
affected the company and all of you,” Thompson said in the
memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “We have all
been working very hard to move the company forward, and this has
had the opposite effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
