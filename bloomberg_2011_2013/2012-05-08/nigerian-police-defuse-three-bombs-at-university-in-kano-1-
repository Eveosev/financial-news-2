Nigerian police defused three bombs at
different locations inside Bayero University in the northern
city of Kano, said Musa Majiya, Kano state police spokesman.  The bombs were planted in buildings housing the faculties
of science and law and in a sports complex, Majiya said today by
phone. At least 21 people were killed and 22 injured in an
attack on a Christian worship center at the same university on
April 29, according to the Nigerian Red Cross. The police said
the attackers, who may have been members of the militant
Islamist group of Boko Haram, opened fire and threw explosives
at worshipers.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks and
bombings in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja, the capital, that
have claimed the lives of hundreds of people since 2009 in
 Africa ’s top oil producer.  Boko Haram, which says it wants to establish an Islamic
state in  Nigeria , carried out bombings at the offices of three
national newspapers that killed at least eight people and
injured 34 on April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
