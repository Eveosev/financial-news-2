Sixt AG (SIX2)  is trying to re-enter the
Chinese market and is in talks to find a new license holder in
the country,  Financial Times Deutschland said , citing an
interview with board member Thorsten Haeser.  Big auto rental companies are either having difficulties or
are not in  China  at all because the mobility market in the
country is still developing, Haeser said, according to the
German newspaper. A cooperation with a franchisee for leasing,
limousine service and vehicle rental failed in 2007, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
