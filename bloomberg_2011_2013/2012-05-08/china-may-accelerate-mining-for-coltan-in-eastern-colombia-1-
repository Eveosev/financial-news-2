China may accelerate development of
coltan mines in Colombia as it taps commodities reserves across
 Latin America .  The two nations are studying possible projects in
Colombia’s eastern provinces to produce minerals including
coltan, used in mobile phones, Colombian Mines and Energy
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said today in Beijing, according to a
government statement.  “They are the most expensive ores in the world and they
are strategic,” Cardenas said in the statement.  China is investing in Latin America to guarantee supplies
of copper, oil and minerals like coltan. Colombia’s President
 Juan Manuel Santos  is visiting China this week to strengthen
trade ties and increase his nation’s exports.  Colombia is mapping out mining areas that will be
accessible to companies that demonstrate enough investment
capacity, according to Cardenas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
