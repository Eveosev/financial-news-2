More than one-third of ministers from
 Greece ’s interim government who ran in May 6 elections,
including Environment, Energy and Climate Change minister  George Papaconstantinou , didn’t secure seats in parliament.  Thirteen out of 29 members of the country’s current
government who stood in elections failed to gain enough support
to secure a seat in the 300-member Greek Parliament, according
to a list of elected lawmakers released by state-run Athens News
Agency.  New Democracy  and the socialist Pasok, the two parties that
supported Prime Minister Lucas Papademos’s interim government,
are two seats short of the 151 seats needed for a majority in
the 300-member chamber. Greece’s Parliament is divided over
whether to renege on the terms of the two bailout agreements
negotiated since May 2010.  Papaconstantinou, who was finance minister when Greece
secured its first aid package from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  in May 2010, didn’t get into
parliament. Alternate Defense minister Yiannis Ragousis, who
served as infrastructure minister in the previous elected
government, Growth, Competitiveness and Shipping Minister Anna Diamantopoulou, Labor minister George Koutroumanis and Culture
and Tourism minister Pavlos Yeroulanos failed to be re-elected.  Sixteen members of Papademos’s interim government had
enough votes to enter Greece’s Parliament, including Finance
Minister Filippos Sachinidis, Health Minister Andreas Loverdos
and Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
