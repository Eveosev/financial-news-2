Egyptian security forces launched an
operation to combat the rising violence in Sinai, with raids
resulting in the arrest of Egyptians and Palestinians linked to
Hamas’ armed wing, Al Shorouk reported today.  The operations, which included military and Interior
Ministry forces, were in response to recent attacks on Egyptian
security patrols in the strategic peninsula, the independent
newspaper reported today, citing an unidentified security
official. It was unclear how long the operations would continue.  Separately, an official with the Islamic Jihad group warned
that  Egypt  could see a period of renewed bloodshed if the
president elected in a May 23 vote isn’t a candidate supported
by those who adhere to the idea of jihad, or holy war, or
doesn’t back the imposition of Islamic law in the country, the
independent Al Masry Al Youm reported.  Nabil Naeem, a member of Islamic Jihad, also said there
were about 500 al-Qaida-affiliated militants in the country,
most of whom were in Sinai and were among the remnants of
militant groups such as Takfir wal Hijra. Those movements had
waged an insurgency against  Hosni Mubarak ’s government in the
1990s before security forces quashed the violence.  The Islamic Group had also been among those that fought
against Mubarak’s regime, though it has since pushed to secure a
stronger position in mainstream politics after last year’s
uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
