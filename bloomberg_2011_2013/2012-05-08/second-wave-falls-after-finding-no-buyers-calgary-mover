Second Wave Petroleum Inc. (SCS) , the
Calgary-based oil and natural-gas producer that announced in
February it was seeking a buyer, fell the most in more than five
years after it didn’t get a satisfactory offer.  Second Wave  dropped  31 percent to C$1.84 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since December 2006. The shares
have fallen 47 percent since the company announced on Feb. 28 it
would consider a sale “in response to certain unsolicited
expressions of interest.”  The company, which had hired  RBC Capital Markets  to handle
the sale, said today “the process did not result in a proposal
that reflects the long-term value of Second Wave’s Pekisko and
Beaverhill Lake oil assets.”  In lieu of a sale, Second Wave may accelerate drilling at
Beaverhill using a C$15 million ($15 million) facility from
Brookfield Bridge Lending Fund Inc., its largest shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
