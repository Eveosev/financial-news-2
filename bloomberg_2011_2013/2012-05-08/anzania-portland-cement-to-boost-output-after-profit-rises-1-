HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) ’s Tanzanian unit
plans to increase production this year after profit increased in
2011, Managing Director Pascal Lesoinne said.  Net income in the 12 months through December rose to 50.6
billion shillings ($32 million) from 50.2 billion shillings a
year earlier, Lesoinne, managing director of  Tanzania Portland
Cement Co. (TWIGA) , told shareholders at a meeting today in Dar es
Salaam, the commercial capital. Revenue climbed to 217 billion
shillings, he said.  Output is expected to rise to 1.4 million metric tons this
year from 1.1 million tons in 2011 as supplies of electricity
and domestically produced clinker, a raw material used to make
cement, improve, Lesoinne said.  “Higher imports of clinker and frequent breakdowns of
machinery resulting from the erratic power supply led to
increased production costs” in 2011, he said.  A $17 million upgrade of a clinker line of Tanzania
Portland’s Wazo Hill plant, set to be commissioned by the end of
this month, will end the company’s reliance on expensive imports
of clinker, according to the company’s  annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
