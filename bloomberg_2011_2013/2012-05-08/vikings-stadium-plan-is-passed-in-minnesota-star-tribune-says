The  Minnesota Vikings  moved a step
closer to a new stadium as the Minnesota House passed a public
subsidy package that would require the National Football League
team to pay $105 million more than in the previous plan, the
 Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported .  The $1 billion stadium project, approved 73-58 by the House,
could go to the Senate for a vote today and be signed into law
by Governor  Mark Dayton  by the end of the week, the paper said.  The team will be responsible for cost overruns and will
have to share naming rights revenue.  Yesterday’s vote was driven by the possibility that the
Vikings might leave Minnesota without a new, taxpayer-supported
stadium to replace the Metrodome, where the team is committed to
play one more season, the Star-Tribune said.  Major League Baseball’s Minnesota Twins six years ago won
approval for a publicly subsidized ballpark and Target Field
opened in 2010 at a cost of $545 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
