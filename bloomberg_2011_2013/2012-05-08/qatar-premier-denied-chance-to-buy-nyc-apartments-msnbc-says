Qatar’s Prime Minister Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jabr Al Thani’s effort to purchase two apartments in  New
York  that belonged to Montana copper fortune heiress Huguette
Clark was thwarted by the building’s co-op board,  MSNBC.com
said , citing an unidentified person familiar with the decision.  The board declined to grant Al Thani, who offered $31.5
million for two 8th floor apartments, an interview for the
properties, MSNBC.com said. The apartments are located at 907
Fifth Avenue and overlook Central Park. The board was concerned
that the “quiet character” of the building would change should
the premier buy the property, MSNBC.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
