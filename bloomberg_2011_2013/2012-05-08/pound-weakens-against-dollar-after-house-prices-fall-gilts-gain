The pound weakened from within two
U.S. cents of an eight-month high against the dollar after an
industry report showed a  gauge  of  house prices  fell in April.  Gilts advanced as the  Royal Institution  of Chartered
Surveyors said its index of house prices dropped to minus 19
from minus 11 in March. A reading below zero means more
surveyors saw price declines than increases. Sterling rose
against the euro amid concern  Greece  will withdraw from the
currency bloc. Greek leaders will meet in  Athens  today after
talks yesterday failed to forge a governing coalition following
inconclusive weekend elections.  “It’s wrong that sterling is still being put in the safe-
haven basket with the Swiss franc and Japanese yen,” said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in London. “In the
near-term, pound-dollar may be heading back towards $1.60. There
will be more focus on U.S. performance in the second half of the
year.”  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.6135 at 4:18 p.m.
 London  time after rising to $1.6302 on April 30, the highest
level since Aug. 31. Sterling appreciated 0.2 percent to 80.47
pence per euro. It climbed to 80.36 pence yesterday, the
strongest since November 2008.  “The next big level in euro-sterling is around 80 pence”
per euro, Hydeskov said. “The market is looking out for a test
of that level within the next few weeks. The risk is still to
the downside” for the common currency.  Greek Talks  Greece’s New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said he
failed to reach agreement to form a government. The attempt will
pass to Alexis Tsipras, the head of Syriza, the second-biggest
party, which has vowed to cancel bailout terms for the nation.  The euro may find support against the pound should the
 currency pair  reach the October 2008 low at 76.94 pence,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The common European
currency may meet resistance at the 50-day moving average,
currently at 82.67 pence, the data show.  Support refers to an area on a price chart where analysts
expect orders to buy a currency to be grouped. A resistance
level is an area where they anticipate sell orders will be
clustered.  Sterling has appreciated 4.6 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 2.3 percent and the euro fell 0.1 percent.  BOE Meeting  Gilts rose as trading resumed after markets closed
yesterday for a public holiday. The 10-year yield fell to within
one basis points of a record low as investors sought the
relative safety of U.K. government debt.  The 10-year yield dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.93 percent. That’s the lowest level since
Jan. 18, when it reached 1.917 percent. The 4 percent bond due
March 2022 gained 0.77, or 7.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 118.485.  Volatility in U.K. government securities was the fourth-
highest of 24 developed-nation markets, according to measures of
10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default
swaps compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of England  policy makers will halt their  bond-purchase
program  at 325 billion pounds at their monthly meeting on May
10, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Stimulus ‘Close Call’  In a survey, 43 of 51 economists forecast no change to the
stimulus target. All 61 economists in a separate poll say the
central bank will keep its key  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5
percent.  Former Bank of England official  John Gieve  said today the
central bank may extend its asset-purchase program this week to
support growth, though faster inflation makes the decision a
“close call.”  The Debt Management Office plans to sell 2 billion pounds
of 30-year gilts tomorrow. The U.K. will auction 2.75 billion
pounds of 5 percent securities maturing in March 2025 on May 15
and gilts due in September 2014 in a so-called mini-tender on
May 17, the debt office said today.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S.
Treasuries returned 0.5 percent and German bunds gained 1.7
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
