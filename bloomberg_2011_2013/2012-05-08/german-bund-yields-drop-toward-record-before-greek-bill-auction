German bunds advanced, pushing yields
down to records, as Greek political leaders struggled for a
second day to form a new government after inconclusive elections
on the weekend.  Five-, 10- and 30-year German  yields  all dropped to all-
time lows after Greek borrowing costs increased for the first
time this year at a bill sale, boosting demand for the euro-
region’s safest securities. Italian and Spanish bonds declined
as stocks slid around the region amid concern the debt crisis is
worsening. The Netherlands, Austria,  Belgium  and the European
Financial Stability Facility all sold debt today.  “There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the
political outcome in  Greece ” and “bunds are likely to be one
of the main beneficiaries,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “So long as there remains
considerable uncertainty over the growth outlook and
sustainability of public finances for many of the euro-zone
sovereigns, then bunds are likely to remain well bid.”  The German  10-year yield  dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.54 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
declining to 1.532 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1989. The 1.75 percent bond due in July
2022 gained 0.59, or 5.90 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,300) face
amount, to 101.935.  The five-year yield fell five basis points to 0.53 percent
after sliding to a record 0.521. The 30-year yield dropped to as
low as 2.243 percent.  Greece Stalemate  Greek political leaders are meeting again today to try to
form a government after New Democracy’s Antonis Samaras, who won
the most seats in Parliament, said he was unable to forge a
coalition. The stalemate is fueling investor concern about the
country’s ability to adhere to the terms of its European Union
bailout and remain in the single currency.  Greece sold 26-week bills at a yield of 4.69 percent, up
from 4.55 percent at the previous auction on April 10. Investors
bid for 2.6 times the amount allotted, compared with 2.62 times
last month, the Public Debt Management Agency said.  The yield on the Greek 2 percent bond due in February 2023
jumped 15 basis points to 23.13 percent.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed five basis points to 5.45
percent, and  Spain ’s 10-year rate rose nine basis points to 5.84
percent. The Stoxx  Europe  600  Index (SXXP)  of shares slid 1.7 percent.  French bonds rose in earlier trading after German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the country’s President-elect
Francois Hollande has an obligation to cut the  budget deficit .  ‘No Doubt’  “The commitments on deficit reduction that every country
in Europe has undertaken will be upheld also by  France ,”
Schaeuble said in an interview broadcast late yesterday on
 Germany ’s ARD television channel. “I have absolutely no doubt
about that. How France puts together its budget within the
framework of the European commitments is up to them.”  The French 10-year bond yield climbed two basis points to
2.81 percent. It earlier slid to 2.76 percent, the lowest level
since March 2.  The Dutch  10-year yield  fell four basis points to 2.11
percent as the Netherlands sold 2.5 billion euros of the
securities.  Austria  auctioned 1.1 billion euros of debt due in
February 2017 and November 2022. Belgium and the European
Financial Stability Facility sold bills.  German bonds have returned 1.7 percent this year, indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies show. French debt gained 3.3 percent.  Bund Futures  German 10-year bund futures advanced to a record high
142.64 after UBS AG said they could rise to 144.04 should they
climb above their last record high of 142.44, citing trading
patterns.  The contracts may reach that level, which represents a 200
percent extension of their rally from an April 25 low, according
to  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy in
 London , referring to Fibonacci analysis, before the futures
touched today’s record.  “Bunds are bullish while they trade above the 141.52
retracement and as long as this remains the case the expectation
is for limited corrections and further price strength,” Adcock
wrote in a note to clients.  The 10-year contract expiring in June gained 0.4 percent to
142.53. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
advance or decline by certain percentages after reaching a new
high or low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
