The Polish zloty slid as the struggle
by Greek political leaders to form a coalition underscored
growing concern the euro region’s debt crisis may worsen.  The zloty depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.2045 per euro as of
4:56 p.m. in Warsaw. It weakened 1.2 percent in the past five
trading days for the fourth-steepest decline among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Greece ’s New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said he
failed to form a coalition government following the weekend
election, passing the opportunity to Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza
party. Tsipras said he would forge ahead with plans to form a
government of left-wing parties that would nationalize banks,
repeal recent labor reforms and cancel the nation’s bailout
accords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
