Austin Beutner , co-founder of New
York-based investment bank  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , said he’s
withdrawing from the Los Angeles mayor’s race to spend time with
his family.  Beutner, 52, ran as an “ unpolitician ” with a background
in investment and business development who entered public
service in 2008 after a cycling accident caused him to reassess
his life.  “I intend to keep working to make a difference in our
community,” Beutner, a former deputy under Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, said on his campaign  website . “We face tough
choices ahead and we’ll need elected leadership who will make
the right ones.”  His campaign raised $627,000 last year, with donations from
Wall Street and Hollywood figures including  KB Home (KBH)  founder Eli Broad, “Pirates of the Caribbean” producer Jerry Bruckheimer
and “Will and Grace” star Debra Messing, according to
campaign-finance  reports .  Others in the race to lead the second-largest U.S. city
include Controller Wendy Greuel and City Council members Jan Perry and Eric Garcetti. Villaraigosa can’t run because of term
limits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
