 London . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was
down 0.9 percent at 1,522.344.  BASE METALS:  Copper fell the most in almost five weeks in  New York  after
elections in  France  and  Greece  fueled concern that austerity
efforts aimed at stemming the region’s debt crisis will be
derailed, dimming the outlook for demand.  Copper futures for July delivery dropped 2.8 percent to
$3.667 a pound on the Comex in New York, retreating for a fourth
session in five. A close at that price would mark the biggest
decline since April 4.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slumped 1.2 percent to $8,078 a metric ton ($3.67 a

months, will spur demand for the grain.  Wheat futures for July delivery gained 1.1 percent to
$6.185 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Through
yesterday, the commodity was down 6.3 percent this year as
favorable weather boosts crop prospects in the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter of the grain.  Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil fell a sixth straight day as concern that the
 European debt crisis  may spread boosted the dollar and crude oil
fell as supplies increased.  June-delivery heating oil dropped 2.63 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9551 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 1.51 cents, or 0.5 percent,

austerity efforts will be derailed.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 2.2 percent to
