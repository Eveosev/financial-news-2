Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , the Hong Kong-listed
unit of billionaire Steve Wynn’s Las Vegas company, reported a
10 percent increase in first-quarter profit as Chinese tourists
drove up revenue in the world’s largest gambling hub.  Net income  rose to $209.2 million from $189.7 million a
year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today.  The casino operator this month said it won a land grant
from Macau’s government to build its second resort in the former
Portuguese colony.  Wynn Macau  will join  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  in
expanding into the city’s increasingly popular Cotai Strip.  The new project is unlikely to open before late 2016, Anil Daswani, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong, wrote in a
note to clients today. “Wynn Macau could halt its special
 dividend ” because of the expected large capital expenditure on
the project, Daswani wrote.  The Macau government approved a 51-acre concession on the
Cotai strip, the unit of  Wynn Resorts (WYNN)  Ltd. said on May 2.  Wynn Macau fell 1.5 percent to HK$22.50 as of 11:15 a.m. in
Hong Kong trading, while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  was
little changed. The stock has climbed 15 percent this year,
lagging behind Sands  China ’s 34 percent gain and Galaxy’s 62
percent jump.  Wynn Resorts Misses  Parent Wynn Resorts earlier reported first-quarter earnings
fell 19 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, on lower winnings
in Las Vegas. Net revenue in Macau surged to $950.7 million from
$865.7 million a year earlier, Wynn Resorts said in a statement.  Macau is the only place in China where casino gambling is
legal. The Chinese city had $34 billion in gambling revenue last
year, almost six times the $6.07 billion of the  Las Vegas  Strip,
according to government figures.  Wynn Resorts has been fighting a legal battle with Japanese
billionaire Kazuo Okada, who opposed the company’s HK$1 billion
($129 million) pledge in July 2011 to the University of Macau
Development Foundation. The  Universal Entertainment Corp. (6425) 
chairman and the former Wynn Resorts vice chairman filed a
petition in state court in Clark County, Nevada, in January for
access to financial records.  Wynn sued Okada in February and redeemed his 20 percent
stake in Wynn Resorts saying he was “unsuitable.” Okada is
challenging the redemption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
