Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up yields
the most in five months, as concern  Greece  might withdraw from
the euro zone sapped demand for higher-yielding assets in
emerging markets and sent commodities prices lower.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.08 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. That was the steepest increase since Dec. 12. The
price fell 0.41 centimo to 118.35 centimos per sol.  The “drop in commodities prices is probably feeding into
some weakness in Peruvian assets,” said Aryam Vazquez, a New
York-based economist at  Wells Fargo & Co . “The situation in the
euro zone is back in focus.”  Copper, Peru’s top export, fell in  New York  as Greek
political leaders struggled to create a coalition following the
weekend election. The mandate to form a government was passed to
the Syriza party, which has vowed to nationalize banks, repeal
recent labor reforms and cancel international bailout accords.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6410 per  U.S. dollar , according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank bought $24 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6420
soles per U.S. dollar, the bank said in a statement on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
