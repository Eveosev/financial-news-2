Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude for
June will be unchanged from May at five cargoes of 780,000
barrels each, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Shipments will total 3.9 million barrels, or 130,000
barrels a day, the plan showed.  Houston-based  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  operates the  field  in the
Norwegian North Sea. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
