Kenya ’s Regional Development Ministry
asked Kenya Electricity Generating Co. to pay 9 billion
shillings ($108 million) the company owes for its use of the
Masinga dam over the past 20 years, Business Daily reported.  The ministry claims KenGen was supposed to pay 420 million
shillings a year for use of the hydropower facility, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing Francis Agoya, managing
director of the Tana and Athi River Development Authority. The
company said it doesn’t owe the government any money, the
newspaper said, citing Managing Director Eddy Njoroge.  Kaara Wainaina, a spokesman for KenGen, said he couldn’t
immediately comment when Bloomberg contacted him by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
