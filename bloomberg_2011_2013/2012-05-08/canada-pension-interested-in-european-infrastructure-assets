Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
is “very interested” in European infrastructure assets despite
concerns about the region, said  Mark Wiseman , executive vice
president of investments for the Toronto-based  fund manager .  “We’re quite concerned about the outcome of continental
 Europe ,” Wiseman said during a panel discussion at Bloomberg’s
Canada Economic Summit in Toronto. “Having said that, we’re
very interested in infrastructure assets in Europe right now.
We’re seeing an increasing number of those come to market.”  Canada Pension has been investing in private companies and
infrastructure in the past decade, buying stakes in utilities,
pipelines and companies as it diversifies from stocks and fixed
income assets. Canada Pension, with C$152.8 billion ($152.9
billion) in assets of Dec. 31, manages retirement funds for 18
million Canadians in every province except Quebec.  Wiseman takes over as chief executive officer for Canada
Pension in June, after CEO David Denison retires.  To contact the reporters on this story:
