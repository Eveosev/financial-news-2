President William C. Dudley called for greater international
coordination of economic and regulatory policies to improve the
stability of the world financial system.  “We need to understand where greater global perspective is
required and we need to apply that perspective consistently
across jurisdictions in a timely manner,” Dudley said in the
text of remarks given in Zurich today. Otherwise, “we won’t
achieve all the benefits that are possible from global
specialization and we will continue to run significant risks
with respect to financial stability.”  Dudley said transparency in economic policy helps improve
international cooperation, as authorities better understand the
goals of counterparts in other nations.  He gave the example of the Fed, which is trying to
“provide greater clarity” about its inflation target and
emphasizes that actions such as purchases of  government
securities  are driven by monetary policy goals and won’t
“continue beyond the moment they become inconsistent with our
dual mandate objectives,” he said.  Dudley also called for global standards for so-called
central counterparty clearinghouses that would clear
standardized over-the-counter derivatives trading around the
world. Resolution regimes must also be developed for globally
systemic financial institutions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
