India’s bonds rose the most in three
months after the central bank said it will purchase sovereign
debt at an open-market auction this week.  Yields on notes due 2024 fell from a one-week high after
the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a statement yesterday that it
will offer to buy a total of 120 billion rupees ($2.3 billion)
of securities maturing in 2020, 2024, 2030 and 2032. Government
notes also gained as a drop in  oil prices  tempered concern
 inflation  in Asia’s third-largest economy will accelerate.  “The fact that the central bank has announced open-market
bond purchases likely means the market will expect continued”
buying by the monetary authority,  Ju Wang , a Singapore-based
strategist in Barclays Capital, wrote in a report today. “This
will likely result in bond yields drifting lower.”  The yield on the 9.15 percent note due November 2024
dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.57
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level since April 24.  Crude oil in  New York  lost 7.1 percent this month to $97.37
per barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Inflation
in India, which imports almost 80 percent of the oil it uses,
averaged 6.9 percent in the first quarter.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
was little changed at 8.03 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
