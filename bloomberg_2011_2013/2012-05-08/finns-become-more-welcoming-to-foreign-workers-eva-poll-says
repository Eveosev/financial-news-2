Finns are again becoming more
welcoming to foreign workers after the financial crisis soured
attitudes to an influx from abroad, a poll showed.  About a third of Finns backed making it easier for
foreigners to enter the country to reduce the strain caused by
the aging population, up from 25 percent a year ago, according a
poll commissioned by the  Finnish Business and Policy Forum EVA 
in Helsinki.  Finland has the fastest-aging population in  Europe . By
2020, about 2 1/2 working-age people will support one pensioner,
down from about four in 2000, the European Union’s statistics
office projects. The government is raising taxes and cutting
spending by a total 2.7 billion euros ($3.5 billion) to tackle a
 budget deficit .  About 43 percent of Finns were against easier entry for
foreign workers, down from 56 percent last year, EVA said. The
attitudes to foreign workers haven’t been as lenient since the
second half of 2006, EVA data shows.  The survey had 1,271 respondents and a margin of error of
as much as 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
