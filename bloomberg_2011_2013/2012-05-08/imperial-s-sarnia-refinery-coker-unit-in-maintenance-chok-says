Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s Sarnia oil
refinery in Ontario began several weeks of maintenance on one of
its units on May 7, local radio station CHOK Country said on its
 website  yesterday.  The plant’s coker unit was taken out of service on May 6,
resulting in a plume of thick black smoke that lasted a couple of
hours that morning, CHOK said. Other units will remain in 
operation, the radio station said. The refinery can process 
121,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Imperial didn’t immediately return a phonecall to the
Calgary, Canada-based company’s media relations department
before normal business hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
