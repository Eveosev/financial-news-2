South  Korea ’s won rose for the first
time in four days, rebounding after elections in France and
Greece fanned concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and
triggered the currency’s biggest loss in a month yesterday.
 Government bonds  declined.  Germany , the euro region’s biggest economy, reported a
bigger-than-forecast increase in factory orders yesterday and
data today is expected to show the nation’s industrial output
rose 0.8 percent in March from February, based on the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. French president-elect Francois
Hollande’s platform calls for austerity measures to be delayed
and Greek political leaders will meet for a second day today in
a bid to form a government.  “The  currency market  is taking a breather after the recent
decline, but gains will be limited with lingering uncertainties
in  Europe ,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst
at Woori Futures Inc. “Investors will refrain from betting
strongly on a position with no major economic data due in the
next couple of days.”  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,135.38 per dollar as
of 9:22 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It dropped 0.6 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since April 4.
One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, dropped 23 basis points, or
0.23 percentage point, to 7.64 percent.  South Korean producer prices rose 2.4 percent in April from
a year earlier, the smallest increase since February 2010,
official figures showed today. The  Bank of Korea  will probably
leave its benchmark interest  rate  unchanged at 3.25 percent at a
May 10 policy meeting, according to all 15 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 rose climbed for the first time in four days, advancing two
basis points to 3.39 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures slid 0.04 today to 104.44 and the one-
year  interest-rate  swap held steady at 3.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
