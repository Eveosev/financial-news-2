Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
company led by  Elon Musk , fell to the lowest price in more than
three months after  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  said its RAV4 sport-
utility vehicle with batteries and motor from Tesla costs twice
as much as a gasoline version.  Tesla declined 7 percent to $30.19 at the close in  New
York , the lowest level since Feb. 1. The Palo Alto, California-
based company plans to release first-quarter results tomorrow.  “The details of the RAV4 EV that Toyota gave out yesterday
were a little disappointing,” said Ben Schuman, an  analyst
with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who rates
Tesla shares sector perform, the equivalent of hold. The
manufacturer’s suggested retail price “is a little bit high to
make it appealing to a larger buyer group.”  Toyota said yesterday the electric RAV4 that goes 100 miles
(161 kilometers) per charge will sell for $49,800 when it goes
on sale this year in  California . The Toyota City, Japan-based
company, a Tesla investor, plans to deliver 2,600 units over the
next three years,  Bob Carter , Toyota’s U.S. group vice president
said at the model’s unveiling at the  Electric Vehicle Symposium 
in Los Angeles.  The base price of a 2012 RAV4 with a 2.5-liter gasoline
engine is $22,650 on Toyota’s website.  Toyota in July 2011 agreed to pay Tesla a total of $100
million to supply lithium-ion battery packs, motors, software
and other parts for the RAV4 project, part of a three-year
contract, according to a filing by Tesla with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Based on Toyota’s 2,600-unit sales goal for
the model, it’s paying $38,462 for components per vehicle.  “We don’t talk about development costs and costs to bring
vehicles to market,”  John Hanson , a spokesman for Toyota, said
today. Both Carter and J.B. Straubel, Tesla’s chief technology
officer, declined to discuss vehicle cost details in interviews
in  Los Angeles  yesterday.  Tesla may report a loss of 70 cents per share tomorrow,
excluding some items, the average of 11 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
