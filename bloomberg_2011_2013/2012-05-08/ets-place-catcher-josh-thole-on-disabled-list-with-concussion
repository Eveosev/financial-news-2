The  New York Mets  placed
catcher Josh Thole on the seven-day disabled list with a
concussion, one day after he was injured in a home-plate
collision with Ty Wigginton of the  Philadelphia Phillies .  The Mets also said today in a release that they had
promoted catcher Rob Johnson from their minor-league affiliate
in Buffalo, New York.  Thole, 25, is batting .284 in 26 games for the Mets this
season. Mike Nickeas, 29, is expected to take over as New Yorkâ€™s
starting catcher with Thole sidelined.  Johnson, 29, spent the 2011 season with the San Diego
Padres, batting .190 with three home runs and 16 RBIs in 67
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
