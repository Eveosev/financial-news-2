Minority Capital Partners LLP,  a
London-based asset manager founded by former  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  bankers, is seeking to raise 150 million
pounds ($242 million) for a fund to invest in small and medium-
sized companies.  The European Investment Fund, a unit of the  European
Investment Bank , has agreed to invest 33 million pounds in the
Minority Capital Partners Fund that targets more than 20 percent
annual return, according to Bruce McLaren, who formed the firm
in 2009 with Alastair Weinel.  The fund will focus on providing debt or equity funding to
companies valued at less than 100 million pounds in return for a
minority stake, McLaren said.  “There is a dearth of capital for this type of company
because banks have limited appetite to provide this sort of risk
capital,” McLaren said in a telephone interview. “There are
very few places entrepreneurial owners can go to if they don’t
want to give up a controlling stake. So there is a clear gap in
the market.”  McLaren joined RBS in 1993 providing lending to mid-market
leveraged buyouts, before setting up RBS Debt Ventures with
Weinel in 2000, a mezzanine financing business for private
companies. He subsequently became a managing director in the
Edinburgh-based bank’s private equity unit, according to
Minority Capital’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
