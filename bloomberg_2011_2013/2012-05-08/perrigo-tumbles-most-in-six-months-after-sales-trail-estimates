Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  slumped the most in six
months in New York trading after the largest U.S. maker of
generic over-the-counter drugs reported  revenue  that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Allegan, Michigan-based drugmaker slid 3.6
percent to $100 by 4:30 p.m. in New York, the sharpest drop
since Oct. 27. The  Tel Aviv shares  fell 4.4 percent to 378
shekels, or the equivalent of $99.28.  Sales grew 13 percent to $778 million in the third quarter
ending March 31, Perrigo said in a PRNewswire statement
distributed today. The median  estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg called for a rise of 19 percent to $823 million.
The drugmaker also lowered its 2012 growth outlook to between 15
percent and 18 percent, from 17 percent to 20 percent, citing a
mild flu season.  Revenue was “extremely light and investors expected
more,” Frank Pinkerton, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey, Inc., who has a buy rating on the shares, said by
phone from Atlanta today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
