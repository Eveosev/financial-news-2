Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) ,  Brazil ’s second-
largest retailer by market value, posted a 36.4 percent drop in
its first-quarter profit and missed forecasts as financial
expenses increased.  Sao Paulo-based Lojas Americanas posted a profit of 36.3
million reais in the first quarter compared with a profit of
57.1 million reais in the same period last year, according to a
statement on its website. The result was below the median
estimate of nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg for adjusted
profit of 50.2 million reais.  Lojas Americanas’s net financial result was a loss of 108.3
million reais in the quarter, compared with a loss of 69.5
million reais in the same period last year.  Net sales rose 18 percent to 1.45 billion reais from 1.23
billion reais a year earlier. For the consolidated group, sales
including the subsidiaries rose 8.1 percent to 2.44 billion
reais.  B2W Cia. Global de Varejo , Brazil’s biggest online retailer
and a subsidiary of Lojas Americanas, also posted a worse-than-
expected result in the quarter. B2W said it had a consolidated
first-quarter loss of 42.8 million reais, worse than the mean
estimate of nine analysts consulted by Bloomberg of an adjusted
net loss of 17.6 million reais. The result compares with a 1.6
million loss a year earlier. Sales fell 2.7 percent to 1 billion
