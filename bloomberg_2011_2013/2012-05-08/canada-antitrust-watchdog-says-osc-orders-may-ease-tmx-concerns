Melanie Aitken, Canada’s Competition
Bureau commissioner, said draft rules released by the Ontario
Securities Commission last week may address the Bureau’s
concerns about a proposed bid for  TMX Group Inc. (X)   Aitken said the Bureau is consulting market participants to
determine what effect the rules proposed by the securities
regulator may have on the offer from Maple Group Acquisition
Corp., a group of Canadian banks and pension funds.  “We’re doing what we always do, which is talk to the
market about what they think,” Aitken said today at the
Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit in Toronto.  Ontario’s securities regulator set conditions on May 3 for
a C$3.73 billion ($3.73 billion) takeover of the Toronto Stock
Exchange operator, including ownership restrictions and a
requirement for independent board members, that moves Maple’s
proposed purchase a step closer to approval.  The Bureau said in an e-mailed statement April 27 that “it
is possible that the OSC’s recognition orders could materially
change the regulatory environment such that, if enforced, our
serious concerns may be substantially mitigated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
