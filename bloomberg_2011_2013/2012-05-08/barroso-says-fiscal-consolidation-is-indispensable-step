European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said budget consolidation is an “indispensable step”
for countries such as Spain and Greece on Europe’s periphery.  “If not, they will pay every day higher  interest rates  for
their debt,” Barroso said in a speech in Brussels today. He
said other nations with more leeway should pursue a strategy of
consolidation, growth and investment that takes into account
their national circumstances.  Barroso repeated his welcome of calls for growth from
Francois Hollande, the socialist winner of France’s May 6
presidential election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
