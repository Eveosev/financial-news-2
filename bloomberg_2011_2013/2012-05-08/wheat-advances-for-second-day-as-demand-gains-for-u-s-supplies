Wheat gained for a second day on signs
that a 23 percent slump in the year through yesterday may have
boosted demand for U.S. supplies. Corn climbed.  The July-delivery contract rose as much as 1 percent to
$6.18 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at $6.155
at 3:14 p.m. Singapore time. Futures slumped 6.2 percent last
week, the most since the five days ended Sept. 23.  About 24 million bushels bound for export were  inspected  at
ports in the U.S., the largest shipper, in the week ended May 3,
up 21 percent from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday.  “The sell-off last week certainly is helping uncover more
international demand,” Simon Clancy, a director for brokerage
services at Advance Trading Australasia Pty., said by phone from
Sydney today. “It certainly continued to make U.S. wheat very
attractive from an export perspective.”  Stockpiles in  Australia , the second-biggest shipper, may be
8 million metric tons at Sept. 30, according to Emerald Group
Australia Pty. Reserves were 8.97 million tons last year, data
from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences showed.  Corn for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to $6.2475 a bushel,
while soybeans for delivery in the same month were little
changed at $14.6475 a bushel after gaining 0.4 percent.  Soybean stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
are poised to drop to the lowest relative to consumption since
at least 1965 after drought decimated crops across  South America ,
driving  China  to buy more from Midwest farmers. Inventories will
probably decline 20 percent to 172 million bushels (4.68 million
tons) before next year’s harvest, according to the average of 31
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
