Pakistan Steel Mills Corp. will import
40,000 metric tons of iron ore from  Iran  to speed up steel
production, state-run Iranian news agency  Fars  reported, citing
unidentified individuals.  Importing iron ore from Iran costs less than buying the
steelmaking raw material on international markets and saves
time, Fars said, without elaborating on the transaction.  The first consignment of 20,000 tons will reach Port Qasim,
Karachi, this month and a second will arrive by early June, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
