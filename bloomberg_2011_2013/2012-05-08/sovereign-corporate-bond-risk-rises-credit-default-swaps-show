The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 1.5 basis points to 277 at
8:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 17
basis points to 672. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings climbed 4.5 basis points
to 149 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 6 basis points to 250 and the
subordinated index was up 7.5 at 405.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
