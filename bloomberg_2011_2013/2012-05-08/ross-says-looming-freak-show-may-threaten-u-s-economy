The  U.S. economy  is at risk of
slipping back into recession in 2013 because of likely impasses
in Washington over taxes and mandatory spending cuts, said
 Wilbur Ross , the billionaire investor.  “That’s too big a hit for the economy to take,” Ross said
today during a discussion at Bloomberg Markets’ Global Financial
Elite lunch in  New York . “We’re going to have another freak
show at the end of the year.”  Ross said he’s worried that President  Barack Obama  and
Congress won’t be able to agree on extending tax cuts passed
under former President George W. Bush that expire at the end of
2012, or on mandatory spending cuts tied to the extension of the
country’s debt-ceiling agreement. He said he’s optimistic about
the U.S. economy between now and then, and found a new way to
describe the shape of the recovery beyond a “W.”  “It’s more like punctuation,” he said. “Dots, dashes,
question marks and an occasional exclamation point.”  W.L. Ross & Co., his namesake firm known for buying
distressed assets in industries from steel to financial
services, is largely avoiding investments in what he called
“the Club Med countries” of  Europe , according to Ross.  “It’s way too unsettled, even for our tastes, to be in
Spain or countries like that just yet,” he said, adding that he
has made deals in countries including Ireland. “You have to be
very selective within Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
