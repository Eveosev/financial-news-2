Christopher Marut was appointed as the
next U.S. representative to  Taiwan , succeeding William Stanton,
 the American Institute in Taiwan  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Marut will take up the post as de facto ambassador to
Taiwan in August, according to the statement from AIT, the U.S.
State Department’s representative organization. The U.S. doesn’t
have formal diplomatic relations with the island.  The Connecticut-born career diplomat’s most recent post was
head of the State Department’s Office of Australia, New Zealand
and Pacific Island Affairs. Before that, he served as deputy
consul general in  Hong Kong , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
