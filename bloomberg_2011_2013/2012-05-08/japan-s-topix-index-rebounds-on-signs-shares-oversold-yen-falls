Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index rebounding from its worst slide in nine months, amid
speculation shares on the gauge were oversold. Gains in the yen
eased, brightening the outlook for exporters.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets almost 80 percent of
its revenue overseas, gained 3.1 percent. Video-game developer
 Konami Corp. (9766)  rallied 7.1 percent after plunging 18 percent
yesterday.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270)  soared 7.3 percent after
the maker of Subaru cars and industrial machinery forecast
profit growth.  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  rose 3.8 percent on a report the
trading house is in talks to buy U.S. grain company Gavilon LLC.  “Technically, the price-to-book ratio is undervalued, and
that’s bolstering the market,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps
oversee $6.5 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“The yen is correcting after strengthening too much, which is
good for the market.”  The Topix rose 0.6 percent to 776.57 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, climbing back from yesterday’s 2.6 percent drop, the
steepest since Aug. 5. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.7
percent to 9,181.65, with volume about 13 percent below the 30-
day average.  The 25-day Toraku index, which compares advancing and
declining shares, fell to 67.9 yesterday, the lowest since Aug.
24. A reading below 70 suggests stocks are close to bottoming,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The Topix has advanced about 6.6 percent this year,
rebounding from last year’s 19 percent drop, amid signs the U.S.
economy is improving and on optimism the Chinese economy will
avoid a hard landing. Shares on the gauge trade at an average of
0.95 times book value, compared with 2.17 times for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index. A number less than one means that companies
can be bought for less than value of their assets.  Yen Weakens  Nissan gained 3.1 percent to 790 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker
of factory robots that gets more than 75 percent of its revenue
overseas, rose 1.1 percent to 13,630 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 105.05 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 103.72 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened
to 80.13 from 79.83. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  “The yen’s climb, one of the biggest market concerns, has
halted, driving gains in exporters’ shares,” said Fumiyuki
Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent today. The gauge
finished little changed yesterday in  New York , recovering from a
0.4 percent decline after billionaire investor  Warren Buffett 
said American lenders are in “fine shape,” propelling a rally
in banking shares.  Japanese stocks fell yesterday as concern grew that
Europe’s commitment to budget cuts as a remedy to the debt
crisis may waver after  Francois Hollande  was elected France’s
first Socialist president in almost two decades and Greek anti-
bailout parties made a surprisingly strong showing at the polls.  Konami Climbs Back  Konami, which yesterday had the biggest  decline  on the
Nikkei 225, jumped 7.1 percent to 2,024 yen. The stock yesterday
plunged on a report the government found that some social-gaming
operators used sales systems that violated the law.  Nippon Light
Metal (5701) , an aluminum producer, gained 2.7 percent to 115 yen after
tumbling 6.7 percent yesterday on declining metals prices.  “The results of the elections in France and Greece weren’t
a surprise. Investors who had expected the results and sold
shares are now buying them back,” Shinkin Asset Management’s
Fujiwara said.  Fuji Heavy soared 7.3 percent to 602 yen, the biggest gain
in the Nikkei 225, after forecasting a 25 percent jump in profit
to 48 billion yen ($600 million) this fiscal year as it targets
record sales on rising demand in the U.S. and China.  Marubeni, Japan’s biggest grain trading company, advanced
3.8 percent to 550 yen. The trading house is in exclusive talks
to buy closely held U.S. grain handler Gavilon Group LLC for
about $5 billion including debt, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
