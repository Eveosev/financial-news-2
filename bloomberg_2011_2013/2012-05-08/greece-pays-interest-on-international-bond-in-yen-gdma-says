Greece paid the interest due today on
20 billion yen ($250 million) of international bonds in yen,
according to Petros Christodoulou, the head of the Greek Debt
Management Agency in  Athens .  Europe ’s most indebted nation didn’t offer to swap the 4.5
percent bonds due 2016 when it exchanged more than 200 billion
euros ($260 billion) of bonds for new securities with a lower
face value and longer maturities, Christodoulou said in an e-
mail. The notes are among bonds issued under foreign rather than
Greek law that sidestepped losses imposed under the biggest-ever
sovereign bond restructuring, completed last month.  Greek political leaders are seeking the support needed to
form a coalition government after Greek voters flocked to anti-
bailout parties on May 6, calling into question the country’s
ability to impose the measures needed to guarantee its future in
the euro.  Greece ’s financing costs rose for the first time this
year today at a 1.3 billion-euro auction of treasury bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
