Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.2 percent to 1,532.3386.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a fifth day after  Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister
 Ali al-Naimi  said prices are too high and a survey signaled that
inventories rose to the most in more than 21 years in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 82 cents to $97.12
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $97.16 at 3:13 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract slid 55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $97.94 yesterday, the
lowest close since Feb. 6. Prices are down 1.7 percent this
year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures were little changed after rising 2.5
percent yesterday  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 75 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $16.05 a barrel at 11:30
a.m.  Singapore  time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a measure of processing
profit, narrowed by the largest percentage since March 19.

lowest so far this year, PVM data showed.  Naphtha swaps for June rebounded $6, or 0.7 percent, to
$935.25 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical
feedstock ended the longest losing streak since January 2011.
Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures increased
$3.44 to $80.14 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The difference, also known as the crack spread,
widened for the first time in three days.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a second day on concern about the future
of  Greece ’s membership in the euro region, weakening the common
currency against the dollar and damping demand for alternative
investments.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1,630.45 an ounce
before trading at $1,631.59 at 2:56 p.m. in Singapore, extending
yesterday’s 0.2 percent fall. The euro held near a three-month
low as Greek leaders struggle to form a new government after
voters flocked to anti-austerity parties on May 6, calling into
question the country’s ability to impose the measures needed to
guarantee its future in the euro.  BASE METALS  Copper rose for the first time in four days in  London  amid
a tightening spot market in  China , the biggest user, and on
expectations that  Spain  will use public funds to bolster banks.  The metal for delivery in three months gained as much as
1.2 percent to $8,268.75 a metric ton, the biggest gain since
April 27, on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$8,238.50 at 2:02 p.m. Shanghai time. The bourse was closed for
a holiday yesterday. August-delivery copper on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 57,850  yuan  ($9,171) a ton.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat gained for a second day on signs that a 23 percent
slump in the year through yesterday may have boosted demand for
U.S. supplies. Corn and soybeans climbed.  The July-delivery contract rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$6.1575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at
$6.1475 at 12:19 p.m. Singapore time. Futures slumped 6.2
percent last week, the most since the five days ended Sept. 23.  Corn for July delivery rose 0.7 percent to $6.24 a bushel,
while soybeans for delivery in the same month added 0.2 percent
to $14.6875 a bushel.  Palm oil  gained on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia ,
the second-largest supplier, may have declined in April as
exports increased.  The July-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.8 percent
to 3,388 ringgit ($1,109) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 3,384 ringgit at the close of
the morning session in  Kuala Lumpur .  May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Rubber fell to the lowest level in
