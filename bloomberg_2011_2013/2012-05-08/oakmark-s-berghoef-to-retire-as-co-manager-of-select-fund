Henry Berghoef, co-manager of the $3.1
billion Oakmark Select Fund, will retire at the end of July.  Berghoef, 63, has worked at Harris Associates LP, the
investment firm that manages the Oakmark funds and separate
accounts, since 1994 and has overseen the Select Fund with
William Nygren since 2000, according to a  statement  today from
the Chicago-based company.  Oakmark Select, which focuses on about 20  value stocks , has
beaten 92 percent of its peers with a 20 percent annual average
return over the past three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Nygren, who has run the fund since its 1996 inception
and also oversees the $6 billion Oakmark Fund, was named
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) ’s domestic stock fund manager of the year for
2001.  “Over his years of service, Henry has made extraordinary
contributions as an analyst, director of research, Select Fund
co-manager and member of the Harris management committee,”
Nygren said in the statement.  A co-manager for the Select Fund is expected to be named
within the next year, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
