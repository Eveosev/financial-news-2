Embraer SA (EMBR3)  will bid again on a
contract for U.S. Air Force light-attack aircraft, after its
initial victory on the project was reversed when a competitor
sued the military.  The plan was announced today by Luiz Carlos Aguiar, chief
executive officer of Embraer’s defense unit, according to the
planemaker’s press office.  Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based
Embraer won the contract with Sierra Nevada Corp. in December.
The U.S. dropped the award after Hawker Beechcraft Corp. filed a
suit over the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
