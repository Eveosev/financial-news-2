American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
non-U.S. property-casualty businesses are “begging” to be
rebranded so that their operations can be associated with the
AIG name, the head of commercial insurance lines said.  AIG faces “no reputational issue whatsoever in our P&C
business,”  John Doyle , chief executive officer of global
commercial insurance at the Chartis property-casualty unit, said
at a conference today in  New York . “In fact, I would say to you
that our international operations are begging us to rebrand as
AIG.”  AIG’s global property-casualty business changed its name to
Chartis in 2009 from AIU Holdings LLC after 7,000 brokers,
clients and employees were surveyed about whether the unit
needed a brand more distinct from its parent. Wrong-way bets on
the housing market forced the insurer to take a U.S. government
bailout in 2008 that swelled to $182.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
