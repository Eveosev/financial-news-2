Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell 1.4
percent to 17,523.19 by the close in Budapest, retreating for a
fifth day, the longest such streak since August.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, declined
1.6 percent to 3,648 forint. European stocks fell after Greece’s
biggest party failed to form an agreement on a new government,
increasing concern that the region’s debt crisis will deepen.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s largest refiner, weakened 0.9 percent
to 16,845 forint. Oil fell for a fifth day after Saudi Arabia’s
Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said prices are “still a bit high”
and a survey signaled that inventories rose to the most in more
than 21 years in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
