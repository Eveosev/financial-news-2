The  New York Knicks  began talks with
interim coach  Mike Woodson  on taking the job full time after he
rallied the franchise to a winning record and a playoff
appearance, according to the New York Daily News.  The negotiations are in the preliminary stages “but it is
clear that Madison Square Garden management is convinced Woodson
is the right man for the job and will not pursue either Phil Jackson or Kentucky head coach John Calipari,” the  Daily News
said  without citing a source.  The Knicks were 18-24, having lost six straight, when coach
Mike D’Antoni resigned on March 14. Woodson took the helm and
the team responded by winning the next five games and eight of
nine. In 24 contests under Woodson,  New York  went 18-6 to finish
the lockout-shortened regular season at 36-30, in second place
in the Atlantic Division behind the  Boston Celtics .  The Knicks trail the Miami Heat 3-1 in their best-of-seven
opening-round playoff series. New York won the last game 89-87,
snapping a National Basketball Association record 13-game
postseason losing streak. Game 5 is tomorrow in Miami.  Woodson coached the Atlanta Hawks from 2004-05 to 2009-10,
posting a 208-286 record while leading the franchise to the
playoffs during his final three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
