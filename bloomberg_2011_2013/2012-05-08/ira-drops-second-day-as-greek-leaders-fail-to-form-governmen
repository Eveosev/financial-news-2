The lira weakened the most in almost a
month and bonds sank as Greek politicians failed to form a
government after weekend elections, clouding the outlook for
 Europe , which buys half of Turkish exports.  The lira depreciated 1 percent to 1.7773 per dollar at 5
p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest loss since April 10. The  yield  on
two-year benchmark debt increased for a third day, adding seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 9.53 percent, the
highest since March 26.  The euro retreated for a seventh day against the dollar
after Greece’s New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said he
failed to form a coalition government following the election,
passing the opportunity to Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza party.
Tsipras said today he would forge ahead with plans to form a
government of left-wing parties that would nationalize banks,
repeal recent labor reforms and cancel the nation’s bailout
accords.  “The expectation is very strong that  Greece  will fail to
form a government and will go to election once more on June
17,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Istanbul-based Garanti
Yatirim Menkul Degerler, said in e-mailed comments.  Turkey ’s central bank refrained from lending at the lowest
policy rate of 5.75 percent for a third day in its repo auctions
to support the lira after a government report showed last week
 inflation  accelerated to 11.1 percent in April from 10.4 percent
in the previous month, the highest yearly advance in 3 1/2
years, as food and energy costs rose.  The Treasury in Ankara sold a total net 1.17 billion liras
($663 million) of March 2014 benchmark bonds at an average yield
of 9.46 percent in an auction and earlier non-competitive sale,
borrowing at a lower cost than last month’s 9.49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
