Dubai police confiscated an Emarati
woman’s car after she racked up 127,000 dirhams ($35,000) of
traffic fines in six months,  Al Bayan  reported, citing Mohammed
Al Zafeen, who heads the emirate’s traffic police.  The woman, in her twenties, had to give up her 350,000-
dirham BMW as she wasn’t able to pay the fines, which included
80 penalties for speeding, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
