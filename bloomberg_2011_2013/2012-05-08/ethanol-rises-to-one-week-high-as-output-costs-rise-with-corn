Ethanol futures rose to the highest
price in a week in  Chicago  as corn increased, raising production
costs for the biofuel.  Futures followed corn higher on speculation farmers are
withholding supply to fetch higher prices. The grain is used to
make ethanol in the U.S., with one bushel making at least 2.75
gallons of the fuel.  “We had a very sharp rally in old-crop corn,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“That’s helped a little bit with the ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 0.5 cent to
settle at $2.206 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since May 1. Ethanol has fallen 14 percent in the
past year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 1.5 cents
to $2.175 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
5:01 p.m. in  New York . On the U.S. Gulf Coast, the biofuel added
1.5 cents to $2.24.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 2 cents to $2.335 a gallon
and in New York the additive rose 2 cents to $2.265.  Corn for July delivery advanced 3 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$6.23 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
