Serbia’s fiscal gap will reach 5.7
percent of its economic output by the end of 2012 assuming no
major shocks to revenue and spending and no change to economic
and tax policies, the Economics Institute said.  The government must focus immediately on fiscal policy, cut
the deficit and limit the public debt to maintain economic
stability, the Belgrade-based institute said today. Serbia’s
opposition Progressive Party, led by  Tomislav Nikolic , won a
narrow victory over the  Democratic Party  of  Boris Tadic  in
elections on May 6.  “Fiscal consolidation will be the buzz word in the months
ahead,” Miladin Kovacevic, deputy head of the Serbian
Statistics Office and the institute’s analyst, told reporters in
Belgrade. “Different models and assumptions” indicate that
this year’s budget revenue will drop by at least 42 billion
dinars ($487 million) “boosting the consolidated fiscal gap
from 152 billion dinars to almost 200 billion,” he said.  According to its own fiscal rules, Serbia needs to keep the
fiscal deficit within 4.5 percent of GDP and public debt below
45 percent of total economic output.  The outgoing cabinet of Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic has
not updated fiscal statistics since February, when the two-month
gap stood at 41.3 billion dinars, compared with a 26-billion
dinar target agreed with the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
