The  Big 12  Conference has reached a
media rights agreement with ESPN and Fox that’s worth $2.6
billion over 13 years,  CBSSports.com reported  yesterday, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  The contract, worth $200 million annually through 2025,
puts the Big 12’s college sports media deal at about the same
level as that for the Pac-12, Southeastern and Big Ten
conferences, CBSSports said. Big 12 spokesman Rob Carolla didn’t
return a message seeking comment.  The Big 12 this year is losing Texas A&M and the University
of Missouri, a year after the University of Nebraska and the
University of Colorado both left the conference. The Big 12 is
adding West Virginia and Texas Christian next season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
