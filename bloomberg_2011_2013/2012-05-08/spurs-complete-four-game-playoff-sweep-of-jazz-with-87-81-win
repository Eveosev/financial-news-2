The  San Antonio  Spurs moved into the
second round of the National Basketball Association playoffs by
beating the  Utah Jazz  87-81 to complete a four-game sweep.  Manu Ginobili scored 17 points while Tony Parker and Tim Duncan each had 11 last night in Salt Lake City as the Spurs,
the top seed in the Western Conference, avenged their opening-
round ouster from a year ago. San Antonio last season was also
the No. 1 team in the West and got eliminated by the eighth-
seeded Memphis Grizzlies.  “We weren’t looking ahead,” Duncan said. “It was good to
get these guys done with and move on to the next round.”  The Spurs, who tied the  Chicago Bulls  for the NBA’s best
regular-season record at 50-16, advance to face the Los Angeles
Clippers or Grizzlies in the Western Conference semifinals. The
Clippers beat the Grizzlies 101-97 in overtime last night in Los
Angeles for a 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven series.  San Antonio used a 21-3 first-half scoring run to open a
14-point lead at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City.  After the Jazz pulled within three points late in the third
quarter, Ginobili hit consecutive 3-pointers to push the Spurs’
advantage back to 10 points. San Antonio stretched its lead to
as much as 21 points, at 81-60 with six minutes remaining.  The Jazz, led by 26 points and 10 rebounds from Al Jefferson, responded with a 19-2 scoring run to pull within four
points with under a minute left. Parker then had a steal for San
Antonio and passed to Ginobili for a layup with 18 seconds left
that helped seal the Spurs’ win.  The Spurs hit 10-of-22 three-point shots, while the Jazz
missed all 13 of their attempts from beyond the arc.  Griffin Leads Clippers  At the Staples Center in  Los Angeles , Chris Paul scored
eight of his 27 points during overtime as the Clippers pulled
out the win.  Blake Griffin  led Los Angeles with 30 points before
fouling out.  Mike Conley had 25 points and Rudy Gay added 23 points for
the Grizzlies, who had finished the fourth quarter with a 13-3
scoring run to force overtime.  The Clippers can win their second playoff series since
moving to Los Angeles in 1985 with a Game 5 victory in Memphis
tomorrow.  Four playoff games are scheduled for tonight.  The Bulls, the Eastern Conference’s top seed, host the
 Philadelphia 76ers  after losing three straight games to trail 3-
1 in their series. Also in the East, the  Indiana Pacers  are home
to the Orlando Magic and the  Boston Celtics  visit the  Atlanta
Hawks . The Pacers and Celtics hold 3-1 series leads.  The Los Angeles Lakers host the Denver Nuggets tonight with
a 3-1 advantage in their Western Conference series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
