Canadian oils weakened after power
failed at Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Illinois  refinery  and Imperial
Oil Ltd. said a unit at its Sarnia, Ontario, plant was
undergoing planned work.  Citgo reported emissions at the Lemont refinery, which
processes Canadian crude, because of the power malfunction
yesterday, according to a  filing  with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency. Imperial began work yesterday that is
expected to last several weeks. The 121,000-barrel-a-day Sarnia
refinery halted production at a coker unit May 6 after an upset.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $1.15 to $16 a barrel at 2 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude’s premium to WTI
narrowed 10 cents to $2.10.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark was unchanged
at $1 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 75 cents to $15.85 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 85 cents to
$16.65.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $11.25 a barrel.
Poseidon’s lost 85 cents to $10.15, while Southern Green
Canyon’s decreased 25 cents to $10.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 10 cents
against WTI to a premium of $15.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
