Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  slid 2.2 percent
to 2,168.35 by the close in Warsaw, the lowest in two weeks.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest oil
refiner, fell 4.1 percent to 27.25 zloty, the lowest level since
March 30, after saying the probability that an oil field off the
coast of Norway starting production next January is “very, very
low.”  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)  , advanced 1.6 percent
to 126 zloty, rising for the first time in three days after the
country’s second-largest publicly traded coal producer was rated
new overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co. An overweight
