Mr. Met , the spherical embodiment of
the Major League Baseball team, was honored by the  New York 
Senate after being named best mascot by a company that measures
the perception of celebrities and their impact on brands.  Among the reasons: “Mr. Met is the official mascot of
Major League Baseball’s New  York  Mets; he is a man with a
large baseball for a head and can be seen at Citi Field during
Mets home games.”  The  resolution  approved today on a voice vote congratulated
Mr. Met for being named No. 1 in the U.S. in a fan survey
conducted by the Marketing Arm, a Dallas-based firm. He defeated
the Phillie Phanatic.  The Senate also listed Mr. Met’s being elected to the
Mascot Hall of Fame, among other achievements.  “His legacy stands as a sterling example for all
mascots,” the resolution said.  Mr. Met was introduced on scorecards in 1963, when the Mets
played at the Polo Grounds in northern  Manhattan , according to
the resolution. He is believed to be the first mascot in  Major
League Baseball  to exist in human form, the resolution said.  “Be it resolved that this Legislative Body pause in its
deliberations to congratulate Mr. Met,” the resolution
concluded.  It will be sent to the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
