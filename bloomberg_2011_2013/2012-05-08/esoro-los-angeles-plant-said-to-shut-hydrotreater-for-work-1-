Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  shut a hydrotreater at
its Los Angeles refinery over the weekend for maintenance,
according to a person familiar with plant operations.  The shutdown will affect a fluid catalytic cracker at the
97,000-barrel-a-day refinery unless feedstock for the unit is
purchased, said the person, who isn’t authorized to speak for
the company and declined to be identified.  “It is Tesoro’s longstanding policy not to discuss the
status of specific units,” Tina Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  California blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles, rose
8.5 cents to 36 cents a gallon over New York Mercantile Exchange
futures at 2:44 p.m.  A hydrotreater removes sulfur, metal and other impurities
from refined oil products, allowing them to burn more cleanly as
fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
