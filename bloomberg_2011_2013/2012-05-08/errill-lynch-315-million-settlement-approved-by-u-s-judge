Bank of America Corp.  won final
approval of a $315 million settlement with investors who sued
its Merrill Lynch unit claiming they were misled about mortgage-
backed securities and lost money on their investments.  In an order filed publicly today, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that the settlement, reached in December between
Merrill Lynch and a class of investors led by the Public
Employees’ Retirement System of  Mississippi , is “fair,
reasonable and adequate.”  Holders of the asset-backed certificates sued Merrill Lynch
starting in December 2008 for alleged “false and misleading”
prospectus statements related to the securities. The investors
claimed Merrill made false statements about the qualifications
of mortgage-loan borrowers, property appraisals and debt-to-
income ratios of applicants, and that “the registration
statement materially misrepresented the credit quality of the
 mortgage loans  underlying the certificates.”  Merrill Lynch, bought by Bank of America in 2009, claimed
in settlement papers that the investor losses were the result of
“the overall economic downturn, housing-price declines and
reduced liquidity.”  Rakoff approved the settlement after holding a fairness
hearing in March.  The lead case is Public Employees’ Retirement System of
Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 08-CV-10841, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
