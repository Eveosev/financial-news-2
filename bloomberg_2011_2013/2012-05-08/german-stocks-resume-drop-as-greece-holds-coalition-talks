German stocks resumed declines, after
paring earlier losses, as the leader of  Greece ’s second-largest
party received a mandate to form a government.   The benchmark DAX Index dropped 0.7 percent to 6,521.46 at
2:31 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The start of trading was delayed for
more than an hour due to a malfunction on Deutsche Boerse AG’s
Xetra system. The broader HDAX Index fell 0.8 percent today.  Antonis Samaras, the leader of the New Democracy party in
Greece, said he failed to forge an agreement to form a
government. The attempt passes to Alexis Tsipras, head of
Syriza, the second-biggest party, which has vowed to cancel
bailout terms for the nation. Tsipras received a mandate from
the country’s President, Karolos Papoulias, to form a government
today.  German industrial output rose more than three times as much
as economists forecast in March, adding to signs  Europe ’s
largest economy may have avoided recession. Production jumped
2.8 percent from February, when it dropped 0.3 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
