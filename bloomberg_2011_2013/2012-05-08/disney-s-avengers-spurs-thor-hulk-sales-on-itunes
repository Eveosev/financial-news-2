“Marvel’s The Avengers,” last
weekend’s box-office record-setting film from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ,
is sparking sales and rentals of other comic-book hero movies on
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes.  “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger,” both
released last year, and “The Incredible Hulk” and “Iron
Man,” both from 2008,  rank  among the top 30 film downloads on
iTunes, Cupertino, California-based Apple said on its website.
“Hulk” also ranks No. 21 on iTunes movie  rentals , the only
Marvel film on that list.  “Avengers,” which collected a record $207.4 million in
box office sales when it was released last weekend, is leading
to sales of other films featuring the super-hero characters in
the new movie. None of the films appeared on the iTunes charts
before the “Avengers” was released into theaters.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, climbed 1.1 percent
to $44.30 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 18
percent so far this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
