SEB Bank AB, the biggest Lithuanian
lender in terms of assets, raised its 2012 economic growth
forecast for the country, citing better-than-expected first
quarter results, improving industrial output and consumption.  The Baltic nation’s  economy  will probably expand 3 percent
this year, compared with a previous forecast of 2 percent,
Vilija Tauraite, an economist with SEB in Vilnius, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Industry results have substantially improved at the start
of the year from the final months of 2011, as the situation in
key export markets was relatively good,” Tauraite said.
“Increasing domestic demand is also boosting optimism.”  Lithuania’s economy expanded a preliminary 3.9 percent in
the first quarter, slowing from the European Union’s second-
fastest pace of 4.4 percent in the previous three months.
Industrial output rose 3.8 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, after a 2.5 percent contraction in the final three
months on 2011. Retail sales increased an average 8 percent in
the first quarter from the same period last year.  “What’s important is that Lithuania’s economic growth
continues to be balanced,” Tauraite said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
