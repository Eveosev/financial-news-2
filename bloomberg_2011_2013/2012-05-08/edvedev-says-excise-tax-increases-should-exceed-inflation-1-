Dmitry Medvedev , who was nominated by
President  Vladimir Putin  to become  Russia ’s prime minister, said
the government should raise excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco
at a pace faster than the country’s price growth.  The increases should “substantially exceed inflation,”
with additional income transferred to regional budgets, Medvedev
told lawmakers in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
