Valentino Rossi, the nine-time MotoGP
world champion, will quit the motorcycle racing series at the
end of this season, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The 33-year-old Rossi, who has won seven of his titles in
the premier class, is said to have told his father, Graziano,
and his manager, Davide Brivio, that he will not race beyond
this year, the newspaper reported, citing people close to the
Italian racer it didn’t identify.  Rossi’s contract with the Ducati team expires at the end of
2012 and he had previously said that he wanted to sign a two-
year extension, the Telegraph added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
