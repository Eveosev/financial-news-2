DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-TV
provider, reported an 8.5 percent increase in first-quarter
profit as it focused on retaining U.S. customers rather than
adding new ones.  Net income rose to $731 million, or $1.07 a share, from
$674 million, or 85 cents, a year earlier, the El Segundo,
California-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
predicted earnings of $1.05 a share, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  DirecTV is using programming, including its exclusive NFL
Sunday Ticket football package, to persuade customers to stay
and fend off competition from  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  and cable
carriers such as  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  Chief Executive Officer Mike White, seeking to preserve profit margins, said on a conference
call that DirecTV will continue to focus on customer retention
instead of trying to win new users with aggressive promotions.  “DirecTV is choosing to spend on the subscribers that it
chooses to attract,”  Vijay Jayant , an ISI Group analyst in  New
York , said in an e-mail. DirecTV “is staying true to its
message of carefully balancing growth in favor of
profitability.”  DirecTV rose 0.3 percent to $48.03 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have gained 12 percent this year.  Subscriber Growth  The company added 81,000 U.S. customers in the quarter.
Growth slowed from 125,000 additions in 2011’s fourth quarter
and 327,000 in the third quarter. Average monthly revenue per
U.S. subscriber rose 3.6 percent to $91.99.  The company reduced promotional discounts for new customers
by about $5 per month in February, White said on the conference
call. DirecTV said last month it would again offer NFL Sunday
Ticket to new customers for free.  Cutting back on lower-priced offerings will raise average
monthly revenue “as we go through the year,” White said.  In  Latin America , DirecTV added a record 593,000 customers
after signing up 590,000 in the previous quarter.  Sales increased 12 percent to $7.05 billion from $6.32
billion. Analysts projected $7.04 billion.  “Very solid quarter for DirecTV, with continued strength
in Latin America, and better-than-expected margins driving
outperformance relative to our expectations,” said  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate credit at Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York.  The company bought back $1.3 billion of its stock in the
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
