Viterra Inc. (VT) ’s chief executive officer
said securities laws compelled him to tell a Canadian television
network in March that the company hadn’t been approached about a
possible takeover even though he had already met with the CEOs
of two potential acquirers.  “It was simply a matter of not getting in a situation of
selective disclosure to a discrete group of investors” watching
the interview, Mayo Schmidt said today at the Bloomberg Canada
Economic Summit in Toronto.  Schmidt said there hadn’t been any approach in a March 9
interview on Canadian business television channel BNN. Viterra
said in a statement later the same day that it had received
expressions of interest from third parties.  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  said March 20 it agreed to acquire Regina,
Saskatchewan-based Viterra for C$6.1 billion ($6.1 billion).  Meetings in February with the CEOs of the potential bidders
were disclosed yesterday in a filing. Viterra investors will
meet May 29 to vote on the takeover by Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
