Sina (SINA)  Corp., the Chinese Internet
operator trading at six times the valuations of Nasdaq Composite
Index companies, led declines among the nation’s stocks traded
in the U.S. as concern rose that global growth will stall.  Sina, which runs the Twitter-like Weibo service, fell 3.5
percent as of 1:52 p.m. in  New York , while  E-Commerce Dangdang
Inc. (DANG) , an online bookstore, sank 4.7 percent to the lowest since
March 23. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. lost 2.3 percent to 99.49, heading
for its lowest closing level since April 10.  Sina, which is expected to report a first-quarter loss next
week, traded at 91.5 times estimated earnings, compared with a
15.4 average valuation for companies on the Nasdaq Composite
Index.  China’s economy  grew at the lowest pace in more than two
years in the first quarter, raising concern that the online
advertising business will slow. Global stocks tumbled as the
struggle by Greek political leaders to form a coalition deepened
the concern about the region’s debt crisis.  “These stocks are not cheap,” Echo He, a New York-based
analyst who covers Chinese Internet stocks for Maxim Group LLC,
said by phone yesterday. “It’s not a consensus that the Chinese
economy will pick up. This is reflected in the volatility of the
stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
