A Beijing court has accepted Ai Weiwei’s lawsuit challenging the 15 million  yuan  ($2.4 million)
tax evasion penalty the government levied against the company
that markets his work, the artist said in an interview.  The Chaoyang District Court agreed to accept the case on
May 7, Ai said by phone yesterday. He said he expects the court
to take up the case “sooner rather than later,” though he did
not know exactly when. Calls made to the court after office
hours yesterday weren’t answered.  Ai, an internationally known artist who has criticized the
government, was detained for almost three months last year and
released without charges. After he was freed, authorities handed
him the bill for back taxes they said were owed by the company,
Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., which is controlled by
his wife. He said the the tax bill was “a joke” meant to cover
for the fact that he was never charged.  “This is a chance to look into the Chinese judicial
system,” Ai said.  Ai said the important thing is that the tax bureau’s case
against him will be made public, allowing people to judge for
themselves whether he was right or wrong.  “Every detail will be posted on the Internet and it will
be a part of history,” he said.  Ai had an installation at  London ’s Tate Modern gallery
turbine hall featuring millions of ceramic sunflower seeds. He
collaborated on the design of the Olympic Bird’s Nest Stadium in
Beijing, working with the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
