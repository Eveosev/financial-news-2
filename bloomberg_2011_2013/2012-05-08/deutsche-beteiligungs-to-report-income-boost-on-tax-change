Deutsche Beteiligungs AG (DBA)  will report a
one-time gain of more than 10 million euros ($13 million) in the
second quarter after the state of Hessenâ€™s fiscal authority
decided not to impose value-added tax on income from an
investment fund, the company said in a statement.  The company, based in  Frankfurt , said it allocated
provisions for potential tax liabilities in previous years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
