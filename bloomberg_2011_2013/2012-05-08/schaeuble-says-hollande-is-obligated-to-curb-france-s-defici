German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said French President-elect Francois Hollande has an
obligation to reduce the  budget deficit  and he’s confident that
France’s new government won’t renegotiate Europe’s fiscal pact.  “The commitments on deficit reduction that every country
in Europe has undertaken will be upheld also by France,”
Schaeuble said in an  interview  broadcast late yesterday on
Germany’s ARD television channel. “I have absolutely no doubt
about that. How France puts together its budget within the
framework of the European commitments is up to them.”  Governments will manage to convince France it must abide by
the European Union’s fiscal treaty to stem the debt crisis, he
said. “We will discuss that intensively,” Schaeuble said.  Hollande’s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, signed the pact
for France when leaders of all 27 EU countries except the U.K.
and the  Czech Republic  endorsed it in March.  “There’s no sustainable growth without deficit
reduction,” Schaeuble said. “Over the last few years, we
proved in Germany that this works.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
