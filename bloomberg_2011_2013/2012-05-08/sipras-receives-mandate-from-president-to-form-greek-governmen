Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party
placed second in Greek elections on May 6, received a mandate to
form a government from President Karolos Papoulias today, after
first party  New Democracy  failed.  “This is a great moment for the Left, a great
responsibility for me,” Tsipras told the president in  Athens .  Syriza got 16.8 percent of the vote in the elections, or 52
seats in the 300-seat chamber. New Democracy received the most
support, or 18.9 percent. That gave them 108 seats in the
Parliament, short of an overall majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
