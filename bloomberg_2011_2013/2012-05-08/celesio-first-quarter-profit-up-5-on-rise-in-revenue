Celesio AG (CLS1) ,  Europe ’s largest drug
wholesaler, said preliminary first-quarter profit rose about 5
percent as sales improved.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, excluding one-time effects from a cost-saving
program, climbed to about 140 million euros ($182 million) from
133 million euros a year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based
company said in a statement. Revenue increased about 2.5 percent
to 5.64 billion euros.  The company, which is selling its DocMorris mail-order
pharmacy business, reported a non-cash impairment charge of 45
million euros from the revaluation of the Pharmexx sales and
marketing support unit that it’s also seeking to offload.  The sales are part of an overhaul by Chief Executive
Officer Markus Pinger, who took over in August. He is trying to
return the company to growth by cutting costs and refocusing
strategy. Celesio today reiterated it expects both Ebitda and
earnings before interest and taxes to be similar to 2011.  Ebit, excluding effects from the cost-saving program, was
around 107 million euros in the first quarter, compared with 103
million euros a year earlier. The company, which is 54.6 percent
owned by Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, is due to report full results for the three months to
the end of March on May 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
