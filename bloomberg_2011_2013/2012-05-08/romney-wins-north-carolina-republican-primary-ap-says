Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney won the  North Carolina  primary, the
Associated Press reported, one of three contests held today.  Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, also won
Indianaâ€™s primary and was favored to win in West Virginia. He
faced little opposition in any of the states from his last
remaining primary opponent, U.S. Representative Ron Paul of
Texas.  Romney began the day with 856 delegates of the 1,144 needed
for the nomination, according to an AP tally. The presidential
primaries conclude June 26 when Utah votes.  Charlotte , North Carolina, will host the Democratic
National Convention on Sept. 3-6, where President Barack Obama
will be officially nominated for a second term. The Republican
National Convention takes place Aug. 27-30 in Tampa,  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
