A gauge of corporate credit risk
increased for the fourth day as Greek politicians struggle to
form a new government, raising concern that the nation wonâ€™t be
able to contain its debt crisis.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, added 1.1 basis points to a mid-price of 101
basis points at 5:10 p.m. in  New York , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The swaps index rose as the responsibility to form a new
Greek government was passed on to the second-biggest party,
which has vowed to renegotiate the terms of international aid
for  Greece . The country received rescue funds earlier this year
after assurances of implementing austerity measures and an
overhaul of its economy.  The credit-default swaps measure typically rises as
investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The
contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet
its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis
point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
