Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO)  began maintenance
yesterday at its  refinery  and chemical plant in Sarnia, Ontario,
according to a recorded message left on a community hot line.  The work is on one unit and other process units at the
refinery remain in operation, according to the message. The work
is expected to last several weeks.  On May 6 the Sarnia refinery had an upset at the coker unit
and feed was removed from the unit, the company said in a
statement.  The plant has a capacity of 121,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
