European stocks dropped after the
leader of  Greece ’s biggest political party failed to reach an
agreement on a new government following the weekend’s elections.  National Bank of Greece SA led a selloff in banks, falling
8.4 percent.  Spain ’s  Bankia SA (BKIA)  dropped 4.8 percent.  Taylor
Wimpey Plc (TW/)  led U.K. builders lower after a gauge of  house prices 
fell to a six-month low. Royal KPN NV surged 17 percent after
America Movil SAB offered 2.6 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for a
larger stake in the business.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slid 1.7 percent to 250.58 at
the close in  London  as the cost of insuring against default on
European sovereign and corporate debt advanced. The Stoxx 600
has  fallen 8 percent from this year’s high  on March 16, paring
the gauge’s  advance in 2012 to 2.5 percent . The U.K. and Irish
markets were closed for a holiday yesterday.  “European political risk remains center stage for
financial markets,” wrote Adrian Cattley, a strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in a report to clients dated yesterday. Greece’s
election result “suggests no quick path to a new stable
government and could raise probability of contagion risks.”  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.7 yesterday as German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said she will receive France’s president-elect,
 Francois Hollande , with “open arms.” Stocks briefly erased
their losses today after Merkel told Hollande in a
congratulatory message that she is confident they can work
together to tackle the debt crisis.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 today
was 14 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the
cost of Euro Stoxx 50 Index options, gained 8.3 percent to
31.32, its highest level this year. The gauge closed 19 percent
above its average of 26.37 since January 1999.  ‘Barbaric Bailout’  The euro weakened for a seventh day as Antonis Samaras, the
leader of the New Democracy party in Greece, said he failed to
reach an agreement to form a government. Alexis Tsipras, the
head of Syriza, the second-biggest party, will now attempt to
form a coalition government of left-wing parties.  Tsipras said he wouldn’t agree to join forces with New
Democracy and Pasok, the two Greek parties that have supported
austerity measures in return for international funds, while
saying a left-wing coalition government would nationalize banks
to spur growth, repeal recent labor reforms and immediately
cancel the bailout accords, he said.  ‘Barbaric Cuts’  “The Greek election result was a vote against a barbaric
bailout,” he said in statements televised live on state NET TV.
“There will be no 11 billion euros of additional of additional
austerity measures; 150,000 jobs will not be cut.”  National benchmark indexes fell in every western-European
market except Iceland and Portugal. France’s CAC 40 slid 2.8
percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1.8 percent and Germany’s DAX
dropped 1.9 percent. Greece’s ASE Index plunged 3.6 percent to
its lowest close since 1992.  National Bank of Greece, the country’s biggest lender,
tumbled 8.4 percent to 1.42 euros, extending yesterday’s 8.3
percent slump. Alpha Bank,  Greece’s second-largest lender , sank
14 percent to 72 euro cents and EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA dropped
10 percent to 46 cents.  Elsewhere,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France’s biggest lender , slipped
3.8 percent to 29.07 euros,  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) ,
 Italy’s third-largest bank , slid 4.3 percent to 25.08 euro cents
and Germany’s Commerzbank AG lost 3.4 percent to 1.53 euros.  Banks fell as the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of credit-default swaps on 15 governments rose 1.5 basis points
to 277 at 8:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals a
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Bankia Shares Plummet  In Madrid, Bankia tumbled 4.8 percent to 2.26 euros as
Spain’s economy ministry today denied that the state has seized
the  third-largest lender  in the country.  El Confidencial reported that Spain will nationalize Bankia
and its parent BFA on May 11. The newspaper cited people in the
financial industry familiar with the government’s plan.  Joaquin Almunia , the European Commissioner responsible for competition,
said “it would seem” that Bankia will get state support.  U.K. builders retreated as a  house-price index  fell in
April, the  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors said. The
gauge dropped to minus 19 from minus 11 in March, according to
RICS, which conducts a monthly poll of property surveyors across
the country. A reading below zero means more surveyors saw price
drops than gains last month.  Taylor Wimpey Slips  Taylor Wimpey dropped 6.3 percent to 44.67 pence,  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV)  lost 5.3 percent to 117.7 pence and  Persimmon
Plc (PSN)  declined 4.4 percent to 563.5 pence.  ACS-Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA lost 5.3
percent to 13.49 euros after the Spanish builder reported
 earnings  that missed some analysts’ estimates and a 19 percent
increase in net debt to 10.5 billion euros.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization was 664 million euros for the first quarter. That
was 5 percent below N+1 Equities’ estimate and 3 percent below
Espirito Santo Investment Bank’s forecast.  KPN surged 17 percent to 7.58 euros, its biggest rally in
more than a decade, after  America Movil  offered 8 euros a share
to increase its stake in the  Netherlands’ largest phone company 
to 28 percent. KPN said the offer, which is 23.5 percent more
yesterday’s closing price, “substantially undervalues the
company.” KPN hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. to help it explore strategic options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
