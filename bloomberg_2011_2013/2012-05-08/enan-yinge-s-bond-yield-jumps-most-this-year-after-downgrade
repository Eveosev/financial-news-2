The yield on  Henan Yinge Industrial
Investment Holding Co. (600069) ’s 750 million  yuan  ($119 million) of
bonds rose 54 basis points yesterday in its biggest rise this
year to a two-month high of 8.42 percent following a ratings
downgrade, exchange-traded prices on Bloomberg show.  Pengyuan Credit Rating Co. lowered its long-term rating on
the paper maker, which is based in Luohe in the central province
of Henan, to A+ from AA- and on its bond to AA- from AA with a
stable outlook, according to a Shanghai Stock Exchange filing on
May 3.  The debt of the manufacturer will continue to increase and
its cash-flow situation is worsening, Pengyuan Credit said in
the statement. “The pressure of short and long-term debt is
quite big,” the ratings company said.  There’s excess capacity in the  paper industry , and pulp
waste paper and other raw material prices have risen rapidly,
according to Pengyuan. Henan Yinge’s profitability has fallen
and its losses have increased, Pengyuan said in the filing,
which was posted by the manufacturer.  The yield on Henan Yinge’s 2017 bonds dropped 19 basis
points today to 8.24 percent, exchange-traded prices on
Bloomberg show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
