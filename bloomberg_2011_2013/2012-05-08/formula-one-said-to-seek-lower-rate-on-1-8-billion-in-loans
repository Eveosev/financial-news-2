Formula One, the auto-racing series
owned by CVC Capital Partners Ltd., will hold a lender meeting
May 10 at 2 p.m. in  New York  to discuss lowering the  interest
rate  on $1.8 billion of loans the company obtained last month,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc are arranging the financing for the London-based company,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The transaction will consist of a $1.3 billion term
loan B, a $450 million term loan A and a $50 million revolving
line of credit, the person said.  The deal is expected to be denominated mostly in U.S.
dollars and is contingent upon the company’s initial public
offering, the person said.  Formula One’s existing $1.38 billion  term loan  B due in
April 2017 pays interest at 4.5 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, with a 1.25 percent floor on the
lending benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
was sold to investors at 99 cents on the dollar, the data show.  An e-mail sent to CVC seeking comment wasn’t immediately
returned.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t. A term loan A is sold
primarily to banks, while so-called B loans are mainly bought by
non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan obligations, mutual
funds and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
