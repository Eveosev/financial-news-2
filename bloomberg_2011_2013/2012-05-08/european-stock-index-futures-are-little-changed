European stock futures were little
changed, following yesterday’s biggest rally in more than a week
for the region’s equities, as companies from  Hochtief AG (HOT)  to
 Statoil ASA (STL)  reported earnings. U.S. index futures fluctuated,
while Asian shares climbed.  Hochtief may move after Germany’s largest construction
company reported a wider-than-estimated loss. Statoil, Norway’s
largest oil company, and  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  might also be active
after posting first-quarter profit. Royal KPN NV may rally after
America Movil SAB offered 2.6 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for a
larger stake in the business.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June slipped
0.1 percent to 2,244 at 7:05 a.m. in London. Contracts on the
FTSE 100 Index fell less than 0.1 percent. The U.K. market was
closed for a holiday yesterday. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures slid 0.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
advanced 0.3 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 0.7 percent
yesterday, reversing an earlier selloff, as German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said she will receive French president-elect
Francois Hollande with “open arms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
