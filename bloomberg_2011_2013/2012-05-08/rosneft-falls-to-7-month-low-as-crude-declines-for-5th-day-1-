OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil
producer, sank to the lowest level in almost seven months as
crude declined for a fifth day.  Rosneft dropped 3 percent to 193.17 rubles, the lowest
price since Oct. 11, by the close in Moscow.  Crude for June delivery fell 2.3 percent to $95.69 a barrel
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange after Saudi Arabian Oil
Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said crude prices are “still a little bit
high.” The five-day losing streak is the longest since Feb. 2.  Russian stocks traded today even as the country observed a
public holiday. The market will be closed tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
