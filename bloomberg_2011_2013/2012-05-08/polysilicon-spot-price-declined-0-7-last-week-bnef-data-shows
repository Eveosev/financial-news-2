The price of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, dropped 0.7 percent
last week, its 10th consecutive weekly decline, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The average spot price of the material was $23.78 per
kilogram last week compared with $23.95 a week earlier, a survey
by the London-based research group showed today. The price,
which tumbled almost two-thirds during 2011 on oversupply, is
down 13 percent this year. Itâ€™s at the lowest in at least a
decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
