Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)  advanced
for the first time in three days after Polandâ€™s second-largest
publicly traded coal producer was rated new overweight at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The shares climbed as much as 1.1 percent to 125.4 zloty,
and traded 0.4 percent higher at 9:09 a.m. in Warsaw. The  WIG20
Index (WIG20)  fell 0.5 percent.  JPMorgan set the 12-month target price at 169 zloty per
share. An overweight recommendation means the bank advises
clients to buy the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
