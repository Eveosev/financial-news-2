During an election-year clash over
which U.S. political party has the best prescription for curing
unemployment, Democrats can argue that almost two-thirds of
private-sector job growth in the past five decades came with
them in the White House.  The BGOV Barometer shows that since Democrat  John F.
Kennedy  took office in January 1961, non-government payrolls in
the U.S. swelled by almost 42 million jobs under Democrats,
compared with 24 million for Republican presidents, according to
Labor Department figures.  Democrats hold the edge though they occupied the Oval
Office for 23 years since Kennedy’s inauguration, compared with
28 for the Republicans. Through April, Democratic presidents
accounted for an average of 150,000 additional private-sector
paychecks per month over that period, more than double the
71,000 average for Republicans.  The debate over jobs intensified last week, when the Labor
Department reported that U.S. employers added a total of 115,000
private and government jobs in April, fewer than forecast and
the smallest number in six months.  Private payrolls grew by 130,000 and, for the first time
under President  Barack Obama , surpassed the total in January
2009, when he took office. Total employment stayed below January
2009 because there are 607,000 fewer federal, state and local
government employees, the Labor Department reported May 4.  April’s  unemployment rate  fell one percentage point to 8.1
percent as more workers left the  labor force .  Romney Attacks  Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , campaigning
on his business experience and the promise of low taxes and
lighter  government regulation , said the “terrible and very
disappointing” jobs report was evidence that Obama’s economic
policies aren’t working.  “This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a
normal recovery,” Romney said in a Fox News Channel interview.  Obama focused his remarks on the improvement at non-
government employers. “Our businesses have now created more
than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months -- more than 1
million jobs in the last six months alone,” Obama said at a May
4 event in  Virginia .  Through April, private employers have added an average of
about 900 jobs per month since Obama’s inauguration. During the
two terms of his predecessor, Republican  George W. Bush , private
payrolls shrank by an average of 6,700 jobs per month.  On a monthly basis, Democrat  Bill Clinton  averaged 217,000
new private-sector jobs. Democrat  Jimmy Carter  had an average of
188,000, followed by Republican  Ronald Reagan ’s 153,000,
according to Labor Department data.  Clinton’s Tenure  Clinton’s eight-year tenure accounted for half of the
Democrats’ total private employment gains over the past five
decades. More than 60 percent of the Republicans’ increase came
during Reagan’s two terms in office.  Republicans, campaigning on pledges to cut government
spending and programs, had a relatively better record at
creating public-sector jobs. Since January 1961, federal, state
and  local government  employment grew by 7.1 million under
Republican presidents and 6.3 million when Democrats were in the
White House. Government agencies added an average of 21,000 jobs
per month under Republicans, compared with 22,000 for Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
