Saudi Arabia ’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is negotiating three major projects as he seeks a return
on investment of at least 20 percent to 25 percent, Handelsblatt
reported, citing an interview.  The projects are in Saudi Arabia, the region and
international, the German newspaper quoted Alwaleed as saying in
comments published today. He declined to elaborate, according to
the interview.  Alwaleed, the billionaire who controls the Saudi investment
company Kingdom Holding Co., said he doesn’t plan to expand
investment in banks beyond  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and won’t raise his
stake in the U.S. bank, according to Handelsblatt. He said he’s
increasingly investing in Saudi Arabia, which is experiencing a
real-estate boom, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
