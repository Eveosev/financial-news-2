Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 3.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to
2,448.88. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.3 percent to 2,709.12.  China XD Electric Co. (601179)  (601179 CH), the nation’s biggest
maker of electricity transmission and distribution equipment,
surged 9.9 percent to 4.33  yuan  after it said General Electric
Co. will buy a 15 percent stake in the Chinese company for 3.38
billion yuan ($536 million). GE will also provide a further 258
million yuan for a joint venture, China XD said in a statement
yesterday.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  (600362 CH), China’s biggest producer of
the metal, slid 1.4 percent to 26.91 yuan. Jiangxi Copper’s
growth will “substantially” slow down this year and its
overseas projects won’t progress as well as expected, Fan Guohe,
an analyst at Phillip Securities (HK) Ltd., said in a note dated
today.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  (600031 CH), the biggest Chinese
machinery maker, lost 0.5 percent to 14.81 yuan. Sany may cut
its unit-sales forecast for this year as government efforts to
curb property speculation slow construction, Xiang Ru’an, the
company’s vice president, said in a May 5 phone interview.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
