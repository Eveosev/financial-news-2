The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default outside of  Japan 
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 4 basis points to 169 basis
points as of 8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge has traded in a 132.5 basis-point to 209 basis-
point range this year, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 4 basis points to
164 as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show. The
index has risen from its low for the year at 128.2 on March 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was unchanged at 192 basis
points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The measure has risen 56 basis points since March 19,
when it fell to its lowest for the year at 136.2, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
