Drydocks World LLC, the Dubai-based
shipyard thatâ€™s restructuring $2.2 billion of debt, is facing a
dispute in  Singapore  over a drilling rig it supplied to a
customer,  The National  reported, citing a lawyer.  The unidentified customer has been repaid the cost of the
rig after it was unhappy with its performance by three banks
which provided guarantees in the sale, the Abu Dhabi-based
newspaper said, citing Ian Schneider, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP., an adviser to Drydocks World.  Drydocks World now needs the approval of two thirds of its
creditors to transfer the ownership of the rig to the three
banks -- Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank and
the DBS Group -- which also need to find another buyer for the
rig, The National said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
