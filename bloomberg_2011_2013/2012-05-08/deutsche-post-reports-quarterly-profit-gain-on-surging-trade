Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , the world’s biggest
carrier of air and sea freight by volume, reported higher first-
quarter profit as trade volumes to developing markets surged,
beating analyst estimates.  Earnings before interest and taxes  grew to 691 million
euros ($900 million) from 629 million euros a year earlier, the
Bonn-based company said today in a statement. The figure beat
the 663 million-euro average of 10 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue increased 4.3 percent to 13.36 billion euros.  “Given the somewhat subdued global economic environment,
our successful start to the year is clear evidence for us
continuing to build on our strengths,” Chief Executive Officer
Frank Appel said in the statement. “The efficiency improvements
we have achieved in recent years and our unmatched position in
the world’s growth markets have prepared us well for continuing
on our profitable growth path.”  Deutsche Post, which is also  Europe ’s largest mail carrier,
has focused expansion on express-package and cargo businesses in
 emerging markets  while seeking to stabilize earnings at its mail
unit. The company stuck to its forecast that earnings before
interest and taxes in 2012 will rise to a range of 2.5 billion
euros to 2.6 billion euros.  Net income jumped 64 percent to 533 million euros,
according to the statement. Ebit at the Mail division climbed
5.4 percent to 393 million euros, while it increased 13 percent
to 409 million euros at the DHL.  Deutsche Post is targeting growth in Ebit at the DHL unit
of 13 percent to 15 percent a year through 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
