Gasoline slid for a seventh straight
day as concern that the  European debt crisis  may spread boosted
the dollar and crude oil fell as supplies increased.  Futures capped the longest losing streak since August as
Greek political leaders struggled to form a new government amid
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening. A stronger dollar
reduces the appeal of commodities as an investment alternative.
U.S. oil  stockpiles  as of April 27 were the highest since 1990,
according to Energy Department data.  “Products are following crude and the biggest issue on
crude is that inventories are at a 22-year high,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “And
the market is worried about slowing demand in  Europe  due to the
political uncertainty.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 1.77 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $2.9564 a gallon at 12:19 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange.  Prices are down 7.8 percent in seven days of losses and
have lost 13 percent since reaching a 2012 high of $3.4166 on
March 26. The fuel has pared its year-to-date gain to 10 percent
from 27 percent.  Crude inventories climbed to 375.9 million barrels, the
highest since September 1990, in the week ended April 27,
according to department data. Stockpiles may have climbed an
additional 1.95 million barrels last week to 377.8 million,
according to the median of 10 analyst estimates before the
weekly report tomorrow.  Gasoline Supplies  Gasoline supplies probably dropped 250,000 barrels while
supplies of distillate fuels rose 375,000 barrels, according to
the survey.  The dollar rose a seventh day against the euro, gaining 0.5
percent at 10:15 a.m. in New York in its longest run of gains
against the European benchmark since September 2008.  “This is a clear sign that people are worried about Europe
and looking for safe haven,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Gasoline’s loss was part of a broader decline in
commodities and equities. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
commodities slid 1.1 percent at 12:18 p.m. in New York. The S&P
500 stock index dropped 1.3 percent.  “The S&P is falling a lot and  Greece  is on everybody’s
mind,” said Amrita Sen, a London-based analyst at  Barclays
Capital . “Europe is really a concern.”  Greek Crisis  Greece’s political leaders are meeting for a second day to
try to form a government after New Democracy’s Antonis Samaras,
who won the most seats in Parliament, said he couldn’t forge a
coalition.  Greece will probably leave the euro as soon as next month
as the government runs out of cash and European institutions
fail to lend more to the nation, according to  John Taylor  of
hedge fund FX Concepts LLC.  June-delivery heating oil dropped 2.4 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9574 a gallon on the exchange, the sixth
consecutive decline.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.4
cent to $3.763 a gallon yesterday, the lowest level since March
8, according to AAA. Prices have dropped 17.3 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
