Nigeria ’s naira was little changed as
foreign currency demand remained subdued, with oil companies
continuing to supply the market with dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer strengthened
less than 0.1 percent to 157.26 at 1:54 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, having declined less than 0.1 percent in
each of the past three days.  Demand is “seemingly muted” at the Central Bank of
Nigeria’s biweekly foreign-currency auctions to lenders, Absa
Capital strategists led by Ridle Markus in Johannesburg, wrote
in a note to clients today. The Abuja-based central bank has
been selling between $120 million to $150 million at auctions,
which it uses to manage the naira, since the end of March. The
bank was selling as much as $500 million at auctions last year.  Outside the auctions, “foreign currency supply appears to
be relatively strong with oil firms continuing to supplement”
the bank supply, Absa Capital said.  Oil companies  are the second-biggest suppliers to the
market after the central bank. Nigeria depends on crude exports
for more than 95 percent of its foreign income. Nigeria’s
foreign currency reserves grew 12 percent this year to $36.8
billion as of May 4.  Demand for foreign currency has declined compared with last
year as fuel imports fell after a parliamentary probe into
gasoline subsidy discrepancies started in January, according to
Samir Gadio, an emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd. in  London .  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.875 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
