Barclays Plc will gain market share in
investment banking, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  said
in a speech in New York today, according to a transcript
published on the lender’s website.  “In a world where the industry is polarising, we believe
we will continue to gain share as weaker players withdraw from
the market,” said Diamond. The lender will maintain its 13
percent target for return on equity, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
