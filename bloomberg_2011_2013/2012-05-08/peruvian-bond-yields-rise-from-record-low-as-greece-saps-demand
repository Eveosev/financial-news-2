Peruvian bond yields rose from a
record low after copper fell on concern  Greece  might withdraw
from the euro zone, sapping demand for higher-yielding assets in
emerging markets.  The yield on Peru’s 6.55 percent dollar-denominated bond
due in March 2037 increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.34 percent at 11:39 a.m. in Lima. The
price fell 0.60 cent to 133 cents per dollar.  The “drop in commodities prices is probably feeding into
some weakness in Peruvian assets,” said Aryam Vazquez, a New
York-based economist at  Wells Fargo & Co . “The situation in the
euro zone is back in focus.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6415 per  U.S. dollar ,
compared with 2.6410 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit.  Copper, Peru’s top export, fell in  New York  as Greek
political leaders struggled to create a coalition following the
weekend election. The mandate to form a government was passed to
the Syriza party, which has vowed to nationalize banks, repeal
recent labor reforms and cancel international bailout accords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
