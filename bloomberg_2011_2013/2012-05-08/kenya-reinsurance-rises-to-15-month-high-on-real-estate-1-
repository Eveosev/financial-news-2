Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE) , the state-
owned reinsurer, rose to the highest in 15 months on improved
valuations of real-estate investments.  The stock jumped 3.3 percent to 10.85 shillings, the
highest since February 2011, by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the
capital.  “They have invested heavily in property and have about 97
percent occupancy rate in their buildings so this is expected to
feed into the market,” Samora Kariuki, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  The value of real-estate investments has also gone up after
the  National Social Security Fund , the state-run pension fund,
advertised for sale two office blocks it owns in Nairobi for
more than 2 billion shillings ($24 million), Kariuki said.  Kenya Re, as the reinsurer is known, has assets worth 13
billion shillings with 35 percent of its investments being in
real estate, according to the company’s website.  Kenya Re plans to increase its investments in the property
industry,  Business Daily  reported on April 25. The company is
planning to build a 1.5 billion-shillings office in the
capital’s Upper Hill business district, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported, citing Managing Director Jadiah Mwarania.  The plan marks “a return to property development as it
eyes bigger returns from the real estate sector,” Nairobi-based
Old Mutual Securities Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients
on April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
