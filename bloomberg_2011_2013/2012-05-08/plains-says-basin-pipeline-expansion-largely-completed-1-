Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)  has
mostly completed an expansion of a portion of its Basin pipeline
system that moves oil from the Permian Basin region in west
Texas and Southern New Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma.  “We have largely completed the expansion of our Basin
pipeline system having achieved approximately 90 percent of the
volume expected,” President Harry Pefanis said in a conference
call with analysts today. “The timing of this expansion has
been challenged by the sheer volume of crude nominations we have
had on the system.”  Oil shipments on Permian Basin area pipeline systems
increased 16 percent to an average 454,000 barrels a day in the
first quarter from 392,000 a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today.  “We expect to complete the final minor modifications as we
are able to,” Pefanis said.  The company announced Jan. 25, 2011, that it would expand
the portion of the system that moves oil from Colorado City,
Texas, to Cushing to 450,000 barrels from 400,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
