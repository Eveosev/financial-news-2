German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
Europe’s leaders should listen to voters and alter their
strategy on tackling the debt crisis, said  Charles Dallara , head
of the Institute of International Finance.  “That’s the message that the markets have given and that
voters have given,” Dallara, who negotiated a Greek debt swap
on behalf of private bondholders, said in an interview in
Istanbul today. Merkel and French President-elect Francois Hollande should agree “not just on superficial commentary but
on fundamental issues,” he said.  The European Commission appealed today for pro-growth
policies after France’s first power shift to a socialist
president since 1981 and  Greece ’s electoral rebellion against
austerity undermined the continent’s budget-cutting response to
the debt crisis. Merkel told Hollande she is confident they can
work together to stem the debt crisis in a congratulatory
message released by her office in Berlin today.  “They don’t need to fundamentally run away from what
they’ve been trying to do with the fiscal pact, with the fiscal
discipline, but a 30-45 degree course change absolutely merits
serious consideration,” Dallara said. “Not just by Hollande,
but by Merkel and the other leaders in  Europe .”  Spain  is starting to overcome its banking problem and
Greece, which isn’t expected to default or leave the euro, needs
“economic restructuring” such as more asset sales and a
reduced economic role for the state, Dallara said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
