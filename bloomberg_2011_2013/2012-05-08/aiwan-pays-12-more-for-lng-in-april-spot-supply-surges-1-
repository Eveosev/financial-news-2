Taiwan paid 12 percent more for
liquefied natural gas in April compared with a year earlier as
imports rose, according to customs data.  Prices  of the fuel rose to $724 a metric ton last month
from $644 a ton a year earlier, the data shows. Thatâ€™s
equivalent to about $13.90 per million British thermal units.
Benchmark U.S. front-month natural gas futures at  Henry Hub 
traded at $2.342 today and U.K. benchmark gas futures, used to
price spot cargoes, traded at 56.30 pence a therm, equivalent to
about $9.10 per million Btu, according to data on Bloomberg.  Imports of long-term supplies and cargoes shipped under
contracts lasting less than one-year rose by 9.8 percent to 1.11
million metric tons of LNG in April, according to the data.  Supplies from the Atlantic Ocean area more than doubled in
April to 245,574 tons, the customs data shows. A cargo from
 Spain  cost $815 a ton and about three from  Nigeria  averaged $878
a ton in April, according to the data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
