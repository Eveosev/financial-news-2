Tam SA (TAMM4)  advanced to the highest since
2007 after  Brazil  approved  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ’s plan to start a
tender offer for shares of the carrier as part of a deal that
will create the world’s largest airline by market value.  Tam gained 0.3 percent to 46.25 reais, the highest closing
level since December 2007. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 1.4
percent to 60,365.48.  The planned combination of Tam and Lan, announced in August
2010, would have a market value of about $13.4 billion,
overtaking Air China Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. as the
world’s biggest carrier. Santiago-based Lan has 10 days to make
the offer for Tam shares, the airline said in a statement posted
on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “The market was already expecting this, but every step
ahead that confirms the merger transaction is positive,”
Marcelo Varejao, an analyst at Socopa Corretora, said by phone
from  Sao Paulo .  Brazil’s securities regulator, known as CVM, approved the
operation yesterday, according to a regulatory filing.  Tam shares will be swapped for stock in a holding company
called Holdco II, which will combine with Lan to form Latam
Airlines.  Lan dropped 0.9 percent to 13,479 pesos in Santiago. The
benchmark Ipsa Index slipped 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
