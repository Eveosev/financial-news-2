Nelson Mandela, the former South
African president who led the struggle against apartheid, is
improving steadily as he extends his two-month hospital stay,
according to the office of the presidency.  “Doctors have indicated to President Jacob Zuma that the
former president is making a slow but steady improvement,” the
president’s office said today in a statement. “The medical team
also reiterated that although his health was improving steadily,
Madiba still remained in a critical condition,” it said,
referring to Mandela’s clan name.  Mandela turned 95 last month in a Pretoria hospital where
he has been treated since June 8. The former president spent 27
years in prison for his opposition to white, minority rule,
including 18 years on Robben Island, where he contracted
tuberculosis. This is his fourth, and longest, stay in the
hospital since December.  Mandela won the Nobel Peace prize in 1993 and became the
nation’s first black president a year later when his African
National Congress party won elections. He stepped down in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
