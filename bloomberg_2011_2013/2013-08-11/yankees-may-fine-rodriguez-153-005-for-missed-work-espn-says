The  New York Yankees  may fine third
baseman  Alex Rodriguez  $153,005 for missing a day of work during
his rehabilitation assignment in the minor leagues,  ESPN.com
reported , citing unnamed sources.  Rodriguez, who is playing during an appeal of his 211-game
suspension for violating  Major League Baseball ’s drug policy,
received a letter before the team’s Aug. 9 game, reprimanding
him for seeking a second medical opinion without giving the
Yankees prior notice, and for not showing up at the ballpark on
July 12 after a meeting with league officials to discuss its
case against him, ESPN said yesterday.  Rodriguez denies receiving the letter and says it might
have been sent to his lawyers, MLB.com reported.  The Yankees have already fined catcher  Francisco Cervelli ,
who accepted a 50-day suspension for his involvement with the
now-closed Biogenesis clinic that was allegedly a source of
illegal performance enhancing drugs for several players, ESPN
said.  Cervelli was fined a day’s pay for failing to go to the
training complex to get treatment on his injured hand and
shoulder July 28 after learning he was suspended, ESPN reported.
His salary was $515,350 and one day’s pay was $2,816, assuming a
183-day work year.  ESPN, citing unnamed team officials, said Rodriguez would
probably also be fined a day’s pay. Rodriguez’s salary is $28
million this season, making a day’s pay amount to $153,005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
