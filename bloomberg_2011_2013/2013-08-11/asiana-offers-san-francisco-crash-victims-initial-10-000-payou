Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560) , the South
Korean carrier that suffered a fatal jet crash in San Francisco
last month, plans to pay an initial compensation of $10,000 each
to survivors.  The carrier may pay more after the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board completes its investigation into the
accident, Lee Hyo Min, an Asiana spokeswoman, said yesterday.
Lee said 288 passengers who survived the crash are eligible for
the payment.  The survivors “need money to go to hospital or for
transportation so we are giving them the $10,000 first,” Lee
said in a telephone interview. “Even if they are not hurt or
they don’t go to hospital, we will still give them this money.”  Three people died when an Asiana Boeing Co. 777 struck a
seawall short of a runway at  San Francisco  International Airport
on July 6, sending the plane spinning off the tarmac. More than
300 survived the crash, the first fatal airline accident in the
U.S. since 2009.  The families of those who died were last month paid more
than $10,000 as an initial compensation, Lee said, without
providing a specific figure.  Passengers can sue the carrier even after accepting the
compensation, Lee said. The company is asking for a receipt to
record the payment, rather than an agreement, she said.  Shares of the airline fell 2 percent to 4,530 won, the
lowest price since April 5, 2010, in  Seoul  trading.  Asiana’s Reputation  South Korea ’s second-biggest carrier may take a charge of
at least 20 billion won ($18 million) from the crash, pushing it
into a loss for the year, five analysts said after the accident.
Insurance payment won’t cover the loss of aircraft, litigation
and other charges and an erosion in passenger number following
the accident, Cho Byoung Hee, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities
Co., said last month.  “The cause of the crash is not defined yet,” said Lee,
adding that this could take more than a year.  The July 6 accident was Asiana’s worst since 1993, when a
 Boeing 737  crashed in Mokpo, south of Seoul, killing 66 people,
according to the  National Archives  of  Korea . The airline’s
previous disaster was the crash of its cargo freighter in the
sea south of Jeju island in July 2011.  The accident dented Asiana’s reputation as one of the top
carriers in the world for service, honed over a quarter century
since its formation in the run-up to the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
South Korea plans to tighten aviation rules as the crash
triggered concerns about the nation’s safety regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
