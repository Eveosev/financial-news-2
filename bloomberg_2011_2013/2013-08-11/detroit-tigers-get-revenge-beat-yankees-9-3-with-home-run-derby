Miguel Cabrera , Torii Hunter and
Austin Jackson each hit home runs as the  Detroit Tigers  beat the
New York Yankees 9-3, a day after having their 12-game winning
streak halted in a 10-inning loss at Yankee Stadium.  Cabrera had three hits, including his 35th homer of the
season in the third inning, and Jackson homered in the fifth as
the Tigers tacked on four more runs to open a 6-0 lead.  Yankees starting pitcher  Phil Hughes  allowed four earned
runs over 4 1/3 innings and now has an 11.45 earned run average
over his past three appearances. He’s 1-7 in his latest 10
starts, dropping to 4-11 on the Major League Baseball season.  Hunter added a three-run homer in the sixth inning off
Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain to put the Tigers up 9-2.  Lyle Overbay drove in all three runs for the Yankees, on a
two-run homer in the fifth inning and a run-scoring single in
the bottom of the ninth. Anibal Sanchez allowed two runs over
seven innings to pick up the win for the Tigers.  Detroit, which had 17 hits, improved to 69-46 and is eight
games ahead of the  Cleveland Indians  atop the American League
Central Division. The Yankees are 58-57 and 11 games behind the
first-place  Boston Red Sox  in the AL East.  A day after the Tigers had their winning streak ended by
the Yankees, another team had a similar fate.  The  Atlanta Braves ’ 14-game win streak ended on a wild
pitch in a 1-0 loss to the last-place  Florida Marlins . They were
one game short of tying the 2000 club for the franchise’s
longest-winning streak dating back to the 1891 Boston Beaneaters
who won 18 straight games.  Adeiny Hechavarria led off the Miami ninth inning with a
triple and scored on the wild pitch by reliever Jordan Walden.  In other games it was Toronto 5, Oakland 4; Chicago White
Sox 5, Minnesota 4; Los Angeles Dodgers 5, Tampa Bay 0; San
Francisco 3, Baltimore 2; San Diego 3, Cincinnati 1; Washington
8, Philadelphia 5, and Texas 5, Houston 4.  The Chicago Cubs 6, St. Louis 5; Los Angeles Angels 7,
Cleveland 2; Boston 5, Kansas City 3;  New York  Mets 4, Arizona
1; Colorado 6, Pittsburgh 4, and Milwaukee 10, Seattle 0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
