Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
rose in Israel, narrowing the discount to its  New York  shares,
as demand for a competitor’s drug showed signs of a slowdown.  The shares of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
climbed 2.9 percent to 141.70 shekels, or $40.12, at 10:39 a.m.
in  Tel Aviv . The stock of the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company
advanced 3.9 percent to $40.43 in New York last week, while it
declined 1.1 percent in Tel Aviv. The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose 0.1
percent today  Teva’s Israeli shares had plunged to an almost two-year low
on Aug. 6 on concern revenue growth will slacken as its
bestseller Copaxone, an injection for multiple sclerosis that
dominates 40 percent of the U.S. market, faces competition.
Prescriptions for  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) ’s drug Tecfidera, which also
treats multiple sclerosis, fell 6.7 percent the week ending Aug.
2 to 3,377 from the previous week, according to IMS Health Inc.  “If it’s negative news for a competitor of Copaxone, it’s
clearly a positive for Teva,” Kevin Kedra, a health-care
analyst at Gabelli & Co., who rates Teva a buy, said by phone
from Rye, New York on Aug. 9. Tecfidera is “the newest oral MS
product. It’s generated a lot of excitement. It’s gotten off to
a very strong launch, so any signs of them maybe slowing down
would be a positive for competitors.”  Kate Niazi-Sai, a spokeswoman for Biogen in Weston,
 Massachusetts , said the company doesn’t comment on weekly sales
of prescriptions.  Teva may be overtaken by Biogen’s Tecfidera in the second
quarter of 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries. The company will also face generic competition next
year after a U.S. court invalidated a 2015 patent for Copaxone
July 26. The injectable drug generated $1.1 billion in sales in
the first quarter for Teva and accounted for almost a fifth of
its revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
