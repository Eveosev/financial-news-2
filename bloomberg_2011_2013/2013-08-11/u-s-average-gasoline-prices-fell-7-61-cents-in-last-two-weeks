The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 7.61 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.5985 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  Conducted on Aug. 9, the survey is based on information
obtained at about 2,500 filling stations across the U.S. by
the Camarillo, California-based company. The average, which
reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in the period ended Feb.
22, is 9.22 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.6907 a
gallon.  The decline “comes mostly from a tremendous performance by
U.S. refiners,” Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey,
said yesterday in a telephone interview. “They have been
producing so much gasoline that it verges on a glut. To move
these plentiful gallons, they have been slashing their wholesale
prices to their marketers and retailers.”  The highest prices for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed were in  Chicago  and San Diego, where
the average was $3.92 a gallon, Lundberg said.  The lowest was in Charleston, South Carolina, where
customers paid an average of $3.27 a gallon. Regular gasoline
averaged $3.87 a gallon on Long Island, New York, and $3.91 in
Los Angeles.  Lundberg said that there would probably be a continued,
though smaller, decline in gasoline prices over the next two
weeks, assuming that crude oil prices remain relatively stable.  More Coming  “Refiners’ price cutting in the wholesale market has
continued, so a bit more of this may reach the pumps in coming
days,” she said.  Gasoline futures  on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
13.62 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $2.9082 a gallon in the two
weeks to Aug. 9.  Prices slipped as inventories increased and President
 Barack Obama ’s administration eased concern that higher ethanol
blending costs will curb fuel supply.  The Environmental Protection Agency  said  Aug. 6 that
refiners and blenders would have four extra months to meet this
year’s requirement to blend 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol into
gasoline under the 2007 Renewable Fuels Standard. The EPA also
announced that it “anticipates proposing adjustments” to next
year’s level, which is set to reach 14.4 billion gallons.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  rose 135,000 barrels in the week
ended Aug. 2 to 223.6 million, the highest level for this time
of year in weekly data going back to 1990, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex gained $1.27, or
1.2 percent, to $105.97 a barrel in the two weeks ended Aug. 9.
Prices were supported by nationwide  inventories  that as of Aug.
2 were the lowest since January at 363.3 million barrels.
Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI,
fell 2.25 million barrels to 39.9 million that week, the lowest
level since March 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
