UGL Ltd. (UGL) , the Australian company
that  acquired  U.K. real estate broker DTZ Holdings Plc in 2011,
plans to split its operations into two listed companies by June
2015 to allow each to follow its own growth strategy.  UGL will create two companies, one focused on global
property services and the other on engineering, construction and
maintenance services in Australia,  New Zealand  and  Asia , it said
in a statement to the Australian stock exchange today. The
company today reported underlying profit after tax in the 12
months to June 30 fell 45 percent from a year ago to A$92.1
million ($84.7 million).  UGL in December 2011 bought the London-based DTZ for about
77.5 million pounds ($120.2 million), gaining access to  China ,
where DTZ has the biggest geographic presence among
international real estate advisory firms. The plan to create two
separate companies follows a 3.5 percent drop in the company’s
share price this year, compared with a 8.7 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  “A demerger is the next logical step which will allow each
business to pursue their own strategic priorities and
opportunities for growth,” Chief Executive Officer Richard
Leupen said in today’s statement. “A demerger will recognize
the fundamentally different markets, geographic focus and
strategic requirements of the two businesses.”  DTZ’s revenue grew 21 percent in the year to June 30 from a
year earlier to A$1.9 billion while UGL’s engineering revenue
fell 30 percent to A$1.8 billion due to slower investment in
 Australia ’s resources and infrastructure sector, UGL said.  The company plans to complete the integration of DTZ
globally and the property unit’s global headquarters in the
U.S., and focus on reducing debt before the demerger, it said
today. The board proposes that Leupen will continue to lead the
company as it prepares for the demerger, Chairman Trevor Rowe
said in the statement.  UGL expects underlying net income after tax of between
A$120 million and A$130 million in the year ending June 30,
2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
