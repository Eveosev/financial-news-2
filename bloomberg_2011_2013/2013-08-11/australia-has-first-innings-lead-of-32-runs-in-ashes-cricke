England takes a 202-run lead into
the next-to-last day of the fourth Ashes cricket Test, as it
chases the draw it needs to win the series against Australia.  Ian Bell resumes on 105 and  Tim Bresnan  is on four with the
hosts on 234-5 in their second innings at Chester-le-Street.
Bell has faced 189 balls and hit 10 boundaries, while  Ryan
Harris  has taken 3-74.  Australia resumed yesterday on 222-5 and added 48 runs to
reach 270 in response to England’s 238, a lead of 32 runs.  Stuart Broad finished with 5-71, while Graeme Swann and
James Anderson took two wickets each yesterday. Australia’s top
scorer,  Chris Rogers , was dismissed by Swann on 110, his first
Test century.  England lost Joe Root early in the second innings, bowled
by Harris for two. Then captain Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott
were dismissed to leave the home team wobbling on 49-3.  Kevin Pietersen  and Bell added 106 for the fourth wicket
before Pietersen was caught off Nathan Lyon for 44, his second
dismissal by the bowler in the match.  “We just needed somebody to get out there and get runs,”
Bell told Sky Sports after his third century of the series.
“Kev played really well too and it was nice to dig in as a
partnership and get some runs.”  England retained the Ashes trophy with a draw in the third
Test after wins in the first two games of the five-match contest.
The best Australia can now do is draw the series 2-2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
