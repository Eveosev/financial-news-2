GPT Group (GPT) ,  Australia ’s second-biggest diversified real estate trust, said first-half profit
fell 6.7 percent as income from retail properties dropped and it
saw smaller gains in property values.  Net income  slid to A$257 million ($236 million) in the six
months ended June 30, from A$275.5 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. Net operating income in its retail property division
slipped to A$139.6 million from A$160.4 million a year ago, as
the company sold off assets.  The company, which in May withdrew its bid for rival
 Australand Property Group (ALZ) ’s commercial real estate division, is
seeking to reduce its exposure to retail properties, and has
about A$2 billion to spend on office and industrial assets,
Managing Director Michael Cameron said in June. While GPT
expects earnings in fiscal 2014 to be 1 percentage point above
the change in the  consumer price index , this depends on
conditions in the office and retail markets, it said today.  “We know general conditions have softened in the last six
months, but are they hinting that conditions are perhaps more
challenging than many currently believe?” Louise Mylott,
Sydney-based  executive director  for specialist sales at Morgan
Stanley, wrote in an e-mailed note. “They will really need to
maintain that sharp cost and efficiency focus, reduce debt costs
and continue to recycle and effectively allocate capital to
achieve their near-term goals.”  Softer Fundamentals  GPT  shares  rose 0.5 percent to A$3.74 at the close of
trading in Sydney, compared with a 1.1 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  Net tangible assets climbed to A$3.76 a share in the first
half, compared with A$3.73 a year ago, the company said.
Property values rose by A$31.6 million during the six months,
compared with a A$122.2 million increase in the same period a
year earlier, it said.  Operating income rose to A$236.5 million from A$227.2
million a year ago. Comparable operating income climbed 1.5
percent in the retail division, 3.2 percent in the industrial
business and fell 0.7 percent for offices, GPT said.  “While GPT remains cautiously optimistic about the second
half of 2013, it is clear that market fundamentals have softened
in the past six months,” Cameron said in today’s statement.
“GPT has been effective in meeting these market challenges by
focusing on actively managing its portfolio. This, together with
fixed rental increases, provides a strong base for income
growth.”  The company will pay a  dividend  of 10.1 Australian cents
for the half, it said. Its payout ratio will remain 80 percent
of return on operating income, which will equate to 100 percent
of cash earnings, it said.  GPT is on track to deliver earnings per share growth of at
least 5 percent for the year ending Dec. 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
