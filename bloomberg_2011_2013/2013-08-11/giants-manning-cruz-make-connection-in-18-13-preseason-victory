New York  Giants quarterback Eli
Manning completed a 57-yard touchdown pass to Victor Cruz and
the team’s offensive starters scored on both their first quarter
drives in an 18-13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers at  Heinz
Field  in Pittsburgh.  In the first preseason game for both clubs,  Manning 
completed 2 of 5 passes for 73 yards. Cruz, who signed a six-year, $45.9 million contract in July, broke free on the play by
slipping past William Gay and  Troy Polamalu  and then sprinting
past Ryan Clark for the score.  “My route was the seam and I kind of went up the alley,”
Cruz said after the game. “I (saw) Troy Polamalu, and I think
he was thinking I was going to break off the route. So I just
went vertical and Eli threw a great pass to me that I was able
to take in for the touchdown.”  Pittsburgh quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  completed 4 of 8
passes for 36 yards and free agent running back LaRod Stephens-Howling rushed for a team leading 40 yards on seven carries in
the loss.  One Giants rookie who stood out was third-round draft pick
 Damontre Moore , who blocked a punt on the opening series that
set up Josh Brown’s 23-yard field goal to put New York ahead
3-0. He finished with three solo tackles.  Giants’ field kicker Josh Brown was 3 for 4, with
successful kicks of 23, 30 and 47 yards. He was wide left on a
38-yard attempt in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
