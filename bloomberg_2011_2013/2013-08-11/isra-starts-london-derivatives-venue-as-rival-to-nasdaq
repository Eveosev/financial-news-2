Hirander Misra, former chief
operating officer of Chi-X  Europe  Ltd., plans to start a
derivatives exchange in London, entering the same market as new
venues from  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and CME Group Inc.   Global Markets Exchange Group International LLP is seeking
regulatory approval from the U.K’s Financial Conduct Authority,
Misra said in an interview. Misra will be chief executive
officer, VJ Angelo will be president and managing director and
James Davies, the former head of sales at trading-software
company Trayport Ltd., will be chief operating officer.  New derivatives exchanges are entering the market as
European Union regulations drive competition. Nasdaq opened its
NLX trading venue on May 31 and is hoping for a share of more
than 10 percent of transactions in its first year of operation.
CME, owner of the world’s biggest futures exchange, plans to
open a market in the U.K. capital in 2013. The new platforms
will compete with  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s Eurex and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s
Liffe, the largest derivatives venues in Europe.  Chi-X Europe was the first alternative trading system to
challenge the region’s traditional exchanges. Bats Global
Markets Inc. bought the company in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
