Britain’s Treasury ministry opened a
consultation on plans to “name and shame” promoters of risky
tax-avoidance schemes and impose penalties on those who fail to
comply with new disclosure requirements.  “The vast majority of tax advisers are not high-risk and
have moved away from selling aggressive avoidance schemes, but
there is still a minority that persists in promoting these
schemes,” Treasury Minister David Gauke said in an e-mailed
statement. “We want to make life as difficult as we can for
them and demonstrate that there is no tolerance for aggressive
tax avoidance.” The consultation is due to close on Oct. 4.  Proposals from the ministry headed by Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  include giving powers to Her Majesty’s
Revenue & Customs to publicly identify “high risk” promoters
of avoidance schemes and to demand early information about
avoidance programs, with fines of as much as 1 million pounds
($1.55 million) for those who don’t comply.  Users of failed avoidance schemes could be forced to amend
their  tax return  or pay a penalty based on the tax avoided,
under the proposals.  In a move against tax evasion, HMRC last week published a
list of its 30 most wanted tax fugitives, trumpeting the capture
of one of those being sought after 10 years on the run. They are
wanted for offenses including fraud and  tax evasion  that the tax
authority says have cost the government as much as 10 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
