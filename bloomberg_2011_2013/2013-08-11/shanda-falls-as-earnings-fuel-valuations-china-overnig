Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  and  Youku Tudou (YOKU) 
Inc. led declines in Chinese stocks traded in New York last week
after a rally led by Internet companies pushed valuations to the
highest in a month.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell 0.4 percent to 94.44 after a
four-week rally. The measure traded at 13.7 times trailing
profit, near the highest valuation since June 28. Youku Tudou,
owner of  China ’s biggest video websites, fell the most in five
months as Shanda Games sank 11 percent.  Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH) 
surged 27 percent last week after raising its profit outlook and
LightInTheBox Holding Co. jumped to a record high.  Internet stocks have benefited from better-than-estimated
profit in the second quarter as 16 out of 18 companies that have
reported  earnings  since July 22 have beaten analysts’
projections on average, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The
gains sent the price-to-earnings ratio on shares of Shanda Games
to a two-year high on July 26. Online book retailer  E-Commerce
China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  dropped last week for the first time in a
month after its price-to-book value multiple climbed to the
highest level since 2011.  “Many of the Internet companies have rich valuations after
the nice rally we saw in the last couple of weeks,” Henry Guo,
an analyst at ABR Investment Strategy LLC, said in a phone
interview from  San Francisco  on Aug. 9. “If there’s no good
trigger news, it’s hard for us to see a rally without a pause.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 1.3 percent last week
to $34.53, the first slump in a month. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slipped 1.1 percent as investors pulled money from
exchange-traded funds and weighed signs the Federal Reserve
stimulus this year.  Shanda’s Slide  Shanda, a web games operator based in  Shanghai , sank to
$3.82 in  New York  last week, the lowest level since June 24. It
plunged 39 percent in a 10-day slump through Aug. 9, the longest
stretch of declines since its U.S. listing in September 2009.  The slide followed a July 28 statement by the Shanghai-based company saying it will pay $811.5 million for two units of
its parent Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd. It’s unclear
how the move, which reduces the company’s cash on hand, will
help Shanda build its mobile-game platform, 86Research Ltd. said
in a note July 29.  Youku’s American depositary receipts tumbled 6.9 percent
last week to $23.29, dropping the most since May.  Beijing-based Youku said it expected revenue to be as low
as 830 million  yuan  ($136 million) in an Aug. 8 statement,
compared with an 857 million yuan average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the release.  Dangdang Earnings  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its  rating  for Youku to
neutral from buy in a note Aug. 9, citing concerns over its
growth outlook in the next 12 months.  Dangdang, China’s biggest online book retailer, slid 3.7
percent last week to $10.15. Beijing-based Dangdang, which has
surged 145 percent this year, will  release  its second-quarter
results on Aug. 15.  Noah jumped to $16.10, the highest level since May 2011.
The Shanghai-based company is scheduled to report second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 21.  Noah, which distributes wealth-management products for
commission fees, boosted its 2013 adjusted net income forecast
Aug. 8 from its estimate of up to $37 million given on May 6.
Its current 2013 profit projection represents growth of as much
as 105 percent from 2012.  LightInTheBox, a Beijing-based company that sells life
style products to overseas market, surged 29 percent to $20.94,
the highest since its U.S. initial public offering in June. It
plans to release second-quarter results on Aug. 19.  Sina Corp. and  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ)  are scheduled to report
second-quarter earnings after U.S. markets close today.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  fell 1.4
percent to 9,599.46, sliding for a second week. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rallied 1.1 percent to 2,052.24 in its third
week of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
