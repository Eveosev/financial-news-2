The U.S. condemned a wave of attacks
yesterday in  Iraq  that killed dozens of civilians who were
celebrating the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting
observed by Muslims.  “The United States condemns in the strongest possible
terms the cowardly attacks today in Baghdad,” according to a
 statement  released yesterday by the State Department. “These
attacks were aimed at families celebrating the Eid al-Fitr
holiday that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The terrorists who committed these acts are enemies of Islam and
a shared enemy of the United States, Iraq, and the international
community.”  Car bombs in Baghdad and other cities killed 69 people and
wounded more than 200 others yesterday, the Associated Press
reported today, citing medical officials. It was the highest
single-day death toll since July 20, when assaults on two
prisons near  Baghdad  and other attacks killed 71, AP said.  Yesterday’s attacks resemble others in Iraq over the past
90 days, most of which were perpetrated by al-Qaeda in Iraq, led
by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to the State Department
statement. The U.S. is offering a $10 million reward for
information that leads to the killing or capture of al-Baghdadi.  The size of the reward “is second only to information
leading to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chief of Al Qaeda’s network,
and symbolizes our ongoing commitment to helping our partners in
the region eliminate this threat from their territory,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
