New Zealand’s two-year swap rate was
near the highest since 2011 after a private report showed
housing prices remained close to an all-time high in the South
Pacific nation.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand reiterated last month that
it doesn’t want to see financial or price stability compromised
by excessive housing demand. The Australian dollar declined
against all 16 major peers after posting the biggest weekly
advance in more than a year.  “New Zealand’s strong property market is a reason for
higher swap rates,” said Akira Takei, the head of the
international fixed-income department in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $39 billion.
“Cutting interest rates may be desirable for New Zealand’s
policy makers to weaken the currency and boost exports, but they
can’t.”  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate was at 3.41 percent as of
9:41 a.m. in Sydney after touching 3.43 percent on Aug. 9, the
highest since September 2011. The contracts allow investors to
exchange a floating rate with a fixed one or vice versa.  New Zealand’s currency was little changed at 80.31 U.S.
cents, while the Aussie fell 0.2 percent to 91.86 U.S. cents.
The kiwi climbed 2.6 percent and the Aussie jumped 3.4 percent
last week, the biggest gain for both currencies since December
2011.  The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand said today that
its  property-price index  was at 3,669.1 last month. While it
fell 0.5 percent from a month earlier, it’s still near the
record high of 3,686.9 set in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
