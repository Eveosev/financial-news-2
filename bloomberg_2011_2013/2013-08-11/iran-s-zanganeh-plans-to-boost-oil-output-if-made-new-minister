Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, a former
Iranian oil minister who has been nominated by President Hassan
Rohani to take over the ministry again, pledged to boost  Iran ’s
oil output should he be approved by the parliament.  “My first action will be to bring the country’s oil
production capacity back to 2005” levels, Zanganeh was quoted
as telling  Shana , the Oil Ministry’s news website. At that time
Iran wasn’t subject to  United Nations , U.S. and European Union
sanctions against its nuclear program. The measures, imposed
during ex-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s time in office, have
restricted international companies’ ties with Iran and the
country’s crude exports.  Rohani, who was inaugurated this month to succeed
Ahmadinejad, has pledged to work toward easing sanctions.
Parliament is set to review the qualifications of his proposed
ministers this week.  Iran, once the second-largest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi
Arabia , has slipped to sixth place, producing 2.56 million
barrels a day in July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The country produced about 4 million barrels a day in 2005,
according to Bloomberg.  “I don’t mean output should be immediately returned to its
past level because it may not be possible due to sanctions,”
Zanganeh said. “But stable production capacity should be
created so that we will be able under any circumstances to
benefit from oil for our domestic needs.”  Zanganeh served as oil minister from 1997-2005 and prior to
that was energy minister for nine years, Shana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
