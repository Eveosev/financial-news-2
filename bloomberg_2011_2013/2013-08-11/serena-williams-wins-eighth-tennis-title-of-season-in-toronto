Serena Williams  won her eighth WTA
tour title of the season at the Rogers Cup, her next-to-last
tournament before the U.S. Open, the final Grand Slam event of
the tennis season.  Williams, 31, defeated Sorana Cirstea of Romania 6-2, 6-0
in 65 minutes in yesterday’s final in Toronto.  “There’s a reason we have the rankings and why she’s on
top of those rankings,” Cirstea said. “She’s the No. 1 player,
and she’s proving that every single time she steps on court.”  It was the 54th career WTA tour title for Williams,
breaking a tie with  Monica Seles  for the ninth-most all-time.  Williams is scheduled to play one more hard-court event --
this week in Cincinnati -- ahead of her title defense at the
 U.S. Open , which starts Aug. 26 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
