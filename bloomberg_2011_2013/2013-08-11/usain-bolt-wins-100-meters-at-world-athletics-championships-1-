Six-time Olympic gold medalist Usain
Bolt of  Jamaica  regained his world 100-meter title, winning the
final in 9.77 seconds at the World Athletics Championships in
Moscow.  Bolt finished ahead of Justin Gatlin of the U.S. (9.85) and
Jamaican Nesta Carter (9.95) amid steady rain. Gatlin led from
the start before Bolt charged through to win on a track drenched
by a storm.  Bolt won the event at the world championships in Berlin in
2009, when he set the current world record of 9.58 seconds. He
was disqualified for a false start at the last edition in  South
Korea  two years ago.  Earlier, Olympic decathlon champion Ashton Eaton of the
U.S. won gold in the event. He finished on 8,809 points, ahead
of  Germany ’s Michael Schrader (8,670) and Canada’s Damian Warner
(8,512).  Brittney Reese of the U.S., the Olympic champion, won the
women’s long jump for the third consecutive time with a leap of
7.01 meters, followed by Blessing Okagbare of Nigeria (6.99m)
and Serbia’s Ivana Spanovic (6.82m).  Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia won the women’s 10,000-meter
title for the third time, and Sandra Perkovic of Croatia won the
women’s discus. Aleksandr Ivanov of  Russia  won the men’s 20-kilometer walk.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
