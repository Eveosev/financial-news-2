The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  fell the most among
major emerging-market benchmarks as Rossi Residencial SA led
homebuilders lower amid speculation Brazilian policy makers will
step up the pace interest-rate increases to fight inflation.  Cia. de Bebidas das Americas , the brewer also known as
AmBev, sank to a four-week low. The BM&FBovespa Real Estate
Index retreated from a one-week high. MMX Mineracao & Metalicos
SA,  Eike Batista ’s mining company, plunged the most on the
Brazilian benchmark equity gauge.  The Ibovespa fell 1.5 percent to 51,429.48 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo with 60 of its 71 stocks lower. The gauge
has gained 14 percent from this year’s low on July 3. The real
weakened 1.3 percent to 2.3798 per dollar at 5:28 p.m. local
time.  “Although the Ibovespa has gained quite a bit in the past
few weeks, there hasn’t been any significant improvement in the
outlook or the Brazilian economy to justify it,” Marc Sauerman,
a portfolio manager at Curitiba, Brazil-based J. Malucelli
Investimentos, said in a telephone interview. “The concerns
about growth and inflation are still the same.”  Brazil ’s central bank will increase the benchmark lending
rate to 9.50 percent by the end of 2013, up from a previous
forecast of 9.25 percent, according to a central bank survey of
about 100 economists published today. The median estimate for
2014 inflation rose to 5.84 percent from 5.80 percent.  AmBev declined 1.3 percent to 81.69 reais. Rossi tumbled
6.3 percent to 2.81 reais, the worst performer on the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index, which slipped 1.6 percent.  Suzano Gains  The Ibovespa earlier gained as much as 0.4 percent as
 Suzano Papel e Celulose SA  led gains by some commodities
exporters amid speculation that a weaker real will boost sales
outside Brazil. The pulp maker, which gets about half of its
 revenue  abroad, climbed 0.9 percent to 8.95 reais, the best
performance on the MSCI Brazil/Materials index.  MMX lost 8.1 percent to 2.16 reais.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 13.4 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.3 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21
developing nations’ equities. Trading volume of stocks in  Sao
Paulo  was 5.25 billion reais today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with a daily average of 7.76 billion
reais this year through Aug. 20, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
