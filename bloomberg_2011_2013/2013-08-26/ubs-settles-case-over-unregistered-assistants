UBS AG (UBS) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
will pay $4.58 million to settle an investigation by regulators
into whether its sales assistants were licensed in states where
they did business.  UBS’s “client service associates” took orders without
having the required state registrations, according to a
statement today by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, which
said it led the case. The Zurich-based bank didn’t admit or deny
the allegations.  “Over a six-year period, UBS failed to recognize a flaw
in its order entry systems that allowed unregistered persons to
accept customer orders,” Abbe R. Tiger, the New Jersey agency’s
chief, said in the statement.  UBS’s sales assistants also weren’t adequately supervised,
New Jersey regulators said. Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch brokerage settled a similar state investigation in 2009.  “UBS is pleased to have resolved this legacy registration
issue which involved unsolicited orders,” Gregg Rosenberg, a
UBS spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
