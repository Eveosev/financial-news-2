Violin Memory Inc., the maker of
memory-storage technology that’s partly owned by  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,
is seeking as much as $172.5 million in a U.S. initial public
offering.  Violin Memory didn’t say how many shares it will offer or
at what price in a regulatory filing today. The  Mountain View ,
California-based company has applied to list on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol VMEM.  The company, which provides flash memory for data centers,
originally filed IPO plans confidentially with U.S. regulators
last year, contemplating a market value of as much as $2
billion, people familiar with the discussions said at the time.  Chief Executive Don Basile joined Violin Memory in 2009
after serving as CEO of  Fusion-io Inc. (FIO) , another flash-memory
technology company, for a year, filings show. Fusion-io went
public in June 2011, raising $269 million including an over-allotment, and has since declined 43 percent in trading.  Affiliates of Toshiba, the Tokyo-based maker of products
from flash-memory chips to steam turbines, is Violin Memory’s
biggest shareholder, with a more than 14 percent stake before
the offering, filings show.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America
Corp. are leading Violin Memory’s offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
