West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for the first time in three days as orders for U.S. durable
goods dropped more than forecast in July and  Libya  restarted
exports from a previously closed port.  Prices slipped 0.5 percent after the Commerce Department
said  bookings  for goods meant to last at least three years
decreased 7.3 percent, the most since August 2012. Exports
resumed from Brega, one of four ports where force majeure was
declared on Aug. 18, according to officials in Tripoli.  “Fundamentally, we should be lower,” said Tariq Zahir, a
New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
“Some of the economic numbers aren’t looking good. Exports from
Libya are picking up a little bit and that put pressure on the
market.”  WTI for October delivery slid 50 cents to end at $105.92 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all
futures was less than half the 100-day average for the time of
day. Prices are up 15 percent in 2013.  Brent for October slipped 31 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
settle at $110.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. Volume was 62 percent below the 100-day average
as the U.K. markets were shut for a bank holiday. The price
reached $111.68 in intraday trading, a four-month high. Brent’s
premium over WTI widened to $4.81 a barrel.  Durable Goods  The drop in durable-goods orders was bigger than the 4
percent decline forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Orders  excluding transportation  equipment fell 0.6 percent, the
Commerce Department said.  “The durable-goods report is disappointing,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The tanker Vallesina departed Brega two days ago for  Italy 
with 630,000 barrels of crude, Ibrahim Al Awami, director of
measurement at Libya’s National Oil Corp., said in a telephone
interview yesterday. Deputy Oil Minister Omar Shakmak said by
phone that it’s the first export from Brega since the Aug. 22
lifting of the force majeure.  Es Sider, the North African nation’s largest port, Ras
Lanuf and Zueitina remain shut, Awami said. Brega may add 90,000
barrels a day to current shipments of 500,000 from the nation, a
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  “The Libya news is negative for the market,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  Libya Exports  The country’s oil output averaged 640,000 barrels a day in
August, Deputy Oil Minister Omar Shakmak said today in a phone
interview from Tripoli. Libya produced 800,000 barrels a day of
crude last month, half the rate pumped a year earlier, according
to a Bloomberg survey of output from the 12-member OPEC. Libya
holds Africa’s largest oil reserves.  WTI gained earlier on speculation that tension in  Syria 
will affect  Middle East  supplies. Conflicts in Syria and unrest
in  Egypt  have raised concern that larger oil-exporting nations
in the Middle East will be affected.  World leaders denounced what they said was the use of
chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and called
for action as  United Nations  inspectors attempted to probe the
allegations.  “Syria is still in the news and leading the headlines,”
Baruch said.  Egypt’s military-backed government has killed almost a
thousand people in the last two weeks and placed Cairo under
curfew. The government has lined roads with soldiers, bridges
with tanks, and some roofs with snipers.  Long Positions  Money managers reduced net-long positions in WTI crude, or
wagers that prices will increase, by 2 percent to 302,762
futures and options combined in the seven days ended Aug. 20,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
report on Aug. 23.  Hedge funds  and other speculators boosted net-longs in
 Brent crude  to 208,313 lots in the same period, from 193,527 in
the week to Aug. 13, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
October was 20.8 percent, little changed from Aug. 23, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 260,544
contracts as of 2:35 p.m. It totaled 523,035 contracts
yesterday, 19 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.83 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
