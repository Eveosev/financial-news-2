Gasoline slipped on speculation
demand will drop as the summer driving season ends after the
Sept. 2 U.S. Labor Day holiday and as the school year begins.  Futures slid after gaining 1.3 percent last week amid a
series of unplanned refinery outages from Canada to  Texas .
Gasoline also declined on concern that the  Federal Reserve  will
start tapering monetary stimulus in September.  “We’re going into the shoulder season and there’s the
possibility of tapering in September,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The
expectations of a shortage of supply are diminishing.”  Gasoline for September delivery fell 2.56 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9816 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on trading volume that was 36 percent below
the 100-day average.  Gasoline, after jumping 11 percent in July, has declined
2.1 percent this month.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed a third straight day, dropping 56
cents to $13.59 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent declined
56 cents to $8.97.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, was unchanged a second
day at $3.541 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today
on its website. Prices are 20.7 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery fell 0.64
cent to $3.0886 a gallon on trading volume that was 43 percent
below the 100-day average. Prices are up 1.5 percent this month.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI slipped 4 cents to $23.70 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  gained 1 cent to $19.13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
