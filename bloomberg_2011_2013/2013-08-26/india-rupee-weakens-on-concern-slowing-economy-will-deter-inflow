India ’s rupee fell on concern that
slowing economic growth will make it tougher to attract
investment as the U.S. prepares to rein in stimulus.  Gross domestic product  in  Asia ’s No. 3 economy probably
rose 4.6 percent in the three months through June 30, less than
the 4.8 percent expansion in the prior quarter, according to the
median of 27 economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due
Aug. 30. Minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s July meeting released
Aug. 21 showed policy makers were “broadly comfortable” with
reducing bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, this year
should the  U.S. economy  improve.  “The rupee’s losses are part a reflection of broad
emerging-market vulnerability to the Fed unwinding its QE, and
part a product of local structural and cyclical problems,” Tim
Fox, chief economist at Emirates NBD in Dubai, wrote in a
research report today. With “Indian GDP data expected to remain
weak,” the rupee will stay under pressure, he wrote.  The rupee weakened 1.2 percent to 64.0963 per dollar as of
10:22 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency surged 2.1 percent on Aug.
23, its biggest gain since June 2012, after touching an all-time
low of 65.56 a day earlier. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
16.51 percent.  Global funds cut  holdings  of Indian debt by $9.8 billion
since May 22, when the Fed first flagged the possible paring of
stimulus. The outflows leave the rupee vulnerable to a current-account deficit that official data shows widened to an
unprecedented 4.8 percent of GDP in the year ended March 31.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.2 percent to
65.60 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were unchanged at 65.87. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
