As the U.S. bond market suffers its
worst rout since 2009, the gauge that historically signals more
pain for fixed-income investors is instead suggesting  yields (USGG10YR)  are
near their peak.  The gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields widened to
2.55 percentage points this month, double the median of 1.23
points since 1990 and approaching the record 2.93 points in
February 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield curve
is steepening at the fastest pace since 2009 as the  Federal
Reserve  signals its intent to keep the target interest rate for
overnight loans between banks at about zero into 2015 while
reducing the bond-buying economic stimulus that drove 10-year
yields to the highest level in more than two years.  While the yield curve typically steepens when faster growth
leads investors to demand more insulation from inflation, bond
strategists say this time is different. After rising from this
year’s low of 1.61 percent on May 1 to 2.93 percent last week,
the increase in 10-year yields will slow, with rates reaching
3.05 percent in the second quarter of next year, according to 63
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Losses will be limited by
an economy growing at half the post-World War II average and an
inflation rate below the Fed’s 2 percent target, they say.  Yield ‘Artifact’  “I don’t think the steepness of the curve is reflective of
very bullish expectations for growth or great concern for
inflation,” Wan-Chong Kung, who helps oversee more than $100
billion as a  fund manager  at Nuveen Asset Management in
 Minneapolis , said in an Aug. 21 telephone interview. “It’s an
artifact of the very accommodative monetary policy we continue
to operate under.”  When the yield curve reached its record in February 2010,
investors pushed the 10-year rate to 3.77 percent after the Fed
restated its intention to withdrawal extraordinary stimulus
measures as the economy strengthened.  The widest gap before the 2007 financial crisis was 2.86
percent in August 2003 as the Fed held its  overnight rate  at a
then-record 1 percent while the economy lost jobs amid sluggish
growth. The average spread in the 1980s was 0.48 percentage
point, 0.88 percentage point in the 1990s and 1.06 percentage
points from 2000 through 2008.  Housing Slump  Yields on 10-year Treasuries reached 2.93 percent on Aug.
22, the highest since July 2011 as minutes of the Fed’s last
meeting showed policy makers supported slowing the pace of its
bond purchases this year. The price of the benchmark 2.5 percent
note due August 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
value, to 97 9/32 last week, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show.  While yields touched the high for the year, bonds ended the
week with a rally after a Commerce Department report showed that
sales of newly built homes declined 13.4 percent in July to a
394,000 annualized pace, the weakest since October.  The yield was 2.80 percent today as of 12:26 p.m. in  New
York .  This year’s losses on Treasuries -- the  Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  is down 3.6 percent -- will reverse by
mid-2014 if the analyst survey proves correct. An investor
buying $10 million of 10-year notes will earn about $160,000
after accounting for interest payments by June 30 even if yields
rise to 3 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said the central bank will
keep its overnight lending rate at zero to 0.25 percent into
2015. That’s anchoring two-year note yields, which in turn
restrain 10-year securities.  Taper Speculation  “Until such time as it’s pretty clear that the Fed is
actually going to raise  interest rates , an additional sell-off”
will likely be capped, Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist
at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, said in an Aug. 19
telephone interview. The firm is one of the 21 primary dealers
of U.S. government securities that trade with the Fed.  Speculation that the Fed will taper its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases led to the rout in bond markets, with
Treasuries losing 3.6 percent this year.  The decline is the worst since the 3.72 percent loss in all
of 2009 and more than the 3.35 percent drop in 1994 after the
Fed doubled its benchmark rate to 6 percent, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury index. The firm’s
Global Broad Market Index has fallen 1.62 percent this year, the
largest decline in data going back to 1997.  U.S.-registered bond mutual and exchange-traded funds lost
$30.3 billion to investor redemptions this month through Aug.
19, the third-highest on record, according to a report last week
by TrimTabs Investment Research in Sausalito,  California . The
withdrawals followed $69.1 billion of redemptions in June and
$42 billion in October 2008.  Yield ‘Pressure’  “We are seeing retail bail out of bond funds,” Andrew Richman, the West Palm Beach, Florida-based director of fixed-income at SunTrust Bank’s private wealth management division,
which oversees about $101 billion, said in an Aug. 21 telephone
interview. “The Fed is going to slow down their bond purchases.
Foreign investors are also slowing down their bond purchases.
And banks are actually dumping some Treasuries and making more
loans. All of that is really putting pressure on yields.”  Bank holdings of Treasury and agency debt fell $34.7
billion to $1.81 trillion in July, the biggest monthly drop in
10 years, and an additional $20 billion in the first week of
August, Fed data showed on Aug. 16.  Commercial and industrial
loans  at U.S. banks have surged to $1.57 trillion, the highest
since 2008, from $1.49 trillion in December, Fed data show.  Bond Hedges  U.S. government securities held by international investors
fell 2.2 percent to $5.6 trillion in June, and is down from the
peak of $5.72 trillion in March, Treasury data show.  Traders are also selling Treasuries to hedge stakes in
corporate and mortgage debt,  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond
strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said
in an Aug. 20 telephone interview. RBS is also a primary dealer.  Fed policy makers were “broadly comfortable” with
Bernanke’s plan to start reducing bond buying, known as
quantitative easing, this year if the economy improves, with a
few saying tapering might be needed soon, according to the
record of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 30-31
gathering released Aug. 21.  Reductions will be announced at the next FOMC meeting Sept.
17-18, according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg
survey conducted Aug. 9-13. Last month, 50 percent of
respondents predicted a September reduction.  Investors see a 51.5 percent chance the Fed will raise
borrowing costs by its December 2014 meeting, from about 40
percent a month ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bernanke Successor  Yields have also been increasing amid speculation about who
will follow Bernanke when his term expires in January.  Lawrence Summers , the former  Treasury Secretary  under
President  Bill Clinton  and National Economic Council director
for President  Barack Obama , current Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  and former Fed Vice Chairman  Donald Kohn  have been
mentioned by the president as candidates.  A Bloomberg survey of 63 economists published Aug. 14 found
that 65 percent said Yellen would be Obama’s pick and 25 percent
expect the president to choose Summers.  “Because Yellen is viewed as another Bernanke, you have
more certainty about the promises the Fed is making when it
comes to low rates,” Briggs of RBS said. “With Summers there’s
been a lot of effort to say that he’s pro-QE and he’s not going
to be pulling back, but there’s extra uncertainty.”  The rise in yields has brought Treasuries closer to fair
value, according to the  term premium , which reached 0.55 percent
Aug. 22, the highest since July 2011.  Turning Positive  The gauge turned positive June 19 for the first time since
October 2011, according to Columbia Management. A value of 0.50
percent to 0.75 percent is normal for a developed market economy
with slow inflation, according to Zach Pandl, a  money manager  at
the company, which oversees $340 billion.  Models of term premium, a gauge of the compensation
investors demand for the risk of holding longer-duration debt,
includes variables such as expectations for growth and
inflation. The Fed’s purchases of debt through its quantitative
easing programs first began in 2008 has helped depress long-term
rates in part by damping the premium.  Economists have used the gap between yields on three-month
Treasury bills and 10-year notes to predict economic
contractions. Short-term rates have topped longer maturities
eight times since 1960, with recessions following in seven of
those cases. There hasn’t been a downturn that wasn’t preceded
by a so-called inverted curve in that period.  Tame Inflation  As the curve has widened, consumer prices have remained
tame and growth sluggish.  The personal consumption expenditures deflator, the Fed’s
preferred measure of inflation, rose 1.3 percent in June, and
has been below the central bank’s 2 percent target since May
2012. The  five-year, five-year forward break-even rate , which
projects the pace of consumer price increases starting in 2018,
ended last week at 2.71 percent, below its average over the past
decade of 2.75 percent.  The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annualized pace from
April through June up from 1.1 percent for the first three
months of 2013, Commerce Department data show. U.S. gross
domestic product has grown an average of 3.3 percent a year
since the end of World War II. It will expand 1.6 percent this
year and 2.7 percent in 2014, according to the median estimate
of about 70 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield curve widening “has nothing to do with the
economy, it just has to do with tapering and the idea that the
biggest buyer in the market is going to ease back its
purchases,”  Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at TD
Securities Inc. in New York, said in an Aug. 21 telephone
interview. “The market has already priced for its
termination.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
