New York  Giants starting free safety
Stevie Brown, whose eight interceptions last year were tied for
the second-most in the National Football League, will miss this
season with a torn ligament in his left knee.  Brown was placed on injured reserve yesterday, a day after
his knee buckled as he returned an interception during the
Giants’ preseason loss against the New York Jets. Tests showed
that Brown suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament.  “I feel badly for him,” Giants coach Tom Coughlin said of
Brown on a media conference call. “He’s worked hard. He’s
prepared himself well and been in a position where he’s made a
lot of plays for us. We will definitely miss him.”  The Giants’ other starting safety, Antrel Rolle, has been
out since Aug. 12 with a sprained ankle, though Coughlin said he
expects him back for the team’s opening regular-season game
against the Dallas Cowboys on Sept. 8. Coughlin said Ryan Mundy,
who has been filling in for Rolle, will probably replace Brown
after Rolle returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
