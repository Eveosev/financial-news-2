Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
South Africa’s biggest construction company by market value,
gained the most in 17 months after returning to profit.  The stock  advanced  5.9 percent, the largest one-day
increase since March 16 last year to 25.30 rand by the close in
Johannesburg. The volume of shares traded amounted to 50 percent
of the three-month daily average.  Earnings per share will range from 2.35 rand to 2.55 rand
for the year through June, compared with a year-earlier loss of
2.14 rand, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today.  South Africa’s construction industry is grappling with a
slowing economy, with growth forecast by the central bank at 2
percent this year, the lowest rate since a 2009 recession. The
 Competition Commission  fined about 18 builders, including Murray
& Roberts, about 1.5 billion rand for collusion in contracts for
the 2010  Soccer World Cup .  To contact the reporter on this story:
