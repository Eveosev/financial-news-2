Bank of America Corp .’s lawsuit
against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over $1.7 billion in
investor losses was dismissed by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Washington threw
out the case, saying there weren’t enough assets to make any
payments on general creditor claims.  Bank of America’s claims, based on its role as trustee for
Ocala Funding LLC, “have no value and must therefore be
dismissed because no case or controversy exists,” Rothstein
wrote in her decision yesterday.  The case stems from a mortgage-fraud scheme at failed
lender Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. From 2002 through
August 2009,  Lee Farkas , while he was chairman of  Taylor Bean ,
sold more than $1.5 billion in fake  mortgage loans  to Colonial
Bank with the collusion of its employees and diverted more than
$1.5 billion from Ocala Funding, a financing vehicle Taylor Bean
controlled.  Farkas is serving a 30-year sentence after being convicted
in April 2011 of 14 counts of conspiracy and bank, wire and
 securities fraud  in what prosecutors said was a $3 billion
scheme involving fake mortgage assets.  The judge also found that the court didn’t have
jurisdiction “because the Colonial receivership will never have
the assets necessary to satisfy a judgment” in favor of
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America.  The case is Bank of America v. FDIC, 10-cv-01681, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
