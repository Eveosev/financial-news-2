Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , the  worst
performer  this year among Australia’s 50 largest publicly traded
companies, rose the most in two weeks in Sydney trading to lead
gains by gold producers after the metal touched its highest
level since June.  Newcrest rose 7 percent to A$13.97 at 11:33 a.m. in Sydney,
the most on an intraday basis since Aug. 12.  Resolute Mining
Ltd. (RSG)  advanced 7.4 percent and  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU)  gained 6.4
percent. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was little
changed.  Gold prices  rose above $1,400 for the first time in more
than two months as investors weighed speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s $85 billion a month of asset purchases could
be sustained for longer as data showed U.S. new-home sales fell
more than 13 percent in July. Bullion for immediate delivery
traded at $1396.03 at 11:34 a.m. in Sydney, after it had earlier
risen to as much as $1,407.18 an ounce, the highest price since
June 7.  Producers including Newcrest may look to seize on a rally
in gold prices to raise capital, said Jo Battershill, a
resources analyst with UBS AG in Sydney.  “If there’s an opportunity to raise money in the market,
now’s probably the time,” he said by phone. “I don’t know how
long the strength in the gold market is likely to last, it seems
to be a week by week proposition depending on what comments are
made by the Fed.”  Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. (KCN)  rose 8.3 percent,  Beadell
Resources Ltd. (BDR)  gained 4.9 percent and Alacer Gold Corp. advanced
4 percent in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
