Palm oil  advanced by the most in
eight months on concern that the soybean crop in the U.S., the
largest grower of the oilseed that’s crushed to make an
alternative oil, may be smaller-than-forecast on dry weather.  The contract for November delivery climbed as much as 3.6
percent to 2,451 ringgit ($743) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the biggest gain for the most-active
futures since Dec. 21, and traded at 2,440 ringgit at 11:43 a.m.
in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices rose 2.5 percent last week after a 4.6
percent advance in the previous five-day period.  Soybean output in the U.S. may be 3.158 billion bushels
after planting delays and unusually cool, dry weather stunted
growth, according to the Professional Farmers of America. Hot,
mostly dry weather for most of the Midwest in the next seven to
10 days will put added stress on some crops, DTN said Aug. 23.
Exports from  Malaysia , the second-largest producer, climbed 7.1
percent to 1.16 million tons in the first 25 days of this month
from the same period in July, surveyor Intertek said Aug. 20.  “August and September is a very critical period for the
soybean crop, so dry weather at this stage will be very bad for
the yields, for the maturity and production,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International Futures Sdn.
“Some anticipation is there that demand could shift to palm oil
but it is too early to say. Palm oil exports from Malaysia may
be 5 percent higher this month from a month ago.”  Soybean oil for delivery in December climbed as much as 4
percent to 44.7 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, and
traded at 44.62 cents. Soybeans for November delivery rose as
much as 4.6 percent to $13.8925 a bushel and were at $13.86.
That’s the highest since June for the most-active contract.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 3.7 percent to
5,754  yuan  ($940) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  rose 4 percent to 7,362 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
