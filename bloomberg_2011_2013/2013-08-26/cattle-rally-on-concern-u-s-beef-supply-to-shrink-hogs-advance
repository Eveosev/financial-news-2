Cattle prices advanced the most in
almost two weeks on speculation that U.S. beef supplies will
shrink as feedlots add fewer animals. Hog futures rose.  About 10 percent fewer cattle were added to feedlots last
month compared to July 2012, government data showed on Aug. 23,
after the close of regular trading. Corn prices climbed as much
as 5.7 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade as a heat wave in
the Midwest threatens crop yields. Animals use more energy to
stay cool during higher temperatures, curbing weight gains.  “The cattle-on-feed report was positive,”  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “The grain moving higher should
be supportive. The other issue is the intense heat typically
cuts weights.”  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$1.2725 a pound at 9:42 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
heading for the biggest gain for the most-active contract since
Aug. 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement slid 0.4
percent to $1.58225 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.8 percent to
85.75 cents a pound. Prices declined 1.9 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
