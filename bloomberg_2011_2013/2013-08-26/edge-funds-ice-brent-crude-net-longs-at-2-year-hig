Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude to the highest in more than
two years for a second straight week, according to data from ICE
Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 208,313 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitments
of Traders report. That’s up 7.6 percent from last week and is
the most since at least January 2011, the starting point for the
data series.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 403,399, a 1.1
percent expansion from the week before, leaving their  net-short 
position at the largest since July 16.  Brent advanced 0.3 percent in the week to Aug. 20 to
$110.66 a barrel and traded at $110.96 as of 4:22 p.m. local
time today.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers reduced net-long positions in Brent to the
lowest since April 16, by 11 percent to 208,391.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
rose for the first time in four weeks, climbing 14.1 percent to
65,784 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
