Cia. de Bebidas das Americas , the
Brazilian unit of  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , fell to a four-week
low on concern that rising interest rates will curb spending on
beer and other alcoholic beverages.  Non-voting shares of AmBev, as the company is also known,
 lost  1.3 percent to 81.69 reais at the close of trading in Sao
Paulo, the lowest since July 29. The MSCI  Brazil /Consumer
Staples index sank 1.3 percent.  Economists covering Brazil expect policy makers to raise
the country’s benchmark interest rate to 9.50 percent by the end
of this year, based on a weekly central bank survey released
today. That compares with a year-end forecast of 9.25 percent
the previous week.  “Stocks of companies that depend on internal demand are
suffering because of the prospects of interest-rate increases,”
Felipe Rocha, an analyst at brokerage firm Omar Camargo, said by
phone from Curitiba, Brazil. “The raise will affect the
country’s growth and these companies’ revenue through next
year.”  Brazilian policy makers meet on Aug. 28 and 29 to set the
benchmark Selic rate, which is at 8.5 percent currently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
