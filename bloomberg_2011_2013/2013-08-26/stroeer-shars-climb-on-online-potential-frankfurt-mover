Stroeer Media AG (SAX) ,  Germany ’s largest
outdoor advertising company, climbed to a 15-month high as
investors bet its expansion in the online market will spur
growth.  Stroeer, which last week reported a return to profit in the
three months through June 30, gained as much as 4.7 percent to
11.40 euros, the highest intraday price since May 2012. The
shares traded up 2.6 percent at 1:58 p.m. in Frankfurt with
volume exceeding the three-month daily average.  The acquisition of a 91 percent stake in Munich-based
adscale GmbH, a provider of an online ad exchange, in December,
and Berlin-based mobile advertising company RAdcarpet from
Servtag GmbH in May is boosting growth potential, said Marcus Silbe, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Close Brothers Seydler
Research AG.  “Stroeer will benefit from being able to offer customers
billboard and online advertisement as a package in the mid- and
long-term,” said Silbe. “This would be a structural
advantage.”  The stock has gained more than 70 percent this year,
valuing the company at about 550 million euros ($736 million).
Stroeer reported a second-quarter profit of 3.47 million euros
last week, compared with a loss of 5.78 million euros in the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
