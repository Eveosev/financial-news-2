The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 3.99 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.5586 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Aug. 23 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is about 20.05 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.7591 a gallon.  “We have tremendous gasoline production occurring here and
American refiners are running at very high rates of capacity,”
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said in a
telephone interview. “There is no tightness in supply; if
anything we have an oversupply of gasoline in the  United
States .”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  Long Island ,  New York , where
it averaged $3.82 a gallon, Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Charleston,  South Carolina , where
customers paid an average of $3.22 a gallon. Regular gasoline
averaged $3.80 a gallon in  Los Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  gained
9.9 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $3.0072 a gallon in the two weeks
to Aug. 23.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  tumbled 4.03 million barrels in
the week ended Aug. 16 to 218.4 million, the lowest since May,
according to data compiled by the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  No ‘Emergency’  “Since there is no supply emergency occurring worldwide
for crude oil, that leaves gasoline without a major hike from
crude anytime soon,” Lundberg said. “A further decrease in the
price at the pump is more likely than a rise. We may see a few
more cents decline in the next several days.”  West Texas Intermediate crude on the Nymex climbed 45
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $106.42 a barrel in the two weeks
ended Aug. 23.  Crude  inventories  fell a third consecutive time in the week
ended Aug. 16, dropping 1.43 million barrels to 359.1 million,
the lowest level in almost a year. Inventories at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, fell 1.09 million barrels
to 37.4 million, the lowest level in 17 months.  WTI will probably decline this week on speculation that
demand from refineries will drop with the end of the peak-demand
summer driving season, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Twenty of 33 analysts, or 61 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Aug. 30. Seven respondents, or 21 percent,
predicted an increase and six said there would be no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
