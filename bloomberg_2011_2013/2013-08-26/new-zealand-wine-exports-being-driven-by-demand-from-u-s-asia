An increase in the value of New
Zealand’s wine exports is being driven by demand from the U.S.,
 Canada  and Asia as traditional markets in Australia and the U.K.
retrench, according to a report from the country’s winegrowers.  Exports rose 3 percent by value to a record NZ$1.21 billion
($944 million) in the 12 months through June, although dropping
5 percent in volume, New Zealand Winegrowers said in its annual
report.  While the value of New Zealand’s wine exports has almost
quadrupled since 2004, that period has been marked by volatile
production, with the vineyard area almost doubling and jumps in
output in years such as 2008 creating oversupply. Growers are
now seeking to focus on premium export wines to protect margins.  “The major growth opportunities are outside our
traditional markets of the U.K. and  Australia ,” Steven Green,
chairman of  New Zealand Winegrowers , said in the report. “To
generate volume and value growth, producers will need to
navigate complex and sometimes chaotic markets that have not
been fully developed up to this point.”  Sales to the U.S. rose 13 percent to NZ$283.7 million and
those to Canada increased 10 percent to NZ$78.2 million,
according to the report. Exports to  China  gained 6 percent to
NZ$26.9 million, while shipments to Hong Kong climbed 11 percent
to NZ$20.5 million and those to  Germany  surged 25 percent to
NZ$9.5 million.  Shipments to the biggest traditional markets in Australia
and the U.K. fell 2 percent in value and more in volume over the
past year amid pricing pressure.  “The longer-term trend towards market diversification is
undeniable,” Green said.  The 2013 vintage produced a record grape crush of 345,000
metric tons, up 28 percent from the previous year’s depleted
crop and 5 percent above the 2011 vintage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
