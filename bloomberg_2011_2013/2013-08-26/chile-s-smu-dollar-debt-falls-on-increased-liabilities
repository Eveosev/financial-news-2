Dollar bonds of SMU SA, the Chilean
retailer that has breached debt covenants, fell for a sixth day
after the company said it understated an increase in total
liabilities by almost twice the amount previously estimated.  The yields on SMU’s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose 19 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to a record 15.78 percent at
1:01 p.m. in Santiago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price fell 0.58 cent to 68.23 cents on the dollar.  SMU, a supermarket operator controlled by billionaire
Alvaro Saieh, said in an Aug. 23 regulatory  filing  that a review
of its first-quarter earnings report had uncovered mistakes in
the way it accounted for store lease contracts, resulting in an
increase of $151 million in total financial liabilities. That
compares with an estimate of $76 million the the company gave on
July 11.  SMU had total liabilities of 1.6 trillion pesos ($3.1
billion) at the end of the first quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company plans to sell $600 million in
shares and sell assets to pay down debt and finance expansion
plans, according to regulatory filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
