Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index advancing for a second day, led by metal producers, after
a slump in U.S. home sales eased speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce stimulus next month.  The Topix climbed 0.3 percent to 1,145.02 as of 9:01 a.m.
in  Tokyo . The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 0.3 percent to
13,707.31.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index were little
changed today. The measure rose 0.4 percent on Aug. 23, posting
its first two-day rally in three weeks, as investors watched Fed
officials for signals on stimulus cuts after data showed home
sales plunged.  New home purchases in the U.S. plunged in July by the most
in three years, data Aug. 23 showed. Three Fed regional bank
presidents, speaking from a conference in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming,
differed over the timing for reducing U.S. bond buying in
interviews.  Stocks and bonds globally have been whipsawed since May,
when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first signaled the prospect of
cuts to stimulus should the economy and job market continue to
improve. The Fed will probably pare its $85 billion a month in
bond purchases at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
