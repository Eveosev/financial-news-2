Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biofuel producer
backed by French  oil company  Total SA, held an opening ceremony
for a demonstration facility backed by Coca-Cola Co. and  Toray
Industries Inc. (3402)  that will produce a plastic component from
plants.  The Silsbee, Texas, project uses biomass materials to make
paraxylene, a building block for plastic bottles, textiles and
clothing, the Englewood, Colorado-based company said in a
statement today. Toray, the largest maker of carbon fiber,
funded the plant and is buying the output which can be made into
polyethylene terephthalate, or PET.  Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soda maker, gave research
and development support with the goal of getting all of its  PET
bottles from plant materials, Scott Vitters, a general manager
of the Atlanta-based company, said in the statement.  “We believe Gevo possesses technologies that have high
potential to create it on a global commercial level within the
next few years,” said Vitters. “The opening of this facility
is an important milestone toward our vision of creating all of
our PET plastic packaging from responsibly-sourced plant
materials.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
