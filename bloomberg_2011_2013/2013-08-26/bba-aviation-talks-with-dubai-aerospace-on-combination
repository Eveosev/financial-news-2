BBA Aviation Plc (BBA) , the world’s
biggest provider of bases for  business jets , and aircraft
leasing company Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd. said they are
discussing a combination of parts of their businesses.  Talks concern “certain parts of its business,” DAE said
in a statement today, adding there are “no other details” on
the matter at this time. BBA said there can be no assurance of a
transaction. The company, which is based and listed in London,
is valued at about 1.48 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).  DAE, which was set up in 2006 with the aim of becoming one
of the world’s biggest aircraft lessors, dropped most of its
aircraft purchases since its finances weakened in the global
recession. The company ordered 100 planes from Airbus SAS and
 Boeing Co. (BA)  at the 2007 Dubai air show, only to scale back its
ambitions and cancel 45 Airbus planes valued at $5.8 billion.  The Sunday Times reported yesterday that BBA is in talks to
purchase its U.S. rival Standard Aero and that DAE, which owns
the Arizona-based engine repair and maintenance business, may
take a stake in the enlarged business. Such a transaction would
value the combined business at 2.7 billion pounds and Standard
Aero at 1.3 billion pounds, the newspaper said.  BBA Aviation rose as much as 5.3 pence, or 1.7 percent,. to
309.5 pence in  London  on Aug. 23. Markets in London are closed
today for a holiday. The stock has advanced 38 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
