Denmark  said its  budget deficit  will
widen as the government of Scandinavia’s weakest economy cut its
growth forecast for this year.  Gross domestic product  will grow 0.2 percent in 2013, less
than the 0.5 percent forecast in May, the finance ministry said
today. Weaker growth and increased spending will drive up the
government’s budget deficit to 2 percent of GDP next year from
1.7 percent in 2013, it said.  Denmark’s $355 billion economy stagnated in the first
quarter after shrinking 0.5 percent in 2012. The economy is
struggling to emerge from a burst property bubble, which
triggered a banking crisis and wiped out more than a dozen
lenders since 2008. That’s undermined confidence and hurt
 consumer spending , which makes up half Denmark’s economy.  “We would need to have a very clear improvement of the
Danish economy in the second half to even reach 0.2 percent
growth,” said  Steen Bocian , chief economist at  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE) 
“So the government is actually optimistic rather than
pessimistic concerning the economic future, even as a forecast
cut may indicate the opposite.”  House Prices  The government kept its 2014 GDP forecast for 1.6 percent
growth. Private consumption will grow 0.4 percent this year and
accelerate to 1.2 percent in 2014.  House prices  will rise 3
percent in 2013 and 2.5 percent next year, it said.  Denmark’s benchmark 1.5 percent 2023 government bond
yielded 2.03 percent today or 16 basis points more than similar-maturity German debt. That compares with a record low spread
versus  Germany  of minus 31 in November 2012, according to
Bloomberg generic prices.  Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon said in an Aug. 21
interview that he plans to ease the 2014 budget as much as
possible to help boost employment while staying inside European
Union deficit restrictions.  The government has argued its fiscal restraint has enabled
monetary stimulus as the nation’s haven status from  Europe ’s
debt crisis drives down borrowing costs. The central bank’s
efforts to defend the krone’s peg to the euro have left its
deposit rate below zero since July last year.  The  Finance Ministry  said today the 2014 budget will
“support growth and employment” as the structural deficit
reaches 0.4 percent of GDP, just shy of a 0.5 percent EU
threshold.  The government in May cut its 2013 GDP forecast to 0.5
percent growth from 0.7 percent seen in April. The central bank
on June 12 also cut its 2013 GDP forecast to 0.5 percent growth,
from 0.8 percent previously.  Denmark’s finance ministry  said  late yesterday that the
country’s domestic financing need will decline to 102 billion
kroner ($18.3 billion) in 2014. That compares with a revised
2013 domestic financing need of 136 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
