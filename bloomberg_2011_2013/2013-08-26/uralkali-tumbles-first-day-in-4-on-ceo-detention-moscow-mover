OAO Uralkali tumbled the most in
three weeks after the chief executive officer of the world’s
biggest potash producer was detained in Belarus.  Vladislav Baumgertner was charged with abuse of office in
Minsk today, Pavel Traulko, a spokesman for Belarusian
investigators, said by phone. Uralkali sank 19 percent on July
30 after announcing its split from Belarusian Potash Co., or
BPC, a joint venture that controlled about 40 percent of global
potash exports. Baumgertner is chairman of BPC and faces as long
as 10 years in prison if found guilty.  The stock dropped as much as 3.8 percent and closed down
3.5 percent at 157.62 rubles in Moscow, the first retreat in
four days. The amount of shares trading was equivalent to about
76 percent of the three-month average.  “The Belarusian side has taken the most aggressive
position,” Elena Sadovskaya, an analyst at Rye, Man & Gor
Securities, said by phone from Moscow. “For the country’s
budget, the end to the trade partnership with Uralkali is a
serious loss.”  Uralkali’s press office declined to comment by phone.
Belarus said it’s also seeking the arrest of four other Uralkali
executives, accusing them of a scheme to cut state- owned
Belaruskali out of decision-making at the venture, causing
damages and losses of about $100 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
