Ticket sales tumbled last week for
Broadway musicals showing signs of age. Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers, however, had a good kick-off.  “Once,” “Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark” and “Rock of
Ages” reported their lowest grosses this year. “Once” took in
$636,000, down by more than a third from the $1 million-plus its
producers were enjoying each week last summer after winning the
2012  Tony Award  for best musical.  “Spider-Man,” at $967,000, had its lowest gross since
officially opening in June 2011. “Cinderella’”s $812,000 was
its worst weekly haul since opening in March. “Annie” pulled
in $747,000, down 7 percent and had its worst week since May.  Broadway sales overall declined 6 percent, to $20.6
million. Christopher Durang’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and
Spike” closed after a respectable five-month run and a more than
respectable Tony Award for best play.  “The Trip to Bountiful” did $482,000 over seven
performances, helped no doubt by a visit by  Michelle Obama , her
two daughters and their security detail.  “Motown,” one of last season’s biggest hits that was also
on the Obama weekend tour, did a buoyant $1.4 million.  A new production of “Romeo and Juliet” with Orlando Bloom
and Condola Rashad as the easy-on-the-eyes teen angels took in
$207,000 for two previews. “Soul Doctor,” about the guitar-playing Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, continued on life support,
earning just $187,000 over eight performances.  Muse highlights include  Peter Rainer  on  movies  and Hamptons
