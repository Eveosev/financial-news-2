Karim Benzema got the only goal as
Real Madrid won at Granada to start the Spanish soccer’s La Liga
with back-to-back victories.  French striker Benzema, who scored in the opening-round win
against Real Betis, struck the winner from close range in the
10th minute last night after Cristiano Ronaldo miscontrolled
Angel Di Maria’s cross.  Real joined defending champion Barcelona,  Atletico Madrid ,
Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal in beginning the league campaign
with two victories. Real next hosts Bilbao on Sept. 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
