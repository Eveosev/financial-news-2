Asian  stocks  rose for a second day
after a slump in U.S. home sales eased speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce economic stimulus next month.  Belle International Holdings Ltd., a retailer of woman’s
footwear, advanced 5.6 percent in  Hong Kong  after reporting
first half-net income. Newcrest Mining Ltd. jumped 4.9 percent,
leading a surge in Australian gold producers after the price of
the precious metal rose above $1,400 an ounce last week.  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. slumped 6.9 percent in Tokyo after saying one
of two irradiated water filters at its wrecked nuclear plant in
Fukushima will be shut until at least September.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index advanced 0.1 percent to 131.46
as of 7:27 p.m. in Tokyo, with eight of the gauge’s 10 industry
groups rising.  “Any disappointing economic reading out of the U.S. will
be interpreted as a sign that perhaps the economy is not ready
for tapering in September and perhaps the Fed may hold off,”
said Stan Shamu, a strategist at IG Ltd. in  Melbourne . “It’s
all about picking stocks with right fundamentals.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2.2 percent last week,
paring its gain this year through Aug. 23 to 1.6 percent. The
advance  lags  a 17 percent surge in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index as growth slows in  China  and speculation that the Fed will
curb stimulus spurred investors to sell assets across Asia and
 emerging markets .  The Asia Pacific index  traded  at 12.8 times estimated
earnings on Aug. 23 compared with 15.1 for the  S&P 500 Index  and
13.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Topix Drop  Japan’s Topix index slid 0.1 percent after swinging between
gains and losses. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2 percent, and
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.5 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index increased 1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.7 percent, climbing
from its biggest weekly decline in two months. The Shanghai
Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s stock
exchanges, rose 1.9 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index added 0.3
percent, and Singapore’s Straits Times Index dropped 0.1 percent
for an eighth day of losses.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent today. The measure
rose 0.4 percent on Aug. 23, when data showed new home purchases
in the U.S. plunged in July by the most in three years.
Investors are weighing when the Fed will start reining in $85
billion of monthly asset purchases.  Emerging Markets  The risk that the Fed’s trimming of bond buying will hurt
economies from  India  to  Turkey  by sparking an exodus of cash and
higher borrowing costs was a dominant theme at an annual meeting
of central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that
ended Aug. 24.  An  index  of emerging-market stocks last week fell 2.7
percent, the steepest decline in two months, compared with a 0.5
percent gain in the S&P 500. Such selloffs aren’t an issue for
Fed officials, who said their sole focus is the  U.S. economy  as
they consider when to start tapering asset purchases.  Belle International advanced 5.6 percent to HK$11 after
closing at a seven-week low last week. The company reported
first-half net income of 2.17 billion  yuan  after the close on
Aug. 23 versus an estimated 2.2 billion yuan.  Newcrest Mining rose 4.9 percent to A$13.70 in Sydney
trading to lead gains by gold producers after the metal touched
its highest level in more than two months. Perseus Mining Ltd.
gained 5.1 percent to 82 Australian cents. Zhaojin Mining
Industry Co. jumped 8 percent to HK$7 in Hong Kong.  Tokyo Electric slid 6.9 percent to 473 yen, the lowest
since May 13, as it searches for the cause of a leak at the
Fukushima plant that prompted the biggest escalation in the
nuclear crisis since the March 2011 disaster. Shutting one of
the two water filters compounds concern the utility is losing
its two-year battle to manage the buildup of contaminated water
at the Fukushima station.  BYD Co., the Chinese automaker partly owned by  Warren
Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., slumped 12 percent to
HK$28.45 in Hong Kong after predicting the smallest quarterly
profit in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
