 President  Barack Obama  hasn’t
decided whether the U.S. will take military action in Syria,
according to an administration official who asked for anonymity
to discuss internal deliberations.  The administration is considering whether to lay the
groundwork for a military response following the latest
suspected use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime against civilians.  U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said Britain is
convinced Assad was behind the alleged chemical weapons use and
that there was agreement with the U.S. and France on the need to
respond. Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  said his
country will join a coalition against Syria if the United
Nations fails to act.  UN inspectors are attempting to probe the allegations. Some
Syrian opposition groups say 1,300 people were killed in the
Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Assad has
called the accusations “nonsense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
