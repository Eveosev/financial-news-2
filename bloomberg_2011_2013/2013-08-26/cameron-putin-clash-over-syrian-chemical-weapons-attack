U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
and Russian President  Vladimir Putin  disagreed about whether
Bashar Al-Assad was responsible for a chemical weapons attack in
Syria last week.  In a phone call today, Cameron, who’s pushing for a
“strong response” to the attack, told Putin there was “little
doubt” Assad’s government was behind the attack, according to
the prime minister’s office. Putin’s response was that “they
did not have evidence of whether a chemical weapons attack had
taken place or who was responsible,” Cameron’s office said in
an e-mailed statement.  Cameron’s government will decide tomorrow whether to recall
Parliament early to discuss the situation, according to the
statement. His ministers have said they would make such a move
before military action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
