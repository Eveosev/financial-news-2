Canadian stocks erased gains,
sending the benchmark index lower after a two-day advance, as
concern over  Syria  overshadowed a rally in commodity shares and
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t reduce stimulus soon.  Paramount Resources Ltd. lost 2.8 percent as energy shares
slid. Alacer Gold Corp. and Endeavour Silver Corp. climbed more
than 4.1 percent to pace  gains  among commodity producers. Agrium
Inc. and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. jumped at least 2.4
percent as OAO Uralkali’s chief executive officer was detained
in Belarus after the largest potash producer pulled out of a
joint venture that controlled more than 40 percent of exports.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 2 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 12,760.30 at 4:00 p.m. in Toronto,
erasing an earlier advance of 0.4 percent. The index has  gained 
2.2 percent in August. Trading volume was 20 percent lower than
the 30-day average at this time of the day.  “Lots of people are in wait-and-see mode,” Brian Huen,
managing partner with Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. His firm manages C$220
million ($214 million). “They are going to be monitoring the
data out of the U.S. very closely to see what the Fed is going
to be doing. The materials index is up nicely.”  ‘Inexcusable’ Actions  Stocks fell after U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said
the president will hold Syria’s government accountable for using
chemical weapons. President  Barack Obama  is consulting with
allies and members of Congress and “believes there must be
accountability for those who have used the world’s most
dangerous weapons,” Kerry said.  “By any standard it is inexcusable,” Kerry told reporters
in  Washington  today, saying evidence makes it “undeniable”
that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime was responsible
for last week’s attack that the opposition blames for more than
1,300 deaths.  The S&P/TSX had gained as much as 0.4 percent earlier, led
by rising commodity shares, as a report showing a drop in U.S.
durable-goods orders spurred speculation the Fed won’t reduce
stimulus soon. U.S. Commerce Department data showed bookings for
goods meant to last at least three years decreased 7.3 percent,
the most since August 2012.  Federal Reserve officials are weighing when to begin
curbing bond purchases that they pledged to maintain until the
job market improves. Minutes released on Aug. 21 showed policy
makers were comfortable with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to
taper this year if the economy strengthens.  Crude, Gold  Nine of 10 industries fell as a decline in energy shares
offset a 1.7 percent rally in raw-materials producers.  Energy companies  dropped  0.4 percent, erasing an earlier
advance of as much as 0.3 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude
fell for the first time in three days, declining 0.5 percent.  Paramount Resources slid 2.8 percent to C$33.20. AltaGas
Ltd. fell 0.2 percent to C$35.52.  Alacer rose 7 percent to C$3.50, the highest level since
April. Iamgold Corp. climbed 1.6 percent to C$7.17. Endeavour
Silver gained 4.1 percent to C$5.83. Silver futures jumped 1.2
percent, while gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,393.10 an ounce.  Potash producers rallied after Uralkali CEO Vladislav
Baumgertner was charged with abusing his office as chairman of
Belarusian Potash Co., the trading venture that  Russia ’s
Uralkali and Belaruskali set up in 2005.  Agrium rose 3.3 percent to C$94.07. Potash Corp. gained 2.4
percent to C$32.10.  The S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index increased 0.2 percent to
a record high. Five of eight companies in the group rose today.
Canadian banks are scheduled to post earnings this week, with
Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia reporting tomorrow.  Canada Imperial Bank of Commerce climbed 1 percent to
C$80.69. Bank of Montreal rose 0.9 percent to C$65.78. Toronto-Dominion rose 0.2 percent to a record C$88.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
