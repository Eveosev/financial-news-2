Qatari stocks  slid the most since
January 2012 as some investors sold shares of the gas-rich
nation after the benchmark index reached a five-year high
earlier this month.  Qatar National Bank SAQ, the Gulf country’s biggest bank,
fell to the lowest this month, and Qatar Gas Transport Co., an
operator of vessels to transport liquefied natural gas, dropped
the most since March. The QE Index fell 1.8 percent to 9,898.54
at the end of trading, trimming the gain for the year to 18
percent. The measure had closed at 10,109.5 on Aug. 22, the
highest since September 2008.  Qatar’s stock market, along with those in neighboring
 United Arab Emirates , was upgraded to emerging-market status in
June by MSCI Inc., fueling speculation foreign investors will
channel more funds into these countries. The QE Index has risen
5.8 percent since the decision on June 11, compared with a 1.8
percent drop for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  “The market’s done quite well for the year and profit-booking is natural,” Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director at Shuaa
Asset Management, said by e-mail today. “We may see some
caution from investors especially if international markets drop
from these levels but at this stage there is little to suggest a
reversal.”  Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index declined 0.9
percent, the most since June 15.  Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark retreated
0.7 percent and Dubai’s lost 0.2 percent.  Qatar National Bank fell 1.6 percent to 173.4 riyals, while
Qatar Gas Transport slid 4.1 percent to 19.51 riyals.  Qatar’s benchmark “tested the 10,000 level, which is a
psychological barrier,” Ahmed Shehada, head of trading at QNB
Financial Services, said by phone from Doha.  To contact the reporters on this story:
