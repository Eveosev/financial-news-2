Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
 China ’s biggest developer by sales volume, said first-half
underlying profit rose 23 percent as it sold more properties.  Earnings excluding the revaluation of investment properties
rose to 4.66 billion  yuan  ($761 million) compared with 3.78
billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong
stock exchange statement today. Revenue rose 13 percent to 42
billion yuan.  Evergrande’s earnings rose after the company raised prices
in April and sold the most properties by area among Chinese
developers in the first half, according to China Real Estate
Information Corp., a property data and consulting firm. China
will seek “stable and healthy” development of the market, the
Communist Party’s Politburo said July 30, the first time this
year that authorities didn’t mention further tightening of
restrictions.  Evergrande’s contracted sales were 44.6 billion yuan in the
first half from a year earlier, accounting for almost 45 percent
of its target for the whole year, the developer said today.
Chinese developers begin selling properties while they are under
construction and book profits upon completion.  Evergrande’s  net gearing , or the debt-to-equity ratio, fell
to 58.4 percent, compared with 96.1 percent the same time last
year, the developer said today.  The company said in January that it is seeking to place 1
billion shares at HK$4.35 each and it will use the HK$4.35
billion ($561 million) raised to repay debt and for working
capital.  Evergrande’s  stock  was unchanged at HK$3.30 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong today before the earnings were announced.
It has fallen 22 percent this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
