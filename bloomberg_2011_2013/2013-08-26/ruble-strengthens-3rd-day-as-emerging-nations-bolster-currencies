The ruble strengthened for the third
day as emerging-market countries announced steps to bolster
their currencies, boosting appetite for riskier assets.  The ruble advanced 0.1 percent to 37.9870 against the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket by 1 p.m. in Moscow, after
appreciating to 37.9321 earlier. The yield on the government’s
ruble debt due January 2023 was unchanged at 7.63 percent.  Brazil  last week announced a $60 billion intervention
program after the real swooned, while  Indonesia  said it will
increase foreign-currency supply. Oil declined 0.2 percent to
$110.84 per barrel in  London  after gaining 1 percent Aug. 23.
The oil and natural-gas industries generate about 50 percent of
 Russia ’s government revenue.  “The main reason for the ruble’s strengthening today is
the concerted action of  emerging markets ’ central banks,”
Dmitry Dorofeev, trader and analyst at BCS Financial Group said
by e-mail. “Speculative outflows weakened across all emerging
markets.”  The Russian central bank sold 13.26 billion rubles of
foreign currency on Aug. 22, bringing the total amount spent
since May 29 to almost 406 billion rubles ($12.3 billion).  The ruble appreciated 0.1 percent against the dollar to
32.9865 and gained 0.2 percent against the euro to 44.0995.  This week may be “trend-setting” for the ruble in the
short term, VTB Capital analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin
said in an e-mailed note. While the ruble is weakened by
companies converting rubles into foreign currency for dividend
payments, the “fundamentals, namely oil, are supportive,” they
said.  Companies including natural gas export monopoly OAO Gazprom
may buy about $2 billion for dividends, the last significant
outflow in the coming weeks, Dorofeev from BCS said.  “As a result, the ruble may strengthen significantly and
reach the level of 37 versus the basket,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
