solar-panel manufacturer, sold three power plants in Ontario,
Canada, with a total of 50 megawatts of capacity to a

solar farms, each with 20 megawatts, and the 10-megawatt
Amherstburg plant, according to a statement today. Terms weren’t

the solar farms and the Ontario Power Authority will purchase
the electricity under a 20-year contract. They produce enough
power for about 6,300 homes, according to the statement.  This is the first transaction between First Solar and GE
