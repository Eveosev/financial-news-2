Canola futures headed for the
biggest gain in 29 months on signs that U.S. oilseed production
will be smaller than the government predicted and as hot, dry
weather threatens crops.  Soybean output will probably be 3 percent below the U.S.
Department of Agriculture forecast of 3.255 billion bushels
after planting delays and cool weather hampered growth,
Professional Farmers of America said Aug. 23, after a tour of
2,600 fields in seven states last week. Heat advisories are in
effect for parts of South Dakota,  Nebraska ,  Iowa , and Minnesota
and temperatures are expected to range between 95 degrees
Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) to 110 degrees, according to the
 National Weather Service .  “It’s all based on U.S. weather right now and the
soybeans,” Lorne Boundy, a trader with Paterson Grain, said in
a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “Canola has to follow.”  Canola futures for November settlement jumped 5.2 percent
to C$542.50 ($516.08) a metric ton at 12:11 p.m. on ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, heading for the largest gain since March
17, 2011.  Soybeans, which compete with canola among buyers of
vegetable oils and animal feed, rose 10 percent this month
through Aug. 23 in Chicago trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
