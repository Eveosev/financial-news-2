The Turkish lira headed for the
weakest level on record as the central bank provided funds to
banks at its benchmark 4.5 percent rate for the first time in
six days. Bond yields jumped to a 19-month high.  The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.9982 a dollar at
12:20 p.m. in Istanbul, set for its lowest level since at least
1981, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. The lira was the
third-worst performer after  India ’s rupee and  Mexico ’s peso
among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg today. The  yield 
on 2-year government bonds jumped 38 basis points to 10.12
percent, the highest on a closing basis since January 2012.  The central bank lent 1.5 billion liras ($751 million) at
the 4.5 percent one-week repurchase rate at an auction today,
while also issuing 4.82 billion liras at the overnight lending
rate of 6.75 percent. It said it would sell at least $350
million more at an auction later today. The lira’s 7.5 percent
depreciation in the last three months was the biggest among
 emerging markets  in Europe, the Middle East and  Africa .  “The central bank provided liquidity and this added to
negative factors,” Burcin Metin, head of currency trading at
ING Bank AS in Istanbul, said by phone. “There are no reasons
at the moment to be positive about the Turkish lira.”  The lira will weaken to 2.05 against the dollar in the
fourth quarter, according to forward rates compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency will fall to 2.0555 a dollar in
December, currency futures traded in Istanbul showed.  “We are estimating that the central bank’s average cost of
funding will retreat to around 7 percent from 7.45 percent on
Friday,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at HSBC Asset Management,
said in an e-mailed note, after the one-week repo auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
