Sugar prices may remain under
pressure as the weakening currency of top producer Brazil helps
global supplies exceed demand for a fourth consecutive year,
according to the  International Sugar Organization .  The depreciation of the real against the dollar has reduced
the impact of lower sugar prices on producers, Executive
Director  Peter Baron  said in an interview yesterday. The surplus
will reach 4.5 million metric tons in the year starting Oct. 1,
the London-based ISO said in an Aug. 22 report. Prices are set
for a third annual drop this year, when the glut is forecast at
a record 10.3 million tons. Baron didn’t give a price estimate.  Sugar plunged 40 percent since reaching a three-decade high
in 2011 as growers from Brazil to  Australia  raised output.
Prices will suffer “more losses” in 2013-2014 even as the
surplus shrinks, the ISO said in the report. Exports from  India ,
the second-biggest grower, may jump more than threefold next
year as  Asia ’s worst performing currency spurs demand from
importers, according to  Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. (SHRS) , the country’s
biggest refiner.  “As long as the fundamental situation persists at the
moment, prices will remain under pressure,” Baron said in Bali,
 Indonesia , where he spoke at an industry  conference  today. “We
now have production that is higher than consumption, export
availability that is higher than import demand, and stock to
consumption higher than 41 percent. Something massive must
happen to change this situation.”  Price Declines  Sugar for October delivery closed at 16.47 cents a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. on Aug. 23, down 16 percent this year. Futures
touched a high of 36.08 cents in February 2011 and a three-year
low of 15.93 on July 16.  While futures dropped, weakening currencies boosted the
incentive for growers to ship more of the sweetener priced in
dollars. The Indian rupee weakened 14 percent and  Brazil ’s real
13 percent this year, making them the second- and third-worst
among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “In Brazil, production costs are in the order of 17 to 18
cents,” said Baron, who described the country as a price
“setter”. “With the real’s depreciation against the dollar,
they can still survive. Many currencies depreciated against the
dollar, so the low prices didn’t hit them too hard.”  Thailand, the second-biggest exporter whose baht has
dropped 4.3 percent, will crush 11 million tons from a record
105 million tons of sugarcane in the year starting November,
according to Thai Sugar Millers Corp.  Record Supplies  Global production will fall 1.2 percent to 180.8 million
tons, the first drop since 2008-2009, while demand expands 2.1
percent to 176.3 million tons, the ISO report showed. Sugar
available for exports will climb to a record 57.1 million tons
while import demand will fall for a third consecutive year.  World stockpiles will rise 0.5 percent to 74.4 million tons
at the end of 2013-2014 and reserves as a percentage of
consumption will fall to 42.2 percent from 42.9 percent,
according to the report.  “Production is erratic, depending on the weather and
rainfall, but consumption is relatively resilient,” said Baron,
estimating growth at an annual average of about 2 percent,
resulting in demand of 201 million tons in 2020.  Shipments by India may exceed 1 million tons in 2013-2014,
 Narendra Murkumbi , managing director of Mumbai-based Shree
Renuka Sugars, said Aug. 21. Exports from the local crop may
total 300,000 tons in the year that ends in September, according
to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
