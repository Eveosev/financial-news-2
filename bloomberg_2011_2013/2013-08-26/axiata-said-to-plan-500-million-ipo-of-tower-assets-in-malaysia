Axiata Group Bhd. (AXIATA) , Malaysia’s
largest mobile-phone operator by market value, plans to raise at
least $500 million in an initial public offering of its
telecommunications tower assets, said two people with knowledge
of the matter.  Axiata is working with  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) , Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the IPO, which may
take place next year in Kuala Lumpur, said the people, who asked
not to be identified as the process is private.  Kuala Lumpur-based Axiata is evaluating a bid for PT Axis
Telekom Indonesia as competition for cell-phone subscribers in
that country intensifies, people familiar with the matter said
in May. The company last year canceled a plan to sell 7,000
telecom towers in  Indonesia , citing a lack of interest.  Malaysia hasn’t hosted an IPO of more than $500 million
since  Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd. (ASTRO)  raised $1.5 billion in
October last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. UMW Oil &
Gas Corp. said in July that it was planning to sell about 2.36
billion ringgit ($729 million) of shares in an IPO by the fourth
quarter.  Axiata declined to comment in an e-mailed statement to
Bloomberg News today.  The group plans to spin off its tower assets in seven
countries into a single entity with a market value of 8 billion
ringgit to 10 billion ringgit, Focus Malaysia newspaper reported
in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
