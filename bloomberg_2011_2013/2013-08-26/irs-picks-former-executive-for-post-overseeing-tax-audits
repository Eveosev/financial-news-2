The  Internal Revenue Service  chose
John Dalrymple, a former executive with the tax agency, for its
number-two job, a position where he will oversee audits, the
annual tax-filing season and the tax-exempt organizations office
that led to controversy this year.  Dalrymple will become deputy commissioner for services and
enforcement on Sept. 16, the IRS said today.  Steven Miller , the
last permanent holder of that job, left the IRS earlier this
year. President  Barack Obama  pushed out Miller, who was then
also acting commissioner, after the agency apologized for its
extra scrutiny of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status.  Dalrymple worked at the IRS for 31 years before retiring in
2006. His last position at the agency was as deputy commissioner
for operations support, overseeing the back-office functions of
the 90,000-employee IRS.  “During John’s three decades at the IRS, he gained a
wealth of first-hand expertise and experience in areas he will
be leading,” Danny Werfel, the acting IRS commissioner, said in
a statement. “His insight and knowledge of the IRS will be an
asset to help keep our core tax operations running smoothly.”  Obama has nominated  John Koskinen , the former chairman of
Freddie Mac, as IRS commissioner. The Senate Finance Committee
hasn’t scheduled a confirmation hearing for Koskinen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
