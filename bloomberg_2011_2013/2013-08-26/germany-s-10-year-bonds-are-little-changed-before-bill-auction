Italian  government securities 
declined for a second day as the euro-area’s biggest sovereign-debt market prepared to auction bonds this week for the first
time since July.  Italy ’s  10-year yield  climbed toward a three-week high amid
tensions over former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
political future. The nation will sell 4 billion euros ($5.35
billion) of inflation-linked and zero-coupon debt tomorrow, 8.5
billion euros of bills the next day and an unspecified amount of
bonds on Aug. 29.  Spain  will also sell bills tomorrow. German
bunds rose along with Austrian and Dutch securities as a slide
in U.S. durable-goods orders spurred demand for safer assets.  “What’s driving Spain and Italy is the prospect for a
resumption of issuance,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at Bayerische Landesbank in Munich. “Spreads
have narrowed quite strongly because of the lack of issuance
over the past weeks and maybe there will be profit taking and
spread widening as markets prepare themselves.”  Italian 10-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.39 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time after
climbing to 4.41 percent on Aug. 22, the highest since July 31.
The 4.5 percent security due in May 2023 fell 0.475, or 4.75
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.235.  Spread Widens  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity bunds widened 10 basis points to 249
basis points after contracting to 227 basis points on Aug. 19,
the narrowest since July 2011.  The Cabinet of Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta meets
today to discuss streamlining the country’s political
administration. Members of Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party
have threatened to topple the government if the billionaire
media-magnate is ousted from the Senate following a conviction
for  tax fraud .  A crisis in the government would push the 10-year yield
spread beyond 300 basis points “in a few days,”  New York 
University Professor  Nouriel Roubini  said in an interview today
with La Repubblica newspaper.  “The fear of a Berlusconi return is rattling Italian
bonds,” said  David Keeble , head of fixed-income strategy at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in New York. “We
have a nagging doubt there will soon be some unsettling news.
Bunds are scooping up the difficulties in Italy.”  Spanish Bonds  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed one basis point to 4.47
percent. The government will sell as much as 4 billion euros of
84- and 259-day bills tomorrow.  German 10-year bonds advanced for the first time in four
days as the U.S. Commerce Department said durable goods orders
fell 7.3 percent in July, the biggest decline since August 2012.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell four basis points to 1.90
percent after climbing to 1.98 percent on Aug. 23, the highest
since March 2012. Similar-maturity  Austrian yields  slipped four
basis points to 2.30 percent and those in the Netherlands fell
four basis points to 2.29 percent.  The benchmark bund yields should climb toward the
“psychologically important” 2 percent level amid euro-area
sentiment data this week but may fail to close above it,
 Bayerische Landesbank ’s Daheim said.  The Ifo institute’s business climate  index  for Germany,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 107 this
month from 106.2 in July, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before the data is released tomorrow.  Eurex Halted  Trading in bund futures contracts was limited as Eurex,
 Europe ’s largest derivatives market, halted trading for about an
hour after a technical glitch affected its systems. Trading
resumed at 9:20 a.m. Frankfurt time, Eurex said.  The number of contracts traded today was 199,160, set for
the lowest since May 27. Daily trading volume in bund futures
averaged 612,396 last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Financial markets in the U.K. are shut today for a
public holiday.  Germany  allotted 2.42 billion euros of one-year bills at an
auction today at an average yield of 0.097 percent, compared
with 0.051 percent at a previous sale on July 22.  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Germany and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 3.9 percent this year through Aug.
23, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
securities earned 7.8 percent, while Germany’s lost 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
