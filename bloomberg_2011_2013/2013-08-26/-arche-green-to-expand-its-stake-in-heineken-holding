L’Arche Green NV, an investment
company of  Heineken NV (HEIA) ’s founding family, plans to spend as much
as 100 million euros ($134 million) adding to its majority stake
in the vehicle that owns half of the beermaker’s stock.  L’Arche Green has mandated a bank to purchase the shares on
the open market from Sept. 9 through July 9 to add to its 51.083
percent stake in Heineken Holding NV, it said in a press release
today. The group performed two similar transactions for a total
100 million euros in 2010 and 2011, it said. A spokesman for
L’Arche Green, which holds the Heineken and Hoyer families’
assets in the vehicle, declined to comment further.  “This is only a slight improvement of the position they
have,”  Tom Muller , an analyst at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers NV
in Amsterdam, said today by phone. “I don’t think they are
aiming for a marvelous high percentage of the company.”  Heineken Holding owns 50 percent of Amsterdam-based
Heineken NV, the world’s third-largest brewer. Heineken Holding
dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 45.75 euros as of 10:37 a.m.,
while Heineken NV fell 0.5 percent to 52.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
