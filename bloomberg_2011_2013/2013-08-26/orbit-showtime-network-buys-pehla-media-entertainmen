Orbit Showtime Network, the pay TV
company valued at $2.5 billion by Arqaam Capital, bought Pehla
Media & Entertainment.  The purchase will add almost 40 South Asian TV channels in
Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil and Malayalam languages to OSN’s
portfolio, according to a statement distributed at a press
conference in Dubai today. The acquisition was financed by
internal cash-flow and partly by debt, Chief Executive Officer
David Butorac said, declining to provide the value of the deal.  Kuwait Projects Co., which owns 60.5 percent of OSN, said
in June it hired Rothschild as the adviser for a possible
initial public offering of the pay-TV unit. OSN’s market
position and potential for growth created an opportunity for a
share sale that Kuwait Projects wants to explore with Mawarid
Group, which holds 39.5 percent of the company, Kuwait
Projects’s Vice Chairman Faisal Al Ayyar said at that time.  CEO Butorac said today OSN isn’t currently in the process
of an IPO and is studying strategic options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
