The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 160 basis points
as of 8:17 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest level
since Aug. 21, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1.5 basis points to
94.5 as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The measure, which has ranged from 90.9 to 110.2 this
quarter, is on course for its lowest level since Aug. 15,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 121 basis points as of 10:01 a.m. in Sydney, according to ANZ
prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Aug.
16, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
