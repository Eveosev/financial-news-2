GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , the German
residential landlord that received a takeover bid from  Deutsche
Wohnen AG (DWN)  last week, said the union may be beneficial.  “A combination of GSW and Deutsche Wohnen could make sense
from an operational and industry point of view,” the company
said in a statement today. “GSW is in the process of thoroughly
analyzing the proposed offer.”  The acquisition would create  Germany ’s largest property
company. Both landlords are based in Berlin, where price and
rent gains have outpaced the rest of the country. Deutsche
Wohnen owns about 90,000 apartments in large German cities
including Berlin and  Frankfurt , and GSW owns 60,000 homes in the
capital.  GSW said it hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
Kempen & Co. and Hengeler Mueller Partnerschaft von
Rechtsanwaelten as advisers.  Deutsche Wohnen, Germany’s second-largest residential
company by market value, on Aug. 20 offered to buy its
competitor in an all-share transaction that values GSW at about
1.75 billion euros ($2.3 billion).  GSW said today it must analyze the  financial value  of
Deutsche Wohnen’s offer before it makes a decision, and that it
will wait for more information on the bidder’s “strategy and
intentions.”  On Friday, GSW promoted Chief Operating Officer Joerg
Schwagenscheidt and Chief Financial Officer Andreas Segal to co-chief executive officers. The company had been without a CEO
since Bernd Kottmann stepped down in July following investor
complaints about the way he was hired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
