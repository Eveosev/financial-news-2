Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH) , a Chinese
wealth-management company, sank 17 percent in New York after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the stock amid a weaker outlook.  American depositary receipts of Noah dropped the most in
two months to $13.76 at 3:26 p.m. in New York, trimming this
year’s rally to 136 percent. Trading volume was five times the
90-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan cut Noah to neutral from the equivalent of buy,
citing the prospects for softer product sales in the second-half
of this year. The Shanghai-based company lifted its 2013 net
income forecast earlier this month and said second-quarter
profit jumped 133 percent. The stock traded at 12.8 times
estimated earnings after valuation surged to a  multiple of 22
on Aug. 12, the highest level in two years.  “The structural story is increasingly reflected in
valuations and would wait for better entry points on the
stock,” JPMorgan analysts led by Joshua Klaczek wrote in a note
dated Aug. 23. The stock is “somewhat of a show-me story in
second half, given recent volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
