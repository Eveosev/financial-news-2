Egypt  will offer 500 million euros
($668 million) at an auction of treasury bills to cover debt
issued last year after yields rose amid political unrest.  The government has 513.3 million euros of one-year notes
maturing tomorrow that were sold at an average yield of 3.25
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Egypt will
also seek to raise a combined 3 billion Egyptian pounds ($429
million) of three- and seven-year treasury bonds.  Borrowing costs in the most-populous Arab country are
rising as the government continued to arrest Islamists amid a
crackdown that started with the violent break-up of sit-ins in
Cairo Aug. 14, killing about 1,000 people. Yields on local-currency T-bills rose for a second week at an auction yesterday.
The average  three-month yield  has advanced 35 basis points from
a 28-month low at the Aug. 12 auction to 11.61 percent.  Egypt had 53.3 billion pounds of  outstanding  local dollar
and euro debt at the end of March, according to the most-recent
central bank data. The country started selling foreign-currency
debt locally in 2011 to replenish dwindling foreign reserves.
The yield on the nation’s $1 billion of benchmark  5.75 percent
eurobonds  due in April 2020 retreated four basis points, or 0.04
of a percentage point, to 9.01 percent as of 10:03 a.m. in
Cairo. The pound was little changed at 6.9868 a dollar.  Police arrested Osama Yaseen, a member of the  Muslim
Brotherhood  and Youth Minister under former President Mohamed Mursi, along with the secretary to the group’s deputy head
Khairat el-Shater, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
reported today. The Brotherhood, Mursi’s main backers, saw el-Shater and its spiritual leader Mohamed Badie stand trial
yesterday on charges of inciting violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
