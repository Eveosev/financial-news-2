Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , pushing to make
more vehicles at plants in the Americas, said it will have the
ability to build more than 2 million autos annually in the
region by early next year.  The carmaker is spending more than $5 billion to expand
capacity in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, the Yokohama, Japan-based company said yesterday in a statement. Expansion in the
U.S. will help Nissan almost double exports from plants in
 Tennessee  and Mississippi, the company said in a separate
release.  Nissan began a push to build up production capacity in
North America following Japan’s earthquake and tsunami that
caused some supplier disruptions, and after the yen surged to a
record high against the dollar, making imports to the U.S. less
profitable. Japan’s second-largest automaker hasn’t pulled back
on the expansion even as the yen has weakened in the past year.  The addition of a third plant in Mexico and a new factory
in Brazil, along with upgrades at Nissan’s U.S. plants, will add
about 10,000 jobs in North America and  South America , the
company said.  Nissan set a target last year of getting 85 percent of
vehicles its sells in the U.S. from within North America by
2015, up from 69 percent in 2011. The company’s North American
operations are based in Franklin, Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
