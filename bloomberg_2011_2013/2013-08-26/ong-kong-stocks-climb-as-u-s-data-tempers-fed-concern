Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index advancing from its biggest weekly slump
in two months, after plunging U.S. home sales tempered
expectations the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus in September.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec,
rose 1.9 percent after Asia’s biggest refiner reported higher
first-half net income. Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. jumped 8
percent after gold prices topped $1,400 an ounce for the first
time since June. China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation’s top coal
miner by market value, climbed 3.7 percent after beating first-half earnings estimates.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 percent to 22,005.32 at the
close in Hong Kong, with about three shares climbing for each
that dropped on the 50-member gauge. The equity benchmark posted
a 2.9 percent decline last week, the most since the period ended
June 21, as outflows from Asia accelerated on speculation the
U.S. central bank will reduce asset purchases.  “After the correction last week, we may have a technical
rebound and be firmly up,” said Linus Yip,  a strategist at
First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. “The timetable of
whether they will start the tapering of the bond-buying in the
U.S. is the main focus.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated 2.9 percent this year, the
worst performer among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.
The gauge traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings, compared with
15.09 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  U.S. Homes  Futures on the S&P 500 slid 0.1 percent today. The measure
rose 0.4 percent on Aug. 23 to cap its first two-day rally in
three weeks, as data showed new home purchases fell in July by
the most in three years. Three Fed regional bank presidents at a
conference in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , differed on timing for
reducing stimulus. The Fed’s first step may be to pare bond
buying next month by $10 billion to a $75 billion monthly pace,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , gained 1.4 percent to 10,075.09 today. The gauge
fell 18 percent from a Feb. 1 high on concern China’s growth is
slowing. The measure traded at 1.21 times book value, compared
with a five-year average of 1.77.  Emerging-market stocks lost more than $1 trillion since May
through Aug. 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after
Fed chief Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank “could take a
step down” in its asset purchases depending on the strength of
the U.S. economic recovery.  Sinopec Earnings  Sinopec gained 1.9 percent to HK$5.83 after posting a 24
percent increase in first-half net income to 30.3 billion  yuan 
($4.95 billion) as its refining business returned to profit.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were a 31 billion-yuan gain.  The company refined 115.4 million tons, almost double what
PetroChina Co. processed, as better technology led the business
to a 200 million yuan profit, compared with a 18.5 billion yuan
loss a year earlier.  PetroChina’s (857)  refining loss narrowed to 7.8
billion yuan from 23.3 billion yuan a year earlier.  Gold rallied 18 percent from a 34-month low in June as
Asian demand for jewelry strengthened. Futures jumped 1.8
percent to $1,395.80 on the Comex in New York last week and spot
prices topped $1,400 on Aug. 23.  Zhaojin, the mainland’s No. 2 producer of the precious
metal, surged 8 percent to HK$7.00. Zijin Mining Group Co.,
China’s largest gold miner by market value, rose 1.6 percent to
HK$1.87.  China Shenhua gained 3.7 percent to HK$25.35. The company
is on course to meet its full-year guidance after “solid”
first-half earnings, according to Barclays Plc. The results
imply flat full-year earnings, while the coal producers peers
are likely to see a drop, Barclays said.  Belle, BYD  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , the nation’s largest
footwear retailer, gained the most on the Hang Seng Index,
rising 5.6 percent to HK$11 after closing at a seven-week low
last week. The company reported first-half net income of 2.17
billion yuan after the close on Aug. 23 versus an estimated 2.2
billion yuan.  BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese automaker partly owned by  Warren
Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., slumped 12 percent to
HK$28.45 after predicting the smallest quarterly profit in a
year. Earnings will be hurt by weaker sales of vehicles and
mobile phones, the company said.  Hang Seng Index futures rose 0.9 percent to 22,009. The HSI
Volatility Index gained 0.2 percent to 18.52, indicating traders
expect a swing of 5.3 percent on the benchmark equity gauge over
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
