Ethanol futures jumped to the
highest price in more than five weeks, slashing their discount
to gasoline, on concern a heat wave in the U.S. Midwest will
force plants to reduce operations and threaten corn crops.  The spread, or price difference, shrank by 12.75 cents to
44.37 cents amid forecasts that temperatures in southern
 Minnesota  and northern  Iowa  may be as much as 15 degrees above
normal through the rest of this week. Most ethanol plants in the
U.S. are in the corn-rich Midwest.  “The heat wave will probably slow production some,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl FCStone in  Des Moines ,
Iowa. “This market has a herd mentality. Either they all want
to buy or they all want to sell.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 7.2 cents, or
3 percent, to $2.508 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since July 17. Futures have gained 15 percent this
year.  Gasoline for September delivery slipped 5.55 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.9517 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.
Ethanol’s discount to gasoline is the narrowest since July 8.  Blackford said ethanol is also gaining because of higher
gasoline demand. Consumption of the motor fuel averaged over
four weeks reached the highest level since July 2011 in the week
ended Aug. 16, the Energy Information Administration said.  Ethanol Demand  Ethanol  blender input , a measure of demand, rose to the
most since July 5, according to data from the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Supply last week was 16.5 million
barrels, a record low for this time of year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol is mostly transported by rail from the Midwest to
high-demand regions on the East and West Coast. Rail delays have
added to the lower supply, Blackford said.  “It’s already a ‘just-in-time’ market,” he said.
“Logistically, the pipeline is kind of empty right now.”  Corn for September delivery gained 20.25 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $5.1575 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively
traded December contract advanced 30.5 cents to $5.005.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 63 cents, down from 64 cents on Aug.
23, the highest level this year, based on front-month contracts.
One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  RINs Pricing  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  gained 2 cents to 74 cents while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 80 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  production  fell 1.5 percent to 844,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Aug. 16, from the previous week, the
lowest since July 26, according to EIA data.  Imports fell 47 percent to 19,000 barrels a day, the lowest
in three weeks, the report showed.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $1.98 a gallon as of
Aug. 16, the cheapest since May 7, 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 12.5 cents to $2.81 a
gallon in  New York , 10.5 cents to $2.765 on the West Coast, 9.5
cents to $2.73 in the U.S. Gulf, and 8 cents to $2.64 a gallon
in Chicago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor widened 4.5 cents to
17 cents, while the West Coast’s premium to the Gulf gained 1
cent to 3.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
