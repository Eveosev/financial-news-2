The yen strengthened the most in
almost two months against the euro and dollar as a slide in
emerging-market currencies boosted demand for safer investments.  Japan ’s currency gained versus all of its 16 major peers,
while the Swiss franc rose against each one but the yen. The
euro reversed a loss versus the dollar as a measure of
volatility touched a two-month high. The Hungarian forint fell
to a four-month low against the euro after the central bank cut
the benchmark rate by more than economists expected.  India ’s
rupee and  Turkey ’s lira both dropped to record lows as global
stocks slumped amid escalating tension in Syria.  “Political headlines are dominating -- with risk-aversed
markets such as the yen and the Swiss franc being the strongest
among Group of 10,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re starting to see signs of real outflows
again” in  emerging markets .  The yen rose 1.3 percent to 129.96 per euro at 5 p.m. in
New York after adding 1.4 percent, the biggest gain on an
intraday basis since July 3. Japan’s currency appreciated 1.5
percent to 97.03 per dollar, the largest advance since July 10.
The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.3393 versus the euro after
gaining 0.3 percent.  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major peers, fell 0.3 percent to 1,024.93 after
climbing to 1,031.37 on Aug. 22, the highest since Aug. 2.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index of U.S. stocks  dropped 1.6
percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.8 percent.  Forint Drops  Hungary’s Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced the two-week deposit
rate to a record-low 3.8 percent from 4 percent after 12 months
of quarter-point cuts. Sixteen of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast a cut to 3.9 percent.  The forint depreciated as much as 1.1 percent against the
euro to 301.90, the weakest since April 29.  Hungarian central bank’s “move was larger than expected,”
said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “An ongoing easing should
continue to remain a headwind for the forint.”  India’s rupee slumped 2.9 percent to 66.190 per dollar,
surpassing the previous low set on Aug. 22. Turkey’s lira fell
as much as 2.2 percent to 2.0398, a record low according to
Bloomberg data starting in 1981.  Indonesia ’s rupiah tumbled 0.7
percent to 10,925 per dollar after reaching 10,926, the least
since April 2009.  Fed Buying  The effects of the Fed’s potential tapering of its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases are showing in global markets.
Emerging economies have seen an exodus of cash, with their 20
most-traded currencies  falling  more than 5 percent in the past
three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s all part of a general flight-to-safety trade --
investors are liquidating positions in riskier assets,” said
Hardman. “Currencies such as the yen are the funding currencies
over the last year or so, but that’s ultimately leading to short
positions being pared. That’s encouraging a stronger yen in the
near term.” A short position is a bet an asset will decrease in
value.  Australia ’s dollar slid versus most of its most-active
counterparts as a measure of volatility increased, damping
demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index  increased to 10.14
percent, the highest level since July 16. The gauge has averaged
8.93 percent in the past 12 months.  The Aussie dropped 0.5 percent to 89.85 U.S. cents and  New
Zealand ’s dollar declined 0.7 percent to 77.97 U.S. cents.  The franc strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.2289 per euro, and
rose 0.6 percent to 91.75 centimes per dollar.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $23 billion, compared with $15 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $5.1 billion, the
largest share of trades at 22 percent. Options on the dollar-Brazilian real rate totaled $2.7 billion, or 12 percent.  Greenback-yen options trading was 26 percent less than the
average for the past five Tuesdays at a similar time in the day
and dollar-real trading was 79 percent more, according to
Bloomberg analysis.  Dollar-lira options trading, at $1.3 billion, was 502
percent above average.  Syria Confrontation  The U.S.,  France  and Britain stepped closer to a military
strike against  Syria , laying the legal groundwork to justify
action, moving forces into place and rounding up allies in the
region. Syria is suspected of an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack
outside of Damascus.  Any armed response would be narrowly focused on Syria’s
weapons capabilities and wouldn’t be aimed at deposing Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. and U.K. officials said.  “There’s a lot of risk factors that the market is
currently having to deal with,” said Sonja Marten, a currency
strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “There’s a certain
amount of demand for safe havens and that’s what’s giving the
yen a bit of support.”  The yen has strengthened 4.9 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that
track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 3.5 percent,
while the dollar fell 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
