VMware Inc. (VMW) , the largest maker of
software that lets computers run multiple operating systems,
said it’s hiring Tony Scott, former chief information officer at
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , for the same position.  Scott, who left Microsoft in May after five years, will
report to Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of VMware, the
company said in a statement today. Scott’s departure was
announced in June, when Microsoft said he planned to focus on
personal projects. Prior to that, Scott served as CIO at  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)  and chief technology officer at General Motors Corp.  VMware’s hiring of a new CIO comes days after Microsoft CEO
 Steve Ballmer  announced plans to resign within a year, after
missing opportunities to take the maker of Windows software
beyond personal computers and into a leading position in
products such as smartphones, Web search and tablet computing.
VMware is Microsoft’s main rival in the market for so-called
virtualization software, which lets companies combine multiple
tasks on a single server.  VMware is holding its VMworld conference beginning today in
San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
