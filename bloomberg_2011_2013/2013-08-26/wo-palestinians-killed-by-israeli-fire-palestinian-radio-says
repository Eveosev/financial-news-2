Three Palestinians, including a 17-year-old, were shot dead by Israeli security forces on an arrest
raid inside a West Bank refugee camp, Voice of Palestine Radio
said.  Disturbances involving hundreds of Palestinians, some
hurling firebombs, broke out after a border police operation  in
the Qalandiya camp near  Ramallah , Israeli police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said by phone.  Rosenfeld said he could not confirm reports of deaths
because the injured Palestinians were taken to Palestinian
hospitals.  The incident comes as Israelis and Palestinians are engaged
in U.S.-brokered peace talks for the first time in three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
