People’s Insurance Company (Group)
of China Ltd. (1339) , parent of the nation’s biggest non-life insurer,
said profit rose 53 percent in the first half as investment and
premiums income expanded.  Net income  increased to 7.54 billion  yuan  ($1.23 billion),
or 0.18 yuan a share, from 4.92 billion yuan, or 0.14 yuan a
share, a year earlier, Beijing-based PICC Group, as the company
is known, said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Chairman Wu Yan boosted premiums income in the first half
amid the nation’s economic slowdown after raising HK$24 billion
($3.1 billion) in an initial public offering in Hong Kong in
November to fund its business expansion. Premiums income at  PICC
Property & Casualty Co. (2328) , the main revenue contributor, climbed
14 percent to 115.3 billion yuan as underwriting profit grew and
investment income increased, the non-life unit said in a
separate statement.  “Underwriting profit should increase as premiums grow,
although margins probably narrowed” as competition in the
property insurance market intensified, Fanny Chen, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Haitong International Securities Group, said
before the announcement. “Insurers also face much smaller
pressures from impairments this year after last year’s huge
write-downs.”  PICC P&C’s combined ratio, used to gauge claims and
expenses as a percentage of premiums earned, rose 1.2 percentage
point from the record-low 92.4 percent in the first half of last
year to 93.6 percent, according to the statement. Lower combined
ratio means higher profitability.  Insurance Unit  Gross premiums at PICC P&C jumped 14 percent, while revenue
at the group’s life insurance unit dropped 12 percent as higher-return wealth management products offered by banks dwarfed the
appeal of insurance products, according to data from China
Insurance Regulatory Commission.  Total income from investments rose to 15.34 billion yuan
from 10.26 billion yuan a year earlier, PICC group said. Net
investment income, mainly comprised of interest and dividends,
gained 21 percent to 12.61 billion yuan.  PICC Group’s  stock  rose 1.9 percent to HK$3.74 in  Hong
Kong , trimming this year’s loss to 4.4 percent. PICC P&C rose
2.1 percent today to HK$9.79. China Pacific Insurance (Group)
Co., which reported a 2.2 percent increase in net premiums
yesterday, rose 1.5 percent to HK$27.25.  China Life Insurance Co. said July 30 that first-half
profit may rise by more than 50 percent as investment income
rose and impairment losses fell. The nation’s biggest life
insurer recorded 31.1 billion yuan of such write-downs last
year, jumping 140 percent from the previous year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
