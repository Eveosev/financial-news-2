Sugar rose for a second straight
session on concern that freezing temperatures may threaten crops
in growing areas of  Brazil , the world’s top producer and
exporter. Coffee, cotton, cocoa and orange juice also gained.  A cold front may push temperatures to between zero and 2
degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit) from Aug. 27 to Aug. 28
in the center of Mato Grosso do Sul, the southern most areas of
 Sao Paulo  and parts of Parana, according to Marcio Custodio, the
forecast operating-director at Sao Paulo-based Somar
Meteorologia. Sugar prices fell 16 percent this year through
Aug. 23 on signs of ample supplies.  “The cold weather in Brazil is lending a bit of support to
sugar,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc.
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. Prices were also
supported as the real rebounded, reducing incentives for
exporters to sell commodities priced in the greenback, he said.  Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
16.56 cents a pound at 10:53 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The sweetener climbed 1.2 percent on Aug. 23.  Also in New York, arabica-coffee futures for December
delivery increased 0.9 percent to $1.181 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to
84.82 cents a pound, heading for the first gain since Aug. 16.  Cocoa futures for December climbed 0.7 percent to $2,482 a
metric ton. Orange-juice futures for November delivery added 0.6
percent to $1.3635 a pound.  London ’s NYSE Liffe is closed today for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
