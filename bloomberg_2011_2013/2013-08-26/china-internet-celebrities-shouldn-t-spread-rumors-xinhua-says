China ’s recent detention of several
suspected online rumor-mongers helped protect the public from
the negative effect of false information, the official Xinhua
News Agency said today in an editorial.  Some social media users passed on and commented on
sensational microblog feeds created by unknown people without
checking the veracity of the claims, resulting in the spread of
rumors among  Internet users , the Xinhua editorial said.  These Internet celebrities, about 200 of whom have more
than 10 million followers each on China’s popular Twitter-like
Weibo services run by Sina Corp. and  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , can
threaten privacy, harm reputations and disrupt social order by
spreading online rumors, according to the Xinhua report.  Despite the right of liberal online speech, opinion leaders
ought to “observe laws” and “safeguard the bottom-line of
morality and authenticity of information” when re-tweeting
unverified information, the Xinhua report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
