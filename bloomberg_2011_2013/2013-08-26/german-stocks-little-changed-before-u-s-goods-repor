German stocks  were little changed,
after two days of gains, as investors awaited data on U.S.
durable goods.  Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG surged 6 percent after
Royal KPN NV won the support of minority shareholder America
Movil SAB for the sale of KPNâ€™s German business to Telefonica.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.1 percent to 8,427.84 at 9:26 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The DAX gained 0.3 percent last week and has  rallied
9.6 percent  since June 24 as the  European Central Bank  said that
its  interest rates  will remain low for an extended period of
time. The broader HDAX Index rose 0.1 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 68 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., data today may show orders for durable goods
fell 4 percent in July, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 64 economists. The Commerce Department
report is due for release at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
