Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Convent
 refinery  in Louisiana plans to shut a crude unit for maintenance
in January, according to a person familiar with the schedule.  The refinery is to take a vacuum distillation unit out of
service for repairs that were delayed from last year, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Destin Singleton, a Motiva spokeswoman in Houston, declined
to comment on the work, saying the company doesn’t discuss
maintenance plans.  The Convent refinery, 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New
Orleans, can run 255,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The plant receives crude primarily by
pipeline and distributes finished oil products by pipe, rail,
truck and water to markets on the Gulf Coast and in the
southeastern U.S., the company said on its website.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil, a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
