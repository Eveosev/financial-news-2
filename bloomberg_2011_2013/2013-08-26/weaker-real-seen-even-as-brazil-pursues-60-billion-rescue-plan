Economists covering the Brazilian
economy forecast the real will weaken more than predicted last
week, even after the central bank disclosed a $60 billion plan
to temper the currency’s rout.  The real will weaken to 2.38 per  U.S. dollar  by the end of
2014 from 2.32 this December, compared with the previous week’s
forecast of 2.35 and 2.30, respectively, according to a central
bank survey with about 100 analysts published today. Analysts
also raised their 12-month inflation forecast to 6.08 percent,
from 5.97 percent the prior week.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has stepped up
efforts to control a weakening real, which threatens to further
stoke inflation that’s near the upper end of the government’s
target. Central bankers will raise the benchmark  interest rate 
to 9 percent this week from 8.50 percent in a bid to rein
consumer price increases that are eroding growth, the survey
shows.  The central bank last week announced a $60 billion
intervention program involving currency swaps and loans after
the real dropped the most among major currencies in the prior
month.  The real weakened 0.66 percent to 2.3644 per U.S. dollar at
9:11 a.m. local time. Swap rates on the contract due in January
2015, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 4 basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 10.28 percent.  Price Increases  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index  climbed 
0.16 percent in the month through mid-August from 0.07 percent
in mid-July, the national statistics agency reported last week.
Annual inflation slowed to 6.15 percent after surpassing the 6.5
upper limit of the bank’s target range twice earlier in the
year.  Economists in the bank survey raised their 2013 year-end
inflation forecast to 5.80 from 5.74, while boosting their 2014
expectation to 5.84 from 5.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
