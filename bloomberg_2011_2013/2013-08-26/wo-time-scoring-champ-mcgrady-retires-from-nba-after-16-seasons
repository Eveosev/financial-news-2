Tracy McGrady is retiring from the
 National Basketball Association , ending a 16-year career in
which he made seven All-Star appearances and twice led the
league in scoring.  McGrady, 34, announced the decision today on his Twitter
account. He played in six games last season with the San Antonio
Spurs, all in the postseason, shooting 0-for-7 with no points,
eight rebounds and seven assists.  The Toronto Raptors drafted McGrady out of high school with
the No. 9 pick in 1997. He was traded before the 2000-01 season
to the Orlando Magic, where he became one of the NBAâ€™s elite
scorers.  From 2000 to 2007 with the Magic and the Houston Rockets,
McGrady averaged over 24 points a game every year. He was named
an All-Star each of those seasons, and led the NBA in scoring in
2002-03 and 2003-04.  McGrady averaged 19.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 4.4 assists
per game in his career. He also spent time with the  New York 
Knicks,  Detroit Pistons  and Atlanta Hawks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
