Covanta Holding Corp. (CVA) , the operator
waste-to-energy plants, agreed to convert about 800,000 tons of
New Yorkâ€™s municipal solid waste a year into electricity.  The 20-year contract will take effect in 2015, the
Morristown, New Jersey-based company said today in a statement.
Covanta plans to transport waste from a marine transfer station
in Queens to its processing sites, and expects to open a second
transfer station the following year in  Manhattan .  Converting garbage into energy will help New York meet a
 goal  of diverting 75 percent of solid waste from landfills by
2030, according to a city plan. New York produces about 14
million tons of waste a year.  Covanta will invest $110 million starting this year into
equipment to transport waste to local facilities, including
barges, railroad cars and shipping containers.  Covanta burns waste to boil water, and uses the steam to
produce  electricity .  To contact the reporter on this story:
