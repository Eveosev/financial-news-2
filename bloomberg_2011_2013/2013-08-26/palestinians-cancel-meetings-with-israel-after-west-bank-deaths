The Palestinians canceled peace
talks with  Israel  scheduled for today, a Palestinian official
said, after Israeli security forces shot dead three Palestinians
during an arrest raid in a West Bank refugee camp.  Israeli security officials said forces opened fire after
hundreds of Palestinians began rioting in the Qalandiya camp,
some hurling firebombs and rocks. Voice of Palestine radio said
three Palestinians were killed, including a 17-year-old.  “A large, violent crowd such as this, which significantly
outnumbers security forces, leaves no other choice but to resort
to live fire in self defense,” Israeli military spokesman
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said in a statement.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ office condemned what
it called “assassinations,” the official Wafa news service
reported. Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina said the killings
would hurt U.S.-brokered peace efforts, which resumed recently
after a three-year breakdown.  The deadly incident led the Palestinians to cancel two
meetings with the Israelis scheduled for today, another
Palestinian official said later. He spoke anonymously because he
was not authorized to speak on record.  A spokeswoman for Israeli chief negotiator and Justice
Minister Tzipi Livni was not immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
