Bayerische Landesbank ,  Germany ’s
second-biggest state-owned lender, said second-quarter pretax
profit jumped more than fourfold after the sale of its  GBW AG 
real estate business.  Pretax profit rose to 563 million euros ($753 million) from
120 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
in a statement today. The sale of  GBW  to  Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z) 
and a group of insurers, pension funds and savings banks in
April resulted in a one-time gain of 351 million euros.  BayernLB, led by Chief Executive Officer Gerd Haeusler,
agreed to repay 5 billion euros in state aid that saved it from
collapse during the financial crisis and sold GBW and other
assets as part of a restructuring agreement with the European
Commission. The lender reiterated a target to report a full-year
profit, adding that performance in the first half won’t continue
in the second as one-time gains won’t be repeated.  BayernLB’s Budapest-based MKB Bank unit, which it has to
sell on orders by the European Union by 2016, reported a pretax
first-half loss of 108 million euros compared with a loss of 66
million euros in the year-earlier period.  “Developments in  Hungary  are of key importance for
BayernLB,” the lender said in the statement. “The country’s
government is toying with the idea of fresh political
intervention on foreign currency loans which could severely test
the business of banks operating there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
