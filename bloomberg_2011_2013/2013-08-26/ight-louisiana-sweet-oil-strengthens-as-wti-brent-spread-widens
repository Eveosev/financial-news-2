Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened
relative to West Texas Intermediate after U.S. durable goods
dropped more than forecast in July.  WTI’s discount to Brent, the European benchmark, widened to
$4.81 a barrel as bookings for goods meant to last at least
three years decreased 7.3 percent, the most since August 2012,
the Commerce Department reported. The drop in durable-goods
orders was bigger than the 4 percent decline forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gulf crudes compete with foreign oils priced against Brent
for space in U.S. refineries.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the U.S. Gulf Coast,
strengthened by 20 cents to a $3.20-a-barrel premium to WTI at
3:34 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 10 cents to a $3-a-barrel
premium.  Mars Blend, a medium sour crude, weakened by 5 cents to a
discount of $2.15 a barrel to WTI. Poseidon’s discount narrowed
by 30 cents to $2.85 a barrel. Crude from the Southern Green
Canyon strengthened by $1.25 to a discount of $1.50 a barrel.
 Thunder Horse  was unchanged at a premium of $1 a barrel to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
