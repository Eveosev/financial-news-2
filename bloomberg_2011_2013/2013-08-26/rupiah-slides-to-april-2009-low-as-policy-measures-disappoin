The Indonesian rupiah fell to the
weakest since April 2009 and sovereign bonds dropped on concern
policy makers’ steps to boost dollar supply are insufficient to
buoy  Asia ’s worst-performing currency.  Indonesia  will offer  tax deductions  for export-oriented
companies to boost overseas sales and narrow the  current-account
deficit , which was a record $9.8 billion last quarter, Finance
Minister Chatib Basri said Aug. 23.  Bank Indonesia  announced
measures aimed at increasing domestic foreign-currency supply on
the same day. Nomura Holdings Inc. is maintaining a bearish view
on the rupiah due to the “relatively ineffective policy
package,” analysts led by Singapore-based Euben Paracuelles
wrote last week.  “The measures were meant to address structural issues in
the medium- to long-term, while the market was expecting more
immediate steps to address the rupiah’s weakness,” said Eric Alexander Sugandi, an economist in Jakarta at Standard Chartered
Plc. “It doesn’t mean the measures are bad, only that they will
take at least a month to show any impact.”  The rupiah slid 0.7 percent to 10,855 per dollar as of
11:58 a.m. in Jakarta, the weakest level since April 2009,
according to prices from local banks. The spot rate fell 3.7
percent last week in the worst five-day period since November
2008, and traded at a 4.9 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which lost 1.3 percent to 11,412, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards set by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore  was 11,052 today, from 10,964 on Aug. 23.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 17.91 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 climbed five
basis points to 8.48 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. It has added 65 basis points in August
and 329 basis points since the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
