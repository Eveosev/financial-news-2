Russia cut its 2013 economic-growth
forecast for the second time this year, Deputy Economy Minister
Andrey Klepach said.  Gross domestic product  will rise 1.8 percent, compared with
an earlier estimate of 2.4 percent, Klepach said by phone from
Moscow today. The government’s forecast for industrial-output
growth was cut to 0.7 percent from 2.0 percent, he said. The
government originally predicted 3.6 percent economic expansion
this year.  The world’s biggest energy exporter is struggling to stem
its steepest slowdown since a 2009 contraction as the euro
area’s recession and weaker growth in Asia curb demand for its
products. President Vladimir Putin’s government submitted a plan
to revive economic growth, including measures to reduce
borrowing costs for businesses.  “What the Economy Ministry has done is essentially just a
reflection of current trends and doesn’t provide any new
information,” Maxim Oreshkin, chief economist for Russia at VTB
Capital in Moscow, said by phone. The updated forecast still
suggests that growth will be better in the second half of the
year than in the first, he said.  The benchmark Micex stock index fell 0.6 percent to
1,385.09 as of 4:49 p.m. in Moscow.  Russian GDP expanded 0.1 percent in the April-June period
from a quarter earlier compared with 0.2 percent growth in the
first three months of the year, according to Economy Ministry.  “It’s not recession, but stagnation,” Klepach told
reporters Aug. 20.  GDP will grow 2.6 percent this year, according to the
median estimate of 42 economists in a Bloomberg survey last
month. The pace of expansion was projected to pick up to 3
percent in the third quarter and 3.4 percent in the fourth.  The central bank, which left its main rates unchanged for
an 11th month Aug. 9, resisting government calls to cut rates as
inflation remains above its target range of 5 percent to 6
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
