China’s stocks  rose the most in two
weeks on optimism that the nation’s economy is stabilizing.  Jiangxi Copper Co. gained 2.3 percent as commodity
producers rallied.  Citic Securities Co. (600030)  and Haitong Securities
Co. jumped more than 5 percent after the  Shanghai Stock Exchange 
said it is considering a change in settlement rules that would
allow investors to buy and sell a stock on the same day.
Hangzhou HIK-Vision Digital Technology Co. surged 8.3 percent,
leading a gauge of technology shares to their highest level in
two years.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.9 percent to 2,096.47
at the close, paring its 2013 decline to 7.6 percent. Trading
volumes were 21 percent above the 30-day average. Credit Suisse
Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG increased their economic forecasts
for China in the past week as data from manufacturing to exports
indicate the world’s second-biggest economy is strengthening
after a two-quarter slowdown.  “Signs are emerging that  China’s economy  will rebound,”
said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dragon Life
Insurance Co., which oversees $3.3 billion in assets.  The CSI 300 Index added 2.1 percent to 2,335.62. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 1.5 percent.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, rose
2.3 percent to 17.28  yuan . Western Mining Co., the nation’s
fourth-largest maker of zinc concentrate, added 2.4 percent to
6.07 yuan.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) 
gained 1.5 percent to 29.18 yuan.  Credit Suisse raised its estimate for economic expansion
this year to 7.6 percent from 7.4 percent. Deutsche Bank last
week lifted its forecast for the July-September period to 7.7
percent from 7.5 percent and its fourth-quarter target to 7.8
percent from 7.7 percent.  Brokerages Gain  The nation will speed up infrastructure construction for
new major projects in the west of the country this year,
according to a statement posted to the National Development and
Reform Commission’s website.  Citic Securities, China’s biggest listed brokerage, gained
5.2 percent to 11.06 yuan. Haitong Securities, the second
biggest, jumped 8.1 percent to 11.35 yuan.  Everbright Securities
Co. (601788)  added 4.2 percent to 10.25 yuan.  The exchange is mulling a move to a “T+0” settlement, an
unidentified exchange spokesman said yesterday on its Weibo
microblogging platform. There is no timetable for allowing T+0
 stock trading , Xinhua News Agency reported last month, citing an
unidentified official at the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, which oversees the nation’s capital markets.  Regulator’s Decision  “It’s a good news to have for the brokers and something we
definitely will have in the future,” said Zhou Wei, an analyst
at Founder Securities Co. “The key is the timeframe and it’s
for the CSRC to have a final decision on the matter.”  The regulator didn’t immediately reply to a faxed query on
their stance over T+O. China currently operates a T+1 system.  The Shanghai Composite is valued at 8.4 times its projected
12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average of 12.7
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  A measure tracking technology stocks advanced 3.2 percent,
the highest close since July 22, 2011. Hangzhou HIK-Vision

developer , gained 5.1 percent to 12.41 yuan.  China should ensure its city and county government agencies
