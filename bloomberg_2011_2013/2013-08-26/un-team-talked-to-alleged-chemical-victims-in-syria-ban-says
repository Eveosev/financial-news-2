 A  United Nations  team of scientists “collected some samples,” visited two hospitals and interviewed survivors, witnesses and doctors on its first day inspecting the site of an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today in an e-mail.  Ban said he received the information from Angela Kane, his disarmament chief. He said he instructed her to file “a strong complaint” with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government and opposition forces about a sniper-fire attack earlier against the UN inspectors as they were en route to the investigation site.  Ban said the inspectors were on their way back to Damascus, and that he was awaiting a fuller report from the head of the inspection team, Ake Sellstrom.
