Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL)  plunged
as much as 33 percent in early trading after saying an
experimental treatment for allergic asthma failed in a study.  Rigel declined 18 percent to $2.99 at 9:16 a.m.  New York 
time, after dropping to as low as $2.42. The South San
Francisco-based company had fallen 63 percent in the 12 months
before today.  The inhaled drug, R343, didn’t meet the top goals in a mid-stage trial, Rigel said in a statement today. The company said
it will stop development of the compound as a therapy for
allergic asthma.  “This was not the result we expected based on the
collection of data we had previously seen with R343 in this
therapeutic area,” James Gower, chairman and chief executive
officer of Rigel, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
