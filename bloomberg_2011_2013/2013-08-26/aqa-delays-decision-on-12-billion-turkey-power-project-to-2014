Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
United Arab Emirates-based utility known as Taqa, said today it
is deferring to next year an investment decision on a proposed
power plant project in Turkey.  Taqa is delaying a decision on whether to proceed because
of other spending priorities, a company spokesman, who asked not
to be identified by name in line with company policy, said by
telephone from Abu Dhabi today.  The agreement to study plans for developing coal mines and
power plants is part of an intergovernmental accord signed in
January between the U.A.E. and Turkey. The countries and Taqa
signed a memorandum of understanding for the project in southern
Turkey’s Afsin-Elbistan region. Taner Yildiz,  Turkey ’s energy
minister, said in December that investment in the project to
boost power output to 7,000 megawatts may total $12 billion.  Taqa is pleased with the progress of talks on the project
as part of U.A.E.-Turkish government cooperation, the company’s
spokesman added.  In January, Taqa said the U.A.E. utility and Turkey’s
Electricity Generation Co. will work together on a plan to buy
and modernize an existing 1,400-megawatt coal-fired facility,
and starting work on another and on the mines.  Turkey is developing its coal, or lignite, deposits to cut
reliance on imported natural gas as a fuel for power plants. The
Afsin-Elbistan basin holds about 40 percent of Turkey’s lignite
deposits, Taqa said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
