Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-largest brewer, has agreed to buy a 57 percent stake in
Nigeria’s  Champion Breweries Plc (CHAMPION)  from Consolidated Breweries
Plc, which is majority owned by the Dutch beermaker.  Raysun Nigeria, a wholly owned Heineken unit, will acquire
513 million shares shares from Consolidated Breweries subject to
regulatory approval, Amsterdam-based Heineken said in a
statement dated June 23, which was received by e-mailed today.  The reorganization “will optimize Consolidated Breweries’
operations by reducing excess production capacity it no longer
needs,” Heineken said in the statement. Raysun can adequately
meet loss-making Champion Breweries’ financing and restructuring
needs, the company said.  Champion posted a loss after tax of 758 million naira ($4.7
million) for the six months through June, compared with loss of
806 million a year earlier, it said in a July 31 filling to the
Nigerian Stock Exchange. Revenue rose to 327 million naira from
281 million naira. The stock declined 10 percent to 15.68 naira
as of 1:22 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. It has more
than tripled this year, compared with a 34 percent rise in the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   Consolidated Breweries, in which Heineken owns just over 50
percent, according to its website, acquired the stake in
Champion from Montgomery Ventures Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
