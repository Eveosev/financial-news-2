The construction of  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline won’t lead to a net increase of
greenhouse gas emissions, Canadian Natural Resources Minister
Joe Oliver said.  Speaking to reporters from Yellowknife, Northwest
Territories, Oliver said oil carried by the pipeline would
replace crude from Venezuela, which is similar in emissions to
output from the Canadian oilsands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
