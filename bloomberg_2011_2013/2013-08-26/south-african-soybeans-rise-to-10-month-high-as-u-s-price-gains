South African soybean futures rose
to the highest level in almost 10 months, following prices of
the oilseed in the U.S. that surged due to hot, dry weather in
the Midwest.  Soybeans for delivery in December, the most active
contract, climbed 2.4 percent to 5,655 rand ($553) a metric ton
by the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange.
That’s the biggest increase for a most traded contract since
Oct. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. prices for the oilseed surged the most since March
2011 after the Professional Farmers of America said output may
be 3.16 billion bushels because of planting delays and cool, dry
weather that has stunted growth. The estimate is smaller than
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s prediction for 3.26 billion
bushels  “The soybean market is the most critical at the moment as
prices have gone up due to dry weather,” in the U.S. Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free State
province, said by phone today. “Conditions look dry and hot for
most of the week.”  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 1.7 percent to 2,387 rand a metric ton, while
the yellow variety for delivery in the same period, rose 1.6
percent to 2,239 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
