The  interruption  that froze half the
U.S. stock market last week began with a routine notice.  “NYSE Arca is currently experiencing an issue processing
customer messages on routed orders in Tape C symbol range ‘TACT’
through ‘ZYY.C,’” read an alert for traders received by
 Bloomberg News  at 10:17 a.m. on Aug. 22. “Will advise.”  The brevity of the message belied its significance.
Computers at the world’s biggest exchange operators were having
difficulty communicating. Within two hours, trading stopped in
more than 2,000 U.S. stocks. The three-hour shutdown was the
latest in a series of failures to disrupt increasingly
complicated markets, prompting the Securities and Exchange
Commission to push for rules requiring executives to improve the
reliability of their technology.  “Every time we have a glitch like this, it just knocks a
little bit more investor confidence off the table,” said Seth Merrin, chief executive officer of Liquidnet Holdings Inc., a
private trading platform that competes with the public
exchanges, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “This kind
of scenario should have been thought of and practiced between
all of the different participants.”  Market Integrity  The disruption underscored how quickly the integrity of the
U.S. stock market, which has a value of almost  $20 trillion , can
be threatened as orders to buy and sell shares are matched on
more than 50 exchanges and alternative electronic venues. While
the outage highlighted what can arise when exchange computers
fail, past malfunctions have shown how faulty use of a trading
algorithm by a single brokerage or investment firm can roil the
entire system.  A fault today halted transactions on  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s
Eurex unit, Europe’s largest derivatives market, for about an
hour through 9:20 a.m. Frankfurt time.  One result of last week’s shutdown may be the development
of a backup data feed to compile and disseminate price quotes,
according to  Robert Greifeld , the chief executive officer of
 Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, a former
prosecutor, responded to the failure by vowing to finish a rule
proposed in March to require exchanges to test the reliability
of their technology.  “We have to improve our defensive-driving ability,”
Greifeld said on Bloomberg Television Aug. 23. “We have to
always be thinking, what can go wrong in the external
environment, how can we get body blows that don’t impact us.”  Aug. 22 started off without signs of trouble in the U.S.
equity market, where an average of  6.2 billion  shares traded
each session this year.  Quiet Start  Benchmark indexes opened higher, with the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rebounding from a six-week low, as reports on global
manufacturing and the American labor market eased concern about
the  Federal Reserve ’s plans to reduce its $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases used to help stimulate the economy.  After the first warning by Arca, owned by  New York  Stock
Exchange-operator  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , e-mails from exchanges on
system  abnormalities  started to pile up in traders’ inboxes.
Three minutes after the initial communication, Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats Global Markets Inc., the fourth-biggest U.S. stock
exchange, dispatched an alert that said it stopped sending
orders to NYSE Arca as a precaution.  A connection was disrupted between Arca’s machines and the
Nasdaq Stock Market data facility in Carteret, New Jersey,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.
Arca’s server tried to connect to a computer system known as the
 securities industry processor , or SIP, which is run and
maintained by Nasdaq and overseen by a committee of experts from
exchanges.  Tape C  The SIP compiles price quotes for Nasdaq-listed  stocks  and
shuttles them to the rest of the market in what is referred to
as Tape C. NYSE runs its own SIP to distribute quotes for its
stocks, Tape A and Tape B.  Disruptions to the data feeds are rare. In 2007, Nasdaq’s
SIP prevented some stock prices from updating for about 23
minutes, 10 of them during the regular trading session.  In last week’s instance, Arca’s servers attempted to
connect with the Nasdaq SIP and failed. The computers tried to
make a connection multiple times, according to people familiar
with the matter who asked not to be identified because they were
not authorized to speak publicly. The first issue was resolved
temporarily and at 10:26 a.m., NYSE Arca sent another update
saying, “all systems are operating normally at this time.”  More alerts followed.  Orders Canceled  NYSE Arca said in a message it would cancel live orders in
stocks with symbols that fell between the letters TACT and
ZYY.C. The server that handles those securities on Tape C was
the computer that couldn’t connect to Nasdaq, a person familiar
with the situation said.  Bats declared what’s called self-help against NYSE Arca
again, allowing it to bypass that exchange as it sent orders
around the market in search of the best available prices.  By 10:37 a.m., the machines at Arca and Nasdaq were having
trouble communicating again, according to a person familiar with
the matter. As the issue progressed, Nasdaq closed the port that
connects to Arca, the person said. Arca switched to a backup
server around this time in an attempt to restore the link.  Arca, the legacy of the New York Stock Exchange’s  merger 
with Archipelago Holdings Inc. in 2006 to increase its
electronic trading capabilities amid competition from Nasdaq,
handles about 11 percent of American share volume. Now the
ability of the world’s largest stock market to operate normally
hinged on whether the rivals’ computers could communicate with
each other.  Under Stress  Nasdaq’s server was under stress and running short of the
memory it needed to process Tape C, according to two people
familiar with the matter. As the memory ran out, the machine
went down.  Greifeld, 56, was at a wake in  New Jersey  in the morning
and rushed back to his office on the 50th floor of 1 Liberty
Plaza in lower Manhattan, listening to updates on the phone in
the car, according to a person familiar with his actions.  He was concerned about what he called “information
asymmetry.” Some proprietary and high-frequency trading firms,
whose lightning-fast strategies can execute thousands of trades
a second, were still getting accurate data from exchanges,
Greifeld said in the Bloomberg TV interview. Other investors,
including individuals trading at home, had to rely on the prices
from the so-called SIP and were now out of luck.  Conference Calls  Emergency conference calls were arranged and the lines were
left open, Greifeld said. One was with regulators including
officials from the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  and
the SEC. Another had representatives of exchanges discussing the
SIP, which is housed in the same Nasdaq data facility as the
machines that match buyers with sellers.  “We couldn’t take any moves with the SIP because it’s
really not ours to control without them being involved,”
Greifeld said in the Bloomberg TV interview. “That open line
went through the whole process, so it wasn’t like it was
episodic. It was constant.”  By 12:14 p.m. Nasdaq said it was halting all of its listed
stocks, which have a market value of more than $5 trillion. Its
three options exchanges were then shut down and all its listed
shares stopped changing hands on outside venues.  Before computers started playing a dominant role in
securities markets, traders were accustomed to frequent
interruptions. Markets closed on many Wednesdays in the 1960s
and observed shortened hours as daily trading of 10 million to
12 million shares meant “brokers were literally  buried  in
paperwork,” according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  Computer Trades  In today’s market, where computers can move more than 10
billion shares on a busy day and humans react to news in
seconds, interruptions have become less common.  At First New York Securities LLC in New York, partner
 Andrew Ross  was watching news that could move stocks.
Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  had said on Twitter that he
spoke to Apple Inc. CEO  Tim Cook  and the two were planning to
have dinner. Bloomberg News reported that  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  was pushing
to reduce its takeover offer for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Ross was paralyzed, unable to trade on the news, as stock
charts showing instant updates of prices turned into horizontal
lines for Nasdaq-listed companies from Apple to Zillow Inc.  At JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC in Chicago,
traders sought to relieve tension by squeezing rubber stress
balls, said  Christopher Rich , head options strategist.  Idle Hands  “If you take everybody’s toys away, then they have nothing
to play with, so everybody’s going ‘I’m mad,’ but there’s
nothing they can do about it,” Rich said in a telephone
interview.  President  Barack Obama  was told about the malfunction and
the SEC’s White said she planned to convene market officials to
discuss ways of making trading more reliable. Treasury Secretary
Jacob J. Lew was questioned about the breakdown by a master of
ceremonies after a speech in  Mountain View ,  California . Lew said
he saw no reason to believe the halt had “any of the more
frightening aspects to it, but we’re going to have to learn all
the facts.”  The malfunction was the latest in a series of mishaps that
have shaken confidence in American computerized equities trading
since the faulty use of an algorithm briefly caused markets to
erase $862 billion in share value in May 2010.  Past Breakdowns  Just two days before the latest incident, a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. technology error inundated options markets with
unintended orders. Nasdaq agreed to pay a $10 million fine to
settle SEC charges stemming from its mishandling of Facebook
Inc.’s initial public offering last year as regulators cited
“poor systems and decision-making.” A programming error almost
bankrupted Knight Capital Group Inc. last year, and Bats had to
cancel its IPO after failing to get the shares to start trading
on its own platform.  Back in New York and Carteret, a New Jersey town across the
Arthur Kill tidal straight from  Staten Island , Nasdaq was making
progress. While the SIP’s technical issue was resolved by 12:24
p.m., executives were reluctant to reboot in the middle of a
session, concerned they would spur unpredictable  price swings .  Shortly before 1 p.m., Nasdaq alerted clients that it would
re-open trading “at a time to be determined,” and that it
would not cancel open orders, so traders needed to withdraw
their bids and offers themselves. At 2:20 p.m. it advised that
quotes would start running on test stock symbols -- imaginary
shares -- in 10 minutes with real trades of the fake stocks
starting at 2:45. Real trading of real stocks would start at
3:10.  Landing Gear  “I call it really like preflight risk checks,” Greifeld
told Bloomberg TV’s  Betty Liu . “The system came down, we had it
fixed within a half hour, we’re ready to go, we’re involved in
intensive communications going through the preflight checks.”  That alert proved too optimistic and the exchange pushed
back the open another 15 minutes. By 3:25 p.m., Nasdaq stocks
started ticking again. With the close about 35 minutes away,
both the  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  and the Nasdaq 100 Index began
to rise.  There was more turbulence. At 3:37, Nasdaq declared self-help against NYSE Arca.  Finally at 4 p.m.,  James Hughes , CEO of Clinton, New
Jersey-based Unity Bancorp Inc., a community lender with 166
employees and a market value of $60 million, stood on the dais
of Nasdaq’s MarketSite in Times Square accompanied by a group of
smiling colleagues to ring the closing bell.  Last Trades  The last trades of the session were tallied and at 4:11
p.m., the exchange said the end-of-day auction was done.  “The Nasdaq Closing Cross has completed as normal and the
extended trading session has begun,” it alerted traders.  While only eight stocks in the Nasdaq 100 finished the
session lower, Nasdaq’s own shares retreated. They closed down
3.4 percent at $30.46 for the biggest loss in more than four
months. The next day, the shares recovered 1.2 percent to
$30.83.  “It will come back,” Greifeld said before the market
opened on Aug. 23. “It’s a great buying opportunity.”  Before markets opened today, two of Greifeld’s biggest
competitors confirmed they were teaming up. Bats Global Markets
and Direct Edge Holdings LLC said they would combine, uniting
the third- and fourth-largest equity exchange owners in a
transaction expected to close in the first half of 2014.  Nasdaq shares were up 0.3 percent at $30.91 as of 10:18
a.m. in New York and have risen 24 percent this year. Shares of
NYSE Euronext, which is being taken over by
IntercontinentalExchange Inc., added 0.4 percent to $42.83 and
have rallied 36 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
