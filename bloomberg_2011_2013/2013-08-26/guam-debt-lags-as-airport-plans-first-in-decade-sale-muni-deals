Guam’s only commercial airport is
selling $247 million in debt this week as bonds from issuers in
the U.S. territory are losing more than the market for the first
time since 2008.  The deal from the A.B. Won Pat International Airport
Authority in the island of 160,000 about 4,000 miles (6,436
kilometers) west of  Hawaii  would refinance bonds sold 10 years
ago, when it last issued debt, documents show. Proceeds would
also finance projects such as a new international arrivals
corridor and security lanes.  Moody’s Investors Service ranks the debt Baa2, two steps
above junk. The airport enjoys a monopoly, yet its revenue can
be volatile due to its susceptibility to typhoons and Japanese
discretionary spending, the company said. Passengers declined at
an average annual rate of 2.4 percent in the 10 years through
2012 because of fewer flights to Saipan and other islands by the
airport’s main carrier,  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
according to deal documents.  Guam, the westernmost American territory, says its slogan
is “Where America’s Day Begins.” Settled about 4,000 years
ago, the island has been a U.S. territory since 1950 and has
been also under Spanish and Japanese control.  Now Boarding  Debt from Guam issuers has lost 6.3 percent this year
through Aug. 22, compared with a 4.8 percent decline in the
broad $3.7 trillion muni-bond market, Barclays Plc data show.
The island’s index, with an average rating of about three steps
above junk, outperformed since 2009 as  interest rates  fell to
 generational lows  and investors sought higher-yielding debt.  Rolenda Faasuamalie, a spokeswoman for the Guam airport,
said it “is in a strong financial operating position” because
of the “potential for greater growth in enplanements.”  The agency will save about $12.3 million from the
refinancing, she said in an e-mail.  A Guam airport bond maturing in 2018 that is subject to the
alternative minimum tax traded nine times Aug. 6, the most since
February 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The average
yield of 4.68 percent was about 3.52 percentage points more than
benchmark AAA munis. The spread was 2.79 percentage points on
April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
