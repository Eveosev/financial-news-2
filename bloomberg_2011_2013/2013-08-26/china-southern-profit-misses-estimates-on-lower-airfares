China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , the
nation’s biggest carrier by passengers, said first-half profit
fell 19 percent as competition with bullet trains and slowing
economic growth pushed fares lower.  Net income  was 344 million  yuan  ($56 million) in the six
months ended in June, compared with 424 million yuan a year
earlier, the carrier said in a  filing  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That compares with the 516 million-yuan median
profit estimate of five analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .
Sales fell 1.6 percent to 46.2 billion yuan.  China Southern had an operating loss of 114 million yuan in
the period from a profit of 1.77 billion yuan a year earlier.
Chinese carriers are discounting fares to lure more passengers
amid  China ’s economic slowdown and competition from high-speed
trains.  Shares of China Southern rose 0.7 percent to close at
HK$2.92 in Hong Kong trading today before the earnings were
announced. The stock has dropped 25 percent this year, compared
with a 2.9 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Passenger yields, a measure of average ticket price, fell
11 percent to 0.59 yuan, according to the statement. China
Southern carried 43.8 million passengers, 6.3 percent more from
a year earlier, in the first half while it expanded seat
capacity by 9.3 percent.  Currency Gains  The carrier posted a 1.52 billion-yuan of foreign exchange
gain, compared with a net exchange loss of 314 million yuan a
year earlier, as the nation’s currency appreciated 1.5 percent
against the  U.S. dollar  in the period.  China Southern plans to deploy its Airbus SAS A380s on
Guangzhou-Sydney route in October. The carrier hasn’t won the
right to fly the plane on overseas routes from the nation’s
capital Beijing even after receiving the first superjumbo about
two years ago. The airline has been mostly using its five A380s
for domestic services or on the Guangzhou-Los Angeles route.  The yuan was the best performer in 24 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg in the first half. Chinese
carriers benefit from a stronger local currency as it pares the
repatriated value of dollar-denominated debts used to buy planes
and fuel overseas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
