Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , Brazil’s
state-run oil company, extended losses after Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  said a weaker currency won’t prompt an increase in
domestic fuel prices.  Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras fell 1.7 percent to 18.23
reais at the close in Sao Paulo. Losses for the year widened to
6.6 percent, compared with a 15 percent drop in the benchmark
index.  The government hasn’t made a decision on adjusting the
price Petrobras, as the biggest producer in deep waters is
known, uses to sell gasoline and diesel to distributors, Mantega
said today at an event in Sao Paulo. Mantega is the chairman of
Petrobras, which the government controls through a majority of
voting shares.  Petrobras subsidizes imported fuel as part of a government
policy to control inflation, and a weaker  exchange rate 
increases the cost of selling imported fuel in Brazil. The real
fell 1.4 percent to 2.38 to the dollar at 5:13 p.m., extending
the biggest three-month drop among major currencies on
speculation a $60 billion intervention program isn’t enough to
stem the slide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
