Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  rose
to the highest in almost three months after the Czech bookmaker
said it received permission to start online gambling in Poland.  The stock jumped as much as 4.4 percent and closed up 0.5
percent at 98 koruna by 4:20 p.m. in Prague, the highest since
Nov. 2. Over 182,000 shares were traded, more than seven times
the three-month daily average.  Fortuna will start online sports betting in Poland today
after obtaining a license from the  finance ministry , the company
said in a statement yesterday. The bookmaker has received 20,000
registration requests for  Internet gambling  from Polish
customers, according to a separate statement yesterday.  “Online betting in Poland represents a big opportunity for
Fortuna” as “one of the most important growth projects for the
company,” analysts led by Milan Vanicek at J&T Banka AS in
 Prague  wrote in a report today. “The news is positive because
Fortuna had applied for the license several months ago and there
could be concerns whether any obstacles might get in the way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
