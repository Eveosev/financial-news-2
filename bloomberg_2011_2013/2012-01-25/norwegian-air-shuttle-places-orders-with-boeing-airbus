Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NAS)  ordered
222  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Airbus SAS (EAD)  airliners valued at 127 billion
kroner ($21.5 billion) as Europe’s fourth-biggest discount
carrier steps up its competition with state-backed SAS AB.  Norwegian Air will buy the latest fuel-efficient models,
ordering 100 Boeing 737 MAX8 single-aisle planes and the same
number of Airbus A320neos, plus 22 of Boeing’s existing 737-
800s, the Fornebu-based carrier said today in a statement.  Today’s order will add capacity and pare operating costs as
the carrier seeks to strip traffic from SAS, the Stockholm-based
owner of  Scandinavian Airlines. (SAS)  Founded in 1993, Norwegian Air
switched to a discount model in 2001, emulating  Ryanair Holdings
Plc (RYA)  and  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , before adding long-haul flights last year.  “By ordering so many aircraft Norwegian will certainly
position themselves to be one of the major players in the
European marketplace,” said Hans-Erik Jacobsen, an analyst at
First Securities ASA with a “buy” rating in the stock. “It
will help to keep costs even lower and to stay competitive.”  Norwegian Air surged as much as 15 percent and closed 13
percent higher at 74.75 kroner in Oslo. The stock has advanced
35 percent so far this year, valuing the company at 2.58 billion
kroner ($436 million).  Airbus First  SAS, which is part-owned by the governments of Denmark,
Norway and  Sweden , fell 1.1 percent to 9 kronor. The largest
Nordic airline hasn’t posted a full-year profit since 2007.  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. , the parent of
Toulouse, France-based Airbus, slipped 0.6 percent to 25.81
euros in Paris, while Chicago-based Boeing traded 1.8 percent
lower at $74 as of 11:41 a.m. in New York.  The order is Airbus’s first from Norwegian Air, which
operates an all-Boeing fleet of 48 737-800s and 14 737-300s,
according to the carrier’s website.  There’s no issue with financing, which is supported by the
Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and European Export Credit
Agencies, Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos said today.  Loans will comprise 85 percent of the order’s value,
requiring 15 percent equity, or about 10 billion kroner,
according to Per Kristian Reppe, an analyst at Pareto Securities
in Oslo, who said in a note that that’s likely to be provided
from operational  cash flow  and the sale of older aircraft.  “Management seemed comfortable that an equity issue would
not be needed, although one could not totally eliminate such a
scenario considering the size of the order,” he said.  Fleet Renewal  The deal is also the first in  Europe  for Boeing’s MAX
model, which the U.S. company decided to offer last year to
blunt the success of the A320neo. Single-aisle aircraft are the
most widely used globally, and the neo had become the fastest-
seller in aviation history as customers sought to cut costs.  Deliveries will start in 2016, Norwegian Air said, and the
agreement also includes options for 100 MAX8s and 50 neos.
Airbus has said it plans to provide the first neos by late 2015.
Boeing’s target for the first 737 MAX delivery is 2017.  Norwegian Air will use some of the new aircraft to phase
out planes that were delivered starting in 2009 as they reach
seven or eight years of age, and aims to operate 241 planes as
of 2022, Kjos said in an interview in Oslo.  The Boeing MAX jets will be powered by the Leap-X, the only
engine offered for the model, supplied by the CFM International
venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA. (SAF)  Initial neos will
use the geared turbofan made by  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s
 Pratt & Whitney , since the engine is the only one available for
early deliveries, with the Leap-X an option later, Kjos said.  Dreamliner Plan  Norwegian would also like to add more Boeing 787 widebodies
as it develops longer routes, the executive said, adding that
the Dreamliner’s efficiencies have been an “eye-opener” and that
it and the Airbus A350 mark a “revolution” in the industry.  The Nordic carrier agreed in 2010 to take two 787s from
International Lease Finance Corp. for 12 years starting last
fall, and said it was in talks to add as many as six more. It
said last May that it had struck an agreement with Icelandair
Group HF to acquire three 787s that Icelandair has on order.  Services from Oslo and  Stockholm  to Bangkok and  New York 
began in the second half 2011, with Norwegian Air planning to
add 15 long-distance routes over the next few years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
