The  Minnesota Timberwolves  agreed on
a four-year extension with All-Star forward Kevin Love, the
first National Basketball Association player in 28 years to
average more than 20 points and 15 rebounds per game.  The Timberwolves didn’t disclose financial terms of the
contract in a statement. The Associated Press said the extension
is worth between $60 million and $62 million, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation.  “I am happy for Kevin, who deserves to have the financial
security that this contract affords him,” Timberwolves
President of Basketball Operation David Kahn said in the
 statement .  Love, 23, is averaging 24.9 points and 13.9 rebounds for
the 7-10 Timberwolves this season, his fourth in the NBA.  The 6-foot-10, 260-pound forward was voted the NBA’s most
improved player last season after averaging 20.2 points and a
league-leading 15.2 rebounds. The last 20 point-15 rebound
player was Moses Malone of the  Philadelphia 76ers  in 1982-83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
