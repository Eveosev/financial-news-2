Trafigura Beheer BV, the world’s
third-largest independent oil trader, is offering to pay
interest of 125 basis points more than the  London  interbank
offered rate on a $600 million  credit line .  The 364-day revolving credit will refinance a $676 million
facility maturing in March, according to Jan-Maarten Mulder,
global head of corporate finance and treasury at the Amsterdam-
based company. The interest margin on the new transaction is the
same as the existing line, he said.  The company will hold a bank meeting tomorrow in London for
the transaction that has received $575 million of lender
commitments and may exceed $600 million, Mulder said. Citigroup
Inc., Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , DBS Group Holdings Ltd.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Standard Chartered Plc, UBS AG and
UniCredit SpA are bookrunners for the financing.  Trafigura also decided to exercise its option to extend the
maturity of a $2.5 billion three-year facility to 2015 from
2014, according to Mulder. The company may refinance the one-
year $760 million loan it raised in  Asia  in 2011 later this
year, he said.  Trafigura’s 2011 revenue surged more than 50 percent to
$122 billion from $79 billion, Alan Williamson, an economist at
the firm’s Galena Asset Management unit, said Jan. 10 at an
investment conference.  “Following our record performance in 2011, we see very
strong support from banks across the world and despite the
ongoing financial crisis we are able to increase our access to
dollar funding,” Mulder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
