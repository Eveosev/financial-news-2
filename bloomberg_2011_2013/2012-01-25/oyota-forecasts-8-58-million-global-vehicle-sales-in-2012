Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest seller of gasoline-electric autos, boosted its global
sales target on higher demand for a new small Prius model and
its other hybrids, buoyed by government incentives in Japan.  The automaker now expects to sell 8.58 million vehicles
this year, a 21 percent annual increase, according to a
statement today. The target is 100,000 higher than the Toyota
City, Japan-based company’s projection last month and excludes
subsidiaries  Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262)  and  Hino Motors Ltd. (7205)   Toyota, outsold by  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in
2011, is counting on Japan’s incentives for fuel-efficient autos
and the small Prius Aqua, known as the Prius c in the U.S., to
help regain market share after natural disasters in  Japan  and
 Thailand  crippled production. The recovery will help the maker
of the Camry sedan double its profit next fiscal year after the
output shortfall leads to an earnings decline in the 12 months
ending in March, according to analysts’  estimates .  “Incentives in the domestic market will definitely give
Toyota an advantage over GM and VW,” said  Satoru Takada , a
Tokyo-based auto analyst at research firm Toward The Infinite
World Inc. “With the earthquake and flooding gone, Toyota’s
sales will rebound in all of its markets.”  Toyota’s American depositary receipts rose 2.6 percent to
$74.22 at the close in  New York . They declined 11 percent in the
past 12 months.  Stronger Yen  Toyota still faces the strength of the yen, which has
appreciated more against the dollar than any other major
currency in the past six months, undermining the value of
Japanese exports. The company must also contend with a healthier
GM, which became the world’s biggest automaker in 2011 two years
after exiting a U.S. government-backed bankruptcy, and the
rising popularity of  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s cars worldwide.  The yen, coupled with the production disruptions stemming
from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, led to Japan’s first
annual trade gap since 1980, according to government figures
released today.  To protect a domestic industry reeling from natural
disasters and the yen’s appreciation, the Japanese government
last month began waiving some taxes and offering rebates for
certified low-emission vehicles, allocating 300 billion yen
($3.8 billion) in the fiscal budget. Eligible consumers will be
exempt from paying the 3 percent purchase tax, the 2,500 yen per
half-ton duty and receive a rebate, according to the nation’s
transport ministry.  Tax Breaks, Rebates  For example, customers of the Prius hatchback, which starts
at 2.17 million yen, can get 135,500 yen in tax breaks and a
100,000 yen rebate, according to Toyota’s website.  By comparison, consumers in the U.S. who purchase low-
emission vehicles such as GM’s Chevrolet Volt and  Nissan Motor (7201) 
Co.’s Leaf are eligible for a federal tax rebate of $7,500.  The Japanese state aid will help the nation’s automakers
increase sales by 900,000 vehicles in their home market this
year after a record 14 percent drop in 2011, Toshiyuki Shiga,
chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said
late last month.  Toyota may sell 1.63 million vehicles in its home market
and 6.95 million overseas, Senior Managing Director Masamoto Maekawa said in Nagoya, Japan. The company received more than
100,000 orders for the Aqua and about 3,000 for the plug-in
Prius in Japan since their introduction late last year, he said.  Delivering on Time  “We are currently assessing our production lines of the
Aqua, and we hope to deliver all our cars on time,” Maekawa
said. Toyota hasn’t announced a U.S. sales goal for the Prius c,
which goes on sale in March.  Demand for the new compact Prius may lead Toyota to also
raise its 2012 production target for the model by 30 percent to
320,000 units, the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without
citing anyone.  Those figures would indicate global sales of the model may
exceed the total number of cars bearing the Prius name that
Toyota projects to sell in the U.S. this year.  Jim Lentz , head of sales in the U.S., Toyota’s biggest
market, said in  Detroit  this month that Prius sales in the
country would climb more than 60 percent to a record and exceed
220,000 vehicles, fueled by the new smaller version of the
hybrid hatchback.  To contact the reporters on this story:
