Catcher Russell Martin agreed to a
one-year contract with the  New York Yankees  to avoid salary
arbitration the same day  Jorge Posada  announced his retirement.  The team didn’t disclose terms of Martin’s agreement
yesterday. The New York Times reported it is worth $7.5 million,
with the possibility of $100,000 in performance bonuses.  Martin, 28, batted .237 with 18 home runs and 65 runs
batted in during 125 Major League Baseball games last season,
his first with the Yankees. He tied Alex Avila of the  Detroit
Tigers  with a major league high 40 baserunners caught stealing.  Over his 792-game career with the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and
Yankees, Martin has a .267 batting average with 72 home runs and
365 RBIs.  Posada, a Puerto Rico native, retires with a .273 career
batting average, 275 home runs and 1,065 runs batted in. He won
five World Series championships with the Yankees, the only team
the long-time catcher played for in 17 major league seasons.  Posada said he told his agents not to consider offers from
other clubs to extend his career.  “It wasn’t in me,” he said. “I knew in my heart and I
knew in my head that I really didn’t want to play any more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
