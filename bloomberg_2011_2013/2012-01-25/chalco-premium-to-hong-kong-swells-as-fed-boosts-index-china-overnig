Chinese stocks  in the U.S. rose,
pushing  Aluminum Corp of China  to its biggest premium versus
Hong Kong shares in two months, as Federal Reserve plans to
leave  interest rates  low for longer boosted global growth
optimism and speculation mounted that China will take further
steps to bolster its economy.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. gained 1.2 percent to 102.76 in  New York 
yesterday, led by energy and commodity producers.  Sinopec
Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (SHI)  and  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC)  rose as
oil and metals prices climbed. Aluminum Corp., known as Chalco,
advanced to a two-month high, extending a 5 percent premium over
stock traded in Hong Kong as markets there open after the three-
day Lunar New Year holiday.  Economic growth in China eased to the slowest pace since
2009 in the fourth quarter, stoking speculation that policy
makers will further loosen lending and monetary policy. The
 Federal Reserve  will keep U.S. benchmark rates “exceptionally
low” until at least late 2014, officials said in a statement
yesterday.  The Fed’s statement indicated “it is going to be easing
for quite some time, and the market turned around,” said Greg
Lesko, who oversees $750 million as managing director at Deltec
Asset Management in New York by phone yesterday. China may
“prefer some fiscal programs to monetary easing. They still
have the ability to spend money.”  The People’s Bank of China, which lowered banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios for the first time since 2008 last month,
hasn’t changed the nation’s benchmark 6.56 percent lending rate
since July. The Chinese government rolled out a $586 billion
stimulus package that helped to lift the economy out of the 2008
global financial crisis.  Metals Bets  Chalco rose 2.1 percent to $13.51 in New York, extending
its advance this week to 4.5 percent. The difference between the
company’s U.S. and  Hong Kong  stocks was the widest since Nov.
30, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Aluminum for three-month
delivery advanced for the third day, gaining 0.6 percent to
settle at $2,252 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest
closing level since Oct. 27.  Speculators raised bets on higher metal prices by the most
since July on signs of growth in the U.S., increasing demand in
China and more confidence in  Europe .  Money managers increased combined net-long positions in
five industrial and precious metals by 13 percent to 152,665
futures and  options  in the week ended Jan. 17, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities has risen 2.6 percent this month, led by
silver, zinc and aluminum.  ‘Double-Digit’ Rally  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced 0.9 percent to a
six-month high of 1,326.06. Mainland Chinese markets are closed
all of this week for the New Year break.  “I do expect the Hong Kong market after the New Year
holiday to take us back very quickly to July levels last year,”
Thomas Murphy, a managing partner at Family Office Research &
Management Ltd. in Sydney, a private wealth-management firm,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday. “The
Chinese market will actually lead the rest of the  emerging
markets  in terms of upward moves.”  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has slumped 12 percent from a
22,770.5 level reached on July 4, the highest over the past six
months. The market will post a “double-digit rally” this year,
with most gains to come in the second half, Murphy said.  American depositary receipts of Yanzhou Coal, the fourth-
largest coal producer in the country, climbed 2.9 percent to a
two-month high of $25.31. The ADRs are trading at a 4 percent
 premium  over the company’s Hong Kong stock, which gained 0.6
percent to HK$18.88 on Jan. 20, or the equivalent of $2.43 a
share. Each ADR represents 10 ordinary shares.  Sinopec Shanghai  Sinopec  Shanghai , a unit of China’s largest oil refiner,
rose 2.3 percent to $37.62. Its parent  China Petroleum and
Chemical Corp ., known as Sinopec, climbed 1.2 percent to one-
week high of $118.23.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index  Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 1.1 percent to $39.41 in
its seventh straight day of gains. The  yuan  weakened 0.4 percent
to 6.3390 versus the dollar on Jan. 20, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Suntech Power Holdings Ltd. (STP) , the world’s largest
photovoltaic panel marker, climbed 2.6 percent, the most in a
week, to $3.14 after Chief Executive Officer Zhengrong Shi said
the solar development market is moving away from Europe to
expand rapidly in China, the U.S.,  India ,  Japan  and  South
Africa .  Solar Cost  The cost of generating electricity from the sun will
compete with conventional power delivered on a grid in half the
world by 2015, Shi told Bloomberg Television yesterday in an
interview in Davos. Installations in  China  may reach 4,000
megawatts this year, he said.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 8.9
percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 9.1 percent in
the previous quarter, the statistics bureau said on Jan. 17.
Full-year growth slowed to 9.2 percent in 2011 from 10.4 percent
in 2010.  Chinese  manufacturing  contracted in January for the second
time in three months, according to the median estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the purchasing managers’
index release on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
