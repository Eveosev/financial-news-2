A slump in U.K. manufacturing demand
eased in January, according to the  Confederation of British
Industry , which said the outlook for growth remains threatened
by the crisis in the euro area.  An index of  factory orders  rose to minus 16 from minus 23
in December, the CBI said in a report in  London  today. A gauge
of export orders increased to minus 26 from minus 32.  Producers were optimistic on the outlook for the coming
three months, with a gauge of expectations for output volumes
rising to 15 from minus 8, the first positive reading since
September. A measure of expectations for selling prices over the
period rose to 13 from 7.  “We know that 2012 will not be an easy year,”  John Cridland , CBI director general, said in a statement. “The
crisis in the euro zone is still hanging over the U.K.,
threatening future growth. Nevertheless, within the survey there
are tentative signs that things could improve somewhat in the
coming quarter.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
