Kazakhstan  and Mongolia added to
their  gold reserves  in December as the precious metal advanced
for an 11th consecutive year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  Kazakhstan’s bullion holdings rose 3.1 metric tons to 76.7
tons and Mongolia added 1.2 tons to take its assets to 3.5 tons,
data on the IMF’s website showed. Ukraine increased gold
reserves by 0.1 ton, Mexico cut them by 0.2 ton and Mauritius
reduced them by 0.1 ton, the data show.  Central banks are expanding reserves for the first time in
a generation as holdings in  exchange-traded products  are within
1.9 percent of an all-time high set last month. The banks may
buy 600 tons this year, according to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
Global holdings of the metal advanced by 66.6 tons in November
from a month earlier to 30,877 tons, the IMF data show. That’s
equal to almost 11 years of world mine production.  “The trend of emerging countries’ official sector gold
buying will continue this year, which will be a price-supportive
factor going forward,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT
Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “The desire of central
banks to diversify reserves with hard-currency gold is high and
a long-term process.”  Gold for immediate delivery gained 10 percent last year and
reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce in September. It traded at
$1,660.93 by 10:19 a.m. in  London  today and is up 6 percent this
month.  Gold accounts for about 13 percent of Kazakhstan’s total
reserves, and 5.2 percent of Mongolia’s, according to the latest
report from the London-based World Gold Council. The metal
accounts for more than 70 percent of reserves of the U.S. and
 Germany , the biggest holders, the data show.  To contact the reporter for this story:
