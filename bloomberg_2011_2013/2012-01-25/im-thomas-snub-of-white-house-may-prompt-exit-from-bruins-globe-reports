Tim Thomas ’s decision to skip a
visit to the White House this week with the rest of the Stanley
Cup-champion  Boston  Bruins may be the first step in the
goaltender and the team parting ways, the Boston Globe reports.  Thomas, one of two Americans on the Bruins’ team that won
the National Hockey League championship last season, declined
the invitation to meet President  Barack Obama  on Jan. 23, saying
in a  statement  that he believes “the federal government has
grown out of control.”  Thomas, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner as the league’s
best goaltender, said he made the decision as an individual and
didn’t mention the Bruins or his teammates in his statement.  Bruins President Cam Neely said the organization was
“ disappointed ” in Thomas, who was a member of the U.S. hockey
team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. General Manager Peter Chiarelli said Thomas wouldn’t be disciplined for his actions.  Thomas, 37, has one year left on his four-year, $20 million
contract with the Bruins after this season. A no-movement clause
in his deal expires at the conclusion of the 2011-12 campaign,
and the Globe said the White House snub may lead to the Bruins
parting ways with Thomas, without citing the source of its
information.  Thomas, who has spent all eight of his NHL seasons in
Boston, is the reigning Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the
postseason’s Most Valuable Player and has a 20-9 record with a
2.12 goals-against average this season. Tuukka Rusk, a 24-year-
old from  Finland , is the Bruins’ backup goaltender and is 11-5
with a 1.82 GAA after starting yesterday’s loss to the
 Washington Capitals .  To contact the reporter on this story:
