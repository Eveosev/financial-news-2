Manchester City forward  Mario Balotelli  will begin serving a four-game suspension tonight
after accepting a violent conduct charge, the Football
Association said.  Balotelli appeared to strike Tottenham midfielder Scott Parker in the head with his foot during City’s 3-2 win in the
Premier League three days ago. Balotelli, who had received a
yellow card earlier in the game, wasn’t punished by referee
Howard Webb and went on the score the winning goal with a
penalty kick late in stoppage time.  The F.A. said on its website that Balotelli will not appeal
the ban, which begins with tonight’s Carling Cup semifinal
second leg at Liverpool, where City must overcome a 1-0 deficit
from the opening game.  The Italian will also miss league matches against Everton,
Fulham and Aston Villa, and would be available for the Carling
Cup final on Feb. 26 should City advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
