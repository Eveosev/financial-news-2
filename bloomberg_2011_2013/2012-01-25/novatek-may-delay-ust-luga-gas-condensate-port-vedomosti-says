OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s largest
independent natural-gas producer, may delay the opening of the
Ust-Luga gas-condensate terminal on the Baltic Sea from the
fourth quarter of this year,  Vedomosti  reported.  Novatek faces engineering issues similar to those that OAO
Transneft encountered at its Ust-Luga  oil terminal , which is to
begin operating in the first quarter after a delay from
November, the Moscow-based newspaper said today, citing a letter
from Transneft President Nikolai Tokarev to Russian Deputy Prime
Minister  Igor Sechin .  Novatek and Transneft, Russia’s monopoly operator of oil
pipelines, are building their terminals at neighboring piers in
the port of Ust-Luga, according to Vedomosti. The companies are
not partners in either project, and the newspaper didn’t explain
how Tokarev might know of Novatek’s plans for its condensate
terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
