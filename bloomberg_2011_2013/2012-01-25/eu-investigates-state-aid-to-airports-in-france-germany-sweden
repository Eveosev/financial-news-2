The European Commission has opened a
probe into whether financial support given by authorities to
four airports in  Germany ,  France  and  Sweden  is in line with the
regionâ€™s rules on government aid.  The probe concerns the airports of Niederrhein-Weeze and
Altenburg-Nobitz in Germany, Pau in France and Vasteras in
Sweden, the regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
