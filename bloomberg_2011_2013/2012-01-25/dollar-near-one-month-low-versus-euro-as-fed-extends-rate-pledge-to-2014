The dollar traded near its weakest
level in one month against the euro after the  Federal Reserve 
extended its pledge to keep  interest rates  low until late 2014.  The yen held a three-day loss against the 17-nation
currency on prospects Asian stocks will extend gains in U.S.
equities, reducing demand for haven assets. Strength in the euro
was limited after the  European Central Bank  was said to oppose
restructuring its Greek bonds. New Zealand’s dollar halted a
four-day advance after Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard
signaled interest rates may stay at a record low
for longer than he intended a month ago.  “The Fed’s pledge for a prolonged easing of monetary
policy boosted risk-on sentiment,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager
of the foreign-bond department in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities
Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest listed bank by market
value. “Dollar selling is likely to continue across the board,
and the bias is for the yen to be weaker too.”  The dollar traded at $1.3112 per euro as of 8:31 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3106 in  New York  yesterday, when it dropped to
$1.3121, the lowest level since Dec. 21.  Japan’s currency dropped to 101.98 yen per euro, the
weakest since Dec. 26, before trading little changed at 101.93.
The yen was at 77.76 per dollar from 77.78 yesterday, when it
reached 78.28, the weakest since Nov. 29.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.9 percent
yesterday, while the MSCI World Index of stocks rose 0.5
percent.  Fed Pledge  “The Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative
stance for monetary policy,” the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said in a statement released in  Washington  yesterday. “Economic
conditions -- including low rates of resource utilization and a
subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run -- are likely
to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate
at least through late 2014.”  The Fed had previously pledged to keep its  rate  target in
place until mid-2013.  New Zealand’s dollar traded little changed at 81.69 U.S.
cents and 63.48 yen. Australia’s dollar fetched $1.0601 from
$1.0597. It traded at 82.39 yen from 82.43 yen.  “Given ongoing uncertainty around global conditions and
the moderate pace of domestic demand, it remains prudent to keep
the official cash rate on hold at 2.5 percent,” Bollard said in
a statement today in Wellington. That was a change from his
December statement, when he said it was “prudent for now” to
maintain the rate, which has been at that level since March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
