Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  Chairman Urs Rohner backed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s
efforts to stabilize the economy amid the debt crisis.  “Mr. Draghi has been in his job for a short period of
time,” Rohner said in Davos, Switzerland at the  World Economic
Forum . “He’s done everything he could so far and I’m convinced
he’ll do whatever is necessary to fend off the crisis.”   Italian and Spanish government bonds have rallied since
Draghi last month offered banks as much money as they needed for
three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
