U.S. crop-insurance payouts rose to
an estimated record $9.1 billion in 2011 because of adverse
weather, and they may top $10 billion once claims are settled,
an industry group said.  Drought in the Great Plains, floods from the Mississippi
River and freezing weather in the South pushed payments by
companies including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Ace Ltd. (ACE)  past the
$8.67 billion record in 2008, National Crop Insurance Services,
based in Overland Park, Kansas, said yesterday in a  statement .  The industry has become “leaner and more efficient”
followings cuts in federal funding, Tom Zacharias, the group’s
president, said. “It is imperative that Congress not weaken the
crop-insurance infrastructure further as it writes the 2012 farm
bill.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
