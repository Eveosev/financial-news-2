Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day on increased dollar inflows from the country’s tea
producers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.8 percent to 85.20 per dollar and traded 0.2
percent higher at 85.70 as of 2:03 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  “The shilling has gained on increased dollar inflows from
the tea sale,” John Muli a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  African tea prices declined to an average of $2.62 per
kilogram from the previous week’s average of $2.74 at an auction
in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd.
said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a third day on increased
dollar demand from oil importers. The currency of the second-
largest East African economy depreciated 0.6 percent to 1,605.70
per dollar.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased demand for
dollars by oil importers and manufacturers seeking to import raw
materials,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at National Bank of
Commerce Ltd., ABSA Group’s Tanzanian unit, said today by phone
from  Dar es Salaam , the country’s commercial Capital.  The Ugandan shilling strengthened for a fifth day, the
longest streak since Dec 2., appreciating 0.5 percent to 2,365
at 1:25 p.m. in the capital Kampala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
