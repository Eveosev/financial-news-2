Citigroup Inc. (C)  is practicing
“responsible finance” and going “back to the basics of
banking” as lenders address public anger after the financial
crisis, Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said.  “It’s important for the financial system to acknowledge
there’s a great deal of anger directed at it,” Pandit said
today at a press conference at the  World Economic Forum  in
Davos,  Switzerland . The system must “balance safety and
soundness but also address the need for growth. Trust has been
broken. Banks have to serve clients, not serve themselves.”  Pandit said the biggest challenges for the world economy in
the next 10 years include the creation of new jobs and
investment in infrastructure.  “The single biggest issue facing us is the question of
jobs,” he said, estimating the world must create 400 million
jobs over 10 years. “That’s going to take a lot of growth.”  The world needs a “recommitment to globalization,” and
you need a “banking system that can support that,” he said.  Pandit also said New York-based Citigroup, the third-
largest U.S. bank, “just yesterday” declined to assist a
potential client that wanted to buy another company with
“excessive amounts of leverage.”  “Our decision was to step away,” he said, declining to
provide details of the client or the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
