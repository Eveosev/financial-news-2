Gulf Air, Bahrain’s state-run
airline, may be sold, dissolved, reduced in size or receive
government support to continue operating,  Gulf Daily News 
reported, citing confidential documents it obtained.  Selling the airline and building a new carrier is seen as
the likeliest scenario and would cost the government 460 billion
Bahraini dinars ($1.2 billion), while cutting its size would
cost as much as 600 million dinars, according to the newspaper.
A committee formed this week is studying options, the Daily News
said, adding that a Gulf Air spokeswoman wasn’t immediately
available for comment.  -- With assistance from Donna Abu Nasr in Manama. Editor: Alan
