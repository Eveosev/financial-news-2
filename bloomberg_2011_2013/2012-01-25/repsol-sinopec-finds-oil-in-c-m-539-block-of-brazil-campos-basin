Repsol (REP)  YPF SA, Spain’s biggest oil
company, said it found traces of crude in the deepest area being
explored in  Brazil .  The Madrid-based company’s joint venture with China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec, found signs of oil in
2.789 meters of water at the BM-C-33 exploration block in
Brazil’s Campos Basin, Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency
reported on its Website. It’s the deepest well currently being
drilled in the country, according to data on the regulator’s
website, and hasn’t been declared commercially viable.  Repsol is exploring in Brazil’s Santos, Espirito Santo and
Campos basins, including minority stakes in the Guara and
Carioca discoveries where the company estimates recoverable
reserves of as much as 3 billion barrels. Repsol is exploring
the so-called pre-salt region in Campos, an area where  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  has found an estimated 1.1 billion barrels.  Repsol Sinopec controls 35 percent of the block, while
Statoil do Brasil Ltda. owns 35 percent and Petrobras, as the
state-controlled producer is known, holds the remainder. Repsol
sold 40 percent of its Brazil unit to Sinopec for $7.1 billion
in 2010 to help finance investments.  Repsol fell 1.4 percent to 21.58 euros at 2:05 p.m. in
 Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
