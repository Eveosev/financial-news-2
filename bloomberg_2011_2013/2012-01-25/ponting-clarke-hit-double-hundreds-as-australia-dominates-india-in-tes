Ricky Ponting and  Michael Clarke  hit
double centuries as Australia amassed 604-7 declared before
reducing India to 61-2 on day two of the final cricket Test.  Ponting hit 221 and Australia captain Clarke struck 210 at
the Adelaide Oval as they shared a ground-record 386-run
partnership. It was the fourth-highest stand by an Australian
pair in elite Test matches.  Brad Haddinwas on 42 and Ryan Harris on 35 when Clarke
called Australia’s first innings to a close after the tea
interval. Peter Siddle then removedVirender Sehwag for 18 and
Ben Hilfenhaus bowled  Rahul Dravid  for 1. It was the sixth time
the player nicknamed ‘The Wall’ was dismissed bowled in seven
innings in the four-match series.  Gautam Gambhir  (30) and Sachin Tendulkar (12) made it to stumps without further loss.  Australia is seeking to wrap up a 4-0 sweep having already
secured the Border-Gavaskar trophy by winning the first three
matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
