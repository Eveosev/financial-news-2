Record seven-time winner Liverpool
tied Manchester City 2-2 to advance to the final of the Carling
Cup.  A Steven Gerrard penalty in the 41st minute and  Craig
Bellamy ’s 74th-minute goal gave the hosts a 3-2 win over the two
games. Gerrard’s penalty in Manchester earlier this month gave
Liverpool a 1-0 lead going into tonight’s match.  Nigel De Jong gave City the lead in the 31th minute, and
then Edin Dzeko put the visitors ahead after Gerrard’s goal,
which came after Micah Richards was ruled to have handled the
ball in City’s area.  The victors meet Cardiff in the Feb. 26 final at Wembley
Stadium. Cardiff beat Crystal Palace 3-1 last night in a
penalty shootout to reach the final of the cup, English
soccer’s second-tier cup competition, for the first time.  Tom Heaton made two saves in the shootout last night for
the Bluebirds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
