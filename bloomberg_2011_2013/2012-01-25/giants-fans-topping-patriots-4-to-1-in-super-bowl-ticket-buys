New York-area football fans are
outpacing New Englanders in buying  Super Bowl  tickets on the
secondary market.  Twenty-three percent of tickets for the Feb. 5 game in
Indianapolis sold on  NFL Ticket Exchange  have been purchased by
people in either  New York  or New Jersey, according to data
released by the website, the official ticket reseller of the
 National Football League .  Residents of Massachusetts make up 5 percent of purchasers
and Connecticut 7.5 percent, though that state includes
geographic allegiances to both participating teams, the  New
England Patriots  and the New York Giants.  “The Giants have a notoriously rabid fan base that travels
extremely well,” Jennifer Swanson, a spokeswoman for the NFL
Ticket Exchange, said in an e-mail. “We’ve already seen a spike
in ticket orders from New York and  New Jersey  -- more than four
times that from Massachusetts -- and we expect that trend to
continue.”  More than 1,100 tickets are available on the site, with the
lowest priced at $2,613 and the highest -- in Row 1 at the 50-
yard line -- at $14,207. The average price of tickets sold so
far is $4,272, a $93 increase from yesterday.  The average resale ticket price across several web
platforms for the Lucas Oil Stadium contest is $4,001, with the
least expensive $2,275, according to TiqIQ, an event ticket
aggregator that tracks listings from StubHub, EBay,
TicketNetwork and TicketsNow, an NFL Ticket Exchange partner.  The game is a Super Bowl rematch between the Patriots (15-
3) and Giants (12-7), who upset  New England  in 2008 to win the
championship 17-14 in Glendale, Arizona.  Tickets for that game averaged $3,702 on TicketsNow. The
NFL Ticket Exchange was created the following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
