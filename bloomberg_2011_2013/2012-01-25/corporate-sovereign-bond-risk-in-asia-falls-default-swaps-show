The cost of protecting Asian
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment dropped,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 3 basis points to 191 as of 8:25
a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 2 basis points to 171 as
of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge is
set for its first increase since Jan. 18, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 160
basis points as of 11:34 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
