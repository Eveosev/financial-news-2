Greece  will sell the betting
operations and real-estate assets of its  Hellenic Horse Racing
Company  separately, with the aim of appealing to a wider range
of investors, said Costas Mitropoulos, chief executive officer
of the  Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund .  “We’re going to split the horse betting and racing
operations from the real estate,” Mitropoulos said today in an
interview in his Athens office.  The company, known as ODIE, has exclusive rights in Greece
for betting at racetracks. The company moved to Markopoulo,
south east of Athens, in 2003 to new facilities designed to
serve the 2004 Athens  Olympic Games .  ODIE owns part of the plot of land that houses an
equestrian center and a racetrack, Mitroupoulos said. “We’ll
sell the company and it will rent the horse track and when we
decide what to do with the land, we’ll put it on the market.”  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and its Greek unit  Emporiki Bank SA (TEMP)  are
financial advisers for the privatization of ODIE and Dryllerakis
& Associates are legal advisers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
