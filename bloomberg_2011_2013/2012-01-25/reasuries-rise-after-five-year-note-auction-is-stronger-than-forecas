Treasuries rose after the U.S. sale
of $35 billion in five-year notes was met with stronger-than-
forecast demand ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee
statement on the direction of U.S. monetary policy.  The notes drew a yield of 0.899 percent, compared with a
forecast of 0.919 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.17, the highest since May,
versus an average of 2.863 for the previous 10 sales. Treasuries
yields fell before the FOMC’s policy statement at 12:30 p.m.  “We’ve cheapened up in recent days, making the sector more
attractive,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist
in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a primary dealer. “There
are still risk-averse buyers out there who understand that the
Fed will be on hold for some time, and that means investors are
still hunting for yield.”  The  yield  on the current five-year note fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.87 percent, at 11:34 a.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
 yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell one basis point to 2.05
percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 43.4 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 43.7 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.1. percent
of the notes, compared with an average of 11.3 percent at the
last 10 auctions.  $99 Billion  Five-year notes lost 0.2 percent this year, compared to the
the 0.8 percent loss for the broader Treasury market, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction is the second of three note sales totaling
$99 billion this week. The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year
notes yesterday and will auction $29 billion of seven-year
securities tomorrow.  At 2 p.m., the central bank plans for the first time to
release forecasts from FOMC participants for the main  interest
rate , and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke plans to hold a press
conference at 2:15 p.m.  The FOMC left its target for overnight loans between banks
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent last month and reiterated
that economic conditions may warrant “exceptionally low” rates
at least through mid-2013. The central bank is forecast to keep
the key rate unchanged today, a Bloomberg survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
