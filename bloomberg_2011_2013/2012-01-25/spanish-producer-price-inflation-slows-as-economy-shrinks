Spanish  producer-price inflation 
slowed for a third month in December as the economy contracted.  Prices (SPROYOY)  of goods leaving factories, mines and refineries
rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 6.3
percent in November, the  National Statistics Institute  in  Madrid 
said today, matching the median forecast of five analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Prices fell 0.1 percent on the month.  Spainâ€™s economy  contracted in the fourth quarter and may
shrink 1.5 percent this year, the Bank of  Spain  estimated on
Jan. 23. Crude oil prices rose 8 percent in the 12 months to the
end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
