Japan ’s Finance Ministry lowered its
evaluation of the country’s regional economies for the first
time in nine months as the yen’s advance to a postwar high
against the dollar weighed on growth.  The economies “are in a severe state, though they are
improving at a moderate pace,” the ministry said in a quarterly
report released today in Tokyo. It downgraded its assessment for
five of 11 areas it tracks including Tokai, home of  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  It maintained its view in five and became more optimistic
in its evaluation of Okinawa, the nation’s southernmost island.  The yen’s appreciation has been one factor in causing
regional economies to slow to a “standstill,” Finance Minister
 Jun Azumi  said at the meeting of the ministry’s regional bureau
chiefs in Tokyo today. Japan’s currency rose to a postwar high
of 75.35 in October, an appreciation that, coupled with weaker
demand, caused Japan to post its first annual trade deficit in
31 years in 2011.  As for the outlook, the ministry said foreign exchange
rates and overseas economies may threaten regional economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
