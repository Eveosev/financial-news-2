Misbah-ul-Haq and Asad Shafiq
combined for 100 runs to lead  Pakistan  to 256-7 at the end of
the first day of the second cricket Test with England in Abu
Dhabi.  Misbah, not out on 83, and Shafiq, who was out leg-before-
wicket on 58, settled Pakistan after it fell to 103-4 as
Englandâ€™s Stuart Broad took the wickets of Azhar Ali and Younis
Khan. Broad was 3-47 after trapping Adnan Akmal lbw for 9.  Pakistan, which leads the series 1-0 after a 10-wicket win
in the opening match, won the toss and elected to bat. Saeed
Ajmal finished the day batting with Misbah, who was dropped on
30 by  James Anderson  off Monty Panesar.  Graeme Swann also had three wickets for England, while
Panesar bowled  Mohammad Hafeez  for 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
