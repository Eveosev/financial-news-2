Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said new European Union rules forcing governments with excessive
debt to reduce it to within an acceptable level have “elements
of flexibility” that may make the regime less of a burden.  The rule forces countries with debt over the EU limit of 60
percent of gross domestic product to cut that excess by 5
percent a year. Currently the nominal value of Italy’s debt over
that limit is almost 900 billion euros ($1.17 trillion), meaning
the government would have to achieve debt reduction of 45
billion euros a year.  The rules adopted unanimously by EU countries are a
“burdensome constraint,” Monti said in testimony in the
Italian Senate today in  Rome .  They also contain language “respecting temporary
guarantees and elements of flexibility that Italy’s previous
government had lobbied to be taken into account,” he said.  Monti, who has been in power since November, said his
government’s position on the rule was in “absolute continuity”
with the previous government of former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi .  Berlusconi and his finance minister,  Giulio Tremonti , had
pushed the EU to accept a broader definition of debt to include
private debt levels, which in Italy are among the EU’s lowest.
That would reduce Italy’s total debt level and make the rule
less onerous.  Monti said there are signs the debt turmoil is easing and
the “contours of a way out from the euro crisis are starting to
take shape.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
