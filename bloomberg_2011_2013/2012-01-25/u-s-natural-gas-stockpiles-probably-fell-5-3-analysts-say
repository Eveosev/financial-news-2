U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
declined more than the seasonal average last week as
temperatures fell in the Northeast, analysts estimated before a
government stockpile report tomorrow.  Inventories dropped 175 billion cubic feet, or 5.3 percent,
to 3.115 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Jan. 20, based on
the median of 16  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average stockpile change for the week is a decrease of
173 billion cubic feet, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for heat averaged 2 percent above normal in the U.S.
Northeast last week and 14 percent above normal in the
Northwest, according to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster
Weather Derivatives. The low in  New York  on Jan. 19 was 20
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 Celsius), 7 degrees below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “It was easily the highest demand of the season,” said
 Kyle Cooper , director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston,
who predicts stockpiles fell 185 billion cubic feet. “The
operators are going to try and get more gas out of storage when
there is higher demand.”  Gas has rallied 16 percent this week after  Chesapeake
Energy (CHK)  Corp. said it would cut production. The number of rigs
drilling for the fuel fell to the lowest level in two years in
the week ended Jan. 20, according to data compiled by Baker
Hughes Inc.  All of the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
stockpile decreases, with estimates ranging from 140 billion to
185 billion cubic feet. The weekly supply report from the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration is scheduled for
release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Natural gas for February delivery fell 32.7 cents, or 12
percent, to $2.343 per million British thermal units last week
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas today jumped 17.5
cents, or 6.9 percent, to settle at $2.729 per million Btu. Gas
fell to $2.231 Jan. 23, the lowest intraday price since February
2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
