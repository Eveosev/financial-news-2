New York’s  Metropolitan
Transportation Authority  may refinance as much as $6.7 billion
of debt this year, the most in a decade, to take advantage of
borrowing costs near the lowest in at least 20 years.  The first portion of the bonds eligible for refunding
become callable April 1, with the rest on Aug. 15, Patrick McCoy, finance director for the MTA, said today. The largest
U.S. transit agency refinanced $13.5 billion in 2002, when
yields fell to the lowest since the late 1960s.  “In the current market it works,” McCoy said today after
an agency board meeting. He declined to estimate the potential
savings, saying it would be premature.  The MTA is looking to cut costs after board members passed
a $12.7 billion budget last month that includes an $86 million
deficit. The agency operates Metro-North commuter rail; the Long
Island Rail Road;  New York City ’s subway and bus systems; and
some city bridges and tunnels.  The agency plans to refinance debt sold in 2002, when the
average rate on benchmark tax-exempts due in 10 years was 4.05
percent, compared with yesterday’s  1.98 percent  rate, according
to Bloomberg Fair Value Index. The 10-year rate fell to 1.91
percent on Jan. 19, the lowest since at least March 1991, when
the index begins.  An MTA revenue bond sold in 2002 and due November 2025
traded today with an average yield of 2.61 percent, 38 basis
points above an index of benchmark municipals due in 13 years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds are rated A2
by Moody’s Investors Service, the sixth-highest grade.  New Debt  McCoy said the agency will remarket $540 million of
Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority bonds next week through a
consortium of U.S. Bancorp and the two largest U.S. public
pensions, the  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  and
the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.  The agency will also sell as much as $1 billion in new debt
in the next six weeks, he said.  MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota, whose appointment by Governor
 Andrew Cuomo  was confirmed by the state Senate this month,
traveled to  Albany  yesterday to ask state officials to waive a
charge of $8.40 for every $1,000 of debt issued, he said in a
press briefing. That would save as much as $54 million over the
life of the bonds, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
