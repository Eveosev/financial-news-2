Lithuanian banksâ€™ loan portfolios
shrank for a third year in 2011 because of waning demand among
consumers to borrow, the central bank said.  Credit contracted 0.8 billion litai ($300 million), or 1.4
percent, the  Lietuvos Bankas  in the capital, Vilnius, said today
in an e-mailed statement. Loans shrank 3.2 billion litai in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
