Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian
Democratic bloc in parliament is seeking changes to benefit
pharmacies and drugmakers in Germany’s drug-pricing law, the
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing a position paper.  The  Christian Democrats  may also seek to reduce the number
of European Union member states used for comparison in price
negotiations, the newspaper reported in an e-mailed preview of
an article to be published tomorrow. Rebates that pharmacies
must pay to statutory insurers may be lowered, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
