OAO Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coal for steelmaking, gained in  New York  after Finam
Investment Holding LLC reiterated its “buy” rating on the
stock and the company reported a rise in coking-coal sales.  American depositary receipts  of the Moscow-based miner
added 5.6 percent to $11.47 in New York, advancing for the
second day this week and bringing this year’s gain to 35
percent. Mechel, which lost 71 percent in U.S. trading last
year, has gone from being the worst performer on the  Bloomberg
Russia-U.S. 14 index  of Russian stocks traded in the U.S. in
2011, to the best this year.  Moscow-based brokerage Finam cut their 12-month price
target for Mechel’s ADRs to $16.80 from $23.60 as the shares
have “already rallied and investors continue to be concerned
about the cash flow management abilities of the company,”
according to the report by analysts led by Vladimir Sergievskiy.  Mechel’s sales of coking-coal concentrate increased 9
percent to 12.5 million metric tons last year and steel
production rose 1 percent to 6.12 million tons, the Moscow-based
company said in a statement on Jan. 24.  The coal producer’s net debt climbed 29 percent to  $9
billion  in September, from the start of 2011, as the company
upgraded  steel mills  and developed the Elga coal field in east
Siberia, according to a Dec. 15 earnings statement. About $2.66
billion of Mechel debt matures this year, according to the
 presentation .  To contact the reporters on this story:
