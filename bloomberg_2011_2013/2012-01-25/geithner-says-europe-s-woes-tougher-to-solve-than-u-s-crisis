U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said  Europe  is “making some progress” in combating a
financial crisis that’s more difficult to solve than what the
U.S. faced in 2008.  “If you look back over the last three months or so, they
are starting to engender more confidence,” Geithner told
business executives today in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .
“They’re going to get their arms around this and contain it.”  Europe has a “much more difficult crisis to solve” than
the U.S. did, he said.  Geithner was speaking at an event held by the Charlotte
Chamber of Commerce. He visited the state to tour a Siemens AG
energy plant and promote investments in manufacturing and
technologies to create jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
