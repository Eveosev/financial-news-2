The following is the text from the
 Reserve Bank  of  New Zealand  after its interest rate decision:
The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR)
unchanged at 2.5 percent.
Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said: “Since the time of the
December Statement, financial  market sentiment  has improved
slightly, with increased liquidity in European financial markets.
However, the global economy remains fragile and risks to the
outlook remain.
“World prices for New Zealand’s export commodities have remained
elevated but the recent appreciation of the  New Zealand dollar 
is reducing exporters’ returns. The European debt crisis has
also increased the cost of international funding, which will
likely pressure funding costs for New Zealand banks over the
coming year.
“In the domestic economy we continue to see modest growth. Over
recent months there have been signs of a limited recovery in
household spending and the housing market. Further ahead,
repairs and reconstruction in Canterbury will also provide a
significant boost for an extended period, though there may be
further delays resulting from the aftershocks.
“Reassuringly, inflation pressures have remained well contained.
Inflation has declined and now sits below 2 percent.
“Given ongoing uncertainty around global conditions and the
moderate pace of domestic demand, it remains prudent to keep the
OCR on hold at 2.5 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
