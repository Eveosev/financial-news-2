UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
offered to buy back as much as 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) of
Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds as part of its plan to boost capital.  “The purpose of the invitation is to support UniCredit’s
strategy for optimizing its  capital structure ,” the Milan-based
lender said in a statement today. The buyback “will generate
profits and thereby increase core  Tier 1 capital ,” it said.  Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  is raising money
to plug a capital shortfall and comply with European Banking
Authority targets. UniCredit, which is also selling 7.5 billion
euros of new shares, will post a capital gain of 490 million
euros if the maximum is paid out on the bond repurchases,
according to the bank’s prospectus.  “It’s another step to recapitalize itself,” analysts at
Banca Akros wrote in a note. “We were expecting such moves by
the Italian banks to optimize their capital positions.”  UniCredit rose 4.8 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 3.80 euros in
Milan trading today, valuing the company at 22 billion euros.  The holders of 10 bonds, who have until Feb. 3 to accept
the cash offer, will receive 50 percent to 87 percent of the
face value, depending on the securities. The purchase involves
4.3 billion euros of euro-denominated bonds and 1.1 billion
pounds ($1.7 billion) of sterling securities, the bank said.  UniCredit estimates its core Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of
financial strength, will improve by as much as 10.9 basis points
if the offer is fully subscribed, according to the prospectus
with the terms of the purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
