lender by profit, said 2011 profit increased 0.3 percent from
the previous year on a growth in lending.  Net income rose to $331.5 million, the Beirut-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement.  The results “confirm Blom Bank’s strong and balanced
performance at a time of political tensions and disturbances in
the region, coinciding with a debt crises and economic slowdown
at the global level,” the bank said in the statement.  A revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad broke in
March amid popular movements that toppled leaders in Tunisia,
Egypt and Libya, while forcing Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh to agree to cede power. The Beirut-based bank operates
branches outside Lebanon including in Syria and  Egypt .  Total assets increased 3.7 percent to $23.2 billion.
Deposits rose 3.5 percent to $20.3 billion and loans advanced 8
percent to $5.6 billion, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
