Californians, including a majority
of Republicans, favor Governor  Jerry Brown ’s proposal to raise
taxes to help close a $9.2 billion deficit, a new poll shows.  More than two-thirds, or 72 percent, of those surveyed
backed the Democrat’s proposed November ballot initiative that
would raise sales and income taxes, according to the nonpartisan
Public Policy Institute of  California  poll released yesterday.  The increases would yield $6.9 billion for fiscal 2012,
letting the state balance its budget without cutting $4.8
billion from public schools, Brown, 73, has said. Almost all the
added revenue, 89 percent, would  go  to primary and secondary
schools, with the rest slated for community colleges. His plan
would limit income-tax increases to individuals or couples
making $250,000 or $500,000 a year or more, respectively.  “There is a high level of support for raising revenues
when it comes to funding schools,”  Mark Baldassare , the
president of the San Francisco-based institute, said by
telephone. “The fact that the governor has tied this to raising
revenues for schools may account for a lot of the support.”  Brown’s plan calls for a four-year increase in sales taxes
to 7.75 percent from 7.25 percent, while the boost in tax rates
for higher-income earners would extend over five years.  Proposed Tax Increases  Individuals making $250,000 to $300,000 annually would pay
10.3 percent in income taxes, up from 9.3 percent. For those
earning $300,000 to $500,000, the rate would be 10.8 percent.
Single filers with income above $500,000 would pay 11.3 percent.  Those earning $1 million or more would pay 12.3 percent, up
from 10.3 percent. A 2004 ballot measure earmarks the current
extra 1 percentage point for mental-health services.  Brown’s overall proposal was favored by 85 percent of
Democrats, 65 percent of independents and 53 percent of
Republicans, according to the survey. Pollsters questioned 2,002
adults, including 894 likely voters, by telephone Jan. 10-17 and
the results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4
percentage points for the larger group.  More than two-thirds of likely voters, 68 percent,
supported raising taxes for high-income residents, while 64
percent opposed sales-levy increases, according to the poll. The
margin of error for that group was 4.2 percentage points.  Many voters remain hostile to tax increases and believe the
state could maintain essential government services without them,
Baldassare said.  Ephemeral Support  Support for tax increases always melts away on election
day, said  Jon Coupal , the Sacramento-based executive director of
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. The state’s most-recent
tax proposal to go before voters, Proposition 1A in 2009, was
leading in polls five weeks before the election mustered only 35
percent support and failed to pass, he said by e-mail.  “These polls are bogus,” said Coupal, whose organization
was named for the author of California’s tax-limiting
Proposition 13.  Brown’s tax proposals, which haven’t yet qualified for the
ballot, received $1.4 million in funding as of Jan. 21,
according to campaign-finance filings. A building-trades union,
a hospital trade group, an insurer,  Indian tribes  and  Occidental
Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  were the major backers.  “We’re encouraged by the support levels,” Brown’s
political adviser, Steve Glazer, said by e-mail yesterday.
“However, it won’t change our intent to wage a vigorous
campaign to urge public support for difficult but necessary
budget cuts and temporary taxes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
