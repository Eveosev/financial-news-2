Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said he would remain in politics even if Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  loses a March 4 vote to return to the Kremlin and isn’t
able to fulfill a pledge to make Medvedev his premier.  “I don’t know what will happen in May -- there are a whole
number of possibilities,” Medvedev said today in a meeting with
students in Moscow. “But I can say this with absolute
certainty: I won’t leave politics.”  Medvedev said he chose not to seek a second term as
president because Putin had a better chance of being elected.
“I’ll remind you that I’m just 46 years old. That’s not such a
serious age to prevent me from further political battles,”
Medvedev said, adding that he may eventually run for president
again.  Putin in September announced plans to return to the
presidency after four years as prime minister, swapping jobs
with protégé Medvedev. The Russian premier, 59, has faced the
biggest protests since taking over from  Boris Yeltsin  as
president on Dec. 31, 1999, with demonstrators taking to the
streets of Moscow and other cities over alleged fraud at
parliamentary elections last month.  Medvedev said some of the protestors who rallied in the
Russian capital may have wanted him to run for a second term.  To contact the reporters on this story:
