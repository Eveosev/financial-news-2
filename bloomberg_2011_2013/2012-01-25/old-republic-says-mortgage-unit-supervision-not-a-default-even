Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) ,
the Chicago-based insurer, said increased oversight of its
Republic Mortgage Insurance Co. unit by a North Carolina
regulator isn’t considered a default.  “Supervision, unlike receivership, does not constitute an
event of default by RMIC or its parent holding company with
regard to any of their respective debt obligations,” Old
Republic said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
