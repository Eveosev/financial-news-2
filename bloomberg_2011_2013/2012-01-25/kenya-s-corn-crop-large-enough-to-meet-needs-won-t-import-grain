Kenya ’s corn harvest is sufficient
to meet national demand and the country won’t import the grain
this year, according to the agriculture ministry.  “We expect 2.34 million tons by the end of the harvest
period in February and we have no plan to import corn,” said
Romano Kiome, permanent secretary for the ministry. “We expect
higher production during the long-rains season of March-May.”  Annual demand is 3.24 million metric tons, Kiome said today
in Nairobi. Kenya has two rainy seasons, the long-rains from
March to May and short-rains from September to November. The
government plans to raise its strategic grain reserve to 360,000
tons, Kiome said, compared with about 234,000 tons currently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
