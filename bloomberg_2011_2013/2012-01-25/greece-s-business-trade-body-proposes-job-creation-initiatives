The Hellenic Federation of
Enterprises proposed that minimum salaries under the national
wage agreement should be frozen until the yearend and automatic
pay increases reviewed.  This year will be even more difficult than previous ones
and the room for companies to cut costs is exhausted, the
Athens-based body said in an e-mailed statement today before
talks with GSEE,  Greece ’s largest private-sector union.  Greece’s social partners should commit the government to
creating jobs by reducing non-wage costs without raising taxes,
cutting company charges for employees for each new job created
and removing obstacles to employee profit sharing, the
federation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
