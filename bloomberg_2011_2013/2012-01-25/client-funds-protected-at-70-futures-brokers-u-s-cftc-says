Customer funds are properly
segregated at 70 futures brokers, the U.S.  Commodity Futures
Trading Commission  said in announcing results of reviews that
began last year after MF Global Holdings Ltd. collapsed and as
much as $1.2 billion in client money went missing.  The review is a “snapshot” of the industry’s compliance
with regulations and didn’t involve a “lengthy examination” of
the brokers, according to a statement from the CFTC. The review
relied on brokers’ records and didn’t involve regulatory
officials independently confirming balances of customer funds at
other entities. The agency said the review wasn’t intended to
serve as an industry audit.  The review was conducted by the CFTC,  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and
the  National Futures Association , the Chicago-based self-
regulatory organization for the futures industry.  The CFTC,  Securities and Exchange Commission  and  Justice
Department  are investigating the collapse of MF Global. Jon S. Corzine, former chairman and chief executive officer of MF
Global, told congressional lawmakers last month that he had no
intent to misuse customer money and doesn’t know where it went.  To contact the reporter on this story:
