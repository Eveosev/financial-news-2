The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:49 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.2 percent to 13,572.65, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.2 percent to 1,601.46.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
Colombia’s largest airline, rose 3.5 percent to 3,855 pesos, a
two-month high. The company gained for a second day after saying
it had 1.9 million passengers in December, a 12 percent gain
from a year ago, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Banco Davivienda SA (PFDVVND)  (PFDAVVND CB), Colombia’s third-biggest
bank, fell 0.1 percent to 20,400 pesos. HSBC Holdings Plc said
yesterday it will sell banking operations in  Costa Rica ,  El
Salvador  and  Honduras  to Davivienda for $801 million in cash.  Davivienda may be “chasing” competitors Bancolombia SA
and Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores into a region where
“economies are small and not exactly growing at a prolific
rate,” according to an e-mailed note from Celfin Capital today.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA  (BVC CB), the operator of
 Colombia ’s main stock exchange, rose 1 percent to 29 pesos.  The shares have gained 9 percent since Jan. 19, the day
before the company said in a regulatory filing that profit rose
19 percent in 2011 from the year before to 28.5 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
