Vitro SAB said an arbitrator ordered
to pay as much as $124.1 million to several investment funds in
a case against some of its U.S. units, the company said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The U.S. arbitrator’s order will not have a significant
impact on Vitro since the glassmaker doesn’t have “relevant
assets in the  United States ,” Vitro said in the statement. The
case against the company is under review in a New York state
court.  Vitro, a Mexican glassmaker that defaulted on $1.5 billion
of bonds, disagrees with the decision of the U.S arbitrator and
it will proceed to appeal it, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
