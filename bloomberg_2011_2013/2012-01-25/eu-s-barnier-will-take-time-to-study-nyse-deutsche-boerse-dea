European Union financial
services commissioner  Michel Barnier  “will take the necessary
personal time” to review plans by  NYSE Euronext (NRX)  and  Deutsche
Boerse AG (DB1)  to merge before giving his opinion on the deal.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
is expected to decide early next month whether to back a
proposal from the EU’s antitrust chief,  Joaquin Almunia , to
block the deal.  “The merger file is a major issue for the European
financial industry,”  Chantal Hughes , Barnier’s spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail. Barnier “has just completed a long official
visit to China, Japan and  London ” and “wishes to take the
necessary personal time before giving his opinion,” she said.
“He will not be making any public comment on this file.”  The EU executive is led by 27 commissioners drawn from each
of the bloc’s member states. They must jointly approve EU
decisions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
