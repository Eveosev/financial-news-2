NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s biggest
wireless carrier, said it restored services in  Tokyo  after
disruption for more than four hours, affecting as many as 2.52
million users.  Subscribers in the area experienced problems in some voice
and data communication from 8:26 a.m. to 1:08 p.m., the Tokyo-
based company said in a statement today. An increase in the use
of NTT DoCoMo’s switching equipment caused the problem, the
carrier said.  NTT DoCoMo spokesman Takuya Ori wasn’t immediately able to
comment on improvement plans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
