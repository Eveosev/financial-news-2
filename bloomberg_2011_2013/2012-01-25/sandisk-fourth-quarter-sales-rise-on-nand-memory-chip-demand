SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  dropped the most in
almost 21 months after the biggest maker of flash-memory cards
gave a sales forecast that fell short of estimates, citing lower
prices for chips that store data in mobile phones.  SanDisk fell 10 percent to $46.95 at 9:32 a.m.  New York 
time, for the biggest intraday decline since May 7, 2010. The
stock fell 1.3 percent last year.  The company said it’s putting the expansion of a plant on
hold as prices fall for so-called Nand flash-memory chips, used
to store information in portable devices such as Apple Inc.’s
iPhone. Production at suppliers like SanDisk and Samsung
Electronics Co. has gotten ahead of demand, according to  Daniel Berenbaum , an analyst at MKM Partners LP in New York.  Price declines accelerated in the latter part of the fourth
quarter, Chief Financial Officer Judy Bruner said on a
conference call yesterday. That, along with lower orders from
some mobile-phone customers, will hurt sales in the first
quarter, she said.  Sales in the current period will be $1.3 billion to $1.35
billion, Bruner said. Milpitas, California-based SanDisk was
projected to have sales of $1.46 billion, the average estimate
of analysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  2012 Forecast  For the full year, sales will be $6.2 billion to $6.6
billion, Bruner said. Analysts on average predicted annual sales
of $6.64 billion.  “We expect the majority of our 2012 year-over-year revenue
growth to be in the second half as overall demand improves,”
Bruner said on the call. The industry’s ability to lower costs
of production through the introduction of new technology is
decreasing, she said.  For the fourth quarter, sales rose 19 percent to $1.58
billion, the company said in a statement. Net income fell to
$281.2 million, or $1.14 a share, from $485.5 million, or $2.01
a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated earnings
of $1.13 a share on sales of $1.58 billion.  Under Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra, SanDisk has
been trying to win more sales from makers of mobile phones and
lessen its reliance on revenue from consumer flash drives and
memory cards.  To contact the reporters on this story:
