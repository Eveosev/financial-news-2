New York City  attracted a record
50.5 million visitors last year, 300,000 more than officials
predicted in December, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said today.  Visitors increased by 3.5 percent in 2011,  NYC & Co. , the
city’s marketing and tourism office, said in a statement.
Tourists injected $32 billion into the economy, up from $31.5
billion in 2010, the most of any U.S. travel destination, the
agency said. Hotel occupancy averaged 85 percent.  Tourism has been the focus of a Bloomberg administration
marketing effort aimed at diversifying the economy at a time
when city officials expect Wall Street revenue to decline. The
industry employs more than 320,000, making it New York’s fifth
biggest.  “The city’s diverse offerings, events and activities
combined with a high quality of life continue to make New York
City the world’s premier destination for both leisure and
business travelers,” Bloomberg said in a statement.  The record visitations occurred ahead of Bloomberg’s goal,
set in 2006, to attract 50 million tourists by 2015, which he
later accelerated to 2012.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
