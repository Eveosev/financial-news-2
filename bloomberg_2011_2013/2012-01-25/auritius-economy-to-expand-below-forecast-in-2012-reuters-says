Mauritiusâ€™s economy will probably
expand by less than the forecast of 4 percent in 2012 because of
the debt crisis in its main European markets, Reuters reported,
citing finance minister Xavier Luc Duval.  The government may give a new estimate for this year, the
news agency cited Duval as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
