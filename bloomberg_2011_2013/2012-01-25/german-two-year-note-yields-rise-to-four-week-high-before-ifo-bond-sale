German two-year note yields touched
the highest in more than four weeks before data that economists
said will show business confidence climbed to a five-month high,
damping demand for the safest government debt.  The yield gap between two- and 30-year securities was
within four basis points of the widest since Dec. 2 as  Germany 
prepared to auction as much as 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) of
3.25 percent July 2042 securities. Bondholders hope to find
“common ground” on a Greek debt swap after finance ministers
pushed for greater concessions,  Charles Dallara , managing
director of the Institute of International Finance, said
yesterday.  “The Ifo survey is likely to dampen recession fears
further today which may act to keep bunds on the backfoot,”
Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in
Dusseldorf, wrote in an e-mailed research note. “However, we do
not foresee such causing a problem in terms of the other big
event today, the 30-year bund tap.”  Germany’s two-year note yield rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 0.24 percent at 8:50 a.m. London time,
after climbing to 0.25 percent, the highest since Dec. 23. The
0.25 percent note due in December 2013 fell 0.03, or 30 euro
cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.025.  The 30-year bond yield advanced one basis point to 2.64
percent, with the  spread  over two-year notes at 241 basis
points, after reaching 245 basis points yesterday.  Business Climate  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of executives, rose for a third month to 107.6 in January
from 107.2 in December, according to the  median estimate  of 42
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Greek two-year notes swung between gains and losses, with
the October 2022 benchmark yield little changed at 33.37
percent. The price was 21.265 percent of face value.  In a speech at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Billionaire  George Soros  will say it is “more likely than not”
that  Greece  will formally default in 2012,  Newsweek Magazine 
reported on Jan. 23, citing an interview in  New York .  Italian two-year notes declined, pushing the yield on the
securities up 15 basis points to 3.79 percent. Italy’s 10-year
yield was eight basis points higher at 6.25 percent.  Bunds have handed investors a loss of 1 percent this year,
after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. French  government bonds  have dropped 0.3 percent and
Greek debt has returned 0.9 percent in 2012, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
