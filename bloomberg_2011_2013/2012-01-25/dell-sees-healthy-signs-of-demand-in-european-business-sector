Dell Inc. (DELL) , the third-largest maker
of personal computers, is performing well in the market of
PCs for business customers in Europe, Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Dell  said.  “Our small-medium business sector in Europe is doing
pretty well and we’re seeing some healthy signs there,” Dell
said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Olivia Sterns at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland. “With
the right products and services, companies can grow even in
challenging times.”  The company missed third-quarter revenue estimates in
November after walking away from $2 billion in potential PC
sales to focus on more profitable technology. Dell, based in
Round Rock, Texas, is winnowing its line of consumer products
and focusing on small- and medium-size businesses as well as
government agencies, which account for more than half its sales.  “Certainly there are plenty of challenges in  Europe  and
the U.S. to work through, but to stay competitive businesses and
industries need to have the latest tools,” Dell said. “I feel
very good about our strategy to continue to grow earnings even
in a somewhat challenging environment.”  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global
growth yesterday and warned that the European debt crisis
threatens to derail the world economy. The euro area may enter a
“mild recession” in 2012 as it shrinks 0.5 percent, according
to the IMF.  To contact the reporters on this story:
