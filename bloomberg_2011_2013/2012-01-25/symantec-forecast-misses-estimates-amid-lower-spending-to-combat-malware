Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , the biggest maker of
computer security software, forecast lower sales and profit than
analysts predicted, evidence that a slump in personal computer
buying is crimping demand for programs to repel malware attacks.  Profit excluding certain items will be 41 cents to 42 cents
a share in the fiscal fourth quarter,  Mountain View , California-
based Symantec said today in a statement. Sales in the current
period will rise to $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion. That fell
short of 43 cents in profit and sales of $1.75 billion, the
average estimates in a Bloomberg  survey  of analysts. The company
also approved $1 billion in share repurchases.  Results were hurt as sluggish personal-computer buying
throttled growth in Symantec’s consumer division, while Europe’s
economic malaise prompted companies to rein in information
technology budgets.  “They continue to have headwinds in the consumer, but I
think they’re doing well relative to what’s happening out
there,” said  Daniel Ives , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets &
Co. in  New York . “They’re a clear leader in the space, they
have strong  brand recognition , and obviously PC weakness does
affect them, but they don’t have as high highs or as low lows as
the PC industry.”  Net income in the December quarter almost doubled to $240
million, or 32 cents a share, from $132 million, or 17 cents, a
year earlier. Sales rose 6.9 percent to $1.72 billion.  Awaiting Windows  PC industry woes clipped the sale of antivirus software to
consumers. Revenue in the consumer division rose 5 percent, a
slowdown from 11 percent in each of the two previous quarters.  Symantec Chief Executive  Enrique Salem  said on a conference
call that he doesn’t expect a turnaround in PC shipments until
Microsoft Corp. introduces its new Windows 8 operating system.
That may happen this year.  Shares were little changed after the results were released.
Symantec had risen 1.2 percent to $17.07 at the close in New
York. The stock has declined 4.2 percent in the past 12 months.  Hackers are becoming more daring, moving from the digital
to the physical world in an attack on  Iran’s nuclear program  in
2010. Government agencies and companies also are being plundered
by espionage attacks using so-called “spear phishing” e-mails,
which elicit information that can be used against a target.  The proliferation of sophisticated hacking attacks fuels
the need for defenses, Salem said in an interview.  “It’s pretty clear there continues to be a lot of demand
for our products,” he said. The company had “strong” bookings
across  Europe , he said later on a conference call.  No Immunity  Symantec isn’t always a passive observer. The company said
this month that hackers stole source code to some of its own
products. Because the software was years old, security experts
said the source code was likely of limited use. Still, it showed
that even security stalwarts aren’t immune to malfeasance.  Worldwide spending on security software will rise 10
percent this year to $20.7 billion, according to Gartner Inc.
Meanwhile, spending by large organizations on software overall
is expected to rise 6 percent to $284.9 billion, Gartner said.  That’s good news for Symantec, which makes most of its
money selling to businesses and governments. Symantec commands
about a fifth of the worldwide market for security software,
according to Gartner. Symantec is followed by McAfee, which was
 acquired  by  Intel Corp. (INTC)  last year for $6.6 billion.  Symantec also makes storage software, a significant part of
its business and a market in which Symantec squares off against
the likes of  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , International Business
Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
