Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the “basic elements” of financial regulatory
reform will be completed by the end of this year.  Geithner, speaking at an event held by the Charlotte
Chamber of Commerce, said the Obama administration is “a little
behind” where it expected to be with the Dodd-Frank financial
regulations because it wants to be sure the rules are
implemented correctly.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
