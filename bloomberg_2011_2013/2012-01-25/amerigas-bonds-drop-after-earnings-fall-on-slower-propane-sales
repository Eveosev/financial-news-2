its quarterly earnings declined 43 percent.  The company’s $1 billion of 7 percent notes due in May 2022

to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. AmeriGas’s stock fell 0.4 percent
to $43.46 at 11:07 a.m.  AmeriGas earned $42.5 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31,
down from $74.9 million in the similar period of 2010, as it
sold less propane due to warmer weather, the  King of Prussia ,
Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement today. It issued
$1.55 billion of eight- and 10-year notes this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
