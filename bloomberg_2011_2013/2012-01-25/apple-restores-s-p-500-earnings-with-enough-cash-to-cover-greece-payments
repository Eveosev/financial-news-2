Call it the iEconomy.  With its report yesterday,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the Cupertino,
California-based iPhone maker, single-handedly erased a drop in
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index earnings for the December quarter,
turning a 4.2 percent decline into a 4.4 percent gain. Apple’s
116 percent profit growth helped push its total cash to $97.6
billion -- enough to cover  Greece ’s debt payments due in the
next two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While results at companies from Google Inc. to Citigroup
Inc. have trailed analyst estimates and Alcoa Inc. posted a
loss, the world’s largest technology company beat revenue
forecasts by $7.3 billion, the most ever. The performance came
during a quarter in which U.S. unemployment averaged 8.7 percent
and about 12.7 million Americans were looking for work.  “They can probably bail out Greece,” Ian Ainsworth, a
Toronto-based  money manager  at Mackenzie Financial Corp., said
in a telephone interview. His firm owns Apple shares and manages
$60.9 billion. “It just puts the power of the company in
perspective with near $100 billion in cash on the balance sheet
and generating that kind of free  cash flow . It’s hard to
conceive of a company with that kind of power.”  Net income more than doubled to $13.1 billion as Apple sold
37 million iPhones and posted $46.3 billion in sales. The total
ranks among the highest quarterly profits on record. MediaOne
Group Inc., acquired by AT&T Inc. in 2000, earned $26.6 billion
in the second quarter of 1998. Ford Motor Co. earned $17.6
billion in the first three months of 1998. Apple’s earnings were
about 11 times the size of Zambia’s gross domestic product.  Earnings Season  The report may salvage a fourth-quarter earnings season
that was in danger of being the first since 2009 in which
profits declined from a year ago. Analysts project income for
 S&P 500  companies climbed 3.4 percent in the period, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple shares  rose  6.2 percent to $446.66 today, gaining the
most in a day since May 10, 2010. The stock is trading at its
highest price ever, while the  S&P 500  remains 15 percent below
the record reached in October 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The company’s almost $100 billion in  cash  and equivalents
is larger than the combined market value of Boeing Co., Alcoa
Inc. and Travelers Cos. -- three of the  30 Dow Jones Industrial
Average companies . That’s enough money to cover Greece’s 48.2
billion euros ($62.56 billion) due in 2012 and 27.9 billion
euros due next year, depending on the  exchange rate . The country
is facing a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.  New Zealand   For calendar 2011, Apple’s sales rose to $127.8 billion,
bigger than the size of New Zealand’s economy, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. More iPhones were sold each day in the
quarter ending Dec. 31 than babies were born in the world,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the  United Nations .  Apple’s $97.6 billion in cash and equivalents is enough for
the company to buy 2,000 tons of gold at current prices, the
weight of 10 blue whales.  “One word: impressive,” Thomas Garcia, head of equity
trading at  Santa Fe , New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment
Management Inc., which oversees about $75 billion, said in an e-
mail. “ Steve Jobs  has a smile on his face wherever he is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
