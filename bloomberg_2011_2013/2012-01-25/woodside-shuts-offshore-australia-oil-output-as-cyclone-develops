Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  shut
production at its Vincent oil field because of a cyclone
developing off the coast of Australia.  “In response to the tropical low, Woodside has shut in
production from the Vincent oil field off the North West Cape,”
Laura Lunt, a Woodside spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. The
site produced more than 40,000 barrels a day of oil during the
fourth quarter, according to Woodside’s most recent production
report on its website.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said earlier today that a
tropical low off the north-west coast of Australia may develop
into a cyclone and strengthen to a Category 2 storm by Jan. 26.
“The low is likely to develop into a tropical cyclone overnight
as it slows and begins to move towards the south or southeast,
bringing it closer to the coast,” the bureau said on its
website.  Woodside also operates the North West Shelf oil and gas
production facilities. Other offshore fields in the area include
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Pyrenees and  Apache Corp. (APA) ’s  Van Gogh . BHP is
“monitoring the situation for extreme weather conditions,”
said spokesman Antonios Papaspiropoulos by phone today. Apache
did not respond to e-mail and phone calls requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
