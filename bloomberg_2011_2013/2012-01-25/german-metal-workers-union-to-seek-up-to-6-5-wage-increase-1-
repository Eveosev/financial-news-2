Germany ’s metal workers may seek as
much as 6.5 percent in pay increases in the coming round of wage
negotiations, labor union  IG Metall ’s branch for the state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg said.  “In the coming weeks, we will see golden balance sheets
and record earnings left and right,” Joerg Hofmann, who heads
the unions operations in the southern German state, said in an
e-mailed statement today. “Workers are demanding no more than
their fair share of what has been generated though their work.”  While the demands coincide with weaker economic  growth 
caused by the European debt crisis, workers in the continent’s
biggest economy are targeting a noticeable raise after the union
had put  job security  for its 2.25 million members above pay in
the past agreement in 2010, partly by extending the use of
short-term work.  IG Metall  will decide on the final wage demands on Feb. 23,
and warning strikes will be possible after April 28, according
to the statement. Apart from higher wages, the union said it
seeks to curb the use of subcontracted employees, and push for
permanent jobs for apprentices.  The unions claim is “economically not justifiable,”
Rainer Dulger, who heads the Suedwestmetall employers’ group for
the region, said in a separate statement, as any negotiation
must be guided by “future economic performance.”  IG Metall represents 750,000 workers in Baden-Wuerttemberg,
the state which is home to some on the countries largest
employers, including  Daimler AG (DAI) , Robert Bosch GmbH, and  Porsche
Automobil Holding SE. (PAH3)   To contact the reporter on this story:
