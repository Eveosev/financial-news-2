Azabache Energy Inc. (AZA) , a Canadian oil
and natural-gas developer, surged to its highest level in more
than three years as the company prepares to drill exploration
wells.  The shares rose 21 percent to C$1.04 at the close in
Toronto, the highest since June 30, 2008.  Azabache Energy, based in Calgary, is part-owner of leases
on properties in  Argentina  and  Colombia  and will begin
exploration drilling this year, said Chairman Glenn Van Doorne
said in an interview today. The company will spend C$15 million
($14.8 million) to drill this year and expects the Colombian
properties to yield 300 barrels a day of oil and the leases in
Argentina to produces 2 million cubic feet of gas daily, he
said.  Azabache Energy may have as much as 4.8 billion barrels of
oil equivalent, Kevin Shaw, a Calgary-based analyst at Casimir
Capital Ltd., said.  “Success on any of the exploration wells are considered to
be high-impact events likely to drive the stock price
significantly higher,” Shaw wrote in a Jan. 10 note, when he
began coverage of the company with a “speculative buy” rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
