Stryker Corp. (SYK) , a maker of artificial
hips and knees, climbed 4 percent after fourth-quarter profit
rose on higher sales of medical and neurotechnology products.  Stryker  gained  $2.12 to $55.06 at 4:11 p.m. in New York,
the biggest increase in five weeks. The shares of the Kalamazoo,
Michigan-based company fell 5.7 percent in the past 12 months.  Fourth-quarter  earnings  increased 36 percent to $401
million, or $1.05 a share, as sales of medical and surgical
products, including hospital beds, rose 11 percent and revenue
from neurotechnology and spine products surged 47 percent, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Stryker reiterated that
earnings excluding one-time items are forecast to grow at
“double-digit levels” in 2012, without being more specific.
Sales may climb as much as 6.5 percent on a constant currency
basis, Stryker said.  “We believe that 2012 guidance is conservative,” wrote
Michael Matson, an analyst with Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in
 New York , in a note to investors today. Stryker also expects to
offset a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax that is scheduled
to take effect next year, he said. “We’re skeptical but if this
proves true then 2013 earnings per share growth should
significantly outpace peers,” Matson wrote.  Stryker acquired Boston Scientific Corp.’s neurovascular
business on Jan. 3, 2011, bolstering its range of products to
treat aneurysms, clear clogged arteries in the brain and prevent
strokes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
