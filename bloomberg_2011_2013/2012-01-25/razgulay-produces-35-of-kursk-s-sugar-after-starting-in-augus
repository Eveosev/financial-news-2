OAO Razgulay Group (GRAZ) , the Russian
sugar refiner that began processing sugar beets in Kursk region
in August, is producing 35 percent of the district’s total
output, the company said today in a statement.  Razgulay has produced 153,740 metric tons of the sweetener
from beets in the region over more than 150 days, which already
exceeds the 58 days of refining in the previous season, when a
drought ravaged crops, it said.  The company operates 10 sugar refineries in  Russia , capable
of processing 4 million tons of beets and 1.4 million tons of
raw sugar a year. Three are in Kursk in the country’s southwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
