The  Los Angeles Lakers  regained the
title of most valuable team in the  National Basketball
Association  a year after being replaced in that spot by the  New
York Knicks , Forbes magazine said.  A 20-year television accord with Time Warner Cable helped
the Lakers surge 40 percent in value to $900 million in 2011.
Beginning with the 2012-13 season, the deal is worth an average
of $200 million annually to the 16-time NBA champions, the
magazine reported.  The Knicks are worth $780 million, 19 percent more than
2010, after their first winning record in 10 years in 2010-11,
which helped the team sell all its season tickets for the first
time since the 2001-02 season, Forbes said.  New York , which
hiked ticket prices 49 percent this season to help pay for a
$850 million renovation of Madison Square Garden, has operating
income of $75 million, the most in the league.  Broadcast accords for teams including the  Boston Celtics 
and  Golden State Warriors , plus a new 10-year labor agreement
between players and owners, helped push the average value of the
leagueâ€™s teams to a record $393 million, a 6.5 percent rise over
the prior survey.  The gap between the richest teams and the rest is widening.
The top 15 franchises are worth $485 million on average, a 10
percent rise, while the value of the remaining 15 teams edged up
0.4 percent to $300 million. League revenue climbed 4.2 percent
to a record $4 billion, the magazine said.  The  Chicago Bulls  are the third-most-valuable franchise, at
$600 million, while the NBA champion Dallas Mavericks ($497
million, a 13 percent rise) and the Celtics ($482 million, a 7
percent increase) round out the top five.  To contact the reporter on this story:
