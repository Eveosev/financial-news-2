The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  climbed 0.4 percent to close at 661.51
at 4 p.m. in  New York , led by natural gas and precious metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices gained 0.6
percent to 1,597.396.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas climbed for a fourth day in New York, the
longest winning streak since November, on speculation a supply
glut may ease as Chesapeake Energy Corp., the second-largest
U.S. producer, cuts output.  Gas gained 6.9 percent, rallying 22 percent after dipping
to $2.231 per million British thermal units on Jan. 23, the
lowest intraday price since February 2002. Chesapeake said this
week it would “immediately curtail” production of 500 million
cubic feet a day as mild winter weather contributed to the
biggest gas surplus in more than two years.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas for February
delivery rose 17.5 cents to settle at $2.729 per million British
thermal units. The futures are down 8.7 percent this year.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed to a six-week high after the Federal Reserve
said it sees “exceptionally low”  interest rates  through at
least late 2014. Silver, platinum and palladium also advanced.  On the Comex, gold futures for April delivery climbed 2.1
percent to settle at $1,703 an ounce, the highest close for a
most-active contract since Dec. 9.  Silver futures for March delivery in New York jumped 3.6
percent to $33.121 an ounce. Earlier, prices touched $33.32, the
highest since Dec. 2.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery advanced
1.8 percent to $1,579.60 an ounce. Palladium futures for March
delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $693.35 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rose to a four-month high after  Federal
Reserve  officials said their benchmark U.S. interest rate will
stay low at least until late 2014, bolstering prospects for
metal demand.  The Fed extended its pledge to keep rates low at least
until the middle of 2013 as inflation remains tame. The dollar
erased earlier gains against a basket of major currencies,
increasing demand for raw materials as alternatives investments.  On the Comex, copper futures for March delivery rose 0.6
percent to settle at $3.8295 a pound, the highest settlement for
a most active contract since Sept. 16.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.3 percent to $8,384 a metric ton ($3.80 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also climbed in
London.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures rose to the highest in almost three weeks on
speculation that demand will increase for U.S. exports as
supplies decline in  Russia .  Russia’s grain shipments will have a “dramatic” slowdown
through June because the three major-exporting provinces have
shipped most of their supplies, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said. About 17.1 million bushels of U.S. wheat were
inspected for export in the week ended Jan. 19, 27 percent more
than a week earlier, the USDA said on Jan. 23.  On the  Chicago  Board of Trade, wheat futures for March
delivery rose 1.2 percent to settle at $6.4125 a bushel.
Earlier, the price touched $6.4975, the highest for a most-
active contract since Jan. 5.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to close
at $6.345 a bushel.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline surged to the highest level since September on
speculation that refinery closures and production unit shutdowns
will reduce inventories on the U.S. East Coast.  Futures rose as  Hess Corp. (HES)  said it may shut the fluid
catalytic cracker at its gasoline-making Port Reading refinery
in  New Jersey  for repairs. Two Pennsylvania refineries have
shut, as well as a refinery in the Virgin Islands that serves
the Eastern U.S.  On the Nymex, gasoline for February delivery rose 2.88
cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $2.8338 a gallon.  February-delivery heating oil fell 0.5 cent to settle at
$3.0192 a gallon on the exchange.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose after Federal Reserve officials said the U.S.
benchmark interest rate will stay low until at least 2014 to
bolster growth and cut unemployment, boosting fuel demand.  Futures advanced 0.5 percent as the  Federal Open Market
Committee  extended its previous pledge to keep rates low at
least until the middle of 2013. The Energy Department reported
that total fuel consumption increased 7.5 percent to 19.2
million barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 20.  On the Nymex, crude oil for March delivery rose 45 cents to
settle at $99.40 a barrel. Futures dropped to $97.53 early in
the session. Prices are up 15 percent from a year earlier.  Brent oil for March settlement declined 22 cents to end the
session at $109.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  LIVESTOCK  Hog prices rose for the second time this week on
speculation that demand for U.S. pork will climb. Cattle futures
settled unchanged after reaching a record high for the seventh
time this month.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for April
settlement rose 0.4 percent to close at 88.225 cents a pound.
Prices have climbed 4.7 percent this year and are 1.3 percent
higher than a year ago.  Cattle futures for April delivery closed unchanged at
$1.29175 a pound in Chicago after touching $1.29675, the highest
for the most-active contract since the commodity started trading
on the CME in 1964. Prices are up 16 percent in the past year.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Raw-sugar futures fell the most in almost two weeks in New
York as producers sold to capitalize on the recent rally. Coffee
dropped, while cocoa rose.  Global sugar supplies will outpace demand by 6 million
metric tons in the season started in October, according to
Rabobank International. Before today, the sweetener had climbed
6.8 percent in January.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 1.5 percent to settle at
24.51 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S., the biggest
drop since Jan. 12. This year, the sweetener has risen 5.2
percent, after plunging 27 percent in 2011.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery slid 1.5 percent
to close at $2.172 a pound in New York, extending this month’s
drop to 4.3 percent.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $2,422
a metric ton on ICE, the third consecutive increase. The
chocolate ingredient has surged 15 percent this year. Earlier
the price touched $2,456, the highest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 22.  In  London  futures trading, refined sugar fell, while cocoa
