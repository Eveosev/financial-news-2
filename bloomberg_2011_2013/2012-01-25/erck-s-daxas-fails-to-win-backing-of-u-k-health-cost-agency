(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show that Daxas
rights were returned to Takeda.)  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s Daxas
lung drug failed to win the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost
agency in final guidance on the treatment of severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  The drug, also known as roflumilast, is most likely to be
used in addition to triple therapy, but there wasn’t direct
clinical evidence to the product’s use in that way, the  National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  said in an e-mailed
statement. The agency repeated its recommendation to conduct a
trial of Daxas in combination with other commonly used
treatments to prove the drug offers an advantage.  Merck & Co . last month ended its agreement with  Japan ’s
Takeda to promote the drug in certain European countries and
 Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
