Ivory Coast growth is expected to
reach 8.9 percent this year and aims to attain 12 percent to 15
percent growth by 2020, after a 5 percent retraction in 2011,
the countryâ€™s Finance Minister Charles Koffi Diby said,
according to  Les Echos  in an interview to appear tomorrow.  Ivory Coast is planning to invest 629 billion CFA francs
($1.2 billion) as private investment begins to return, Diby
said, according to Les Echos. The country hopes its progress in
reforming the coffee and cocoa sectors will earn it
 International Monetary Fund  and World Bank authorization to
access new credits by May, Diby said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
