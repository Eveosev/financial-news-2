Greece ’s creditors won’t help the
country get a handle on its debt by taking losses on sovereign
bonds, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.  Greece’s debt load will be “unbearably high” even if
public creditors join investors in taking 50 percent writedowns
on the debt, the institute at the University of Kiel in northern
 Germany  said in a study published on its  website .  Creditors agreed with European leaders last year to take
losses on Greek debt and swap their notes for bonds with longer
maturities to help rescue the country. Euro area governments are
now seeking to fill a deeper-than-expected hole in Greece’s
finances by saddling investors with lower  interest rates  on
exchanged bonds.  The original declaration of intent by bondholders probably
won’t be implemented in full because of its voluntary nature and
“vague comments” on its realization, said the institute, known
as IfW in Germany. Greece will probably require bond losses of
more than 80 percent, which would move it “close to the region
of complete insolvency,” the institute said.  Portugal  will probably need the value of its debt to be
reduced by as much as half while Ireland,  Italy  and  Hungary 
won’t require losses on their sovereign bonds as long as they
can post “high” economic growth rates, according to the IfW.  The IfW is one of four institutes that provide twice-
yearly, joint assessments of the economic outlook for the German
government.  What follows is a table showing necessary sovereign-debt
losses of selected European countries, according to the IfW’s
model under 2 percent and 4 percent long-term gross domestic
product growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
