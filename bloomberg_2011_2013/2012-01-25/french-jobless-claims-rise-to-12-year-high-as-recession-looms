French jobless claims soared to the
highest in 12 years as companies such as  Peugeot Citroen SA (UG)  trim
payrolls to cope with a slowdown that some forecasts say will
turn into a recession.  The number of people actively looking for work at the end
of December rose by 29,700, or 1.0 percent, to 2,874,500, the
Labor Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
highest total since September 1999. In all of last year, the
number of jobless climbed 5.6 percent from a year earlier.  The French economy is probably already in recession, with
output shrinking in the last quarter and the current one, state
statistical institute Insee said last month.  Business (INSESYNT)  confidence
dropped to the lowest in almost two years this month as
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  looks for ways to cut labor costs and
reduce  France ’s budget deficit.  “The confidence shock and the banking crisis have had
clear consequences for the job market,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
