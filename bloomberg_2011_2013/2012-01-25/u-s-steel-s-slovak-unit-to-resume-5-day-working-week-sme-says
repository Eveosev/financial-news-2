The Slovak unit of  United States
Steel Corp. (X)  will resume a five-day working week from February as
orders have picked up,  Sme  reported, citing Jan Baca, a
spokesman for the Slovak plant.  The steelmaker’s factory in Kosice, eastern Slovakia, in
January began operating four days a week, ordering workers to
stay at home every Friday and receive 60 percent of salary, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
