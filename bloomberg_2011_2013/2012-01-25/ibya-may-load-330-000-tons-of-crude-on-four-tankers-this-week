Four tankers have been booked so far
to load 330,000 metric tons of crude oil in  Libya  this week,
according to data from Poten & Partners Inc.  The ships have been chartered to pick up the equivalent of
about 345,000 barrels a day, compared with 660,000 barrels a day
booked to load on six vessels last week, the New York-based
shipbroker’s figures show.  The absence of Libyan production helped crude traded in
London reach a 2011 high of $127.02 a barrel in April. The
benchmark Brent grade has since dropped 13 percent to $109.97.
The resumption of the nation’s supply has been followed by
 Iran ’s threat to block the  Strait of Hormuz , renewing concern
about global oil supply.  The following table shows weekly charters for crude cargoes
from Libya, according to Poten. Cargo size is expressed in
metric tons. Some cargoes are shipped under long-term freight
contracts and don’t appear in lists of vessel bookings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
