BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s Cofinoga credit
unit plans to cut 433 jobs, according to the CFDT labor union.  Most of the staff reductions will be at a site in Merignac,
 France , the CFDT said today in an e-mailed statement.  Cofinoga, jointly owned by Paris-based BNP Paribas and
Galeries Lafayette SA, aims for cost savings of 100 million
euros ($129 million), partly through job reductions, the company
said in a statement last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
