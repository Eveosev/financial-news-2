Sri Lanka ’s exports expanded in
November, rebounding from the worst decline since 2009 on demand
for garments, tea and machinery.  Overseas sales  increased 11.6 percent to $879.3 million
from a year earlier, after falling 4.9 percent in October, the
 Central Bank of Sri Lanka  said in a statement today. Imports
surged 78 percent to $1.98 billion, it said.  The monetary authority left  interest rates  unchanged on Jan.
11 for a 12th month, seeking to curb quickening inflation while
supporting the economy as  Europe ’s debt crisis restrains global
growth. Sri Lanka devalued its rupee by 3 percent in November to
aid exports by companies such as Ceylon Tea Services Plc.  Earnings from textiles and garment exports rose 28.5
percent to $347.6 million in November, the central bank said.
Agricultural shipments gained 1.1 percent to $184.3 million,
while the value of industrial exports rose 35 percent to $684.5
million.  Sri Lanka’s trade deficit widened to $1.1 billion in
November, compared with a deficit of $325 million a year earlier,
today’s report showed. Imports gained on costlier oil purchases.  Oil and some food imports are putting pressure on Sri
Lanka’s rupee, Treasury Secretary P.B. Jayasundera said in
 Colombo  today. The island is facing some balance of payments
pressure, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said Jan. 3,
adding that he sees resilience among exporters.  Exports make up about a fifth of the country’s $50 billion
economy. Europe accounts for about 35 percent of the Indian
Ocean island’s overseas sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
