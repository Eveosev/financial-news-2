U.S. stocks erased earlier losses
after the  Federal Reserve  said it sees “exceptionally low”
 interest rates  through at least late 2014.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,315.72 at 12:36 p.m. in  New York  after slipping as much as 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
