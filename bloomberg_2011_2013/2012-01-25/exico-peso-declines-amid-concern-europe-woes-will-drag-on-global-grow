Mexico ’s peso strengthened after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will keep the benchmark U.S. interest
rate low until at least late 2014, bolstering demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The peso rose 0.6 percent to 13.0190 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, from 13.0998 yesterday. The peso, which
pared an earlier drop of as much as 0.7 percent, has appreciated
7 percent this year.  Emerging-market currencies reversed losses after the Fed
extended its pledge to hold the key borrowing cost at zero to
0.25 percent until late 2014. Mexico reported a preliminary
 trade surplus  in December, surprising economists who had
forecast a deficit.  “With the news today regarding rates to be extremely low
in the U.S. until 2014, you want to be in a currency that has a
high yield,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base
Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey, Mexico. “The peso is
where a lot of funds will want to be to get exposure to a good
rate and good quality bonds.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
declined seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.26
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the securities rose 0.72 centavo to 133.01 centavos per peso.  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.
The Latin American country had a preliminary trade surplus of
$7.7 million in December, the nation’s statistics agency
reported on its website today. Economists forecast a trade
deficit of $359.5 million, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
