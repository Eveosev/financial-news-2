German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler opposes combining  Europe ’s two rescue funds, saying the
existing instruments are sufficient,  Stuttgarter Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  “Rescue packages that get bigger and bigger aren’t the
correct means of stemming the crisis,” the newspaper quoted
Roesler as saying in an e-mailed preview of an article to be
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
