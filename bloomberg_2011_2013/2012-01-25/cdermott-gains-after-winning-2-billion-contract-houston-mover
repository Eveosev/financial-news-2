McDermott International Inc. (MDR) , a
Houston-based energy services company, advanced as much as 10
percent after winning a $2 billion contract for a liquefied-
natural-gas drilling project off Australia.  McDermott  gained  $1.17, or 9.8 percent, to $13.11 at 11:48
a.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 14
percent this month and dropped 34 percent in the past year.
McDermott fell 27 percent on Aug. 4 after second-quarter
earnings fell short of expectations.  The Ichthys LNG project is a joint venture between  Inpex
Corp. (1605)  and  Total SA (FP) , with Inpex holding 76 percent, according to
McDermottâ€™s statement. McDermott will install subsea hardware,
moorings, risers, umbilicals and flowlines.  McDermott is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-
year earnings on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
