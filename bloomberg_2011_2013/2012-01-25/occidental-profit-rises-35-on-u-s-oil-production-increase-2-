Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S., said
fourth-quarter profit rose 35 percent on higher  oil prices  and
record output from new drilling in California, Texas and  North
Dakota .  Net income climbed to $1.63 billion, or $2.02 a share, from
$1.21 billion, or $1.47, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
Occidental said in a statement today. Per-share profit excluding
costs for selling its Argentine operations was five cents more
than the average of 19  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 19 percent to $6.03 billion.  U.S. oil and natural-gas production was 449,000 barrels a
day, breaking a record set in the previous quarter. Global
production during the last three months of the year fell to the
equivalent of 748,000 barrels a day from 753,000 a year earlier
after Occidental sold assets in Argentina to focus on
opportunities in emerging U.S. oil fields.  “It’s good that they were able to grow domestic production
since they don’t have  Libya ,”  Philip Weiss , an analyst with
Argus Research in New York, said in a telephone interview today.  Occidental extracted 1,000 barrels of crude in the fourth
quarter from Libya, its first production in the country since
the overthrow of  Muammar Qaddafi  last year. In December, the
company also lost some of its ability to produce in Yemen,
making a shift toward growth in the U.S. more important, Weiss
said.  Iraq  Production  Occidental also continued to increase output in Iraq,
raising its share of what it produces there to 9,000 barrels
compared to 4,000 in the three months that preceded the quarter.  The company’s 2011 output fell to the equivalent of
733,000, a decline of 2.7 percent from the previous year, the
first time Occidental’s oil production has declined since 2005,
according to the company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen, who took over in
May, has said the company’s U.S. crude production will grow by
as much as 48,000 barrels a day in 2012, much of it in
 California . Occidental owns about 870,000 acres of land in the
Monterey Shale, which holds more than 15 billion barrels of oil,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  California Outlook  “The outlook for the California play is really the
company-maker in the eyes of all the investors that we’re
talking to,”  Fadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. LLC
in New York, said in a telephone interview before earnings were
released. “The only upside potential going forward is the
results of drilling in California.”  Occidental sold crude in the fourth quarter for an average
of $99.62, a 25 percent increase over the same period a year
ago, according to the statement.  Oil futures traded in  New York  jumped 10.3 percent to
average $94.06 a barrel during the last three months of the year
on speculation that the  U.S. economy  will continue to recover
and sanctions in Iran may cut off the flow of oil from the
world’s fourth-largest crude-producing country. Prices for West
Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, traded at an
average of $85.24 a year earlier.  Occidental fell 0.4 percent to $100.49 at 9:32 a.m. in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
