Argentina ’s Interior Commerce
Secretary Guillermo Moreno increased requirements for the import
of goods into the South American country, newspaper El Cronista
reported.  To obtain approval for  imports , companies must now send a
form detailing their planned transactions by e-mail to Moreno’s
office, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, without
explaining where it obtained the information.  The new request is in addition to a sworn statement that
companies will have to present to the national tax agency from
Feb. 1 to gain permission to purchase merchandise for import.  To contact the reporter on this story:
