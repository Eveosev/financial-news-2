Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  James Gorman  said private investors reaching
an agreement over a restructuring of Greek debt will prevent the
worsening of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  “Europe did not get worse, it hasn’t gotten a lot
better,” Gorman said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television from Davos, Switzerland. “But if we can get Greece
resolved and have one concrete outcome of these talks of the
last several months, that will be a major push towards more
action” by the European Central Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
