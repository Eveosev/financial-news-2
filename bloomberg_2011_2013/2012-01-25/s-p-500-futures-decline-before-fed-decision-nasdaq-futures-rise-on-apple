U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since May, as the
 Federal Reserve  signaled low rates through at least late 2014
and didn’t rule out bond purchases to bolster the economy.  A measure of commodity shares in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index added 1.6 percent after gold rallied as record-low rates
may boost its appeal as a hedge against inflation. Banks had the
biggest drop in the  S&P 500  among 24 groups as the industry may
face pressure on margins from the Fed’s policy on rates.  Apple (AAPL) 
Inc. climbed 6.2 percent to an all-time high as  profit  more than
doubled.  Textron Inc. (TXT) , the maker of Cessna planes, surged 15
percent after forecasting higher-than-estimated earnings.  The S&P 500 added 0.9 percent to 1,326.06 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after dropping 0.5 percent earlier. The Dow gained
83.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,758.85. The Nasdaq-100 Index
rose 1.3 percent to 2,465.66, the highest since  2001 .  “The Fed is saying that money will stay easy and the cost
of money will stay low,” Madelynn Matlock, who helps oversee
about $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati,
said in a telephone interview. “The ability for businesses to
find the money they need to grow and for consumers to find the
money they need to buy things is going to be easier. That makes
the growth path a little simpler.”  Benchmark gauges reversed losses as the Fed extended its
previous pledge to keep rates low at least until the middle of
2013 as more than two years of economic growth have failed to
push unemployment below 8.5 percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said central bankers are still debating additional
asset purchases.  Earnings Season  Investors also watched earnings reports. Of the 112 S&P 500
companies that reported results since Jan. 9, 74 posted per-
share earnings that  beat  projections, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Earnings probably grew 3.4 percent for S&P 500
companies in the fourth quarter, the data show. The projection
has fallen from 6.2 percent at the end of last year.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-
dependent on economic growth added 1 percent. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average advanced 1.5 percent. All 10 groups in
the S&P 500 gained.  Gold producers rallied as the metal climbed to a six-week
high.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold producer,
jumped 4.8 percent to $60.25.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer,
climbed 4.8 percent to $46.08.  Apple Rallies  Apple rallied 6.2 percent, the most since May 2010, to
$446.66. The company sold 37 million iPhones in the period ended
Dec. 31, with customers snapping up the new 4S model that went
on sale in October, a week after the death of co-founder  Steve Jobs . Record revenue vaulted Apple ahead of  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) 
as the world’s biggest computer maker by sales and quelled
concern that the company’s allure may dim as it embarks on a new
era with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook at the helm.  Textron surged 15 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$24.76. Chief Executive Officer Scott Donnelly is working to
leverage the company’s businesses with measures such as having
Cessna and Bell share overseas service centers and sales forces.
Textron is winding down its finance unit, which struggled during
the recession.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index (BUSAIRL)  of 11 companies jumped
4.5 percent.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) 
reported fourth-quarter profits that topped analysts’
projections. Delta Air climbed 6.2 percent to $9.96. US Airways
rallied 17 percent to $7.52.  M&A Deal  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  surged 46 percent to $55.15. Roche Holding AG
offered $5.7 billion in a hostile bid for Illumina to bolster
sales of gene-mapping equipment and services. Roche proposed
paying $44.50 a share, 18 percent more than yesterday’s close.  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  gained 3.9 percent to $70.14. The
company may finally lure buyers willing to bet on a recovery in
coal prices with the industry’s cheapest stock. After  losing 
almost half its value in the past year, the producer of
steelmaking coal sold for 9.3 times earnings this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was less than any
North American coal-mining company with $1 billion in market
capitalization.  Walter Energy, which bought Western Coal Corp. for $5.3
billion in April, is an attractive target because it produces
high-grade steelmaking coal, Brean Murray Carret & Co. said. A
buyer could spend double Walter Energy’s closing price of $67.54
a share yesterday and still get the company for less relative to
earnings than any coal takeover in the past year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Banks (S5BANKX)  Decline  Banks had the biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 24
industries, falling 0.3 percent.  Bank of America Corp.  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  are among lenders that may find it harder to
boost profits and capital after the Fed’s pledge on low rates.
Bank of America rose 0.8 percent to $7.35. Citigroup added 0.2
percent to $29.96.  “This is a very dovish Fed,” David Kelly, who helps
oversee $394 billion as chief market strategist for JPMorgan
Funds in New York, said in a telephone interview. “It’s an
attempt to push down long-term  interest rates . They are pushing
the rates down to a level where consumers should find them very
attractive, but banks will find them very unattractive.”   Corning Inc. (GLW)  tumbled 11 percent, the biggest decline in the
S&P 500, to $13.05. The largest maker of glass for flat-panel
televisions said glass prices contributed to a 53 percent drop
in fourth-quarter profit and are still sinking.  Xerox, WellPoint  Xerox Corp. (XRX)  slumped 9.9 percent to $7.81. The provider of
printers and business services gave earnings forecasts that
trailed some analysts’ estimates as  Europe  weakens.  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  decreased 4.8 percent to $66.10. The largest
U.S. health insurer by enrollment  forecast  2012 earnings and
reported fourth-quarter profit that were less than analyst
estimates on higher medical costs.  “It’s going to be a mediocre earnings season,”  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based global chief investment
strategist for the IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., said in a
phone interview. His firm oversees $3.5 trillion as the world’s
largest asset manager. “We’re not going to see robust growth
this year and this is being reflected in corporate outlooks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
