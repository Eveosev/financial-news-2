Japanese stocks advanced, sending
the  Topix Index (TPX)  up for a seventh day, as the yen weakened and
technology companies rose after Apple Inc. reported record sales
and profit.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, gained 4.8 percent.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , a supplier of
chips for Apple’s iPad, rose 1.8 percent. Toyota Motor Corp.
climbed 3 percent after a report that Nippon Steel Corp. agreed
to cut material prices for Japan’s biggest carmaker.  The Topix, the country’s broadest equity gauge, climbed 1.3
percent to 767.40 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, its longest
winning streak since July 6. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose
1.1 percent to 8,883.69, its highest since Oct. 31.  “The yen is weakening, boosting earnings for exporters and
fueling confidence in the Japanese stock market,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in  Tokyo . “Investors are more likely to look at
the bright side of the global economy and European debt
issues.”  The  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 19 percent last year amid concern U.S.
growth was slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis would damage the
banking system. The decline cut the price of shares on the index
to 0.9 times book value. That compares with 2.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 1.4 times for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.3
percent today after holiday purchases of the new iPhone model
helped Apple avoid the consumer spending slump that has hurt
rivals.  Tech Stocks Advance  Toshiba rose 1.8 percent to 344 yen.  Murata Manufacturing
Co. (6981) , an electronic parts maker that supplies capacitors for the
iPhone, gained 2.7 percent to 4,260 yen. The stock also got a
boost after Credit Suisse Group AG raised its target price to
4,150 yen from 4,000 yen.  Yesterday the  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent in  New York , ending
a five-day advance, after European finance ministers pushed
bondholders to provide greater debt relief for  Greece , spurring
concern the nation may fail to make a March 20 bond payment
deadline. Global stocks also fell as the  International Monetary
Fund  cut its forecast for world economic growth.  “Investors can’t be optimistic on the Greek debt relief
talks until they are finalized, but extreme worries about them
are easing,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “The yen is weakening, fueling
expectations Japanese exporters’ earnings will turn up over the
next fiscal year.”  Exporters Climb  Exporters gained after the dollar rose, reaching the
highest level this year against the yen, which fell against all
of its 16 major counterparts.  Sony jumped 4.8 percent to 1,454 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
Japanese camera maker that gets 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, added 2.9 percent to 3,510 yen.  The Japanese currency fell to as low as 77.98 against the
dollar today in Tokyo, the lowest since Dec. 29. Against the
euro, the yen weakened to 101.56 from 100.20 at the close of
trading yesterday in Tokyo. A weaker yen boosts overseas income
at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Carmakers gained after the Nikkei newspaper reported Nippon
Steel would cut prices for Toyota by 4 percent. The agreement
represents a reduction of 5,000 yen a ton for the six months
ending March 31 from the first-half ended September, the Nikkei
reported, without citing anyone.  Toyota, Honda  Toyota advanced 3 percent to 2,877 yen. Asia’s biggest
carmaker also got a boost after raising its global sales
forecast because of Japanese government incentives on fuel-
efficient vehicles and demand for its new gas-electric Prius
compact.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-largest carmaker by
revenue, increased 3.8 percent to 2,773 yen.  Kyoei Tanker Co., a shipping line that gets more than 90
percent of revenue from the  Middle East , led gains among
shipping lines as rates rose following threats by Iran to
disrupt shipments.  Kyoei Tanker surged by its daily limit of 50 yen, or 30
percent, to 215 yen, extending yesterday’s 28 percent advance.
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , operator of the world’s largest
merchant fleet, jumped 7.6 percent to 298 yen. Shipping lines
gained the most among the 33 Topix industry groups today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
