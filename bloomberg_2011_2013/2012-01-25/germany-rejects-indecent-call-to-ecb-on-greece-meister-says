German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government will oppose any attempt to make the  European Central
Bank  accept a writedown on its Greek bond holdings, senior
coalition lawmaker Michael Meister said.  “I can’t imagine that European politicians would allow
third parties to make such an indecent claim on our central 
bank,” Meister, the deputy floor leader for Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union and the party’s ranking finance spokesman, 
said in a telephone interview today. “That contradicts our
philosophy.”  Plans to cut  Greece ’s debt to 120 percent of gross domestic
product can still be achieved with the voluntary help of private
investors, Meister said. Widening the so-called private sector
involvement plan to include the ECB is neither necessary nor
politically permissible, he said.  “The U.K. and U.S. have a slightly different philosophy
but we would regard such a move as indecent,” he said. Rather,
it is “in the interest of private holders of Greek bonds to
accept the terms of a writedown.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
