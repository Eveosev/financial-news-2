BP Plc (BP/)  plans to temporarily restrict
very large crude carrier, or VLCC, loadings from Hound Point,
 Scotland , as the company repairs a mooring hook at the terminal
that was damaged by bad weather.  VLCC loadings will be affected from Feb. 1 to Feb. 17,
Matthew Taylor, a BP spokesman in Aberdeen, said in an e-mailed
response. “Throughout the repair period we will continue to use
Hound Point for normal liftings,” he said. The company operates
the Forties Pipeline System, or FPS.  “The berth won’t close completely and there will be no
impact on throughput via FPS,” Taylor said. “All affected
shippers have been made aware.”  Hound Point is the loading terminal for  Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude, one
of the four North Sea grades used to price  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) , the
benchmark for more than half of global oil supply. The others
are Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
