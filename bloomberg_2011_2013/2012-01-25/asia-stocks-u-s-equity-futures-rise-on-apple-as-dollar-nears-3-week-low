Treasuries rallied, sending five-
year note yields to a record low, and stocks climbed as the
 Federal Reserve  signaled plans to keep  interest rates  low
through at least late 2014 and didn’t rule out purchasing more
bonds to bolster growth. The dollar weakened.  Five-year  (USGG5YR) yield Treasury yields sank as low as 0.76
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.9 percent to
close at 1,326.06 at 4 p.m. New York time, returning to the
highest level since July. The Nasdaq-100 Index jumped to an
almost 11-year high as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  surged to a record after
profit doubled. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  reached the
highest level since May. The dollar slid against 14 of 16 major
peers, while natural gas and silver led commodities higher.  The Fed extended its previous commitment to keep rates low
at least until the middle of 2013 as more than two years of
economic growth have failed to push the  unemployment rate  below
8.5 percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at a news
conference after the statements, said that the option of further
large-scale bond purchases is still “on the table.”  “This is a very dovish Fed,”  David Kelly , who helps
oversee $394 billion as chief market strategist for JPMorgan
Funds in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “It’s an
attempt to push down long-term interest rates. They are pushing
the rates down to a level where consumers should find them very
attractive, but banks will find them very unattractive.”  Growth Forecast  The Fed also lowered its forecast for growth this year to
2.2 percent to 2.7 percent, down from a projection of 2.5
percent to 2.9 percent in November. It predicted the economy
next year will expand between 2.8 percent to 3.2 percent, down
from a previous forecast of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent.  Yields on 10-year notes fell six basis points to 2.00
percent and the rate on the current five-year note ended down 10
basis points to 0.80 percent after touching its record low of
0.76 percent.  Stocks fell earlier as earnings or forecasts at companies
from Xerox Corp. to Ericsson AB and  Novartis (NOVN)  AG disappointed
investors, overshadowing record profit at Apple.  Technology companies rose 1 percent as a group and
contributed the most to the S&P 500’s advance today. Apple
surged as much as 8.1 percent to a record $454.45. It ended the
day with a market value of more than $416 billion. First-quarter
profit jumped to $13.1 billion, or $13.87 a share, amid surging
 demand  for the iPhone and iPad. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
on average estimated profit of $10.14 a share.  Earnings Season  With its report yesterday, Apple single-handedly erased a
drop in S&P 500 earnings for the December quarter, turning a 4.2
percent decline into a 4.4 percent gain. Apple’s 116 percent
profit growth helped push its total cash to $97.6 billion --
enough to cover  Greece ’s debt payments due in the next two
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Still, analysts forecast earnings increased 3.4 percent in
the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which
would mark the slowest growth in more than two years.  “It’s going to be a mediocre earnings season,”  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based global chief investment
strategist for the IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., said in a
telephone interview. His firm oversees $3.5 trillion as the
world’s largest asset manager. “We’re not going to see robust
growth this year and this is being reflected in corporate
outlooks. This is going to be a slow recovery.”  Textron, Xerox  Textron Inc. surged 15 percent after forecasting higher
2012 profit than analysts estimated, while  Xerox Corp. (XRX)  slumped
9.9 percent after the provider of printers and business services
gave earnings  forecasts  that trailed some analysts’ estimates as
companies curb spending.  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  rallied 46 percent as Roche Holding AG
offered about $5.7 billion in cash for the provider of genetic-
analysis tools, the third time the Swiss drugmaker has made a
hostile  bid  for a U.S. company since 2007.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell for a second day, losing
0.4 percent. Ericsson tumbled 14 percent and Novartis, Europe’s
biggest drugmaker by sales, sank 2.5 percent. ARM Holdings Plc,
the U.K. owner of chip technology used in Apple’s iPhone and
iPad, rose 3 percent.  The dollar weakened to the lowest level in a month against
the euro, falling 0.5 percent to $1.3107 per euro, after gaining
as much as 0.8 percent. The euro retreated earlier after the
 European Central Bank  was said to oppose restructuring its Greek
bonds.  Australia ’s dollar was the best performer, climbing 1
percent versus the U.S. currency, as stocks rallied.  European Yields  The Portuguese five-year note yield climbed to a record
18.93 percent, while the yield on the Italian 10-year bond
jumped six basis points 6.2 percent.  The German 10-year bund yield slipped five basis points to
1.95 percent, falling for the first time in five days.  Germany 
got bids for 5.042 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of 30-year
bonds, more than the maximum sales target of 3 billion euros,
the Bundesbank said in a statement today. The debt agency
accepted bids for 2.458 billion euros at average yield of 2.62
percent.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 0.2 percent.  India ’s
Sensex index climbed 0.5 percent to a ten-week high amid
speculation the central bank will add to yesterday’s bank
reserve-requirement cut to stimulate economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
