Williamson Tea Kenya Ltd. (GWKL) , the
country’s second-biggest tea company, headed for its lowest
close in three months after the country’s industry board said
tea production may decline this quarter.  The stock dropped 3.4 percent to 255 shillings by 1:17 p.m.
in Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level would be the
lowest since Oct. 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tea output may decline to about 70 million kilograms (154
million pounds) in the three months through March, from 85
million kilograms a year earlier, after dry weather and frost
damaged the crop, the Tea Board of Kenya said today.  “They got windfall gains last year from the currency which
will not be repeated again unless they were smart enough to buy
cover when the  exchange rate  was at a good level,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based investment
company Rich Management, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
