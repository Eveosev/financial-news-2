German  government bonds  advanced as
concern Greek debt-swap talks are stalling boosted demand for
the safest fixed-income assets.  Benchmark 10-year bunds snapped a four-day drop amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will oppose any
restructuring of its bond holdings in the indebted nation. The
securities outperformed most of their euro-region peers, with
the extra yield investors demand to hold the securities of
Portuguese and Italian bonds increasing the most. Germany’s 30-
year bonds advanced for the first time in eight days after
yields at a sale of the securities fell to a record low.  “The bullish move in bunds does sit comfortably alongside
these ongoing negative headlines about  Greece ,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. The ECB’s refusal to participate
“means that we are still at an impasse and the clock is
ticking. We also had a very good 30-year bund auction, which is
supporting the long end of the bund curve.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time.
The 2 percent bond due in January 2022 rose 0.295, or 2.95 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,298) face amount, to 100.35.  The 30-year bond yield dropped four basis points to 2.60
percent, after the July 2042 bond auctioned drew an  average
yield  of 2.62 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in December 1993. The difference in yield
between two-year and 30-year German debt  narrowed  for the first
time in five days to 240 basis points.  ‘Maximum Offer’  Greek bonds due October 2022 were trading at about 21
percent of face value after negotiations to cut the nation’s
borrowing via a voluntary exchange of bonds stumbled. European
finance ministers signaled yesterday that they would push
private investors to accept bigger losses, after bondholders
made what Institute of International Finance Managing Director
 Charles Dallara  described as their “maximum” offer.  A deal is key to a second financing package for the cash-
strapped country, which faces a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment
on March 20.  While the ECB faces pressure to join private-sector
investors in taking losses on Greek debt, the central bank sees
this as potentially damaging to confidence in the institution if
it were to take part, said two people familiar with the
Governing Council’s stance, who declined to be identified
because the matter is confidential.  The German government will oppose any attempt to make the
ECB accept a writedown on its Greek debt holdings, said Michael Meister, the ranking finance spokesman for  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s Christian Democratic Union party.  ECB Participation  The Greek two-year note yield rose 357 basis points to
175.95 percent. The benchmark October 2022 bond yield climbed 18
basis points to 33.54 percent.  The ECB’s position has “been perceived as something that
prevents a consensus there in  Athens ,” said Marius Daheim, a
senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in
Munich. “It’s something that everybody continues to speculate
about -- how can this public-sector involvement happen if the
ECB refuses to take part in it?”  Volatility on  Portugal ’s debt was the highest in developed-
nation debt markets today, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.
The 10-year yield jumped 44 basis points to 14.62 percent, 3.1
times the 90-day average change. The five-year note yield surged
to a record-high 18.93 percent.  Italy’s 10-year yield was six basis points higher at 6.23
percent, pushing the spread over similar-maturity bund yields 10
basis points wider to 4.27 percentage points.  Irish Debt Swap  Irish two-year securities advanced after the nation’s debt
agency said it will swap a note due to be repaid in 2014 for one
maturing a year later, to smooth its funding requirements.  The National Treasury Management Agency said today it will
offer to switch an 11.9 billion euro bond due for payment in
January 2014 for a new note maturing in February 2015 yielding
5.15 percent.  The Irish two-year note yield fell 24 basis points to 5.39
percent.  Greek bonds have handed investors a 63 percent loss in the
past year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German debt
has returned 9.9 percent over the same period.  After volatility is taken into account, German bonds
produced a 1.6 percent return, according to Bloomberg risk-
adjusted return rankings. That compares with 1.7 percent for
Dutch securities, 1.9 percent for  U.S. Treasuries  and 2.5
percent for U.K. debt.  The risk-adjusted return is calculated by dividing total
return by volatility, or the degree of daily price-swing
variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. The
returns are not annualized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
