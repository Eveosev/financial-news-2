U.S. consumers will pay 2.5 percent
to 3.5 percent more for food in 2012, the Department of
Agriculture said, affirming its December forecast.  Beef and seafood will post the biggest gains, climbing as
much as 5 percent, the USDA said today on a  report  on its
website. Eggs, dairy products and fruits and vegetables will
rise less than forecast, the agency said.  Retail-food costs rose 3.7 percent in 2011, the USDA said.
The December forecast was for a gain of 3.25 percent to 3.75
percent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month said
expenses climbed 0.2 percent in December, capping a 4.7 percent
projected increase last year. The USDA uses a broader range of
goods for estimates.  “We still, relatively speaking, have affordable food in
this country,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on a
conference call with reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
