Serbia  and Azerbaijan signed a
cooperation agreement that opens way for Azeri financing of part
of a planned highway between Serbia’s capital Belgrade and
Montenegro on the Adriatic coast.  The agreement “opens the possibility of financing for the
Corridor 11’s section between Ljig and Preljine, under very
convenient terms,” the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement today, without elaborating.  The initial, 39-kilometer (24 miles) section may cost 242
million euros ($314 million) to build, according to estimates by
 Koridori Srbije , the state-run manager of Serbia’s highway
projects.  Construction may start by the end of the first quarter “if
all goes according to plan” Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said
after he and the director of Koridori Srbije, Mihajlo Misic,
negotiated the agreement in Baku with Shahin Mustafayev,
 Azerbaijan ’s minister for economic development, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
