Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
governments won’t be able to close budget deficits “in one
go,” though leaders are willing to take the time required to

determined to do that,” Merkel said in a speech at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
