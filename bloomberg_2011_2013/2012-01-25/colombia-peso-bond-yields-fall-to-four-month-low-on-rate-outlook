Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a four-month low, as
speculation the central bank will raise interest rates further
led to increased demand from investors seeking higher returns.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.27
percent, according to the stock exchange. That’s the lowest
level on a closing basis since Sept. 9. The price rose 0.642
centavo to 121.837 centavos per peso.  “Consumer demand continues to drive economic growth and
inflation expectations remain under control,” said Pedro Ospina, a fixed-income analyst at Interbolsa SA, the country’s
biggest brokerage. “Given the carry trade, bonds are offering
good returns. We’re seeing demand across the whole curve” of
peso bonds, he said.  Colombian policy makers last month left the  overnight
lending rate  unchanged, after raising it in November a quarter
percentage point to 4.75 percent. Most economists in a central
bank survey published Jan. 12 forecast Banco de la Republica
will increase the key rate to 5.5 percent by the end of the
year. The next monetary policy meeting is slated for Jan. 30.  The carry trade refers to the practice in which investors
borrow funds in a country with lower borrowing costs and buy
assets where  interest rates  are higher.  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at an auction today of
fixed rate securities. The government sold peso bonds due August
2026 to yield 7.49 percent, the Finance ministry said in a
statement, down from 7.65 percent at the last auction on Jan.
11. Colombia also sold bonds due October 2018 to yield 6.89
percent, down from 7.1 percent, while the yield on the October
2015 securities fell to 6.28 percent from 6.5 percent, according
to the statement.  Colombia’s peso erased an earlier drop after the  Federal
Reserve  extended its pledge to hold its target for the federal
funds rate low until late 2014 from a previous pledge to keep it
in place until mid-2013.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,812.65 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,814 yesterday. The peso has jumped 6.9 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
