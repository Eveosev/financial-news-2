Mauritius’s stocks gauge fell to the
lowest level in more than 15 months, as hotel shares declined on
concern that the debt problems in Europe would limit visitors.  The 38-member  SEMDEX index  retreated 0.6 percent to
1,837.20, the closing lowest level since October 2010.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the country’s largest leisure
operator by market value, led the drop, retreating 2.6 percent
or 2 rupees, the most since Nov. 30, to 75 rupees.  Sun Resorts
Ltd. (SUN) , the second-biggest hotel operator, fell for an eighth
successive trading day, its longest losing streak since 1995,
weakening 2.1 percent to 41.60 rupees, the lowest since May
2009.  Lux Resorts Ltd (NRL)  declined 2.2 percent to 22.50 rupees, the
lowest level since January 2011.  “Investors have a negative outlook on our economy at the
moment,” said Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at Port Louis-
based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., in a phone interview from the
city. “Being a euro destination, margins are set to be tighter
for hotels.”  Tourist arrivals for 2011 missed estimates as the growth in
the number of visitors from  Europe  slowed, according to
Statistics Mauritius. Europe, led by  France , accounted for 63
percent of arrivals. The euro accounts for 41 percent of total
foreign currency income for the Indian Ocean island nation, data
from the central bank show. The country, with a population of
about 1.3 million people, is expected to expand 4 percent this
2012, compared with 4.1 percent last year.  “We find the fall in value of euro very worrying,”
Finance Minister Xavier Luc Duval said in a speech received by
fax today. “We are keeping our growth targets under review --
and may need to be less optimistic.”  European finance ministers are pushing bondholders to
provide greater debt relief for  Greece , spurring concern the
nation may fail to make a March 20 bond payment deadline.  The rupee gained as much as 0.9 percent and traded 0.8
percent higher to 38.0574 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
