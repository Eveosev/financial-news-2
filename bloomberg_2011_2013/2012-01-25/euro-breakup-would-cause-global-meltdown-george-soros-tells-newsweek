Billionaire  George Soros  said “the
euro must survive because the alternative, a breakup, would
cause a meltdown that Europe, the world, can’t afford,”
 Newsweek Magazine  reported, citing an interview in  New York 
ahead of his participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  In his speech at Davos, Soros will say it is “now more
likely than now” that Greece will formally default in 2012,
Newsweek said. Soros nevertheless thinks the euro will survive,
according to Newsweek.  The world is facing a period of “evil,” Soros said,
adding that he foresees Europe descending into chaos and
conflict, while rioting in the streets of the U.S. will lead to
a curtailment of civil liberties and the global economic system
possibly collapsing altogether,  Newsweek  reported.  By contrast, Soros sees a “very positive” future for the
developing world  and said the “aspiration of people for an
open society is very inspiring,” Newsweek reported.  To avoid catastrophe in 2012, the experiences of 2011
mustn’t be wasted, Soros said, according to Newsweek. “The
European Union could regain its luster,” he said, adding that
he’s “hopeful” that the U.S. will “pass a very severe test
and actually strengthen the institution,” Newsweek reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
