(Corrects third paragraph in story originally published
Jan. 25 to show Torii didn’t refer to a target.)  Suntory Holdings Ltd (SUNTZ) .’s food and
beverages unit said Asia is its “first priority for M&A
activities” as it seeks to boost growth outside Japan, where a
shrinking and aging population damps demand.  “For overseas M&A targets, it will primarily be in regions
that I personally, and the company, are familiar with,”
Nobuhiro Torii, president of the Tokyo-based company’s soft-
drinks division, told reporters today in Tokyo.  Torii also said he’s getting “a lot” of ideas from
financial advisers about possible deals. Evian and Volvic
bottler  Danone SA (BN)  has met with Suntory as well as Japanese
rivals  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  and  Asahi Breweries Ltd. (2502)  to gauge
their interest in its  bottled water business , people with
knowledge of the matter said at the time of the 2010 meetings.  “They have great brands in their water business with Evian
and Volvic,” Torii said.  Paris-based Danone was seeking $5 billion to $7 billion for
the entire water business in 2010, the people said at the time.  Suntory bought Frucor, Danone’s Australia and New Zealand
drinks unit, in 2009. The two companies also had a water-cooler
joint venture in the U.S. that ended in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
