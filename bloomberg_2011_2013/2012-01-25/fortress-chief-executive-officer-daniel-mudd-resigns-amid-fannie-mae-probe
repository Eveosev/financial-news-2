Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  said
 Daniel Mudd  resigned as chief executive officer and a director
of the New York-based hedge fund and private-equity firm after a
leave of absence to respond to a government lawsuit.  “I do not want the uncertainty associated with a leave of
absence, on my part, to become a distraction for either Fortress
or its investors, and thus, I have decided to resign,” Mudd
said yesterday in a statement.  Randal Nardone, Fortress principal and co-founder, will
continue to serve as interim CEO, according to the statement.  Mudd, formerly CEO of  Fannie Mae (FNM) , took a leave from
Fortress on Dec. 21 to respond to allegations by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. He and former  Freddie Mac  CEO  Richard Syron  were sued for allegedly understating by hundreds of
billions of dollars the subprime loans held by the government-
owned mortgage finance companies. Mudd denied the claim, saying
the U.S. government and investors were aware of “every piece of
material data about loans held by  Fannie Mae .”  Tom Green, Syron’s attorney at  Sidley Austin LLP (1119L)  in
Washington, said in December there was “no uniform definition”
of subprime in 2007 and that Freddie Mac included in its
disclosure tables information detailing credit risks.  Fortress  shares  fell 1.4 percent to $3.60 in New York
trading as of 1:03 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
