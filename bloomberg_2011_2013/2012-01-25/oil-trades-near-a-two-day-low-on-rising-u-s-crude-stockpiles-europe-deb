Oil traded near a two-day low as
signs of rising U.S. crude supplies and concern Europe’s credit
crisis will spread after a stalemate over Greek debt relief
stoked speculation demand will weaken.  Futures were little changed in  New York  after dropping 0.6
percent yesterday. U.S. stockpiles increased 7.33 million
barrels last week, the biggest gain in four weeks, figures from
the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  showed. An
Energy Department report today may show they climbed 1.45
million barrels. European finance ministers pushed bondholders
to provide greater debt relief for  Greece .  Crude for March delivery was at $99.19 a barrel, up 24
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 11:12 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday fell 63 cents
to $98.95, the lowest since Jan. 20. Front-month prices are 15
percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for March settlement dropped 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $110.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contract’s
premium to West Texas Intermediate futures closed at $11.08,
compared with a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The European Union’s ban on Iranian oil imports starting
July 1 is already priced into crude, leading to a muted market
reaction, according to Ole Hansen, a training advisory manager
at Saxo Bank A/S. The “unlikely” closing of the Strait of
Hormuz by Iran could cause a price spike of $20 to $40 a barrel,
he said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
