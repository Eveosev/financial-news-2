McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
biggest restaurant chain, said an advertisement on Twitter Inc.
backfired after people began using the social-media website to
criticize the company.  A Twitter label, meant to promote a campaign about the
company’s suppliers, “did not go as planned,” Rick Wion,
McDonald’s social media director, said in an e-mailed statement.
The company “quickly pulled” the Twitter label last week after
the negative posts, he said.  People used Twitter to question the chain’s food quality
and the cleanliness of its stores. McDonald’s supplier campaign,
meant to tell customers about where the company’s food comes
from, was introduced Jan. 2 and includes television and Facebook
ads.  “With all social media campaigns, we include contingency
plans should the conversation not go as planned,” Wion said.  McDonald’s, with more than 31,000 McDonald’s restaurants
worldwide, has a Twitter team of 10 employees who post about
news and promotions, according to the company’s  website .  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s has recently advertised Chicken
McBites and McCafe drinks using Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
