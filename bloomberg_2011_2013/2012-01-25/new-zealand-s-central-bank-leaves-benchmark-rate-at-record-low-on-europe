New Zealand ’s central bank left
 interest rates  at a record low as inflation slows and concern
mounts that Europe’s debt crisis may stall global demand for the
nation’s commodity exports.  The official cash rate was held at 2.5 percent, Reserve
Bank Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement released today in
Wellington.  Central bankers have been lowering rates or keeping them
near all-time lows as Europe’s turmoil threatens to slow the
global economic expansion. The  International Monetary Fund 
earlier this week cut its estimate for global growth in 2012,
forecasting the euro area’s economy to contract.  Thailand yesterday reduced its one-day bond repurchase rate
a quarter percentage point to 3 percent, and the  Philippines  on
Jan. 19 lowered the rate it pays lenders for overnight deposits
by a quarter point to 4.25 percent. The Bank of Israel earlier
this week decreased its benchmark rate a quarter point to 2.5
percent, the third reduction since late-September.  In the U.S. yesterday, Federal Reserve officials said the
federal funds target rate, at zero to 0.25 percent, will likely
stay low until at least late-2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
