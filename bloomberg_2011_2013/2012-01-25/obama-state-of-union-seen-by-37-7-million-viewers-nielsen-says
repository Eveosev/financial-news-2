President  Barack Obama , who is
seeking re-election in November, drew 37.75 million viewers to
last night’s State of the Union address, a 12 percent decline
from a year earlier.  Obama’s 65-minute speech was watched by 13 percent fewer
than the 43.4 million who tuned in for President George W. Bush’s State of the Union in 2004, before that re-election
campaign, according to Nielsen  data  today.  The president used last night’s address to highlight themes
of his bid for a second term. Obama called on Congress to
require those making $1 million or more annually to pay a 30
percent federal tax rate. He called on Congress to help
homeowners, crack down on U.S. financial crimes and unfair trade
practices in  China , and investigate lending practices that
preceded the housing crisis.  The speech had a preliminary rating of 24, meaning it was
seen in 24 percent of the 114.7 million U.S. TV households. The
address was carried by major broadcast networks, Fox News
Channel,  CNN , CNBC and  MSNBC , along with the Spanish outlets,
Telemundo, Telefutura, Univision and Mundo2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
