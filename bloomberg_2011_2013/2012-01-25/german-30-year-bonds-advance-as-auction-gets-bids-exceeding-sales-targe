German 30-year bonds advanced after
the government got bids for more than the maximum sales target
at an auction.  The 30-year yield fell two basis points to 2.61 percent at
10:38 a.m. London time.  German 10-year bund yields also dropped two basis points,
to 1.98 percent. Two-year notes erased a decline, leaving the
yield little changed at 0.22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
