Bondholders negotiating a debt swap
with  Greece  have made their “maximum” offer, according to  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP)  Chairman Baudoin Prot. He spoke at the World Economic
Forum’s annual meeting in Davos,  Switzerland  today.  “The offer that is now on the table is the maximum
acceptable for a voluntary deal. All the elements are now in
place. I hope the discussion in the next few days will enable
all parties to reach a constructive agreement.”  “I am a cautious optimist. We are starting to see signs of
a shift in sentiment towards Europe. The ECB three-year
financing facility was really a catalyst. We are on the right
track, but we need to keep moving forward.”  “We need each country to implement financial discipline.
But not just about debt reduction.  Europe  also needs a growth
strategy, a series of initiatives to open up the market, support
innovation and competitiveness.”  “We need each country in the euro zone to make significant
efforts to improve their finances and better European governance
to support collective action.”  “We must be aware of the high risk of overshooting on
regulatory rules that will negatively impact the ability of
banks to finance the real economy, and particularly to support
SMEs, which play a pivotal role in creating new jobs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
