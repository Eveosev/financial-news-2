Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. were among those named to the committee
that will represent  Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  creditors during the
imaging company’s bankruptcy case.  The seven members of the unsecured creditors committee,
which also includes Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., were
announced today in  New York  by the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the
 Justice Department  that monitors bankruptcy proceedings.  Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, filed for bankruptcy
Jan. 19, listing assets of $5.1 billion and debt of $6.8
billion.  Wal-Mart has a claim against Kodak for about $11.4 million,
according to court papers.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , which
wasn’t named to the committee, was listed as Kodak’s biggest
unsecured creditor as trustee for about
$670 million in notes when Kodak filed for bankruptcy.  The PBGC said Jan. 19 that it would “actively
participate” in Kodak’s bankruptcy to protect pension plans.
Kodak sponsors two traditional pension plans that cover almost
63,000 people. The plans are 86 percent funded, with about $4.9
billion in assets to cover about $5.6 billion in benefits, the
PBGC said.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
