Etihad Airways ({360335Z) , the  Middle East ’s
third-biggest carrier, agreed to buy a 40 percent stake in Air
Seychelles Ltd. to tap the high-end tourism market and the
island state’s emerging business links with  China .  Abu Dhabi-based Etihad will invest $20 million in the
Indian Ocean carrier, matched by the Seychelles government, the
current owner, and provide a $25 million loan to meet working
 capital requirements  and fund new services, it said today.  The deal, which follows Etihad’s increased investment in
 Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  last month, includes a five-year  management
contract  aimed at boosting growth and cutting costs after Air
Seychelles this month fired 116 workers, or almost 20 percent of
the workforce, and scrapped all of its long-haul services.  Etihad Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said in a
statement that his airline will help the Seychelles tap European
tourism markets after the islands posted record visitor numbers
last year. Joel Morgan, the archipelago’s home affairs minister,
said the deal provides a “game-changing strategic partnership.”  Etihad will also increase flights between Abu Dhabi and the
island of Mahé from four per week to daily.  In operation since 1978, Air Seychelles operates a  Boeing
Co. (BA)  767-300 jetliner, together with three DHC-6 Twin Otter
turboprops and a Short 360, according to its website.  The carrier, which also received $15 million in government
subsidies last year, has maintained services to Mauritius and
South Africa, together with flights between some of the state’s
115 islands, it said in a statement Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
