Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) , the
biggest petroleum leaseholder in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale
field, jumped the most in five months after reporting production
increased 57 percent in a year and reserves grew 39 percent.  Continental rose 8.8 percent to $80.73 at 12:52 p.m. in  New
York  after climbing as much as 9.2 percent earlier, the most
since Aug. 11. Before today, the shares had risen 25 percent in
the past year.  Daily production in the fourth quarter of 2011 rose to
75,219 barrels of oil equivalent, up from 48,034 a year earlier,
Enid, Oklahoma-based Continental said in a statement today.
Year-to-date production is 80,000 barrels a day. The company is
scheduled to report financial results Feb. 22.  Standard & Poor’s  raised its rating on Continental’s debt
one level to BB+ today, the highest non-investment grade, saying
it expects production and reserve growth to continue. North
Dakota oil production rose 4.5 percent in a month to a record
509,726 barrels a day in November,  according  to the state’s
Department of Mineral Resources.  Continental’s proved reserves rose to the equivalent of 508
million barrels of oil on results of drilling in the Bakken
shale formation and in the Anadarko Woodford region of  Oklahoma ,
according to the statement. Proved reserves rose 39 percent even
as gas deposits equivalent to 23.4 million barrels were removed.
The company has canceled plans to drill gas wells there before
2014 because of low prices for the fuel, according to the
statement.  Continental leases 901,000 acres in  North Dakota ’s Bakken
field, the most according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm
owned 68 percent of the stock as of Nov. 2, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
