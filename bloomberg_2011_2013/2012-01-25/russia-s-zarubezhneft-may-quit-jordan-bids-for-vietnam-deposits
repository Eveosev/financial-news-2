OAO Zarubezhneft, a Russian state
oil producer, plans to withdraw from an exploration project in
 Jordan , while seeking additional offshore blocks in Vietnam.  Zarubezhneft, whose main assets are outside  Russia , doesn’t
see potential in the Jordan project, the company’s press service
said today, confirming remarks made by Chief Executive Officer
Nikolai Brunich and reported by RIA Novosti.  The oil producer, which has output in Vietnam, is bidding
for two new offshore projects in the Asian country, and may find
out the results next month, the press service said, confirming
