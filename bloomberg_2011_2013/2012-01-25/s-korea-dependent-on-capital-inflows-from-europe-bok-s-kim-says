Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo comments on the impact of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis on
 South Korea . He was speaking at the World Economic Forum’s
annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  On the impact from Europe:
“We depend very much upon capital inflow from Europe and
because of the sovereign crisis European banks began
deleveraging and that affects our economy.”  On 2012:
“I don’t dare to predict but I do hope that Europeans somehow
find a way to solve the problem.”  On changes in North Korea:
“We have had such geopolitical risk for a long period of time
but I don’t think we are very much worrying about that for the
moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
