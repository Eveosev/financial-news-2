Natural gas  may fail to sustain the
rally triggered by Chesapeake Energy Corp.’s decision to reduce
output by at least 8 percent, according to Subash Chandra, a
Jefferies & Co. analyst.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, past cuts at Chesapeake
haven’t always lifted the commodity’s price for long. Chandra
cited the track record of the second-largest U.S. gas producer
in a report two days ago.  Gas prices rose from the lowest level in a decade after
Chesapeake curtailed gas production by 500 million cubic feet a
day on Jan. 23. The cutback may be doubled later “if conditions
warrant,” the Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement.  “Curtailments are a response to excess storage volumes,
rather than a solution for low  gas prices ,” Chandra wrote. He
estimated that inventories at the beginning of the U.S. winter
amounted to 4.42 trillion cubic feet, up 16 percent from three
years ago.  Chesapeake also plans to idle half its drilling rigs in
gas-only fields by the second quarter and to slash this year’s
spending on gas wells by 71 percent, to $900 million. The moves
won’t reduce supplies enough to pave the way for sustained price
gains, according to Chandra.  “The supply response we want to see is a multiyear decline
in volumes” across the industry, the report said. He estimated
that production will rise about 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
