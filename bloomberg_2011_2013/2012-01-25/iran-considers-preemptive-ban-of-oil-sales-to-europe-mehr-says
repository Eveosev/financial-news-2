Iranian lawmakers are drafting a
bill that would call for a halt of  Iran ’s oil exports to Europe
even before July when a European Union ban on Iranian crude is
to start, the state-run  Mehr  news agency said.  If the bill is approved, Iran’s government will have to
halt oil sales to Europe before the start of the European
Union’s oil embargo on Iran, Emad Hosseini, the spokesman for
the parliament’s energy commission, said, according to Mehr. The
bill is expected to be debated in the parliament by Jan. 29,
Hosseini said, according to Mehr.  The European Union agreed on Jan. 23 to ban oil imports
from Iran from July 1 as part of measures to ratchet up pressure
on the country’s nuclear program. Iran’s Oil Ministry has played
down the effects of the measure on its economy, saying the move
may lead to “heavy economic loss and damages” for  Europe  and
that it has “no concerns” finding new customers.  Europe, collectively the second-biggest buyer of Iranian
oil after  China , imported 450,000 barrels a day of the nation’s
crude in the first half of last year, U.S. Energy Department
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
