Republican presidential candidate
Newt Gingrich’s consulting firm, the Center for Health
Transformation, tonight released a second consulting contract
with  Freddie Mac , the government-backed mortage lending company.  The contract, first signed in 1999, required the former
U.S. House speaker to work closely with the company’s top
lobbyist to “engage in discussions” about Freddie Mac’s
opportunities and challenges and to “meet with major
stakeholders” to discuss issues that could “contribute to the
achievement of Freddie Mac business goals.”  The agreement includes a clause that notes that “nothing
herein is or shall be construed as an agreement to provide
lobbying services” by Gingrich or his consulting firm, then
called the Gingrich Group. The contract provided a
maximum annual compensation to the Gingrich Group of $520,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
