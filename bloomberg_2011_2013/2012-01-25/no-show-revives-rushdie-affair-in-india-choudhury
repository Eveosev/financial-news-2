The novelist  Salman Rushdie  found himself last week oscillating yet again between being a human being and a symbol -- of both freedom and heresy. Only the venue of this spectacle was new: the city of Jaipur in India, the country of his birth. Rushdie was one of more than 250 writers from around the world who had agreed to speak at the  Jaipur Literary Festival , the largest such gathering in  South Asia , and probably the most eagerly awaited. But a few days before the festival was to begin on Jan. 20, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, a cleric at the  Darul Uloom Deoband , a prominent Islamic seminary in the north Indian state of  Uttar Pradesh ,  caused a stir  by declaring that the Indian government should have denied a visa to Rushdie, who, because of his depiction of the Prophet in his novel "The Satanic Verses," was "a person whom the Muslims of the world hate." The Maulana had got his facts wrong. Rushdie possesses what is called a  PIO  (Person of Indian Origin) card, and didn't require a visa to come to India. Indeed, he visits frequently, and had appeared at the Jaipur Literary Festival once before without incident, in 2007. But it was lost on no one that the cleric's call to action was cannily timed.  Uttar Pradesh ,  India 's largest state, goes to the polls in three months, and it is home to a substantial chunk of India's 160 million Muslims, a bloc being courted by all the major parties of the state. No Indian government has ever been particularly sympathetic to the idea of artistic freedom or freedom of speech. Indeed, in 1988, after demonstrations against "The Satanic Verses" by Indian Muslims, the government banned importations of the book into India,  adding, unbelievably , "that the ban did not detract from the literary and artistic merit of Rushdie’s work.” Now, as the pressure grew on the governments of India and the state of Rajasthan to issue a statement guaranteeing Rushdie's safety, the Home Ministry broadcast, instead, news of  intelligence on a possible attempt on Rushdie's life . Following this, the author decided to call off his visit, releasing a statement  that said : "While I have some doubts about the accuracy of this intelligence, it would be irresponsible of me to come to the Festival in such circumstances; irresponsible to my family, to the festival audience, and to my fellow writers. I will, therefore, not travel to Jaipur as planned." That decision might have drawn the curtain on yet another depressing  instance of censorship  (whether by an edict of government, or the threat of violence by groups of outraged hardliners) in the recent history of India. But as it turned out, it was only the prelude to an explosion of debate about the freedom of artists, the limits of protest and the duties of government -- one that consumed the festival, and made the 2012 edition a kind of extended referendum on the Rushdie affair. The furore began when two writers,  Amitava Kumar  and  Hari Kunzru , decided on the opening day of the festival to use their  allotted time  to read aloud, as a gesture of protest at Rushdie's de facto exclusion some passages of "The Satanic Verses." Just before they went on stage, Kunzru tweeted: "About to defy bigots and shoe throwers, reading  @SalmanRushdie  Satanic Verses on stage with  @amitavakumar  at  #jaipur   #jlf ." Although the organizers, fearing that this would invite action from the state, tried to stop the reading, the two continued, and later that day two other writers, Ruchir Joshi and Jeet Thayil, also read from the banned book. News of this insurrection spread, and within minutes it was being broadcast all over the world by the massive press contingent present at the festival. It seemed that the four writers who had broken open the long-sealed box of "The Satanic Verses" in Indian public life might be charged by the police, and by the next day they had all  left the city . In a piece called " Why I Quoted From `The Satanic Verses ,'" published in the Guardian a day later, Kunzru explained: It was just as well that Kunzru and his comrades in dissent left. Although it became clear in the days that followed that reading from the book  was in no way a crime , the roars and silences that emerged in their protests' wake revealed much about the balance of power in the country. No member of either the government of Rajasthan, the government of India, or the two major political parties -- the Congress and the BJP -- stood up to defend Rushdie, or to say that his right to enter the country trumped any offense felt by an individual or group. But a Muslim member of Parliament  demanded the arrest  of the writers, arguing that "Reading from a banned book is a deliberate provocation and proof that the festival is a forum for Islam-bashing." After a group of hardliners  demanded the cancellation  of the event, even the idea of a conversation with Rushdie via video link on the last day of the festival was finally abandoned by the festival organizers. In a stinging piece in Open magazine , its editor Manu Joseph made it clear that it was the government that was at fault for succumbing to the swagger of the religious fringe: And in Tehelka,  Shoma Chaudhury  wrote: But it might also be worth making a distinction between three types of opposition in India to freedom of speech. One is the absolutist kind, well represented by groups in both Hinduism and Islam, that sees violence or arson as a legitimate response to perceived insults. The second, often complicit with the first, is rooted in political apathy and a refusal to enforce the rule of law rooted in a calculation that standing up for the principle of freedom of expression isn't worth the perceived political cost. In this case, the Congress Party didn't want to jeopardize, through any action in defense of Rushdie, the investment of millions of rupees it is going to pour into its campaign to win Uttar Pradesh. But a third, more insidious kind of muzzle on the genuinely free expression of ideas in India is what one might call a soft opposition, or self-censorship. This is a section of well-meaning Indian opinion that honestly doesn't understand what individuals have to gain by rocking the boat of a particular religious order, and believes that "religious sentiments should always be respected" and art has no business to question or mock what is held by some to be sacred. As its representative, one might take the bestselling novelist Chetan Bhagat,  who said  about the controversy, "[Rushdie] is a hero as far as his others writings are concerned, but writing something that attacks somebody's god is not the right thing to do....I'll not make somebody who attacks my god a hero. This is India, you cannot hurt feelings here." It is true that freedom of speech, as  Rushdie observed  in a long interview with Barkha Dutt, is the source of all other freedoms. But, as the number of  hostile responses  to Kunzru's arguments on his website demonstrate, this idea is bound to be interpreted only in the context of the overall climate of freedom in the society in which its value is asserted. India is actually unfree in so many ways, ranging from the casual harassment of women on streets to the persistence of caste hierarchies in social life to the entrenched patriarchy and deference of family life to the persistent tendency to explain all events as manifestations of the divine will. It is a country where young people are brought up to "always respect their elders" and to think twice before speaking their mind -- basically, to be conformist, to value the old or accepted answer over the subversion of the new idea or question. It isn't especially surprising, then, that the notion of dissent and skepticism of absolute truths enshrined in the idea of freedom of speech has a limited appeal in India. Tolerance may be an idea with a long history here, but not freedom of speech. Perhaps the best result from the unsavory affair was the circulation of a petition demanding a reversal of the original sin: the banning of Rushdie's book in 1988. Proposed by the writer and literary critic Nilanjana Roy,  the petition says : By reversing the ban, the Indian state would also help reverse the creeping tide of intolerance and unreason that threatens today to swamp our public life.
