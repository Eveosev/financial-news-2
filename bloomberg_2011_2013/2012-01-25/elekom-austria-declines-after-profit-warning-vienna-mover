Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  fell after the
Alpine Republic’s former monopoly said late yesterday that 2011
net income would suffer a “significant negative impact” from
hyperinflation in Belarus.  Telekom Austria dropped for a third day, falling 1.8
percent to 8.88 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in
Vienna. The stock has declined 3.9 percent this year.  A 300 million-euro ($390 million) impairment was triggered
after Telekom Austria changed its accounting rules to recognize
hyperinflation in Belarus, the company said in a statement.
Belarusian December consumer prices rose 108.7 percent from a
year earlier, the state statistics committee reported earlier
this month.  Telekom Austria, which operates in seven eastern European
countries, cut its full-year targets in August after a drop in
the value of the Belarusian ruble. The company was cut one level
on Jan. 19 by Moody’s Investors Service after the company’s weak
operating performance strained the network operator’s finances.  A planned 38-cent-per-share dividend for 2011 and 2012
won’t be affected, Telekom  Austria  said. Management reiterated
it expects to announce full-year Ebitda of as much as 1.55
billion euros on revenue of around 4.5 billion euros when it
announces earnings on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
