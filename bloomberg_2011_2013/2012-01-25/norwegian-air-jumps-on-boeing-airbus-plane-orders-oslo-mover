Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NAS)  jumped in
Oslo after placing an order valued at a list price of 127
billion kroner ($21.5 billion) for 222 airplanes from  Boeing Co. (BA) 
and Airbus SAS.  The  shares  rose as much as 15 percent in Oslo trading and
were up 14 percent at 75 kroner as of 9:02 a.m. local time. The
company’s shares are up 35 percent this year.  Norwegian Air agreed to buy 100 Boeing 737 MAX8 planes and
100 Airbus A320neo aircraft, as well as 22 of Boeing’s existing
737-800 model, the Fornebu, Norway-based carrier said today.
Deliveries will start in 2016, it said. The airline also took
options for 100 737 MAX8s and 50 A320neos.  Boeing decided last year to offer the 737 MAX, a new
version of the world’s most widely flown airliner, to compete
with  Airbus (EAD) ’s A320neo aircraft in a global market for narrow-
body planes estimated at $2 trillion in the next 20 years.
Chicago-based Boeing said today that Norwegian Air Shuttle is
the first European customer for the MAX model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
