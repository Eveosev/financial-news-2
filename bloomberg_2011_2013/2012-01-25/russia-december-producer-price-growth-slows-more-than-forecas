Russian  producer-price  growth slowed
more than economists forecast in December.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 12 percent
from a year earlier after a 15.7 percent advance in November,
the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-
mailed statement. The median  estimate  of nine economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 15.4 percent increase.  Factory-gate prices rose 0.2 percent in December from a
month earlier after a 1.6 percent gain in November, the service
said. Economists forecast an increase of 0.8 percent, according
to the median of seven estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Manufacturing prices fell 0.8 percent last month from November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
