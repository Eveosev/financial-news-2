Chile’s peso fell for a second day,
heading for the biggest two-day decline among major Latin
American currencies, as the price of its main export, copper,
dropped.  The peso slid 0.3 percent to 494.40 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:08 a.m. in Santiago from 492.75 yesterday. The median
forecast of 60 traders and investors in a central bank survey
was that the peso would reach 490 in seven days.  Copper dropped after the  International Monetary Fund  warned
that fallout from the European debt crisis could derail global
growth and data from the U.K. showed  Europe ’s third-largest
economy on the brink of recession. The peso is retreating after
it broke through a previous high to reach the strongest in four
months, peaking at 486.43 per dollar on Jan. 23.  “This is a correction within an appreciative trend,” said
Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “We could get to 497.5 or
498 per dollar, but it should hold at that level. When we got
through 486 we were out of line with other emerging currencies,
so it has rebounded back.”  Were the peso to fall through 498 it could trigger a change
in trend and a retreat beyond 500 per dollar, Cortes said.  Investors had been using the Chilean peso to bet on global
growth, Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA in  New York , said yesterday. Offshore investors in
the Chilean peso forwards market reduced their short position in
the currency to $4.7 billion, the lowest in seven weeks, on Jan.
23 as the peso reached a four-month high, central bank data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
