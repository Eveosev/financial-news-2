Oil rose after Federal Reserve
officials said the U.S. benchmark  interest rate  will stay low
until at least 2014 to bolster growth and cut unemployment,
boosting fuel demand.  Futures advanced 0.5 percent as the  Federal Open Market
Committee  extended its previous pledge to keep rates low at
least until the middle of 2013. The Energy Department reported
that  total fuel consumption  increased 7.5 percent to 19.2
million barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 20.  “We’re up because of the FOMC statement,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst with the Schork Group Inc., a consulting
company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The Fed’s policy is good
for the economic outlook. This points to steady growth ahead,
which will be good for oil demand.”  Crude oil for March delivery rose 45 cents to settle at
$99.40 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
dropped to $97.53 early in the session. Prices are up 15 percent
from a year earlier.  Brent oil for March settlement declined 22 cents to end the
session at $109.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European contract’s premium to March crude
on the Nymex narrowed 67 cents to $10.41 a barrel at the close
of trading. That’s down from a record high of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The Fed said it would continue its “highly accommodative”
monetary policy.  “Easing credit is good for commodity markets,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.3 billion. “When the
money supply increases, investors buy commodities and
equities.”  Iranian Exports  Oil prices  have risen 1 percent so far this week after the
European Union announced Jan. 23 that it would ban imports from
 Iran  starting July 1 to pressure the country over its nuclear
program. Iran has threatened to close the  Strait of Hormuz , the
transit point for about a fifth of global oil supply, if an
embargo against its crude is implemented.  A halt of Iran’s oil exports to countries in the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development would
likely lead to a crude price increase of around 20 to 30
percent, or about $20 to $30 a barrel at current levels,
“without offset from other sources,” the  International
Monetary Fund  said in a document released today.  Oil in  New York  has traded in a $6.34 range for the past
month with futures staying between $97.40 and $103.74.  ‘Slowly Growing’  “Absent any supply disruption, we will continue to bounce
around where we are,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9
billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing
director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “It looks like
the economy will continue to trudge along, slowly expanding and
gaining strength.”  The Fed, in a separate statement today, lowered its
forecast for economic growth this year to 2.2 percent to 2.7
percent, down from a projection of 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in
November. It predicted the economy in 2013 will expand between
2.8 percent to 3.2 percent, down from a previous forecast of 3.0
percent to 3.5 percent.  The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously
owned homes fell in December from a 19-month high, showing the
stabilization in the market that began in late 2011 will extend
into the new year. The  index  of pending home sales decreased 3.5
percent last month after jumping a combined 18 percent in
October and November, figures from the National Association of
Realtors showed today in  Washington .  Fuel Stockpiles  U.S. gasoline output tumbled 2.8 percent last week to 8.54
million barrels, the least since February 2010, the Energy
Department report showed.  Crude oil  supplies  rose 3.56 million barrels to 334.8
million, the highest level since the week ended Dec. 2,
according to the department. Oil  imports  advanced 7.1 percent to
8.85 million barrels a day, the fourth increase in five weeks.  “Product demand is still pretty solid,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-
based energy consultant. “The sizable build in crude supplies
was more than balanced by the drop in product supplies.”  Gasoline (DOESTMGS)  inventories fell 390,000 barrels to 227.1 million
in the seven days ended Jan. 20, the first decline in four
weeks, the report showed. Supplies of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, dropped 2.46
million barrels to 145.5 million.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 2.88 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.8338 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement since Sept. 8.  Refineries operated at 82.2 percent of capacity, down 1.5
percentage point from the week before. It was the lowest
operating rate since May.  Ramping Up  “Refinery utilization will have to ramp up in the months
ahead in order to build up supplies before the summer demand
peak,” Khan said. “This will increase demand for crude.”  Gasoline consumption in the U.S. peaks during the summer,
when Americans take to the highways for vacations. The so-called
driving season lasts from the Memorial Day weekend in late May
to Labor Day in early September.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 584,742
contracts as of 4:15 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 484,488
yesterday, 20 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.34 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
