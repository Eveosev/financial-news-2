Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
its clients buy the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar versus
the U.S. currency, saying the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep
 interest rates  low reaffirms a dollar “weakening trend.”  The peso may advance to 12 per dollar from 13.019 today and
the Canadian currency will rise to 95 cents per U.S. dollar from
C$1.0043, analysts led by  Thomas Stolper  wrote in a note.  “We have argued repeatedly that the broad dollar weakness
theme remains intact as a result of the still very weak U.S.
balance of payments and a very dovish Fed,” the analysts wrote
today. The Fed’s pledge today to keep its benchmark borrowing
costs between zero and 0.25 percent until at least late 2014
“reaffirms our view that the dollar weakening trend is not
over,” they wrote.  The Mexican peso remains “cheap” while the country’s
balance of payments is “solid,” the analysts wrote. In  Canada ,
policy makers may not follow the Fed in pursuing a more
“proactive” monetary policy, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
