The law must change before people
such as Mitt Romney can be criticized for paying low taxes,
Carlyle Group LP founder  David Rubenstein  said.  “You change the law and they’ll pay the taxes,” he said
in a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum’s annual
meeting in Davos,  Switzerland . “Romney said, and I’m not his
defender, he’s paying whatever the law required. If you change
the law, change the law, but don’t criticize him for paying the
taxes that the law requires him to pay.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
