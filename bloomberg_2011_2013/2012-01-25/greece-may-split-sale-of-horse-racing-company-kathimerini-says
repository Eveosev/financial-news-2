Greece  may sell separately the
betting operations and the large real-estate assets of the
Hellenic Horse Racing Company, known as  ODIE , with the aim of
appealing to a wider range of investors,  Kathimerini  reported,
without citing anyone.  French gambling company PMU is interested in the right to
offer horse-race betting in Greece, the newspaper said.  The  Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund  will discuss
today the sale of ODIE and of state natural-gas supplier DEPA
and gas-grid operator DESFA, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
