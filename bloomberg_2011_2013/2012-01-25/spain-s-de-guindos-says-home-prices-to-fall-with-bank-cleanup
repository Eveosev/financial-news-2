A cleanup of real estate on the
books of Spanish banks will contribute to a decline in property
prices that will make homes available to more people, Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos said.  Spanish banks are “filling up” with real-estate assets
such as apartments that aren’t going to market because they’re
not being priced properly, de Guindos said in an interview with
state broadcaster TVE today. When they are priced at their real
value “we’ll find that the price of housing in  Spain  will fall
more, there’ll be an adjustment and it will be available for a
lot more people,” he said.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government has pledged to
cleanup real-estate assets such as building land and unfinished
apartment complexes that have piled up on the books of the
country’s banks as part of its strategy to bolster growth and
confidence in the economy. Spanish lenders have 176 billion
euros ($228 billion) of  “troubled” assets  related to real
estate on their balance sheets, according to the Bank of Spain.  House  prices , which more than doubled in the decade through
2007, turned negative in the first quarter of 2008 and have
since fallen by about 17 percent, according to the Ministry of
Development and Public Works. Prices fell 8.2 percent in 2011,
accelerating their slide, and sellers should brace for further
declines this year, the property website Idealista.com said last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
