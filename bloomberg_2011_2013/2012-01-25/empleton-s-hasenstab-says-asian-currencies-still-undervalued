Michael Hasenstab , a  San Mateo ,
California-based portfolio manager who runs the $57 billion
U.S.-incorporated  Templeton Global Bond Fund (TPINX) , comments on the
European Central Bank’s policy to deal with the debt crisis in a
statement issued today.  “The ECB has launched its version of quantitative easing
which now augments the extraordinarily loose monetary policy of
the U.S., Japan and U.K. We now see the most aggressive printing
of money in modern times. While this aims to address domestic
conditions, most notably to ease the deleveraging of domestic
banks, capital cannot be contained within national borders.  “Given open  capital markets , abundant global liquidity
will continue to flow into Asian markets blessed with strong
macro fundamentals, particularly as the region’s currencies
still appear largely undervalued.  “Unlike  Europe  or the U.S., Asia has built up plenty of
room to provide fiscal stimulus and to lower interest rates in
response to a worsening external environment as debt levels
remain low and interest rates were preemptively hiked at the end
of the recession.  “For example, Korean government debt levels have been
slashed over the last decade and international reserves now well
exceed levels seen before the global financial crisis.  “And the largest economies like China, India and Indonesia
can count on robust and resilient domestic demand to counter
external demand weakness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
