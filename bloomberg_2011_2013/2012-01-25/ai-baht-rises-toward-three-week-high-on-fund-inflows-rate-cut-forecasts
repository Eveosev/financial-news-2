Thailand ’s baht approached a three-
week high after international investors increased their holdings
of the nation’s assets amid speculation economic growth will
accelerate this year.  The currency has advanced 1.5 percent since the start of
last week as global funds bought $1.7 billion more debt than
they sold in eight days of  net purchases  through yesterday,
according to data from the Thai Bond Market Association. The
Bank of Thailand may cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a
quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent today, according to
all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Fund inflows mainly came from optimism about the
situation in the  euro zone ,” said Amonthep Chawla, a Bangkok-
based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl. “Action by the central bank
is a sign that they are going to do something to stimulate the
economy and that gives a boost to investors.”  The baht rose as much as 0.4 percent to 31.38 per dollar
and traded little changed at 31.48 as of 8:51 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.35
yesterday, the strongest level since Jan. 4. Kasikornbank
expects the currency to appreciate to 29.50 by the end of this
year, Amonthep said.  Exchange data show overseas investors purchased a net $18
million of Thai equities yesterday amid easing concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis will worsen.  Thailand’s central bank trimmed its one-day bond repurchase
 rate  for the first time in more than two years at its last
policy review on Nov. 30 to help the nation recover from the
worst floods in almost 70 years. Today’s decision is due at 2:30
p.m. local time.  The Bank of Thailand is predicting economic growth of 4.8
percent this year, compared with a forecast 1.8 percent
expansion for 2011.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government notes due June
2017 was unchanged at 3.08 percent, the lowest level since Jan.
16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
