Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after a government report showed inventories in the region fell
to the lowest level since Nov. 11.  Gasoline stockpiles in the Gulf Coast declined 1.9 million
barrels to 73 million barrels last week, according to the Energy
Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.33 cent to 3 cents versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:08 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 4.88 cents to
$2.8261 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  held at a premium of 2.13
cents a gallon.  Hess Corp. may shut the fluid catalytic cracker at the Port
Reading refinery in  New Jersey  for about three weeks, the
company said today.  The 70,000-barrel-a-day plant lost $6 million in the fourth
quarter, Chief Financial Officer John P. Rielly said during a
quarterly conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
