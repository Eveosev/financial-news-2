The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose two basis points to 331 at 11 a.m. in London.
An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed seven
basis points to 643, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 151.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 8.5 basis points to 234 and
the subordinated index rose nine to 414.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
