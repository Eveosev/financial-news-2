Lincoln National Corp. (LNC)  and  MetLife
Inc. (MET)  led insurers lower after investors bet they’ll struggle to
maintain bond-portfolio income as the  Federal Reserve  said its
benchmark interest rate will stay low until at least late 2014.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, dropped 96 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $35.95 at 4:01 p.m. in New York trading.
Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Lincoln slipped 4 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee today extended an earlier
pledge to keep rates  low  until at least the middle of 2013. U.S.
life insurers hold more than $2 trillion in bonds including
corporate debt, municipal securities and mortgage-linked assets.
The companies use the holdings to cover policyholder obligations
and generate profits.  Results at life insurers will “be pressured in 2012 due to
low  interest rates , increased hedging costs and ongoing market
volatility,”  Fitch Ratings  said in a statement on the industry
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
