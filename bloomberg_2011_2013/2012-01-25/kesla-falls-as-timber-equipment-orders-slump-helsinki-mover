Kesla Oyj (KELAS) , the Finnish maker of
trucks and cranes used by the forestry industry, dropped the
most in five months in Helsinki trading after saying sales will
shrink, ending two years of expansion.  Kesla fell as much as 13 percent, the most since Aug. 4,
making it today’s biggest decliner in OMX Helsinki All-Share
Index. The stock fell 1 euro to 6.50 euros at 4:23 p.m. in
 Finland ’s capital with trading volume more than five times the
three-month average. The shares of the Joensuu-based company
gained 61 percent last year.  Kesla said today that 2012 sales and profit will decline
after it experienced a sudden slow-down in the fourth quarter of
2011 when operating profit plunged 78 percent. Finnish
papermakers  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  and  Stora Enso Oyj (STEAV)  have closed mills
as they face competition from South American and Asian
producers.  Kesla will lay off employees for as long as 90 days during
2012 in its Finnish factories of Joensuu and Kesaelahti, as
orders are falling short of production capacity, Chief Executive
Officer Jari Nevalainen said Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
