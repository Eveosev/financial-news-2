LSI Corp. (LSI) , a maker of chips used in
computer disk drives, rose as much as 10 percent in late trading
yesterday after forecasting first-quarter revenue that surpassed
analysts’ estimates.  First-quarter  sales  from continuing operations will be $550
million to $590 million, the Milpitas, California-based company
said yesterday in a statement. That compares with the $508.7
million average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The forecast reflects market-share gains and new orders
from large customers, Chief Executive Officer Abhi Talwalkar
said in the statement. Demand for LSI’s technology, which
handles the transfer of data between disks and computers, is
climbing as customers upgrade mobile networks and data centers,
used to handle cloud computing, he said.  “We enter 2012 building on strong business momentum and
are accelerating our revenue growth,” Talwalkar said.  LSI  rose  to as high as $7.80 in extended trading yesterday,
after closing at $7.08 on the New York Stock Exchange. The
shares have climbed 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
