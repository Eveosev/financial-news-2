Western nations have three or four
years to fix their “severe problems” and reduce debt, or else
Chinese-style “state capitalism” will prevail, according to
 David Rubenstein , co-founder of  Carlyle Group (CG) .  “The game will be over for the type of capitalism many of
us lived through,” Rubenstein said today at a panel discussion
organized by Time magazine at the World Economic Forum’s annual
meeting in Davos,  Switzerland .  State-capitalist countries “have the most efficient model
right now,” he said. “We have to solve our debt problems, our
deficit problems. We have three or four years to improve our
economic model. Otherwise we have lost the game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
