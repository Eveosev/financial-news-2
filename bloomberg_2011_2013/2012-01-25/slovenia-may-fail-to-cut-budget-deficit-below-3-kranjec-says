Slovenia will probably fail to cut
its  budget deficit  to below 3 percent of gross domestic product
by 2013 as mandated by the euro region’s stability pact, central
bank Governor Marko Kranjec said in an interview with
 Demokracija .  “Current trends show this will be very difficult to
achieve since our budget gap is still around 6 percent,”
Kranjec was quoted as saying by the Ljubljana-based magazine in
a preview of an interview to be published tomorrow. “The
problem is the primary deficit, which is the difference between
expenditures and receipts excluding interest payments. If we
don’t cut the primary deficit we will still be on ratings
companies’ watch lists.”  The Slovenian banking system’s liquidity has improved since
December, when the  European Central Bank  offered three-year
loans to lenders, Kranjec said.  “Refinancing with three-year loans through the ECB is a
good measure, which will enable the government to borrow money,
but probably at a higher cost,” Kranjec, who’s also a member of
the ECB governing council, said.  Slovenian banks will set aside about 900 million euros
($1.16 billion) for 2011 to cover bad loans and asset
writedowns, according to Kranjec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
