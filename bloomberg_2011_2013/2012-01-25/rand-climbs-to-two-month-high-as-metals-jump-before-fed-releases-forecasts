The rand weakened to its lowest in a
week against the dollar on concern that the global economic
recovery is faltering and after  Greece ’s debt talks have reached
a stalemate damped demand for riskier assets.  South Africa’s currency depreciated as much as 1.6 percent
to 8.0658 per dollar, the weakest level since Jan. 18 on an
intraday basis, and traded 1.1 percent down at 8.0268 as of 4:31
p.m. in Johannesburg. It declined 0.6 percent against the euro
to 10.4065 and 0.9 percent against the pound to 12.5007.  “People were thinking the recovery has started, but
they’re coming to the rude awakening that we’re not out of the
woods by a long way,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at
Johannesburg-based Bidvest Bank Ltd., which runs South Africa’s
largest chain of money changers, said by phone. “There is still
a lot of uncertainty around.”  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of raw material prices
declined for a second day and  South Africa ’s benchmark stock
 index  dropped after the International Monetary Fund yesterday
cut its forecast for global growth and warned that the European
debt crisis threatens to derail the world economy. The U.K.
economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, leaving
Britain on the brink of another recession. The  European Central
Bank  was said to be opposed to the restructuring of Greek bonds,
adding to concern the nation will fail to win a deal to reduce
its debt.  The rand reached 7.8965 per dollar earlier in the session
today, its strongest level since Nov. 14. Demand for the
courrency at around 7.90 per dollar, a so-called resistance
level, sparked its initial retreat, De Vleeschauwer said. A
resistance level is a price level where a security is expected
to receive sell orders.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 fell for the
first time in three days, driving the yield up one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
