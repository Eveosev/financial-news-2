Britain’s government will compensate
owners of U.K.-registered trucks who will face a daily charge of
as much as 10 pounds ($15.6) to use their vehicles by 2015,
Transport Minister Mike Penning said.  The U.K. is seeking ways to charge foreign hauliers to use
Britain’s roads without hurting U.K. lorry drivers. European
Union rules prevent the U.K. from charging only trucks with
foreign plates. About 1.5 million trips a year are made by such
vehicles.  “We want to ensure that U.K. hauliers get a fairer deal
and help maintain the competitiveness of our logistics
industry,” Penning said in a statement released by his office
in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
