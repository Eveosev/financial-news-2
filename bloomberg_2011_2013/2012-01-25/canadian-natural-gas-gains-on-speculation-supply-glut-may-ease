Canadian natural gas fell for the
first time in four days as mild U.S. weather pared demand for
furnace fuels.  Alberta  gas fell 7.2 percent. Heating demand in the U.S.
will trail normal by 24 percent through Feb. 2, according to
forecaster Weather Derivatives. Chicago’s low will be 34 degrees
Fahrenheit (1 Celsius) on Jan. 31, 15 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. Gas had gained for three days
after  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said it will pare output.  “Weather is king,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research
with IAF Advisors in Houston. “Nature continues to trump the
production cuts.”  Alberta gas for February delivery dropped 17.5 cents to
C$2.245 a gigajoule ($2.13 per million British thermal units) at
11:45 a.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX
Alberta gas has slipped 15 percent this month.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  fell 14.9 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $2.58
per million Btu as of 12:15 p.m.  U.S. inventories fell 192 billion cubic feet, or 5.8
percent, to 3.098 trillion cubic feet last week, according to
the Energy Department. Stockpiles had been expected to fall 175
billion cubic feet, the median of analyst estimates compiled by
 Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  Pipeline Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 31 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.41 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.14 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 292 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.73 billion cubic feet today, or 86 percent of its
capacity of 2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.06
billion cubic feet at 11:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
