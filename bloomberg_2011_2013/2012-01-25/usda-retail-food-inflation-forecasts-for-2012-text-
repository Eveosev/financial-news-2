Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture:  Food Price Outlook, 2012  Food prices surged in the final quarter of 2011, resulting in
annual price inflation slightly above ERS’s expectations for
beef and veal, eggs, and fats and oils. The food-at-home
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI) increased more than expected--4.8
percent in 2011--which means that food price inflation was not
as strong as in 2008 when it increased 6.4 percent over 2007.
With inflationary pressures not expected to intensify in 2012,
this higher starting point for food prices translates into a
moderated outlook for inflation in 2012.  The CPI for all food is projected to increase 2.5 to 3.5 percent
in 2012, with food-at-home (grocery store) prices also forecast
to increase 2.5 to 3.5 percent and food-away-from-home
(restaurant) prices forecast to increase 2 to 3 percent. The
average annual increase for food-at-home prices between 1990 and
2011 was 2.8 percent, and ERS’s current outlook for 2012 falls
within the historical average for food price inflation. All ERS
forecasts for 2012 assume normal weather conditions and no
shocks to the global market for major commodities.  See ERS data on CPI for food and CPI forecasts
December 2011 Prices (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  The CPI for all food increased 0.2 percent from November to
December 2011, increased 0.1 percent from October to November
2011, and is now 4.7 percent above the December 2010 level. The
food-at-home CPI increased 0.3 percent in December 2011 and is
up 6.0 percent from last December, while the food-away-from-home
index was up 0.2 percent in December 2011 and is 2.9 percent
above last December. Food commodity and energy price increases
over the past year, combined with a weak  U.S. dollar , have
caused most of the grocery store price increases observed in
2011. The all-items CPI was down 0.2 percent in December and is
3.0 percent above the December 2010 level. The 2011 all-food CPI
increased more than both the all-items CPI and the fuel CPI,
highlighting the fact that many inflationary factors of the past
year were strongest for food markets or specific to food markets.  Beef prices were up 0.9 percent in December and are 11.5 percent
above last December, with steak prices up 11 percent and ground
beef prices up 11.9 percent. Pork prices decreased 1 percent in
December and are 8.1 percent above last December’s level.
Poultry prices increased 1 percent in December and are 4.8
percent above prices last year at this time, with chicken prices
up 2.9 percent and other poultry prices (including turkey) up
12.4 percent. Beef and pork prices are expected to exceed 2011
levels--by 4 to 5 percent for beef and 3 to 4 percent for pork--
as cattle and hog inventories are expected to remain low
relative to demand. Retail poultry prices are expected to
increase 3 to 4 percent in 2012.  Egg prices increased 1.4 percent in December 2011; egg prices
are now 6.4 percent above the December 2010 level. The inventory
of table egg-laying hens in the U.S. decreased for much of 2011,
and drought conditions throughout the South have reduced output,
contributing to the surge in prices in the final quarter of 2011.
However, egg prices are expected to stabilize in 2012,
increasing 1 to 2 percent over 2011 levels.  Fish and seafood prices were up 0.7 percent from November to
December 2011 and are 6.8 percent above the December 2010 level.
Japanese output is expected to continue recovering throughout
2012, but seafood prices should remain high in 2012. The current
outlook is for an increase in prices of 4 to 5 percent.  Dairy prices were down 0.1 percent from November to December
2011, compared with a 0.3-percent increase from October to
November 2011. Dairy prices are now 8.1 percent above the
December 2010 level. Within the dairy category, prices changed
as follows in December: milk prices were down 0.1 percent and
are 9.2 percent above last December’s prices; cheese prices were
down 1.0 percent and are 7.8 percent above last December’s
level; ice cream and related product prices were up 0.7 percent
and are 9 percent above last December’s level; and butter prices
decreased 0.5 percent this month and are 1.9 percent below last
December. Fluid milk prices are expected to level off early in
2012 and to remain below the average 2010 farm price. The export
market for milk will be a significant factor in the coming year,
but current expectations are for retail dairy prices to increase
2 to 3 percent over 2011 levels.  Fresh fruit prices increased 0.6 percent in December, and the
fresh fruit index is down 0.5 percent overall from last year at
this time, with apple prices up 7.1 percent, banana prices up
3.6 percent, citrus fruit prices down 3.8 percent, and other
fresh fruit prices down 3 percent. The fresh vegetable index
decreased 0.1 percent in December. Since last year at this time,
fresh vegetable prices are up 2.4 percent, with potato prices up
7.4 percent, lettuce prices unchanged, tomato prices up 1.3
percent, and other fresh vegetable prices up 1.9 percent from
this time last year. Fresh fruit prices are expected to increase
3 to 4 percent and fresh vegetable prices 1 to 2 percent in 2012.
Processed fruit and vegetable prices increased 0.6 percent in
December and are 7.0 percent above the December 2010 level. The
contracts within the processed fruit and vegetable industry have
kept price inflation below that for fresh fruits and vegetables
throughout 2011, but 2012 prices are expected to reflect
increased fuel and commodity costs. The processed fruit and
vegetable index is forecast to increase 3 to 4 percent in 2012.  Cereal and bakery product prices increased 0.2 percent from
November to December 2011 and are up 6.1 percent from last year
at this time, with bread prices up 6.7 percent and breakfast
cereal prices up 6.5 percent over the past year. Lower yields
for hard red varieties of wheat due to a number of weather-
related factors raised wheat prices for 2011. However, these
price increases have not been passed on to retail prices to the
extent expected, and the cereals and bakery index is expected to
increase 3.5 to 4.5 percent in 2012. Sugar and sweets prices
were up 0.4 percent in December and are 3.8 percent above last
December. The 2012 outlook is for an increase of 2 to 3 percent
over 2011 levels. Prices for nonalcoholic beverages, including
coffee and carbonated beverages, are down 0.1 percent in
December 2011 and are up 5.8 percent from last year. This index
is forecast to increase 1.5 to 2.5 percent in 2012.  The index for fats and oils was up 1.2 percent from November to
December 2011 and is 13.5 percent above the December 2010 level.
The significant price increases in 2011 were due in large part
to surging soybean prices which are expected to stabilize
somewhat. The fats and oils index is projected to increase an
additional 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2012.
Background on the CPI for Food  Although ERS analyzes changes in retail prices for individual
food items, sometimes it is useful to record and analyze a
measure of change for the overall level of food prices.  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) is the most publicized and most
widely used measure of the general level of prices in the  U.S.
economy . The CPI is a composite measure of the level of average
prices paid by urban consumers for a defined market basket of
goods and services, including food.  The CPI for food at home is a component of the full CPI and is
the principal indicator of changes in retail food prices.
Policymakers, both public and private, closely follow the CPI
for food consumed at home and its changes, which measure price
inflation for food items. The CPI for food consumed at home also
affects policy evaluation because the effects of many current
and proposed policies are evaluated based on CPI measures. To
contribute to the analysis of government and commercial
decisionmakers, ERS estimates the future direction of changes in
the CPI for all food, food at home, and food away from home (see
data on the CPI for food forecasts).  The food price level can be influenced by changes in costs
incurred by food system firms. Changes in input costs can
translate directly into changes in the CPI or may have little or
no effect. Researchers at ERS not only produce forecasts of the
CPI but also analyze the impact of economic factors on changes
in the CPI, including changes in firms’ costs.  SOURCE:   U.S. Department of Agriculture   To contact the reporter on this story:
