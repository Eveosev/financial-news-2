The European Union’s Solvency II
rules for insurers may be introduced two years later than
planned,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing an unnamed
insurance executive familiar with the situation.  The rules may be introduced in 2015 instead of 2013 and
take full effect in 2016 instead of 2014, the newspaper said in
an e-mailed preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  The article cited a spokeswoman for EU Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  as saying the European Commission
“regrets this delay and is still working resolutely toward a
speedy introduction of the Solvency II rules.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
