The Nikkei 225 Stock Average  may
almost double this year as the Japanese return to equities
seeking higher returns on $19 trillion in household savings,
according to Atsuto Sawakami, chairman of the country’s largest
independent mutual fund.  Japan ’s benchmark index may hit 16,000 by year’s end, said
Sawakami, whose fund has outperformed the  Topix Index (TPX)  in 10 of
the past 12 years. Once shares start to rebound, he said, gains
will snowball as money pours in from Japan’s households, which
have 1.5 quadrillion yen in assets, an amount bigger than the
 U.S. economy . About 85 percent of that wealth is sleeping in
life insurance and savings accounts with  interest rates  around
zero percent, according to the  Bank of Japan .  “There’s a lot of energy out there waiting to be
released,” the 64-year-old investor said in an interview at the
Tokyo headquarters of  Sawakami Asset Management Inc. (SAAP)  “Once
things start to move, you’ll see a lot of money shift into
stocks from savings.”  Four  recessions  and a 77 percent slide in stocks over the
past two decades has led Japan’s households to be wary. They
keep just 5.6 percent of their wealth in equities, compared with
21 percent in 1989 when the Nikkei peaked at 38,916.  Sawakami predicted a rebound last year only to watch
March’s earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear meltdowns
drive the index down 17 percent. That compares with the 11
percent drop for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  amid the region’s
debt crisis.  Pent-Up Demand  Renewed U.S. demand for products such as  Toyota (7203)  Motor
Corp.’s Prius hybrid car will trigger a Japanese rally this year,
Sawakami said. Consumers in the world’s biggest economy are
holding on to their cars and trucks for a record 10.8 years on
average as  job security  and other economic worries keep them
from buying big-ticket items, research firm  R.L. Polk & Co.  said
last week.  “That can’t go on forever,” Sawakami said. “You could
see an explosion in consumer demand.”  His forecast makes even the most bullish investors look
conservative. Some 21 strategists and investors surveyed by
Bloomberg News last month estimated the Nikkei will rise 19
percent this year to 10,000.  The  benchmark  slipped 0.4 percent to 8849.47 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. The gauge has risen about 4.7 percent this year,
compared with a 5.4 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and a 4.3 percent gain for the Stoxx 600 in  Europe .  Sawakami isn’t the only investor betting that Japanese
households may fuel a rebound.  ‘Mrs. Homemaker’  “No one, including ‘Mrs. Homemaker,’ has any significant
amount of money invested in Japan, and when they start to move,
people won’t want to miss it,” David Herro, chief investment
officer at Harris Associates LP in  Chicago  and Morningstar’s
international manager of the decade, said last month.  Herro said he started adding “aggressively” to his
Japanese holdings last year and a quarter of his $7.8 billion
Oakmark International Fund is now invested in the country. “You
can hear the stories: ‘Oh, the cheapest developed market in the
world. It’s finally hit bottom, time to get in.’”  An investment strategy focused on exporters such as Toyota
and tiremaker  Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  has helped Sawakami outperform
the Japanese market. His  fund  has posted a total return of 8.2
percent since it started in August 1999, compared with a 50
percent loss for the Nikkei.  Mutual Fund Maverick  The former head of Pictet & Cie in Japan, Sawakami
pioneered selling investments directly to individuals after the
country ended a monopoly held by brokerages in 1998. Using
lecture tours and more than 20 published books, he built the
 Sawakami Fund (71311998)  into the country’s biggest commission-free fund
with 203 billion yen under management, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The fund is second in size to FMR LLC’s  Fidelity Japan
Growth Fund (32311984)  among actively managed Japanese mutual funds that
invest in domestic stocks, the data shows.  “It would take 3,600 years to double your money in a
Japanese savings account at 0.02 percent,” Sawakami said,
repeating a sales pitch he makes to his audiences of Japanese
workers and housewives. “So when the market finally starts to
go up, investors are going to respond.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
