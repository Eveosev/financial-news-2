Global markets are improving and
would be steadied if the Greek debt crisis is resolved,
according to  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive Officer  James
Gorman .  “The tone is a little better,” Gorman, 53, said today in
a Bloomberg Television interview from Davos,  Switzerland , where
he’s attending the  World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting. A deal
to settle  Greece ’s dispute with creditors is “very close to the
finish line,” he said.  Gorman presided over the only increase in trading revenue
among the five largest Wall Street banks in 2011, excluding
accounting gains, and the  stock jumped  20 percent this year
through yesterday. New York-based Morgan Stanley owns the
world’s largest brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
