OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, headed for its best close in almost two months as the
ruble strengthened against the dollar and RIA Novosti said
retail-lending growth will accelerate.  The shares, which have a 13 percent weighting in the 30-
stock Micex Index, climbed as much as 3.4 percent and last
traded 2.2 percent higher at 86.91 rubles as of 3:32 p.m. in
Moscow, poised for their strongest level since Dec. 5.  Retail deposits will grow 20 percent this year after an
18.1 percent gain in 2011, state-run RIA reported, citing
Sberbank department head Dmitry Oguryayev.  The Russian currency added 0.5 percent to 30.7074 versus
the dollar today. A close that that price would be its best
since Nov. 15. A stronger ruble discourages Russians from
withdrawing and converting ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main
source of funding.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
