BMO Capital Markets, the investment-
banking unit of  Bank of Montreal , hired Michael Cippoletti from
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  to oversee U.S. equity capital markets.  Cippoletti, 40, will be a managing director and based in
New York, the Toronto-based bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. Cippoletti has 15 years’ experience and was a
managing director in Morgan Stanley’s equity capital markets
group, according to the statement.  “He has experience in leading transactions and experience
in a broad swath of industries that we’re focused on,” Perry Hoffmeister, head of U.S. investment and corporate banking, said
in an interview from Chicago.  Cippoletti, an Amherst College graduate, had responsibility
for oil-and-gas and health care transactions at Morgan Stanley,
according to the statement. He replaces William Schreier, who is
retiring.  “Building BMO’s equity capital markets business is truly a
unique opportunity,” Cippoletti said in a telephone interview
from  New York . “There’s not an opportunity like it anywhere on
 Wall Street  right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
