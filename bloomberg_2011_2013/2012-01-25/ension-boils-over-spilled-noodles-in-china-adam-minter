Fifteen years after political reunification, a skirmish over spilled, instant noodles has shown how far the citizens of  Hong Kong  and mainland China have to go before they can unify socially. Sometime last week, a mainland child, yet to be named, was traveling with her mother, also yet to be named, on a Hong Kong subway train. The child was eating dry noodles in the train car and spilled a few on the floor. Eating is prohibited in Hong Kong’s subway cars, and several Hong Kong locals, harboring a serious passion for subway protocol,  scolded  the little girl and her mother. A  video of the confrontation  has gone viral in both Hong Kong and on the mainland, engendering the sort of bitter ethnic and class-based recriminations more commonly associated with rival nationalities than rival provinces. In the video, a Hong Kong man demands an apology from the mother –- and her young daughter -- for the spilled noodles. The mother, exasperated, responds that it is "not a big deal." Soon after, one of the Hong Kongers presses the car’s emergency button, summoning subway staff. A staff member arrives and explains the rules to the mother, who tries to explain the situation. But a shouting match ensues between her and the Hong Kongers. As the video ends, a Hong Kong man says dismissively: “No need to talk  to them; all mainland people are like this.” Hong Kongers grew up accustomed to thinking of mainland Chinese as poor country cousins. A city proud of its British heritage is now part of a country that many Hong Kongers still perceive as an authoritarian, provincial backwater. It’s a quantifiable phenomenon: According to a  December 2011 poll  conducted by the Public Opinion Program at the University of Hong Kong, only 16.6 percent of Hong Kongers identify first as Chinese citizens. Yet today, Hong Kongers depend on mainlanders for investments, tourism and political largesse. The antipathy goes both ways. In the past week, many mainland netizens have taken to Sina Weibo, the country's most popular microblogging website, to rail against Hong Kong residents. Ma Ziqiang, the general manager of 525j.com, an online home-improvement marketplace,  wrote : Another mainland netizen who uses the handle " Ashows " was determined to remind Hong Kongers who’s boss in their complicated relationship: But Chinese microbloggers can't compare with Kong Qingdong, who unleashed a burst of divisive vitriol on an online talk show, broadcast by the popular news portal,  v1.cn . Kong is an alleged 73rd generation descendant of Confucius himself, a faculty member of the elite  Peking University , a hyper-nationalist crank and a go-to source for Chinese reporters looking to inject some crazy into their stories. His  interview , conducted by the innocent-looking talk show host Shi Fei is one for the ages. As Kong and Shi watched the video, he told her to pay attention to the two languages spoken in it, the Cantonese spoken by Hong Kongers (which he characterizes as a mere dialect) and Mandarin Chinese: That was just the start. A moment later he addressed the sensitive matter of Hong Kong’s political identity: If Hong Kongers can’t take the mainland Chinese heat, Kong advised pointedly,  “Go ask for help from your British daddy.” Kong’s wild rants traditionally have garnered considerable opposition in mainland China; students have even  called for his dismissal  from Peking University. But this tear -- particularly his contention that Hong Kongers are dogs -- has received considerable online support. Huang Yigang , deputy editor at Youth Times, a major newspaper in Hangzhou run by the Communist Party, championed Kong's sentiment on Weibo: Perhaps the best proof that Kong’s over-the-top interview resonates with everyday Chinese is the call for its censorship. One particularly interesting advocate for this is  Yang Jinlin , a mainlander who runs Hong Kong TV. In mainland China, Hong Kong and  Taiwan , Yang is a popular and influential political commentator, especially on the topic of cross-Strait relations. Thus his concern over the ethnic-baiting at the heart of Kong’s attack is worthy of attention: So far, the video of the Kong interview remains widely available -- and is even being heavily promoted on the  v1.cn  website. Perhaps the censors, like most Chinese, are taking time off during the Chinese New Year holiday. Or, alternatively, the propaganda bureaucracy has no objection to Kong’s rant. Hao Tiechun, the Minister of Propaganda at Beijing’s Hong Kong liaison office, publicly criticized the December survey in which less than a fifth of Hong Kong citizens identified themselves as Chinese first, suggesting that foreign consultants interfered with the polling. Beijing’s propaganda mandarins are ever vigilant over internal ethnic and class-based discord; they might just refrain from censoring those who assign the blame for the discord on haughty Hong Kongers still enthralled with their colonial past. Yet a serious issue remains for the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing: the two sides -- despite many years of togetherness -- remain distant. On Weibo, Yang Jinlin  pointed out  a parallel divide between the mainland and Taiwan: Yang’s commentary is a remarkable bit of soul searching, especially since it emanated from little more than a handful of ramen smuggled into a subway car.
