Russian stocks  advanced the most in
a week as Apple Inc.’s better-than-expected quarterly results
helped lift stock prices globally and the ruble surged to its
strongest level in more than two months.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 0.9 percent to 1,501.52 by
12:04 p.m. in Moscow, heading for its biggest daily advance
since Jan. 17.  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  and  VTB Group (VTBR) , the country’s two
largest banks, increased as ruble surged to 30.6332 per dollar,
its strongest level since Nov. 15. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index added 1.5 percent to 1,538.05, poised for its highest
close since Dec. 5.  European and Asian stocks rose today after Apple’s
quarterly profit more than doubled, beating analyst estimates,
and as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Open Market
Committee’s forecasts for its key  interest rate . Brent oil for
March settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
was at $110.25 a barrel, up 25 cents.  “Global markets are driving Russian indexes higher as
investors look more upbeat after Apple results exceeded
estimates,” Alexander Zakharov, head of international equity
sales at Finam Investment Co, in Moscow, said by e-mail. “We
could expect some fund inflows into equities since the stocks
are cheap and most of the bad news related to a possible
recession in  Europe  and a slowdown in the world economy is
priced in.”  Sberbank jumped 2.7 percent, the biggest advance in the
Micex Index today, to 87.27 rubles, heading for its strongest
close since Dec. 5. VTB advanced 1.6 percent to 6.652 kopeks,
poised for its highest level since Dec. 8.  Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s largest oil company, rose 0.4 percent to
229.60 rubles, while  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the state-controlled gas
export monopoly, jumped 1.3 percent to 185.50 rubles, erasing
yesterday’s 0.5 percent drop.  The Micex is up 7.1 percent this year and trades at 5.7
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies.  The gauge retreated 17 percent in 2011, compared with an 18
percent drop for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which is valued at 9.9
times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 9.6 times
estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 15.1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
