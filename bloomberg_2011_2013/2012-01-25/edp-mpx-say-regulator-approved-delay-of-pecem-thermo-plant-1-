EDP- Energias do Brasil  SA and  MPX (MPXE3) 
Energia SA, an energy company controlled by Brazilian
billionaire  Eike Batista , said the country’s power regulator
Aneel allowed the companies to postpone the start of operations
of the Pecem thermoelectric plant, according to a filing today.  Energia Pecem, as the plant is known, is located in
Brazil’s northeastern state of Ceara, and it’s a joint venture
with equal stakes by  EDP (EDP)  and MPX. It has an installed capacity
of 720 megawatts.  EDP and MPX will be allowed to postpone by 60 days the
start of operations of the plant’s first turbine, while the
second turbine will be allowed to go online 150 days later than
originally planned, the companies said in two separate filings
today. The companies didn’t reveal the original deadlines for
the turbines to go online.  -- Editors: Charles Siler, Susan Warren  To contact the reporter on this story:
