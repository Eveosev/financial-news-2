The agency replacing the U.K.’s
financial regulator will be stricter in  policing banks  than its
predecessor, including banning products it decides are
“inherently flawed,” the authority’s chief said.  The Financial Conduct Authority, which is due to start work
in 2013, will use “specialist teams” to probe lenders’
activities, Martin Wheatley, the agency’s chief executive-
designate, said at a banking conference in  London  today. The
regulator will need to make “better, bolder and faster
decisions” than the Financial Services Authority, he said.  “Intervention could be a ban on the sale of a particular
type of product to all customers, or to certain categories of
customer,” Wheatley said. He called on U.K lawmakers to give
the FCA enough flexibility to use the powers.  The FCA will take over consumer protection tasks currently
carried out by the FSA, which is being abolished as part of a
supervisory overhaul in the wake of the financial crisis that
followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
