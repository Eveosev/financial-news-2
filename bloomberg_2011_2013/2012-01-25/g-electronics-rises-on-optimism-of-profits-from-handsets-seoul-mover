LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s
third-largest maker of mobile phones, rose the most in more than
a month in  Seoul  trading amid optimism that its handset business
may have returned to profit.  LG  advanced  4.1 percent to 77,100 won at the 3:00 p.m.
close, the highest level since Dec. 21. The benchmark Kospi
index rose 0.1 percent to 1,952.23.  LG, whose handset unit has lost money for six straight
 quarters , said in November it plans to raise 1.06 trillion won
($940 million) in a rights offer and will invest more than half
the proceeds in turning around the unprofitable mobile-phone
business. LG’s shares dropped 35 percent over the past 12 months,
while its rival  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  gained 14 percent.  “The current share price is pretty low compared to other
tech stocks,” Kim Woon Ho, a Seoul-based analyst at Hanwha
Securities Co., said by telephone “We’ve been telling investors
to reduce holdings of other stocks and buy LG lately.”  The handset division probably returned to profit in the
fourth quarter, Kim said. Sales at the air conditioning business
will start picking up in the first quarter, while other
technology companies typically report slower sales in that
period from the previous quarter, he said.  The Seoul-based company will report fourth-quarter earnings.  Samsung Electronics Co. continued its advance today,
closing at record 1.114 million won in Seoul.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , which supplies memory chips to
Apple Inc., rose 1.9 percent to 27,450 won. Apple yesterday
reported quarterly profit that more than doubled after a record
37 million iPhones were sold in the fiscal first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
