ConocoPhillips and  China  National
Offshore Oil Corp. will pay about $160 million to compensate
Chinese fishermen for losses arising from oil leaks in the
country’s biggest pollution settlement in at least six years.  The companies reached an agreement with the agriculture
ministry to pay 1 billion yuan, Conoco, the third-largest U.S.
oil company, said in a statement today. That’s more than four
times the 234 million yuan ($37 million) 29 fishermen had sought
in a lawsuit for the loss of clams and sea cucumbers resulting
from spills at China’s biggest offshore oilfield last year.  In a sign that China is cracking down on polluters, Premier
 Wen Jiabao  demanded a “thorough” investigation into the leaks
after China’s maritime regulator ordered Conoco on Sept. 2. to
shut the field. Houston-based Conoco operates and owns 49
percent of the Penglai 19-3 area in Bohai Bay, while  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
the listed arm of China National, has 51 percent.  While the settlement may be one of the biggest in China,
it’s a “drop in the bucket” for Conoco, said  Gordon Kwan , head
of regional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities HK Ltd.
“I’m surprised China isn’t asking for more,” he said by
telephone from  Hong Kong . “This doesn’t even pay for two
deepwater exploration wells in offshore China.”  Zijin, PetroChina  The compensation surpasses the 3.26 million yuan a unit of
Zijin Mining Group Co. agreed to pay last year after the
collapse of a tailing dam at a tin mine in 2010 killed 22
people, Xinhua News Agency said Dec. 28. China’s largest gold
producer said in May an appeals court in  Fujian province  upheld
a criminal fine of 20.4 million yuan against the company after
acidic waste leak from a mine in July 2010 polluted a river and
poisoned enough fish to feed 72,000 people for a year.  State-owned PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil
producer, was fined 1 million yuan in 2005 for a toxic spill
that poisoned the drinking water of about 3 million people.  The payments contrast with the $20 billion fund that
President  Barack Obama  demanded from BP Plc to compensate
victims of the worst U.S. oil spill. BP paid $7.4 billion to
individuals, businesses and government entities affected by the
Gulf of Mexico spill by Dec. 23, according to its website.  Conoco will also allocate about $16 million of a previously
announced environmental fund to improve fishery resources, the
company said in today’s statement.  Tainted Sea  The leaks tainted more than 6,200 square kilometers (2,400
square miles) of  Bohai Bay , resulting in losses to the tourism
and fisheries industries in Liaoning and Hebei provinces, Xinhua
said in a report today. Conoco Chief Executive Officer James
Mulva apologized for leaks in a Sept. 6 statement after state
media accused the U.S. company of negligence and cover-ups.  China National said on Dec. 24 resuming oil production at
Penglai is a priority for 2012 after the closure forced Cnooc to
cut its 2011 output target.  Cnooc has declined 17 percent in Hong Kong in a year and
gained 0.3 percent to close at HK$15.50 on Jan. 20, the last
trading day before the city’s markets shut for the Lunar New
Year holidays. Conoco has gained 4.6 percent in 12 months and
rose 0.1 percent to $70.61 yesterday.  “This should be taken as a positive sign in that a
settlement has been reached, which may be one of the elements
needed” before the field can start, David Hewitt, an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG in  Singapore , wrote in an e-mailed
response to questions today. “You could argue that a key
uncertainty for the stock this year is production growth” at
Cnooc, he said.  Target Cut  Cnooc, which relies on fields off the Chinese coast for 80
percent of its production, said on Jan. 19 that it aims to
produce the equivalent of 330 million to 340 million barrels of
oil in 2012, a gain of as much as 2.7 percent from last year.  Output was about 331 million to 332 million barrels of oil
equivalent last year, compared with a revised target of 331
million to 341 million, Cnooc said. Before the leak the company
had a target of as much as 365 million barrels.  Cnooc’s state-controlled parent said on Jan. 10 that 29
fishermen had sued the country’s biggest offshore energy
explorer. The Tianjin Maritime Court accepted a complaint from
fishermen alleging the spilled oil killed their clams and sea
cucumbers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Dec. 30.  “The company will continue to support and assist
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  to deal with the subsequent issues in a proper
manner,” Cnooc said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
