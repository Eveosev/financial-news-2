A proposal to overhaul the U.K.’s
state-run medical system would undermine comprehensive free care
by transferring power from a centralized authority to regional
groups, a public health researcher wrote in The Lancet.  The new legislation would create an unspecified number of
Clinical Commissioning Groups, which would take on the
responsibilities currently under Conservative Health Secretary
Andrew Lansley, said Allyson Pollock, a professor of public
health research and policy at  Queen Mary, University of London .
Unlike the secretary, the groups aren’t bound by any duty to
promote comprehensive free health service, Pollock said.  Such decentralization “will increase inequality in service
access, provision and uptake,” she wrote in the article
published today. “The duty to provide a  national health service 
throughout  England  would be lost if the Bill became law.”  Lansley’s Health and Social Care Bill, which applies only
to England, would be the biggest shakeup in the history of the
64-year-old National Health Service. The legislation includes
proposals aimed at expanding the number of private companies
that offer health-care services to NHS patients. The plan has
been attacked by doctors’ groups, the opposition  Labour Party 
and lawmakers from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s own
Conservative Party and their Liberal Democrat coalition
partners.  The bill is going through the House of Lords, and any
 amendments  made there would have to be approved by the House of
Commons before the legislation is submitted for royal assent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
