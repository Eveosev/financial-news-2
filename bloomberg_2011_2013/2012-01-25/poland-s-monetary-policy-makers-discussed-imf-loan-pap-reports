The Polish  central bank’s  rate-
setting body discussed making a loan to the  International
Monetary Fund  at a meeting yesterday, PAP newswire said, citing
monetary policy maker Elzbieta Chojna-Duch.  The Monetary Policy Council did not take any decision on
the credit, after the bank’s board said last week it was willing
to take part in aid to stabilize cash-strapped economies, PAP
said. The council will discuss the interest to be charged on the
loan and the repayment timescale at its next meeting, Chojna-
Duch said, according to PAP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
