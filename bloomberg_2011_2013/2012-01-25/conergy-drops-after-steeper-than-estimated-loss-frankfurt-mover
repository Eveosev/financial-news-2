Conergy AG (CGYK) , the German solar panel
maker owned by creditors since July, fell the most in seven
weeks in  Frankfurt  after posting a steeper-than-expected loss
last year on pricing pressure and project delays.  Conergy fell 8 percent to 38 euro cents at the close in
Frankfurt, the steepest one-day decline since Dec. 8. The
company, based in Hamburg, had a loss before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 80 million to 85 million euros,
more than the 50 million to 55 million euros it predicted.
Conergy also said 2012 sales will probably decline in a
preliminary earnings statement last night.  Conergy, once Germany’s largest solar company, is cutting
jobs, halting production of wafers and cells, and focusing on
end-product modules, project development and services in a bid
to become profitable. Bigger-than expected module price
declines, restructuring costs and delays in  project financing  in
Greece, Spain and Italy contributed to the loss, it said.  Germany’s solar manufacturers are under pressure from
Chinese rivals that have boosted capacity even as international
prices slumped. Berlin-based module maker  Solon SE (SOO1)  and  Solar
Millennium AG (S2M) , with headquarters in Erlangen, filed for
protection from creditors last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
