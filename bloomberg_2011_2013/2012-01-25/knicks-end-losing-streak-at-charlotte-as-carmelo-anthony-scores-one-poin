The  New York Knicks  overcame the
worst offensive performance of Carmelo Anthony’s career to end a
six-game losing streak by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 111-78
in a National Basketball Association contest.  Anthony, who came into the contest averaging 25.7 points
per game this season, missed all seven of his shots and scored
his only point of the night on a technical free throw. He played
30 minutes and did not commit a foul.  Tyson Chandler had 20 points and 17 rebounds to lead the
Knicks (7-10). Kemba Walker had 22 points for the Bobcats (3-15)
in the game at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North
Carolina.  Anthony’s previous career low came on Nov. 30, 2008, when
he scored two points for the  Denver Nuggets  in a win against the
 Houston Rockets . He went 1-for-4 from the field while playing 14
minutes in that game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
