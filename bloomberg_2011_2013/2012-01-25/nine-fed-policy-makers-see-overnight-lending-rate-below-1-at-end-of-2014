Nine of 17 Federal Reserve officials
expect borrowing costs will remain below 1 percent at the end of
2014, with six officials expecting zero rates to remain into
2015.  Policy makers also lowered their estimates for growth and
inflation in 2012, a move consistent with their statement
earlier today that  interest rates  will remain “exceptionally
low” through at least late 2014.  The projections by Federal Open Market Committee
participants, released for the first time today in  Washington ,
provide an unprecedented look at policy makers’ plans for the
path of the benchmark interest rate, which has remained near
zero since December 2008. An increase in 2014 would mark the
first rise in the  fed funds rate  since June 2006.  The Fed released the expectations of the five Fed board
members and 12 district bank presidents after the FOMC today
said they expect “to maintain a highly accommodative stance for
monetary policy” in order to “support a stronger economic
recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at
levels consistent with the dual mandate.”  Not all officials agree on when and how quickly the Fed
should raise rates. Three officials say the Fed should raise
rates in 2012, three say the Fed should raise rates in 2013. A
group of five policy makers says rates should rise in 2014 while
four say the central bank should wait until 2015 and two until
2016.  Pared Gains  Stocks and Treasuries pared gains after the projections.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to 1,321.36 at
2:06 p.m. in  New York  from as high as 1,324.56 earlier. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.98 percent from
2.06 percent late yesterday. The yield fell as low as 1.91
percent before the projections.  Fed officials estimate 2012 growth in U.S. gross domestic
product centered around 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent, measured
from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of
this year. In their November estimates they saw growth of 2.5
percent to 2.9 percent.  For 2013, U.S. growth is projected at 2.8 percent to 3.2
percent according to the central tendency forecast, which
excludes the three highest and three lowest projections.  Policy makers see 2012 inflation falling below their goal
of 2 percent, with most expecting inflation on the personal
consumption expenditures index between 1.4 percent to 1.8
percent, down from 1.4 percent to 2 percent in November.  No Change  The committee today left unchanged its plans to lengthen the
maturity of its bond portfolio and maintain its mortgage-backed
securities investments.  The Fed extended its previous pledge to keep rates low at
least until the middle of 2013 as inflation remains tame and
more than two years of economic growth have failed to push
unemployment below 8.5 percent. Some Fed officials have said
further easing might be needed to put more Americans back to
work and revive the housing market.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will explain the FOMC’s
outlook for the economy and monetary policy in a 2:15 p.m. press
conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
