Boeing Co. (BA)  forecast a smaller 2012
profit than analysts estimated, dragged down by rising pension
expenses and declining U.S. defense spending, as the planemaker
works to boost commercial production to a record.  Full-year net income will drop to $4.05 to $4.25 a share,
Boeing said in a statement today. That trailed 2011’s $5.34 and
the $4.89  average  of 27 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
in 2012 may rise to a range of $78 billion to $80 billion, up
from $68.7 billion and matching analysts’ projections.  Pension costs “are a material event, but not unexpected,”
said Joel Levington, head of corporate credit at Brookfield
Asset Management Inc. in New York. “What is different with
Boeing versus its peers is that the market has overlooked these
issues in favor of the growth in commercial aerospace.”  Jet deliveries should climb to a range of 585 to 600 from
477 in 2011, Boeing said, helping the Chicago-based company in
its bid to reclaim the top spot in commercial production lost to
 Airbus (EAD)  SAS in 2003. Boeing is increasing output by more than 60
percent in four years through 2014 to meet demand for more fuel-
efficient planes, including two new models.  Profit margins at the commercial-jet unit will fall this
year to a range of 8.5 percent to 9 percent, from 9.7 percent in
2011, Boeing said, noting that the new 787 Dreamliner and 747-8
jumbo jet will start out with low margins.  ‘Prudent’ Margin View  Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said the margin
forecast was “prudent.” The Dreamliner’s commercial debut was
more than three years late, the first 747-8 freighter was more
than two years behind schedule, and the passenger version of
that plane is still not ready for delivery.  Boeing rose 0.6 percent to $75.82 at the close in  New York ,
reversing an earlier drop of 3.3 percent. That was the highest
closing price since July 7.  The revenue forecast was “surprisingly high,” while the
profit projection probably left investors feeling “sticker
shock” and weighed on the shares, Carter Copeland, a Barclays
Capital analyst, said in a note to investors.  Boeing said pension costs will probably rise to $2.6
billion this year from $1.6 billion, an increase of 83 cents a
share.  Adjusting for that expense, an increased tax cost of 12
cents, a 6-cent impact from share dilution, and a 53-cent tax
settlement in 2011, earnings would be $5.06 to $5.26 this year,
said Chaz Bickers, a spokesman. That would be about 7 percent
more than adjusted profit in 2011, he said.  ‘Key Takeaway’  “The key takeaway is that the commercial airplane market
is still in great shape and the backlog is there,” Matt Collins, an Edward Jones & Co. analyst in  St. Louis , said in an
e-mail. He said Boeing “tends to set the bar low” in its
initial annual forecast, and “that will probably come up as the
year unfolds.”  Collins and Copeland both recommend buying Boeing stock.  Sales in the commercial unit will rise as much as 37
percent to $49.5 billion, Boeing said, while revenue from the
defense business will be as much as $30.5 billion. That compares
with last year’s $32 billion.  Net income in 2011 was $4.02 billion pushed earnings past
the top of the increased range Boeing gave in October of $4.30
to $4.40 a share.  Fourth-quarter net income was $1.84 a share. Adjusted
earnings were $1.32, exceeding analysts’ $1.01 projection. Sales
were $19.6 billion.  Delivery Breakdown  Boeing said today it will hand over 70 to 85 of Dreamliners
and 747-8 jets, half of which will be 787s.  About two-thirds of the Dreamliner deliveries will be jets
that have already been built and need to be fixed to incorporate
engineering changes that came up during flight testing, McNerney
said on a conference call. The first plane that won’t need
changes will leave the assembly line in midyear, he said.  The 787 forecast trailed estimates from two analysts,  Rob Stallard  of RBC Capital and Doug Harned of Sanford C. Bernstein,
both based in New York. Harned wrote in a note that he expects
“zero or near-zero gross margins” on both new models this
year, curbing profit growth. Boeing receives much of the price
of a plane upon delivery.  Boeing is building 2.5 Dreamliners a month now and plans to
increase that rate to 3.5 in the second quarter and five a month
by the end of this year, McNerney said. He reiterated the goal
of building 10 of the jets a month by the end of 2013.  Inventory, Production  Dreamliner-related inventory rose to $20 billion. Deferred
production was $10.8 billion, including almost 50 planes that
are being worked on, and that figure will peak at more than $20
billion before declining once manufacturing reaches the full
rate, said Chief Financial Officer-elect  Greg Smith .  The commercial backlog rose to more than 3,700 jets valued
at a record $296 billion, from $273 billion in September.  While Airbus SAS is also increasing output, Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President  Jim Albaugh  has said he expects
by next year to once again be the leader. Toulouse, France-based
Airbus delivered a record 534 aircraft in 2011 and predicted
shipments would rise to 570 this year.  Boeing is counting on the popularity of the 787, the first
composite-plastic airliner, and the 737 MAX, an upgraded version
of the world’s most widely flown jet that’s set to enter service
in 2017. McNerney said there will be “robust order activity”
this year, with purchases exceeding deliveries.  The commercial unit’s earnings from operations in the
fourth quarter surged 56 percent from a year earlier to $981
million, on sales of $10.7 billion.  Boeing’s defense division is looking for spending cuts and
more international sales, with 25 percent to 30 percent of
revenue coming from foreign militaries as the U.S. pares future
arms budgets.  The defense unit’s profit gained 6 percent last quarter to
$865 million, as sales rose 4 percent to $8.47 billion.  There will be more job cuts to come on the defense side,
with more workers hired to build commercial jets, McNerney said.
New jobs in 2012 won’t match the 11,000 added in 2011, he said.
Overall employment will be little changed this year, said
Bickers, the spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
