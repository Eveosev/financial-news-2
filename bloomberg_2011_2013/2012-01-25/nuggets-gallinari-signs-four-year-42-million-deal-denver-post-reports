Danilo Gallinari agreed to a four-
year contract extension with the Denver Nuggets worth almost $42
million, the  Denver Post said , citing an unnamed National
Basketball Association official.  Gallinari, a 23-year-old forward, joined the Nuggets 11
months ago as part of the trade that sent  Carmelo Anthony  to the
 New York Knicks . He’s emerged as Denver’s leading scorer this
season, averaging 17.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists for
a Nuggets team that has the second-best record in the Western
Conference at 12-5.  The 6-foot-10 Gallinari was selected by the Knicks with the
sixth overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft after playing
basketball in Italy. He’s averaged 14.1 points and 4.5 rebounds
over four NBA seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
