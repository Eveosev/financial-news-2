Russia ’s grain exports will have a
“dramatic” slowdown from now through June because the three
major exporting provinces have shipped most of their supplies,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  The southern Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol regions
accounted for 85 percent of Russia’s more than 18 million metric
tons of total grain exports in July through December, according
to the Foreign Agricultural Service report, dated Jan. 19, on
the USDA website.  “Exports, however, are expected to fade during the second
half of the marketing year as domestic demand for grain remains
strong, and stocks of grain available for export have
decreased,” according to the report. Russia’s grain exports are
not expected to exceed 24 million tons in the marketing year, it
said.  Russia’s grain exports reached 19.5 million tons as of
today, a record figure for this time of the year, Interfax cited
First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor Zubkov  as saying in
Stavropol.  Russia’s grain and pulses crop rose 54 percent to 93.9
million tons in 2011 compared with a year earlier, USDA’s report
said, citing Russia’s State Statistical Service data. The wheat
crop rose 35 percent to 56.2 million tons and the barley harvest
more than doubled to 16.9 million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
