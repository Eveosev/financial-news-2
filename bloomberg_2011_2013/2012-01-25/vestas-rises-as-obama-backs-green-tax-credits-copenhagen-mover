Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest maker of  wind turbines , rose the most among Copenhagen’s
benchmark stocks after President  Barack Obama  urged  U.S.
Congress  to vote for clean energy tax credits.  Vestas rose as much as 2.6 percent, making it today’s
 biggest winner  in the Copenhagen 20 Index, and advanced 1.6
kroner to 66.2 kroner at 9:18 a.m. in the Danish capital. Before
today, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company had lost 66 percent of
its market value over 12 months after slashing sales and profit
forecasts and cutting jobs to meet competition from Chinese
producers.  Obama, in his State of the Union speech yesterday, said
congress should set clean energy standards and pledged that the
Defense Department would make the largest renewable energy
purchases in history. Vestas said Jan. 12 it will remove 2,335
positions and may cut another 1,600 jobs in the U.S. if
lawmakers don’t extend the production tax credit that subsidizes
the renewable  energy industry .  It’s time to “double-down on a clean energy industry
that’s never been more promising,” Obama said. “Pass clean
energy tax credits and create these jobs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
