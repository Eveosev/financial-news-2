Palestinian and Israeli officials
will meet again in Amman, Jordan, on the eve of a deadline set
by international mediators to work out the details for renewed
peace talks, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said.  Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  will visit
Jordan’s King Abdullah today before the 7 p.m. talks between
Erakat’s team and an Israeli delegation led by Yitzhak Molcho,
Erakat said. The two sides have met at least four times in the
past month.  The diplomatic group known as the Quartet has asked Israeli
and Palestinian leaders to come up with proposals before
tomorrow for security arrangements and final borders that would
pave the way for formal negotiations, which have been frozen
since September 2010.  The Quartet is made up of representatives from the European
Union, the  United Nations , the U.S. and  Russia . Palestinian
officials have said they would like to extend the deadline.  EU foreign-policy chief  Catherine Ashton  visited the Gaza
Strip today to announce a 55.4 million-euro ($72.2 million)
grant for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for
Palestinian refugees, according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
