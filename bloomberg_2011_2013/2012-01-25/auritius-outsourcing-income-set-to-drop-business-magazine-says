Income in Mauritius’s outsourcing
industry may drop 9 percent to 12 percent because of the rupee’s
strength against the euro, Business Magazine reported, citing
Roshan Seetohul, chairman of the Outsourcing and
Telecommunications Association.  Revenue for the information and communication technology
and business outsourcing industry was 18.7 billion rupees ($636
million) in 2011, the Port Louis-based weekly publication said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
