A halt of  Iran ’s oil exports to
countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development would likely lead to a crude price increase of as
much as $30 a barrel, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The blockade of Iranian oil “without offset from other
sources” would trigger an initial gain of around 20 to 30
percent, or about $20 to $30 a barrel at current prices, the IMF
said in a  document  released today. The closure of the  Strait of
Hormuz  could trigger a much larger rally, according to the IMF.  Iran has threatened to close the Strait, the transit point
for about a fifth of global oil supply, if an embargo against
its oil exports is implemented. The European Union announced
Jan. 23 that it would ban oil imports from Iran starting July 1
to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, which Western nations
say is aimed at producing weapons.  Financial sanctions imposed by some OECD countries against
Iran may “be tantamount to an oil embargo” that would reduce
supply by 1.5 million barrels a day, the IMF said in the
document prepared for a Jan. 19 meeting of Group of 20 deputy
finance ministers in  Mexico .  Oil for March delivery gained 45 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
settle at $99.40 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have risen 15 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
