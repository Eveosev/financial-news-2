The  European Central Bank  is buying
and will continue to buy bonds from the euro region because the
financial markets are blocked, Marko Kranjec, a member of the
governing council of the ECB, said in an interview with the
Slovenian weekly magazine  Demokracija .  “The ECB is just enabling a transmission of the monetary
policy with which it ensures the functioning of the European
financial markets,” Kranjec, who’s also the Governor of
 Slovenia ’s central bank, said in the interview to be published
tomorrow.  Kranjec also said the Frankfurt-based rate-setting bank is
“indicating that it doesn’t take rating companies at an
absolute value.”  “The ECB with its program of purchase of  government bonds 
is buying these securities on the secondary market of those
countries that have low credit ratings and cannot get an
appropriate price or cannot sell them at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
