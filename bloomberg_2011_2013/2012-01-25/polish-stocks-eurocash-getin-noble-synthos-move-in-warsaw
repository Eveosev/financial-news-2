Poland ’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  retreated 0.5
percent, falling for a second day, to 2,252.99 at the close in
Warsaw.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Warsaw market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Eurocash SA (EUR)   rose 4.5 percent to 29.58 zloty,
climbing for the first time in five days, after UniCredit SpA
resumed coverage of Poland’s largest distributor of non-durable
 consumer goods  with a “buy” recommendation.  Getin Noble Bank SA (GNB)   lost 1 percent to 3.8 zloty,
snapping a three-day streak of gains, after the bank controlled
by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki said it plans to sell as
much 200 million zloty ($61 million) of bonds maturing 2018,
which is less than the 500 million zloty issue announced in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
