Indian stocks climbed to a ten-week
high amid speculation the central bank will add to yesterday’s
reserve-requirement cut to stimulate economic growth.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest producer of the fuel,
jumped 3.9 percent, the most in two weeks.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the
owner of Jaguar Land Rover, reached an eight-month high.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the country’s most valuable company,
gained for a second day.  State Bank of India  extended an 11-day,
24 percent rally.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.5 percent
to 17,077.18 at 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its highest level
since Nov. 14. The  Reserve Bank of India  yesterday reduced the
amount of deposits banks must keep aside as reserves for the
first time since 2009 and signaled future interest-rate cuts,
joining other  emerging markets  in shielding growth. The Sensex
sank 25 percent last year amid concern a weak rupee and record
interest-rate increases will exacerbate the effects of  Europe ’s
debt crisis on company earnings.  “The RBI is saying  interest rates  have peaked and that
will reflect positively on growth expectations,” A. Balasubramanian, who oversees 604 billion rupees ($12 billion)
in assets as chief executive officer of Birla Sun Life Asset
Management Co. in Mumbai, told Bloomberg UTV today. “2012 may
turn out to be better than last year.”  The RBI cut the cash reserve ratio to 5.5 percent from 6
percent, the monetary authority said yesterday. While  India ’s
inflation is the fastest in the BRIC group of nations, the rate
eased to a two-year low in December, giving the central bank
scope to inject 320 billion rupees into an economy that grew the
least since 2009 in the September quarter. The RBI also cut its
economic growth forecast to 7 percent for the year ending in
March from the 7.6 percent predicted in October.  Growth Focus  Six out of 13 Sensex companies that have posted December
quarter earnings missed analyst estimates. Forty percent lagged
in the September quarter and 47 percent in the previous three
months. Forecasts for Sensex companies for the year ending in
March have fallen 8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share, the
most since March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The growth-inflation balance of the monetary policy has
shifted to growth, while ensuring inflationary pressures remain
contained,” the central bank said in yesterday’s statement. The
reserve-ratio cut “can be viewed as a reinforcement of the
guidance that future rate actions will be towards lowering
them,” according to the statement.  Brazil pared its benchmark rate on Jan. 18 by half a point
for a fourth straight policy review. Russia in December trimmed
its benchmark rate, while  China  in November reduced the reserve
ratio for banks for the first time since 2008.  ‘Stance Reversal’  “We expect a rate cut in the next RBI meeting in March,”
said Hiren Ved, chief investment officer at Alchemy Investment
Management Ltd. “We expect the market to extend gains in the
near-term as the  Reserve Bank ’s action significantly indicates
its rate-reversal stance.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. increased 0.6 percent to 5,158.30. The BSE 200 Index
rose 0.8 percent, its highest close since Nov. 14.  Coal India jumped 3.9 percent to 342.9 rupees, the most
since Jan. 13, and paced gains among other producers of basic
materials.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the nation’s biggest producer, rose
2.9 percent to 444.85, its highest price since Nov. 9. Sterlite
Industries Ltd., the largest copper and zinc maker, added 2.3
percent to 113.75 rupees.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the nation’s second-largest software maker,
gained 1.8 percent to 2,665.8 rupees, its highest level since
Jan. 11. Tata Motors surged 4.1 percent to 230.95 rupees, its
highest since May 26. Reliance added 0.9 percent to 790.95
rupees, its second day of gains.  Lenders Rally  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage
lender, jumped 1.2 percent to 709.2 rupees, the highest close
since July 8. State Bank rose for a 12th straight day, gaining
0.8 percent to 2,058 rupees, its longest winning streak since
September 2005 and the highest price since Aug. 23. The  BSE
India Bankex Index (BANKEX)  climbed to its highest level since Oct. 31.  Lupin Ltd. (LPC) , the Indian drugmaker founded by billionaire
Desh Bandhu Gupta, advanced to a seven-week high after Chief
Executive Officer Vinita Gupta said the company’s U.S. generics
business will be boosted by the launch of 25 new products. The
stock climbed 2.7 percent to 459.15 rupees,  Foreign investors sold a net 128 million rupees of local
stocks on Jan. 23, ending 14 straight days of purchases. Still,
they have bought $1.4 billion of equities this year, compared
with an outflow of $512 million in 2011, according to data from
the market  regulator . The flows have helped the Sensex to a 11
percent advance this month, the  best  January performance since
1994, when the gauge climbed 19 percent.  Offshore funds invested a record $29.4 billion in 2010,
which pushed the Sensex up 17 percent that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
