Moody’s Investors Service put on
review for a possible downgrade about 3.5 Billion pounds ($5.5
billion) of commercial mortgage-backed securities linked to U.K.
retailer  Tesco Plc. (TSCO)   The action follows the rating firm’s decision to put the
Cheshunt, England-based supermarket operator’s A3 rating under
review for a downgrade on Jan. 20, analysts including Manuel Rollmann in  London  wrote in a statement today.  The review covers six transactions including four issues
from Tesco special purpose companies that are backed by rents
from the retailer’s stores, Moody’s said.  Asset-backed securities package loans into bonds that can
be sold on to investors. The securities typically allow issuers
to raise capital more cheaply than from unsecured debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
