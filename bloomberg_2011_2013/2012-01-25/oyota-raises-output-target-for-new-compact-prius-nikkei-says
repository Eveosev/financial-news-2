Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Japan ’s biggest
carmaker, will probably raise the production target for its new
compact version of the Prius hybrid after initial orders
exceeded the company’s expectations, the Nikkei reported.  Toyota may raise its 2012 production target for the Aqua --
known as the Prius c in the U.S. -- by 30 percent to 320,000
units, the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without citing
anyone. The company hasn’t revised its official targets,
spokeswoman Amiko Tomita said.  Those figures indicate global sales of the model would
exceed the total number of cars bearing the Prius name that
Toyota projects to sell in the U.S. this year.  Jim Lentz , head
of sales in the U.S., Toyota’s biggest market, said in  Detroit 
this month that Prius sales in the country would climb more than
60 percent to a record and exceed 220,000 vehicles, fueled by
the new smaller version of the hybrid hatchback.  In Japan, Toyota is counting on government incentives for
purchases of fuel-efficient cars to spur demand and help the
company rebound from last year’s sales decline. Toyota will
introduce a plug-in version of the Prius, the world’s best-
selling hybrid car, on Jan. 31.  Orders in the first month of sales for its smallest Prius,
which went on sale in Japan Dec. 26, reached 110,000 units, the
Nikkei said.  Toyota  rose  2.8 percent to 2,870 yen as of 11:20 a.m. in
 Tokyo . The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
