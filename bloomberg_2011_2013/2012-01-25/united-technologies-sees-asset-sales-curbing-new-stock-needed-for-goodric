United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  plans to
sell assets to help minimize the amount of stock it needs to
offer to pay for the $16.5 billion purchase of  Goodrich Corp. (GR) ,
Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said.  The maker of Sikorsky helicopters will raise funds on the
debt and equity markets about a month before the acquisition
closes at midyear, Hayes said today in an interview. He wouldn’t
detail any assets to be sold beyond calling them “non-core.”  United Technologies has projected raising about $4 billion
of equity, Hayes said. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company
will identify the assets to be sold by March 15 and is working
with  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service to keep its
debt rating intact, he said.  “We’re working hard to reduce the amount of equity we’re
going to issue,” he said. “As the CFO of the company I would
tell you what I really hate would be to lose my  credit rating 
with S&P and Moody’s.”  United Technologies  agreed to buy Goodrich in September,
adding the world’s biggest maker of aircraft landing gear to an
aerospace portfolio that includes Sikorsky, Pratt & Whitney jet
engines and Hamilton Sundstrand aviation equipment.  Sikorsky is a “core” asset and isn’t being considered for
disposal, Hayes said on a conference call.  United Technologies has an A2 rating and a stable outlook
from Moody’s and an A grade with a negative outlook from S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
