Gunmen assassinated Nazem al-
Juburi, a former al-Qaeda leader in  Iraq  who had turned against
the terror group, the National Iraqi News Agency said.  Al-Juburi was killed in an attack late yesterday in the
western sector of the capital  Baghdad , the agency reported on
its website today, without saying where it got the information.  He was a prominent leader of the Sahwa, or Awakening
militia of former al-Qaeda-linked guerrillas who turned their
guns against the group in 2006 with the support of the Iraqi
government and U.S. forces.  The U.S. hailed the decision of its Sunni Muslim members to
turn against al-Qaeda as a key to a country-wide decline in
attacks about a year later. The Shiite Muslim-led government of
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki took charge of the force in 2008
and said it would disband the militia by absorbing 20 percent of
its members into the police and army, and finding jobs for the
rest. Many Awakening fighters have complained the government
isnâ€™t keeping its promises or doing enough to protect them
against revenge attacks.  -Editors: Louis Meixler, Jennifer Freedman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
