SecondMarket Inc. , the private
shares marketplace, will make up for the volume it loses when
Facebook Inc. goes public by adding to the companies whose
shares it handles, Chief Executive Officer  Barry Silbert  said.  SecondMarket, based in  New York , completed more than $558
million in transactions last year, according to a  statement  last
week.  Facebook, the world’s biggest social-networking site, is
examining a $10 billion offering that would value it at more
than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said in
November. The company has accounted for “a meaningful portion”
of the private  stock trading  on SecondMarket, Silbert said, so
when it goes public that volume will disappear.  “For 2012, we’re excited there is a growing number of
companies that have come to appreciate the value of having a
secondary market for the stock,” Silbert said today at the
World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos,  Switzerland .
SecondMarket is focused on about 200 companies, with a goal of
adding as many of these as possible in the next couple of years.  “It won’t take many of the 200 to make up for Facebook,”
he said.  Silbert added that while SecondMarket’s attention for the
next 12 months will be on U.S. companies, there are
opportunities elsewhere.  “We’re looking very closely in  China ,” Silbert said.  He also said he’s intrigued by companies in Israel and
Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
