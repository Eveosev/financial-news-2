Tibco Software Inc. (TIBX)  plans to hire
500 people in the U.S. this year as the economy improves and
Europe works out its debt crisis, Chief Executive Officer Vivek Ranadive said in an interview.  “We are hiring quite rapidly now, all in sales and
service,” Ranadive said at the World Economic Forum’s annual
conference in Davos, Switzerland. “It’s a good time to hire.”
Some big banks aren’t hiring, so there isn’t as much competition
for workers from Wall Street, he said.  Ranadive said his business-software company wants to
recruit workers at top U.S. colleges such as  Stanford University 
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Palo Alto,
California-based company had about 2,500 employees at the end of
its fiscal year 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are very optimistic about 2012, even in Europe,” he
said. “I think it’s like a well-kept secret that U.S. is doing
better.”  Other software makers such as  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and SAP AG need
to keep buying companies to increase revenue and will compete
with Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines
Corp. to “pursue large deals,” Ranadive said.  Tibco  shares  fell 21 cents, or less than 1 percent, to
$25.51 at 1:45 p.m. in  New York . The stock has  gained  21 percent
in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
