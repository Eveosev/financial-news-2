Ukraine’s sugar facilities produced
2.33 million metric tons of the sweetener from beets in the
season started Sept. 1, Dnipropetrovsk-based agricultural
researcher APK-Inform said, citing Ukrtsukor.  The sweetener came from 77 refiners in the season, which is
now complete, Mykola Yarchuk, the head of the sugar producers’
group Ukrtsukor said, according to a  statement  on APK-Inform’s
website today. Domestic demand for sugar is 1.86 million tons a
year, he said.  Future production may decline if a draft bill on land
reform, which is to be discussed in coming months, goes ahead,
Yarchuk said in another statement today, which was published on
the producers’ group’s  website .  Kiev-based Ukrtsukor has asked President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s government to continue the current policy which
enables agricultural companies to lease as much land as they
want, according to the statement.  The request comes before parliament debates the draft law
which would restrict the amount of land agricultural companies
can lease. Two-thirds of sugar refiners in the country, or
around 40 facilities, would have to stop production if the draft
bill is approved, Ukrtsukor’s Yarchuk said.  The sale of agricultural land has been banned in Ukraine
since its independence in 1991.  Ukraine’s parliament resumes sessions on Feb. 7 after a
winter break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
