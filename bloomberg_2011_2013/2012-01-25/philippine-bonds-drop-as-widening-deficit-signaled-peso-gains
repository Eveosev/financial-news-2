Philippine 10-year bonds fell,
pushing yields to the highest level in more than three weeks, as
the government said the  budget deficit  widened in December. The
peso touched a two-month high.  Last year’s shortfall was probably around 191.6 billion
pesos ($4.4 billion), Budget Secretary Butch Abad said today
ahead of the release of official data. That compared to a
government report last month that said the deficit for the year
through November was 96 billion pesos.  “It’s natural that bids will be more defensive,” said
Angeline Sia, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the
equivalent of $15 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in
Manila. “Traders will start looking at the government’s
finances more closely and look at whether higher spending
translated to stronger growth.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.25 percent,
in  Manila , according to Amstel Financial Services. That was the
highest level since Jan. 2. The peso rose 0.1 percent to 43.115
per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 43.045,
the strongest level since Nov. 9.  The Philippine economy may have grown at the slowest pace
since 2009 last year as exports contracted, Ruperto Majuca,
assistant director-general at the National Economic and
Development Authority, said today. Gross domestic product may
have increased 3.6 percent to 4 percent in 2011, he said. The
economy expanded 7.3 percent in 2010, official data show. The
government is scheduled to release the GDP data on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
