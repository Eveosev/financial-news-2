JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Treasury and
Securities Services division dismissed about 100 people, less
than 1 percent of the unit’s workforce, as part of the bank’s
periodic staff adjustments, said a person briefed on the move.  The unit, which employed 27,825 workers at the end of 2011,
isn’t planning widespread reductions, the person said, speaking
on condition of anonymity because the move hasn’t been made
public. The bank informed employees yesterday, the person said.  The division, run by Michael Cavanagh, handles payments-
processing and cash-management services for institutional
clients such as  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , which filed for
bankruptcy Oct. 31. Dealbreaker.com reported earlier today that
the unit was cutting jobs.  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for the New York-based
company, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
