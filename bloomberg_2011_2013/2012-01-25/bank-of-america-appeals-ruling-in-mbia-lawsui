Bank of America Corp.  is appealing a
ruling in a fraud lawsuit brought by  MBIA Inc. (MBI) , which is
fighting to recover losses on home loans made by the bank’s
Countrywide Financial unit.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten ruled
Jan. 3 that MBIA need only show Countrywide made
misrepresentations about the loans, instead of also establishing
they caused the losses the bond insurer is seeking to recover.  Countrywide said in a filing today with the state supreme
court that it was appealing the ruling.  MBIA, which sued Countrywide in 2008, guarantees payments
to investors that bought securities backed by pools of the
lender’s loans. The insurer says the loans were riskier than
Countrywide promised, and as they defaulted, the Armonk, New
York-based company was forced to make payments.  The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
