The ruble extended its longest
winning streak against the dollar since March 2008 as companies
and banks sought rubles to pay about $43 billion in taxes and
 Finance Ministry  loans.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 30.70 as of
3:35 p.m. in Moscow, its best intraday level since Dec. 02.
Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.1205 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 31.1955
yesterday.  Banks are due to repay a total 725 billion rubles ($24
billion) of loans from the Finance Ministry in January, 21
percent more than the monthly average of 598 billion rubles in
the fourth quarter, data on the ministry’s website show.
Companies face as much as 600 billion rubles of taxes this week,
boosting demand for the ruble as revenues in other currencies
are converted to pay the government, according to VTB Capital
estimates.  “There’s strong demand from local banks facing redemptions
of Finance Ministry deposits and tax payments,” Mikhail Nikitin, a Moscow-based analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said by
e-mail. “They just need rubles given the current liquidity
situation.”  Renaissance forecasts the ruble to weaken as much as 4.1
percent to 32 per dollar by the end of this quarter, the
brokerage said in an e-mailed research note today.  Demand Jumps  The overnight  MosPrime (MOSKON)  rate banks say they charge to lend
to each other in rubles jumped 57 basis points to 5.85 percent
today, the biggest rise since Sept. 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Russia’s central bank provided lenders
with 28.1 billion rubles in a repurchase auction today to ease
the cash squeeze, according to a statement on its website.  Demand at the auction was almost six times higher at 168
billion rubles, the regulator wrote in the statement.  Russia ’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 rose, pushing the
yield down seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
4.397 percent. Dollar bonds due in 2015 rose for an eighth day,
lowering the yield six basis points to 3.015 percent.  The ruble added 0.5 percent to 39.81 against the euro and
0.5 percent versus the central bank’s euro-dollar basket to
34.8133, the strongest on a closing basis since Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
