EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) , a maker
of network processors, rose to the highest in almost three
months, after the company’s U.S. shares gained following better
than expected results from  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)   The  stock jumped  5 percent to 129.10 shekels, or the
equivalent of $34.08, at 3:17 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest
intraday level since Nov. 2. The U.S.-traded shares advanced 3.5
percent to $34.02 yesterday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor
Index, used to track chip industry performance, added 0.4
percent yesterday, extending this year’s gain to 14 percent.  Texas Instruments, the world’s largest maker of analog
chips, said yesterday fourth-quarter sales and profit declined
less than analysts had predicted, signaling to brokerage
Benchmark Co. that the market for electronic components has
bottomed out.  “Companies are talking about an end of inventory depletion
and see increases in bookings,” Gary Mobley, an analyst at
Benchmark, said by phone from New York yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
