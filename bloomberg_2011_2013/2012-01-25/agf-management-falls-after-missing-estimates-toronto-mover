AGF Management Ltd. (AGF/B) , a Toronto-based
mutual fund company, had its biggest decline in five months
after reporting results that missed analysts’ estimates.  AGF fell 5.1 percent to C$16.03 at 10:47 a.m. in Toronto,
its biggest drop since Aug. 8.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to C$21.9 million ($21.6
million), or 23 cents a share, from C$30.9 million, or 34 cents,
in the year-earlier period, the company said today in a
statement.  AGF was expected to earn 30 cents a share excluding items,
according to the average  estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “We believe that the fourth-quarter earnings will likely
reset expectations on the firm’s outlook,” Barclays Capital
analyst  John Aiken  said today in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
