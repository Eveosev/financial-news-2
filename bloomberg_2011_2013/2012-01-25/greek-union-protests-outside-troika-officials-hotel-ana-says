PAME, a labor union backed by the
Greek Communist Party, staged a protest outside the hotel where
officials of the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and
the  International Monetary Fund  are staying, Athens News Agency
reported.  The representatives of the so-called troika asked for a
prosecutor’s intervention, so they can leave the hotel this
morning, the state-run ANA reported, without citing anyone.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
