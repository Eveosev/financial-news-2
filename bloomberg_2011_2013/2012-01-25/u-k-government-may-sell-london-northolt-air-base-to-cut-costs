The U.K. government is considering
“all options” for Northolt Royal Air Force base in northwest
 London , including its sale, the Ministry of Defense said.  The future of Northolt is being considered as part of
continuing scrutiny of defense expenditure, the ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today, after the  Guardian newspaper 
reported that the airfield may be sold and used as a satellite
airport for BAA Ltd.’s Heathrow.  “We continue to scrutinize all defense expenditure to
secure the best value for money. RAF Northolt is no exception,”
the ministry said. “It already generates revenue through
landing fees from private flights and sources of income
generation are of course kept under review.”  Parts of the site may be sold for commercial development,
including possibly using it to increase capacity at Heathrow
after the government blocked the airport’s plans to build a
third runway, the Guardian said, citing unidentified officials.  Northolt, which was used as a base during the  Battle of
Britain , was the site of the return of the body of Princess Dianato the U.K. after her death in a car crash Paris in 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
