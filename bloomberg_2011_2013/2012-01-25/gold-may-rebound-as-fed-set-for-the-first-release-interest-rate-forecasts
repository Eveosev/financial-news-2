Gold futures surged to a six-week
high after the  Federal Reserve  said it expects “exceptionally
low”  interest rates  through at least late 2014. Silver,
platinum and palladium also advanced.  Fed Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at a press
conference after the central bank’s statement that the option of
further large- scale bond purchases is still “on the table.”
Gold has jumped 28 percent in the past 12 months, partly as
record-low rates boosted the appeal of the metal as a hedge
against inflation.  “We saw an immediate reaction in gold” after the Fed’s
announcement, Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist
who helps oversee $150 million at New York-based Pension
Partners LLC, said in a telephone interview. “People are
betting that at some point the economy will face inflationary
pressures because of the low interest rate.”  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 2.1 percent to
close at $1,703 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain since Jan. 3. In electronic trading after the
settlement, the metal reached $1,716.10, the highest for a most-
active contract since Dec. 12.  The price topped the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a
chart signal that some analysts perceive as bullish. The metal
closed above the 200-day moving average on Jan. 10.  Silver futures for March delivery in New York jumped 3.6
percent to close at $33.121 an ounce. In electronic trading, the
price reached $33.40, the highest since Dec. 2.  This month, silver has surged 19 percent, and gold has
gained 8.7 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery advanced 1.8 percent to $1,579.60 an ounce.
Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1.9 percent to
$693.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
