Former Cuban President  Fidel Castro 
accused U.S. Republican Party presidential contenders of
“idiocy and ignorance” after two of them called on the U.S. to
do more to support Cubans who want to overthrow the island’s
communist regime.  The 85-year-old former leader’s comments, published today
in a “Reflections” column on the Cuba Debate website, come
less than a week before the party’s Jan. 31 primary in Florida,
home to many Cuban Americans.  In a Jan. 24 Republican Party presidential debate,  Mitt Romney  and  Newt Gingrich  criticized President Barack Obama for
not encouraging Cubans who want to overthrow the Cuban
government headed by Fidel’s brother, Raul.  While the U.S. has for more than five decades regarded Cuba
as destined “to fall into her bosom like ripe fruit,” Castro
wrote, “the fruit did not fall.” He went on to scorn “the
candidates that aspire to be the president of that globalized
imperialist reign.”  Castro also thanked “brother nation”  Venezuela  for its
fight against a U.S.-backed free-trade agreement backed by
former President  George W. Bush . He said the accord aimed to
extract all of South America’s natural resources.  Castro also said news agencies that attributed the death of
a Cuban prisoner this month to a hunger strike were wrong, and
that the man died of organ failure caused by a respiratory
infection. The man received “the best medical services in the
world” prior to his death, Castro said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
