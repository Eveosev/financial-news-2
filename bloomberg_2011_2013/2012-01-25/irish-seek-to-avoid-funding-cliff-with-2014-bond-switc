Ireland’s debt agency said it will
swap a note due to be repaid in 2014 for one maturing a year
later to smooth its funding requirements as the government seeks
to return to international  debt market .  In its most significant move since Irish bond auctions were
suspended in 2010, the National Treasury Management Agency is
offering to switch an 11.9 billion euro-bond ($15.5 billion) due
for payment in January 2014 for a new note maturing in February
2015. The size of the take-up will be announced after 4 p.m.
today, the agency said, after pricing the new security at a 5.15
percent yield, which has a 4.5 percent coupon.  “We expect a good bid for the 15s as it fits
perfectly” into the ECB’s long-term funding window, Cathal O’Leary, head of fixed income at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin,
said in a note. “This is very good news for Ireland as this
pushes their funding requirement 13 months further down the
road.”  Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  in September called
the 2014 maturity “one big jump” as the state seeks to regain
its economic sovereignty after an international bailout in 2010.
Spreading out repayments may mean Ireland needs to raise less
cash next year to finance 2014 needs and help avoid a second
bailout. The state currently has no bonds maturing in 2015.  “A successful Irish ‘debt swap’ could encourage other
peripheral issuers to offer voluntarily swaps of short-term
bonds with new issues of longer maturities to ease their
refinancing schedules,” Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income
strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, wrote in an e-mailed
research note.  The agency may switch between 1.5 billion euros and 2
billion euros in today’s swap, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified as the
process has not been completed. The agency may repeat the
operation later this year, the person said.  The yield on the 2014 bond bought back by the NTMA is 4.90
percent. The agency may repeat the operation later this year,
the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
