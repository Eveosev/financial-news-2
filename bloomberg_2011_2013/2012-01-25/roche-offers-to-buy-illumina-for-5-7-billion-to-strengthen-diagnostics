Roche Holdings AG offered to buy
 Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  for $44.50 per share in cash, or for a total
amount of about $5.7 billion, it said in a statement today. The
offer represents a 64 percent premium over Illumina’s stock
price on Dec. 21, the day before market speculation about a
potential deal between Roche and Illumina triggered an increase
in Illumina’s stock price, Roche said.  An acquisition of Illumina would offer benefits including
strengthening Roche’s position in the life science and
diagnostics market, Roche said.  Roche Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan said Dec. 22
that the swiss drugmaker was open to a deal as big as $3 billion
and is ready to “seize” the right opportunities for
acquisitions.  Illumina has been “unwilling to participate in substantive
discussions,” Roche said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
