Felipe Casotti , equity manager at
 Brazil ’s Maxima Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro, said the
Bovespa stock index’s plunge today is due to investors fearful
of a repeat of the losses during the 2008 financial crisis. He
helps manage 1.2 billion reais ($760 million) in assets and made
the comments in a phone interview.  On stock plunge:  “Investors remember what happened in 2008 and are
comparing them, because that was the last time we had such a
stressful moment, besides the flash crash in 2010.”  On derivatives tax:  The decision to tax some derivatives announced by the
Brazilian government last week is weighing on the local market
and pushing the Bovespa down more than global peers because
investors don’t like changes, he said.  “Changing in rules always has an affect because foreign
investors don’t like changes and leave. Many believe the real is
strong and if they expect the real to fall, they don’t come to
Brazil because they can lose money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
