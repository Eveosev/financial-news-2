Jameis Winston, the top-rated high-
school quarterback in the nation, committed to play at  Florida
State University  beginning in 2012.  The Hueytown,  Alabama , native chose the Seminoles over
Alabama and Louisiana State in making the  televised announcement 
yesterday on Walt Disney Co.’s ESPNU.  “I feel very confident with my decision,” Winston said
before putting on a baseball hat from the Tallahassee, Florida,
school. “I think I want to be a Florida State Seminole.”  Also a highly recruited baseball player who could be a top
draft pick in that sport next June, Winston is the No. 1 passer
in rankings by both ESPN and Rivals.com entering his senior
season of high school.  The Seminoles went 10-4 last season and beat South Carolina
26-17 in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. They were picked by Atlantic
Coast Conference media members in July to win the conference
championship.  “I’m just comfortable and that’s where I want to be,”
Winston said. “I see myself there in the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
