Peruvian bonds fell from a five-month
high on concern slower global growth may cut demand for the
Andean nation’s copper exports.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.13 percent at 2:08 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price
declined 0.09 centimo to 111.71 centimos per sol.  Copper prices fell amid concern the global economic
recovery may stall and damp demand for industrial metals amid
slower growth in U.S. service industries and European
manufacturing. Metals led by copper account for two thirds of
 Peru ’s exports.  “There’s going to be spending cuts in the U.S. in the
future, so the recovery of the world’s biggest economy is going
to remain weak,” said  Hugo Perea , chief economist at Lima-based
 BBVA Banco Continental , the country’s second largest bank.
“Industrial production indices around the world have been
falling, which is adding to the heightened uncertainty,” he
said.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 16 basis points to 178, a
two-week high, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Lima General Index dropped the most in two months,
falling 4.4 percent to 20,577.49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
