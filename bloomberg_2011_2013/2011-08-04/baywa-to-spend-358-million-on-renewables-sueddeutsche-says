Baywa AG (BYW) , the German agricultural
products and building-materials maker, plans to invest 250
million euros ($358 million) in renewable-energy projects as the
country exits nuclear energy,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Klaus Josef Lutz.  Baywa expects its renewables unit to increase operating
profit 19 percent to 26 million euros this year, Lutz told
Sueddeutsche in an interview. Baywa wants to develop and sell
solar, wind and biogas plants to investors in  Europe , the U.S.
and North Africa, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
