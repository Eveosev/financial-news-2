YIT Oyj (YTY1V) ,  Finland ’s biggest builder,
rose the most in almost three months in Helsinki trading, buoyed
by residential sales in its domestic market and  Russia .  YIT shares jumped as much as 12 percent to 15.20 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since May 10, and was up 0.9 percent as of
4:24 p.m. The Helsinki-based company reported second-quarter net
income of 46.1 million euros ($65.4 million), beating the
average estimate of 44.1 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of
11 analysts.  Sales of Finnish business premises are picking up and
residential sales are “continuously favorable,” the company
said today in a statement. Opportunities for improving
profitability exist particularly in Russian housing
construction, it said. Finland accounts for about 40 percent of
YIT’s annual revenue, while Russia generates about 14 percent.  Finland’s economy will grow by 3.9 percent this year, the
 Finance Ministry  said on June 20. Unemployment fell to 8.4
percent in June from 8.8 percent a year earlier.  YIT reiterated a full-year forecast of “clear” growth in
operating profit on rising revenue and citing “good”
residential sales in Finland and Russia.  The gain at YIT contrasts with a decline of as much as 5.7
percent at Lemminkaeinen Oyj, Finland’s second-biggest
construction company, which reported second-quarter net income
of 12.3 million euros that missed the average 13.7 million-euro
estimate of five analysts. Lemminkaeinen also forecast improving
sales and pretax profit in 2011.  SRV Group Oyj, which ranks third in Finland’s construction
industry, said yesterday that it had a second-quarter net loss
of 2.1 million euros, compared with net income of 800,000 euros
a year earlier. The stock dropped 5.6 percent, falling for a
second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
