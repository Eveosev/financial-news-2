Asia naphtha margins rose. Hin Leong
Trading Pte sold gasoil cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s
biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Glencore International AG sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for
delivery in the first half of October at $966 a ton and 25,000
tons for second-half October at $968 a ton to Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window.  Trafigura Beheer BV sold 25,000 tons for first-half October
to Noble Group at $969 a ton.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, rose to $119 a ton at 5:54 p.m. Singapore time
from $111.06 at the end of Asian trading yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong, the second-largest buyer of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil, or diesel, last month in Singapore, sold two cargoes to
Total SA, according to the Bloomberg News survey. The Singapore
trader sold 230,000 barrels at a discount of 35 cents a barrel
to benchmark quotes, and sold 150,000 barrels at a discount of
40 cents a barrel.  Glencore, last month’s biggest buyer, sold gasoil for a
second day, the survey showed. The world’s largest commodities
trader received 40 cents a barrel below spot prices from
Singapore Petroleum Co. for 150,000 barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 16
cents to $19.26 a barrel at 2:23 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, widened for the fourth time in five
days.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to $1.60 a
barrel, rebounding from the lowest since July 22, PVM said. A
wider regrade shows it’s more profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 59 cents to
$6.01 a barrel at 2:23 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the smallest gap since June 29, indicating reduced losses
for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fell 25 cents to $9.25 a ton, PVM said. This viscosity spread
was the narrowest in two weeks, meaning bunker, or marine fuel,
has dropped less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
