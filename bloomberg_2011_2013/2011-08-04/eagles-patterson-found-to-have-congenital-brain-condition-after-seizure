Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle
Mike Patterson has been diagnosed with a congenital brain
condition after suffering a seizure during a training-camp
practice  Patterson, 27, has a tangle of blood vessels in his skull
outside his brain, a condition called arteriovenous
malformation, Eagles trainer Rick Burkholder said on the
National Football League team’s  website . Burkholder wouldn’t
speculate on what treatment Patterson may need or when he’d be
able to play football again.  The 6-foot-1, 300-pound Patterson collapsed between drills
yesterday morning in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania , and briefly lost
consciousness during a seizure that lasted for about four
minutes.  The brain condition probably caused the seizure, though
Patterson will have further tests, Burkholder said. Dehydration
and head injury were ruled out as causes.  Patterson was stabilized and then taken to the hospital,
where Burkholder said he was alert, stable and joking around.  Patterson was the Eagles’ first-round pick in the NFL’s
2005 draft and has started 77 of 80 games over the past five
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
