CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of  prescription drugs  in the U.S., reported second-
quarter profit that topped analystsâ€™ estimates, helped by the
introduction of lower-price merchandise.  Net income slipped less than 1 percent to $816 million, or
60 cents a share, from $821 million, or 60 cents, a year
earlier, the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company said today
in a statement. Excluding some items, profit was 65 cents,
exceeding the 64-cent average estimate of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo increased retail
pharmacy segment sales 3.6 percent and boosted front of store
revenue 3 percent after introducing less-expensive merchandise
under the Just the Basics brand to lure customers that have cut
purchases amid high unemployment. Total revenue advanced 11
percent to $26.6 billion.  The company narrowed its forecasted range for adjusted
earnings per share this year to $2.75 a share to $2.81 a share,
from an earlier projection of $2.72 to $2.82.  CVS fell $1.18 to $35.03 at 10:24 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the most since Feb. 3. Before today,
the shares had gained 4.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
