U.S. options volume soared to a
record as investors snapped up contracts as protection from a
global stock rout. VIX futures volume also jumped to a record.  More than 35 million options on stocks, indexes and
exchange-traded funds changed hands today on U.S. exchanges,
according to Jim Binder, a spokesman for Chicago-based OCC,
which settles all trades. Volume surpassed the prior peak of
30.8 million on May 6, 2010, when a 20-minute rout erased $862
billion from the value of U.S. shares before stocks rebounded,
Binder said, citing a preliminary tally.  Volume for futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, or VIX, rose to a one-day record 137,132
contracts, the largest U.S. options market said in a statement.
That was more than double the four-week average of 60,666
contracts as the gauge of options prices jumped the most since
February 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
