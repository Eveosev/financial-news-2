Copper in  London  rebounded from a
more than three-week low as a strike at the world’s largest
copper mine ended its second week, disrupting supply forecast to
be in a shortage this year. Aluminum and nickel also gained.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.8
percent to $9,608 per metric ton and traded at $9,558.75 a ton
by 2:14 p.m.  Singapore  time. The contract yesterday dropped to
$9,520, the lowest intraday level since July 12.  The union at BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida mine in  Chile 
plans to present members today with a company pay offer,
according to a statement published on the union website. The
mine loses 2,500 tons of copper-in-concentrate production each
day the strike continues, according to  Barclays Capital , which
also forecasts copper production to lag behind demand by 670,000
tons this year.  “Market fundamentals are still supportive for higher
prices,” Andrew Gardner, an analyst at MF Global Australia
Ltd., said today by phone from Sydney. Still, concern about the
global economic slowdown is likely to limit gains, he said.  Copper has fallen 6 percent from a record $10,190 a ton on
Feb. 15 as euro-zone nations and the U.S. struggled with piling
debts that threatened growth in their economies. Prices may
revisit $10,000 a ton by the end of this year as demand expands
amid constrained supply, JPMorgan Chase & Co said in a report
dated yesterday.  Workers at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg
mine in  Indonesia  are also demanding a pay increase and may
strike if the company fails to conclude talks by Aug. 17, Virgo
Solossa, head of organization affairs at the local unit of the
Phoenix, Arizona-based firm, said today by phone from Timika,
Papua.  Grades Fall  A decline in average grades is putting upward pressure on
costs for the industry, Codelco Chief Executive Officer  Diego
Hernandez  said today in a presentation. The Santiago-based firm
is the world’s largest producer of the metal, followed by
Freeport.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
U.S. economy, dropped to 52.7 from 53.3 in June, the slowest
pace in 17 months, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
yesterday.                       Readings above 50 signal expansion, and the median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey was for 53.5 in July.
Companies hired fewer workers last month than in June, a report
from ADP Employer Services showed yesterday.  ‘More Declines’  “In the event that concerns over the  U.S. economy 
strengthen, we could see more declines in copper prices,” Ong
Yi Ling, a metals analyst at Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore,
said by phone. Support for the three-month contract is at $9,400
a ton, she said. Support refers to  price levels  where buy orders
may be clustered.  Nickel rose 0.2 percent to $23,840 per ton in London, and
tin gained 1.2 percent to $26,610 per ton. Lead climbed 0.3
percent to $2,529 per ton, zinc advanced 0.6 percent to $2,392
and aluminum was little changed at $2,526.  Copper for October delivery fell 0.8 percent to 71,520 yuan
($11,112) per ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
