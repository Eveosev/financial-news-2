Permira Advisers LLP, manager of a
9.6 billion-euro ($14 billion) leveraged buyout fund, said it
hired Alan Chen from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as head of China.  Chen, a nine-year Goldman Sachs veteran, was most recently
an executive director at the bank’s Asian Special Situations
Group, Permira said in an e-mailed statement today. Before that,
he worked in the Wall Street firm’s corporate finance group,
according to the release.  Permira, based in London, promoted former Goldman Sachs
banker Henry Chen to co-head of its Asian operations in January.
Steve Sun, a managing director at Goldman Sachs’s private-equity
unit, left in May to join TPG Capital as a China partner, people
with knowledge of the matter said at the time.  In the past five years, Permira has invested more than $2
billion in three companies in Asia: Asia Broadcast Satellite,
 Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , and Japan’s Arysta LifeScience
Corp.  Permira also hired Christian Paul, a former director at
Alix Partners in Shanghai, as portfolio director, according to
today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
