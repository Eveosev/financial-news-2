Former champions  Bayern Munich  and
Benfica, and  England ’s Arsenal are among the 10 seeds in the 20-
team lineup for today’s Champions League soccer playoff draw.  National champions will be placed in one section, with
teams that qualified via their league position in the other. The
draw is scheduled to start at noon local time at UEFA’s
headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.  As non-champions, four-time European Cup winner Bayern,
Benfica and Arsenal can’t be drawn against a team that won its
domestic title in 2010-11, meaning their potential opponents are
 Rubin Kazan , Udinese, Odense, FC Twente or FC Zurich.  The 10 winners of the two-game series will advance to the
32-team group stage of  Europe ’s elite club competition. The
opening playoff matches are scheduled for Aug. 16-17 with the
return games the following week.  Barcelona, which beat Manchester United 3-1 in last
season’s final, is rated the 15-8 favorite to defend its title
by U.K. bookmaker William Hill Plc. Bayern is a 16-1 chance and
Arsenal 20-1.  CHAMPIONS ROUTE TEAMS:
FC Copenhagen, Bate Borisov, Maccabi Haifa, Dinamo Zagreb, APOEL
FC, Wisla Krakow, Sturm Graz, Genk, Viktoria Plzen, Malmo.  LEAGUE ROUTE TEAMS:
Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Lyon, Benfica, Villarreal, FC Twente,
Rubin Kazan, Udinese, FC Zurich, Odense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
