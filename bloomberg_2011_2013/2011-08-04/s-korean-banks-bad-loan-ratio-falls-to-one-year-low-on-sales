South Korean banks’ bad-debt ratio
dropped to 1.73 percent of their total lending at the end of
June, the lowest level in a year.  The non-performing loan ratio fell from a revised 2 percent
at the end of March as banks sold or wrote off 9.5 trillion won
($9 billion) worth of troubled loans, including credit extended
to real-estate developers, the Financial Supervisory Service
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
