Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)  jumped 9.2 percent
in New York trading after the travel-website operator forecast
higher third-quarter profit than analysts estimated, boosted by
demand for European trips and hotel stays.  Excluding some items, earnings for the current period will
be $9.10 to $9.30 a share, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company said yesterday when it released second-quarter results.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted $7.97 a share.  Bargain-hunting shoppers are fueling growth at Priceline,
even as the global economy struggles to recover from the
recession. International revenue jumped 90 percent to $612.9
million last quarter, accounting for 56 percent of total sales.
Priceline’s  Booking.com  business in  Europe  has been adding
hotels and now  lists  more than 157,000 in 101 countries.  “Priceline’s strong growth has been driven by its ability
to take share of the international hotel market through
Booking.com,” Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
said in a report yesterday. He rates the stock “overweight,”
with a target price of $610.  Priceline rose $44.47 to $527.81 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest one-day percentage gain
since Aug. 4, 2010. Priceline has surged 80 percent in the past
12 months.  Bookings Forecast  Priceline, known in the U.S. for its name-your-own-price
services, purchased Booking.com in 2005 and expanded in  Asia  two
years later with the acquisition of Agoda.com in Bangkok. The
company forecast an increase in international travel bookings of
62 percent to 67 percent in the third quarter, and a total
increase of 47 percent to 52 percent.  Second-quarter net income more than doubled to $256.4
million, or $5.02 a share, from $115 million, or $2.26, a year
earlier. Profit excluding some items was $5.49 a share, beating
the $4.87 forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investors have snapped up Priceline shares this year even
with the debt crisis in Europe leading to bailouts of  Greece ,
 Portugal  and Ireland. The Stoxx Europe 600 has tumbled 12
percent since the beginning of the year and is trading at the
lowest since July 2010.  The online leisure-travel market may grow 16 percent in the
U.S. to $113 billion next year from $97 billion in 2010,
according to research firm  PhoCusWright Inc.  The U.S. represents
about half of the global market.  In addition to hotels, Priceline is benefiting from the
rental car market. The number of days cars were rented rose 55
percent to 6.6 million from 4.3 million a year earlier. The
number of airline tickets sold rose 7 percent to 1.7 million.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , the biggest U.S. online travel agent by
sales, reported second-quarter revenue last week that beat
analysts’ estimates, helped by a 37 percent increase in
international bookings, including the impact of foreign exchange
rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
