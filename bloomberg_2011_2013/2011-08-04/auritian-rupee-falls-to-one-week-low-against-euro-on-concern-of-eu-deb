Mauritius’s rupee depreciated to a
one-week low against the euro, the currency of its main trading
partner, on concern slowing growth may worsen the euro region’s
debt crisis.  The currency weakened as much as 1 percent to 40.4417 per
euro and traded at 40.0508 by 1:08 p.m. in Port Louis, the
capital. Versus the dollar, the rupee slipped 0.4 percent to
28.1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
returned to  Madrid  to discuss the worsening fiscal crisis with
ministers, less than a day after departing for a vacation in the
south of the country. Political leaders are responding to the
latest stage of the European debt crisis that has pushed Spanish
and Italian 10-year borrowing costs above 6 percent, stoking
concern they could become the next victims of Europe’s debt
crisis.  “European leaders are unable to dissipate the doubts
markets have about the Italian and Spanish fiscal position,”
analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank, the country’s largest
lender by market value, wrote in a note to clients. “With all
these events occurring amidst a somber economic outlook, we
expect the bearish feeling to stay.”  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main source of
tourists, with a share of 64 percent of arrivals for the January
to June period, according to the Mauritius Tourism Promotion
Agency data. The continent bought 65 percent of Mauritian
exports during the quarter through March, the  Central Statistics
Office  said on May 31, led by the  United Kingdom ,  France  and
Spain.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.2706 rupees and
27.4357 rupees, with the selling price declining to 28.7327 from
28.765 rupees per dollar, according to indicative rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  Mauritian stocks snapped two days of declines, with the 38-
member SEMDEX gauge advancing 0.4 percent to 2,031.48, led by
Mauritius Commercial Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
