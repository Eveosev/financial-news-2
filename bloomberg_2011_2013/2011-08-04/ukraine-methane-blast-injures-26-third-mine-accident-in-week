A methane explosion injured 26 coal
miners at the Krasnokutska mine in eastern Ukraine, a week after
accidents killed 38 workers at two other mines in that region.  The blast occurred at 11:40 a.m. local time today at a
depth of 110 to 120 meters, the Emergency Situations Ministry,
based in the capital, Kiev, said in a statement on its  website .
The mine, which is located in the Luhansk region and operated by
state-run Donbas Antratsyt, remained open after the accident.  An explosion killed 27 miners in the Sukhodilska-Skhidna
mine on July 29 in the deadliest such accident since 2007.
Eleven miners died as a shaft collapsed at the Bazhanova mine
the same day, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter son this story:
