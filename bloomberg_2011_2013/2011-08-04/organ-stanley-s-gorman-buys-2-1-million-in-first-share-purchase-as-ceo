James Gorman , chief executive officer
of Morgan Stanley, purchased $2.06 million of stock in the firm
as the shares touched their lowest level since March 2009.  Gorman bought 100,000 shares today at a weighted average
price of $20.62, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The stock tumbled $1.32 on the New York
Stock Exchange, or 6.3 percent, giving Gorman a $92,000 one-day
loss on the transaction.  The purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for
2010, increased Gorman’s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about
$18.8 million at today’s closing price of $19.70. It was
Gorman’s first outright purchase since he became CEO of the New
York-based firm at the start of 2010.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  fell 28 percent this year, making its shares
worth 35 percent less than book value. The bank’s puts were the
most active in the U.S. equity-options market yesterday after an
investor bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25
percent below the previous day’s closing level.  Morgan Stanley shares dropped to $19.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest level since
March 9, 2009.  Gorman said in May that the market was assuming worst-case
scenarios for financial companies, which may get a boost if a
notable value investor were to step in and take a large
position. Gorman said in an internal memo in December that the
stock, then trading at $26.86, was “meaningfully undervalued.”  Gorman’s Stake  Gorman’s net worth has dropped with Morgan Stanley’s plunge
this year as the firm tries to raise its market share in fixed-
income trading and increase profitability at the retail
brokerage. His shareholdings were worth about $26.2 million when
he received his annual stock award in January. That figure had
dropped to about $18 million yesterday. Gorman also holds more
than 800,000 options, all of which are more than 30 percent out
of the money.  The stock jumped 11 percent on July 21 after Morgan Stanley
reported a smaller loss than analysts estimated on higher
trading revenue. It has dropped 19 percent since then, as
financial companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated
amid concern the U.S. recovery is weakening and the European
sovereign-debt crisis will spread.  A trader yesterday purchased 34,532 October puts to sell
Morgan Stanley shares at $16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the biggest trade in Morgan Stanley’s puts
since January 2010, according to  Henry Schwartz , president of
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
