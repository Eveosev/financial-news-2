SM Prime Holdings Inc. (SMPH) , the largest
Philippine shopping mall operator, said it dropped a plan for a
$500 million real estate investment trust after the government
doubled the public ownership requirement for property trusts.  The  Philippines  last month raised the public ownership to
67 percent. That compares with the previous minimum public
shareholding of at least 33 percent, Chief Financial Officer
Jeffrey Lim said. SM Prime also has an agreement with some
creditors to retain control over some assets, he said.  SM Prime is dropping its plans for the REIT “given the
current public ownership structure,” Lim said in a briefing in
Manila, adding that the company will seek other forms of
fundraising for projects “given that there’s plenty of
liquidity for capital raising.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
