Novo Nordisk A/S said a study shows
more patients benefit from its diabetes drug Victoza when the
medicine is prescribed early in the disease.  Scientists delving into data from an existing study found
that 72 percent of those treated early with Victoza met a target
of lower blood-sugar levels, compared with 49 percent of those
treated late, the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based drugmaker said in a
statement today.  Sales of Victoza, which mimics a hormone called GLP-1 and
stimulates natural insulin production, more than quadrupled in
the second quarter to 1.25 billion kroner ($229 million).  To contact the reporter for this story:
