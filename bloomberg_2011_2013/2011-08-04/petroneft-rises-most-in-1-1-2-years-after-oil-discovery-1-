Petroneft Resources Plc (PTR) , which today
reported an oil discovery in Russia, rose the most in more than
a year-and-a-half in  London  trading.  Petroneft climbed 12 percent, the biggest gain since
December 2009, to 36.25 pence as of the 4:30 p.m. close in
London.  The explorer said it found oil at the Sibkrayevskaya well
at License 61 in the Tomsk region. The well encountered a 12.6-
meter (41-foot) layer of oil, exceeding pre-drill estimates, the
Dublin-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
