Czech retail sales declined 3.5
percent in June from the year-ago period, the biggest drop since
April 2010 as consumer demand weakens amid concerns about
 Europe â€™s growing debt crisis.  The fall in  consumer spending  was led by sales and repairs
of automobiles, which declined 8.3 percent in June from the
year-ago period, the Prague-based Czech Statistics Office said
today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
