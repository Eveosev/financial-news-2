component maker, aims to raise as much as 203.6 billion won
($191 million) selling shares in an initial public offering in
September, said Korea Exchange Inc., operator of the country’s
bourse.  The company applied to the exchange to sell 22.6 million
new shares for 7,600 won to 9,000 won per share, the exchange
said in an e-mailed  statement  today. Woori Investment &
Securities Co. is arranging the share sale, according to the
statement.  Nexolon, which produces silicon ingots and monocrystalline
wafers, is raising funds to expand capacity as use of solar-
power equipment rises. Net income more than tripled to 35.5
billion won in 2010 from 9.9 billion won in 2009.  The company’s biggest shareholder, Lee Woo Jeong, controls
a 59 percent stake, according to the statement. His father is
