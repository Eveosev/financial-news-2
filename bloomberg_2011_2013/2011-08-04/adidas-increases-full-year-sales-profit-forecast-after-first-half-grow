Adidas AG (ADS)  raised its full-year sales
and earnings forecast after reporting profit advanced in the

sales to rise about 10 percent on a currency neutral basis, it
said in an e-mailed statement today. The company had previously
said sales on that basis would rise by a “high single-digit
rate.”  Earnings per share will increase at a rate approaching 15
percent this year from last year. The company had forecast an
earnings per share increase of between 10 and 15 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
