Commodities slumped, erasing gains
for the year, on growing concern that the global economic
recovery is faltering.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
slumped 2.4 percent to 329.31 as of 1 p.m. in  New York , led by
declines in silver, energy and nickel. A settlement at that
level would leave the index down 1 percent for the year.  “The global slowdown is taking root and poised to vanquish
hopes of a second-half rebound,” James Dailey, who manages $185
million at TEAM Financial Management LLC in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania , said in an e-mail. “That should result in softer-
than-expected demand for industrial commodities in particular.”  Concern the global economy may relapse into a recession has
driven investors out of stocks and into the relative safety of
Treasuries, the Swiss franc and yen. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index is heading for the biggest nine-day slump since March
2009, while two-year Treasury yields plunged to a record low.  Service industries  in the U.S., the largest part of the
nation’s economy, expanded in July at the slowest pace in 17
months, a report showed yesterday. European services and
manufacturing growth eased last month to the slowest pace in
almost two years.  Crude-oil futures fell to the lowest level in five months
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . On the Comex in New York,
silver for September delivery fell as much as 6.2 percent, and
copper futures dropped to a one-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
