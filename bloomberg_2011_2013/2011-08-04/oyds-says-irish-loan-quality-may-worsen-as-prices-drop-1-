Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said loan
quality in Ireland may worsen further, as the prices of office
blocks, hotels and shopping malls show no sign of recovery.  The bank took a loan loss charge of 1.78 billion pounds
($2.91 billion) in Ireland, Lloyds said in a  statement  today.
Sixty-four percent of its loans in the country are impaired,
rising from 53 percent at the end of 2010. Commercial real
estate prices, which have dropped about 60 percent from their
2007 peak, may fall further, the company said.  “The fragility of the economy and political system could
still cause further credit quality deterioration within our book
as it winds down,” Lloyds said.  Lloyds’s entry into Ireland in 1999 helped drive the real-
estate boom which turned to bust in 2008, according to a
government-commissioned report. After injecting almost 8 billion
euros of capital into its Irish unit between December 2008 and
the end of 2010, the company withdrew from Ireland last year.  Lloyd’s Irish loans are now handled by Dublin-based
 Certus , set up by its former executives in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
