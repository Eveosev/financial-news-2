Japan  intervened in the foreign-
exchange market to sell yen, Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda 
told reporters today in  Tokyo .  The nation acted alone, and was in touch with other
countries, Noda said. The  Bank of Japan  separately said in a
statement that it will end its policy meeting today, one day

appropriate action.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
