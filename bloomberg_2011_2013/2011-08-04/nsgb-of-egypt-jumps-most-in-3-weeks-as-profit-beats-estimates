National Societe Generale Bank,
 Egypt â€™s second-biggest publicly traded lender by assets, gained
the most in three weeks after second-quarter profit exceeded
analyst estimates.  The shares of the Cairo-based lender advanced 1.3 percent,
the most since July 13, to 31.41 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30
p.m. close in Cairo. That gave the bank a market value of 11.5
billion pounds ($1.9 billion). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose
1.7 percent.  Profit for the period increased 14 percent to 369.2 million 
pounds from a year-earlier, the bank reported yesterday after market
close. The median of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 339 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
