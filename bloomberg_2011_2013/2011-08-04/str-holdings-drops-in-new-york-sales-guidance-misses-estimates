STR Holdings Inc. (STRI) , a producer of
protective coatings for solar panels, fell in New York trading
after saying sales guidance would miss analysts’ estimates.  The company fell 16 percent to $11.14 by 9:37 a.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, adding to a 33 percent slide this year.  Third-quarter sales will drop to $51 million to $57
million, from $97.8 million a year before, Enfield, Connecticut-
based STR said in a statement yesterday after the close of
regular trading. The range compares with the $101.7 million
average of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Kelly Dougherty, Macquarie Research analyst in New York,
today cut the recommendation on the company to “underperform”
from “neutral” and reduced its 12-month price estimate to
$11.50 from a July 18 forecast of $14 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
