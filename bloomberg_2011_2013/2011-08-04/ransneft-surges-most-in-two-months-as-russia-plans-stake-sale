OAO Transneft rose the most in more
than two months after the government said it may start selling a
stake in the Russian oil pipeline monopoly operator next year.  Its shares climbed as much as 4.6 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since June 2, and were 3.4 percent up at 43,301
rubles by 11:21 a.m.  The government, which owns all the common shares, will cut
its holding to 75 percent, First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor
Shuvalov ’s office said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The decision is opposed by the Moscow-based company’s
management, which says a sale would hinder its ability to borrow
for projects. Transneft President Nikolai Tokarev in September
called privatization “the worst thing” that could happen to
the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
