The HTC-Highroad cycling team, whose
484 race wins included six stage victories in last month’s Tour
de  France , will disband at the end of the year because it cannot
find long-term sponsorship.  “It’s time to release our team members to pursue other
options,” team owner Bob Stapleton said today in an e-mailed
news release. “It’s in their best interest that we make this
decision now.”  Team member  Mark Cavendish , a Briton, won five stages and
the green jersey as the race’s top sprinter at this year’s Tour
de France. HTC-Highroad finished 21st of 22 teams in the 2011
Tour.  The team, which is based in San Luis Obispo, California,
includes 36 male and female racers. Its 484 race wins in 2008-
2010 are more than any other cycling team during that span, HTC-
Highroad said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
