Queens Park Rangers, promoted to
English soccer’s Premier League at the end of last season,
signed striker DJ Campbell from Blackpool on a two-year contract.  QPR didn’t reveal a fee for the 29-year-old, although press
reports said it was 1.25 million pounds ($2 million).  Since last season QPR has signed striker Jay Bothroyd from
Cardiff, and forward Kieron Dyer and defender Danny Gabbidon
from West Ham, on free transfers. The west  London  team is about
to play in the Premier League for the first time since 1996.  Campbell scored 13 goals in the Premier League for
Blackpool last season, although that wasn’t enough to stop the
club from being relegated to the second-tier Championship. He
welcomed the move to QPR.  “It’s a club that I supported as a kid,” Campbell told
the team website after tying up the move. “I grew up around
here and QPR have played a massive part in my life. This was my
first club, from six to 16, so to finally be back here at the
age of 29 is really special. It means a lot to me to be back
here where it all began.”  Campbell played with Bothroyd in his younger days in west
London and his professional career has included spells at
Brentford, Birmingham and Leicester.  QPR has also been linked in media reports with Southampton
winger Jason Puncheon.  The club has been surrounded by takeover speculation amid
reports that  Tony Fernandes , chief executive officer of AirAsia
Bhd., is about to buy it from Formula One chief  Bernie Ecclestone .  To contact the reporter on this story:
