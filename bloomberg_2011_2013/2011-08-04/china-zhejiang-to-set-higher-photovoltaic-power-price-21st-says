China â€™s eastern province of Zhejiang
may set on-grid prices for photovoltaic power at 1.43 yuan a
kilowatt hour, higher than the national standard price of 1
yuan, the 21st Century Business Herald reported today, citing a
government official.  The province is awaiting approval from the National
Development and Reform Commission, the newspaper said, citing
Ling Yun, vice director of Zhejiang Economic and Information
Technology Commission.  About 17 provinces in the region may suffer losses if they
follow the national standard price, the newspaper, citing Wang
Sicheng, an researcher at the NDRC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
