(Corrects date of record price in 13th paragraph.)  Oil fell to the lowest level in five
months in  New York , erasing 2011 gains amid growing evidence the
U.S. economic recovery is stalling and sapping demand in the
world’s biggest consumer.  Futures dropped 5.8 percent as a U.S. government report
showed limited improvement in the labor market. The Dollar Index
gained as much as 1.5 percent, curbing commodities’ appeal as an
alternative investment, and the MSCI All-Country World Index of
stocks slid 3.9 percent.  “What you’re looking at here is concerns about what demand
is going to be doing because of the economy,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
 Washington . “The result of all this could be slower growth and
the result of slower growth is less oil demand.”  Crude for September delivery declined $5.30 to $86.63 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Feb. 18. It was the biggest one-day drop since
May 5. The contract has fallen 5.2 percent in 2011.  Brent for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell $5.98, or 5.3 percent, to $107.25.
For the year to date, Brent advanced 13 percent. The European
benchmark contract was at a $20.62 premium to U.S. futures,
after reaching a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  2011 Decline  Futures have tumbled 25 percent in New York since reaching
a two-year intraday high of $114.83 a barrel on May 2 as
European officials struggled to contain a debt crisis, U.S.
lawmakers attempted to stave off a default and global economic
growth showed signs of slowing.  U.S. gasoline demand, averaged over four weeks, slipped 0.3
percent to 9.07 million barrels a day in the period ended July
29, the Energy Department reported yesterday. The decline was
the fourth in a row.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 1,000 in the
week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest in almost four months,
the Labor Department said in Washington. The four-week average
also fell to the lowest level since April.  Consumer confidence 
dropped to the lowest level in more than two months last week in
the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, the Commerce Department reported last week, less
than the 1.8 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The government also revised down its first-
quarter estimate to 0.4 percent, less than the 1.9 percent
previously indicated.  ’Poor Economic Data’  “With this continuous stream of poor economic data and the
dollar really making impressive gains today, it’s no wonder why
the front-month contract is really under pressure,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, surged 1.5 percent to 75.114 at
3:30 p.m. in New York The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return
Index of 24 commodities tumbled 4 percent to 644.95. Twenty-one
of the commodities dropped, led by gasoline and Nymex and Brent
crudes.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks in developed and
emerging markets dropped 3.9 percent to 312.28, extending the
decline from the near-three-year high on May 2 to 13 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 4.8 percent to 1,200.07 at
4:08 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
tumbled 4.3 percent to 11,383.68.  Technical Support  Oil breached technical support at $89.84, the 50 percent
retracement level on a Fibonacci study from the record $147.27 a
barrel price set in intraday trading July 11, 2008, Armstrong
said.  President  Barack Obama  signed a bill Aug. 1 that averted a
debt default in the world’s largest economy with one day to
spare. In  Europe , officials are trying to put a firewall around
Italy and  Spain , where bond yields have surged to euro-era
records on concern that they will have to follow Greece, Ireland
and Portugal in seeking bailouts.  “Even though the U.S. avoided a debt default, the specter
of a potential systematic failure of the sovereign  debt market 
has engendered a big drop in most markets,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin,  Texas .  Prices also fell after crude stockpiles advanced for a
second week in the seven days ended July 29, according to Energy
Department data yesterday. U.S. inventories rose 950,000 barrels
to 354.9 million barrels.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 936,669
contracts as of 4:09 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 658,645
contracts yesterday. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
