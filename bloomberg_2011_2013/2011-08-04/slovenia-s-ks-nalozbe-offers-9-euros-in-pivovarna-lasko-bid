KS Nalozbe (KSFR)  d.d., a Slovenian
 investment company , offered 9 euros ($12.84) a share in a
takeover bid for Pivovarna Lasko Group d.d., a beverage company
that’s struggling with to repay debts.  The Ljubljana-based KS Nalozbe offered 9 of its bonds in
the value of 1 euro for each share of Pivovarna Lasko, KS
Nalozbe said in a statement to the Ljubljana stock exchange
today. The company didn’t set a threshold for the bid, which
expires at the end of September.  Lasko shares dropped 2.60 euros, or 19 percent, to close at
11 euros at the Ljubljana stock exchange. It’s the biggest drop
since May 19 and gives the company a market value of 94.7
million euros.  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  is selling assets as it needs to repay some
400 million euros in debt accumulated before the global
recession. The company last month sold its juice making unit
Fructal d.o.o. to Serbia’s Nectar d.o.o. for 35 million euros.
It also formed a group with Slovenian banks that want to sell
just over 50 percent of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. by the end
of the year after Lasko previously failed to sell its 23 percent
holding in the largest supermarket chain in the Balkans.  The owner of KS Nalozbe is Igor Lah, who deals mostly with
real estate and is the second-richest Slovenian with an
estimated fortune of 166.5 million euros, Slovenian business
magazine  Manager  said in its annual rich list. His wealth stems
from Slovenian sales of state assets in the 1990s, the magazine
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
