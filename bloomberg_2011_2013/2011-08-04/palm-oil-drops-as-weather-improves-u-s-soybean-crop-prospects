Palm oil  dropped the most in more
than a week on speculation that favorable weather in the U.S.
may boost soybean yields, lifting global supplies of vegetable
oils for use in food and fuel.  The October-delivery contract fell 1.1 percent to 3,101
ringgit ($1,037) per metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest loss since July 25. Futures have lost 18
percent this year.  Some soybean fields from  Colorado  to Iowa may get as much
as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain in the next three days with
more precipitation and cooler temperatures developing after Aug.
8, Dave Tolleris, the president of WXRisk.com in Richmond,
 Virginia , said in a report yesterday.  “There’s less concern of supply coming in below
expectations” for soybeans as the weather improves, Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala
Lumpur . Palm oil is “down because of the grain market.”  Corn dropped for a second day in Chicago on concern that
the global economic growth will slow amid lower spending by U.S.
consumers and companies, reducing demand for the grain that’s
used in food, feed and biofuels. Wheat and soybeans also fell.  Palm oil is lower “due to the global concerns,” Rajesh
Modi, a trader at Singapore-based Sprint Exim Pte., said by
phone. The tropical oil is expected to trade between 3,050
ringgit and 3,200 ringgit until September, he said.  “Demand is there for palm oil in the near term due to the
price differential with soybean oil,” Modi said. “Production
is high, but it is offset by the demand.”  Rising Output  Soybean oil ’s premium over palm oil widened to $216.17 a
ton from $201.34 yesterday. Output of palm oil in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer after  Indonesia , expanded 0.7 percent to
1.75 million tons in June from May, the highest in 20 months.  “The stock levels will remain roughly where they are in
terms of palm,” Ng said. “There’s plenty of it.”  Reserves in Malaysia stood at 2.05 million tons in June,
after reaching an all-time high of 2.27 million tons in November
2008, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Data on output,
inventory and exports for July are set for release on Aug. 10.  Soybeans for delivery in November lost as much as 0.8
percent to $13.6225 per bushel in  Chicago  and last traded at
$13.6275. Soybean oil for December delivery dropped as much as
0.4 percent to 56.83 cents per pound.  Palm oil for May delivery fell 1 percent to close at 9,142
yuan ($1,420) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and soybean
oil for delivery in the same month shed 0.8 percent to settle at
10,278 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
