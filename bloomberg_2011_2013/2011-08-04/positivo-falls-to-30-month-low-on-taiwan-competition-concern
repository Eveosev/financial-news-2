Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3)  dropped to
its lowest price in 30 months on speculation Taipei-based
 Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  plans to increase its business in Brazil,
making competition tougher for the country’s biggest computer
maker.  Positivo plunged 4.7 percent to 5.42 reais at 9:51 a.m. New
York time, the lowest since February 2009. It earlier dropped
7.4 percent, the most intraday in seven weeks.  Asustek aims to increase to 13 percent from 1 percent its
market share in Brazil over the next two years, which would make
the company one of the country’s three biggest computer makers,
newspaper  Valor Economico  reported today, citing Chief Executive
Officer Jerry Shen.  “We consider the news negative for Positivo,” Banco J.
Safra SA’s analysts Erick Guedes and Fernando Labes wrote in a
note to clients. “It reinforces once again that competition
with large global players will remain tough for the coming
years.”  Positivo tumbled 42 percent this year through yesterday,
the fourth-worst performance in the 73-member  BM&FBovespa Small
Cap (SMLLBV)  Index. The gauge dropped 15 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
