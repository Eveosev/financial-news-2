The leader of the House of Commons,
George Young, said lawmakers may debate the reintroduction of
the death penalty in Britain if there’s sufficient support for
electronic petitions calling for it to be reinstated.  Young, who handles parliamentary business for the
government in the lower chamber, said in an article in the Daily
Mail newspaper today that lawmakers should respond to the issues
raised by voters on a  government website . So-called e-petitions
included “Reinstatement of the death penalty” and “Bring back
capital punishment in Britain.”  “People have strong opinions, and it does not serve
democracy well if we ignore them or pretend that their views do
not exist,” Young said. Lawmakers need to explain to the public
why they would reject re-adopting capital punishment, he added.  The petitions need at least 100,000 signatures before a
committee of lawmakers decides whether to debate the subject in
Parliament. The death penalty, which was abolished in 1969, was
last debated during the passage of the Human Rights Act in 1998
and was rejected by 158 votes, Young said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
