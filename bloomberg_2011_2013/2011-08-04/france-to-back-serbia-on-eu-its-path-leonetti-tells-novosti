France  has decided to support  Serbia 
on its path to the European Union, a move which doesn’t hinge on
Serbia’s recognition of Kosovo’s independence, Novosti reported,
citing French European Affairs Minister Jean Leonetti.  Reconciliation between Kosovo and Serbia “is not a formal
condition, but there is a possible way between legal recognition
and political normalization,” the newspaper quoted Leonetti as
saying.  France, which has recognized Kosovo’s independence, will
send one of its EU enlargement experts to join Serbia’s European
Integrations Office, as the country steps up efforts to convince
the bloc of its readiness to become a candidate and get the date
for starting entry talks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
