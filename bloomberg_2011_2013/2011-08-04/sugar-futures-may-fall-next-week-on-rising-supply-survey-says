Raw sugar may decline next week on
signs that global supplies will outpace demand.  Seven of 12 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in  New York  would fall. Two said
it would gain, while three were neutral. Before today, futures
for October delivery fell 6.8 percent this week to 27.79 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Seven respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE Liffe
would slide, while two forecast a gain. Three expected little
change. Futures for October delivery fell 7.4 percent this week
through yesterday.  Six respondents said refined-sugar’s premium over raw would
narrow, two said it would widen, and four were neutral.  -- Editors: Millie Munshi, Daniel Enoch  To contact the reporters on this story:
