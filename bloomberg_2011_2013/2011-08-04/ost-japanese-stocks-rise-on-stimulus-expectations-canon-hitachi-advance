Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
advanced for the first time in three days after the government
sold yen, boosting prospects for exporters’ earnings. Mining and
energy companies slipped.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which gets 80 percent of its sales abroad,
climbed 1 percent. Hitachi Ltd. rose 1.7 percent after a person
familiar with the matter said its in talks with  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)  to merge some businesses, following a Nikkei
newspaper report on the possible deal.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s
largest energy exploration company, declined 2.1 percent after
crude  oil prices  dropped.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 percent to 9,659.18 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index fell for a third
day, ending 0.1 percent lower at 826.36 after advancing as much
as 1.1 percent. The indexes pared gains as oil prices slipped.  “The intervention was timely and concerns about the yen’s
appreciation eased, however, that wasn’t great enough to erase
investors’ worries,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee
the equivalent of $18 billion as chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “Gains in stocks were limited as
people still want to identify whether intervention will be
continued.”  The yen dropped against all 16 of its major counterparts,
falling to 79.41 against the dollar while the stock market was
open, the lowest level since July 14, compared with 77.15 at the
close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, the
yen slipped to 113.37 from 109.65. A weaker yen boosts the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency.  Canon, Nintendo  Exporters advanced on easing concerns the yen, which had
approached a postwar high against the dollar, will hurt overseas
earnings. Canon closed at 3,725 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, advanced 0.6 percent to 3,140 yen.
Nintendo Co., the game maker which receives more than 80 percent
of its revenue outside Japan, climbed 1.1 percent to 11,950 yen.  The Bank of Japan expanded its asset-purchase fund to 15
trillion yen ($189 billion) from 10 trillion yen, according to a
statement in Tokyo today. It also expanded a credit facility by
5 trillion yen to 35 trillion and kept its benchmark interest
rate near zero. It ended the meeting a day earlier than
scheduled after the government intervened.  It was the first time the central bank expanded the asset-
buying fund, its main policy tool, since the March earthquake
and tsunami. The fund buys financial assets ranging from
government bonds to real-estate investment trusts.  Swiss Action  Japan ’s Switzerland, also contending with a stronger
currency, unexpectedly cut  interest rates  and pledged to boost
the supply of the franc yesterday.  In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.5
percent to 1,260.34 yesterday, snapping a seven-day decline,
amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  may consider another
economic stimulus program to prevent a recession.  The Wall Street Journal reported three former top officials
at the Fed said the central bank should consider a new round of
securities purchases to bolster economic growth.  “If investor sentiment improves because of easing monetary
policies in the U.S., their tolerance for risk will increase,”
said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , advanced 1.7 percent to 471 yen. Mitsubishi
Heavy, Japan’s largest maker of heavy machinery, leapt 3.4
percent to 361 yen.  Merger Talks?  Both companies said they’re not holding talks to merge some
businesses, hours after the president of Hitachi said that a
deal was being discussed.  “Greater integration of businesses is very good for
Japanese industries as a whole,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps
oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“We should pay attention to how much synergy the merger will
create.”  Companies which reported higher profits advanced.  Konami Corp. (9766) , a game developer, surged 5.1 percent to 2,295
yen, the most on the Nikkei. Net income more than tripled to
4.04 billion yen in the April-June period from 1.27 billion yen
a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  Japan Steel Works Ltd. (5631) , a maker of machinery for castings,
jumped 3.4 percent to 545 yen. It reported net income surged 94
percent to 5.61 billion yen in the quarter ended June 30.  Among the 820 Japanese companies in the Topix index that
posted quarterly earnings results since July 11, 142 beat the
average analyst profit estimate, while 83 reported disappointing
results, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stocks pared gains in the last 20 minutes before the market
close, dragged down by mining companies. Crude for September
delivery declined 0.5 percent to $91.51 a barrel in electronic
trading in  New York .  Inpex closed at 572,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum Exploration
Co. (1662) , the second-biggest oil driller, lost 1.6 percent to 3,770
yen.  -- Editors: Andrew Hobbs, Rebecca Keenan  To contact the reporters on this story:
