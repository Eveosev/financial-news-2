New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
signed bills to lend towns $650 million for water projects.  The loans will be interest-free or carry low rates and will
be financed through the state’s Environmental Infrastructure
Trust, which will issue bonds to cover the cost, said Christie,
a first-term Republican. He said $400 million will go to clean-
water projects and $250 million will protect drinking water.  The measures include $16 million for projects aimed at
improving conditions in Barnegat Bay on New Jersey’s coast, the
governor said.  “We have to invest in these projects if we’re going to
make New Jersey in the future a leader in economic development
and environmental development,” Christie said today as he
signed the bill in Barnegat, north of  Atlantic City . “The
Jersey Shore and Barnegat Bay are huge economic drivers in this
state, and they won’t continue to be if they aren’t protected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
