Belgian 10-year bonds fell for a
sixth-straight day, driving the yield on the securities up as
much as eight basis points to 4.54 percent, the highest since
January 2009. The yield was at 4.53 percent as of 7:42 a.m. in
 London  today.  Italian bonds rose for a second day, pushing down the yield
on 10-year bonds by two basis points to 6.07 percent. That
reduced the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of benchmark German bunds by seven basis
points to 361 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
