Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s
second-largest bank by market value, plans to add 2,000 people
globally by the end of this year, as rivals including  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Barclays Plc cut jobs.  The U.K. bank will also add 10 more outlets in China by the
end of 2011, taking its total in the Asian nation to at least 81,
Jaspal Singh Bindra, chief executive officer for Asian
operations, said in an interview today in Hong Kong.  Standard Chartered , which earns most of its profit in Asia,
yesterday forecast an eighth successive year of record profit
after first-half net income beat analysts’ estimates. HSBC this
week said it would eliminate 30,000 posts by the end of 2013,
while Barclays planned to cut 3,000 jobs in 2011 as revenue in
 Europe  and the U.S. slows.  “We’ve been growing the business,” Bindra said. “We’ve
been hiring people all along, and we’ve been growing our profits
as well.”  Standard Chartered fell 1 percent to HK$199.40 as of 9:42
a.m. in Hong Kong trading today. The stock has dropped 5.9
percent this year, compared with the 4.1 percent decline in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Bindra said most of the hiring would be in the emerging
markets.  Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank by assets,
announced the job cuts as second-quarter investment banking
profit fell by more than a quarter.  HSBC Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver this week said
he plans to trim 10 percent of staff at Europe’s largest bank
after a bigger workforce and wage inflation helped drive up
costs, while hiring 3,000 to 5,000 people a year in emerging
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
