OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  climbed for the third
day this week after market researcher FMB said the Russian
potash producer’s trader may have agreed to sell the soil
nutrient to India under the same terms announced yesterday by
Canada’s Canpotex Ltd.  Its shares added 1.9 percent to 267.26 rubles by 12:28 p.m.
in Moscow, helping to pare yesterday’s 5.2 percent slump.  Canada’s Canpotex said yesterday it agreed to sell Indian
customers potash at $470 per metric ton through the end of the
year and at $530 a ton in the first quarter of 2012.  Mikhail Safin, an equity analyst at  Renaissance Capital ,
said in an e-mailed report this would be “positive” for
Uralkali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
