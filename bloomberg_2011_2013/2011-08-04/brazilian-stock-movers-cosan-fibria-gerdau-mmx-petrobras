The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m.  New York  time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 5.7 percent to 52,811.36.  Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3)  (FIBR3 BS), the world’s biggest
pulpmaker, declined 6.9 percent to 15.23 reais, a record low
since the company went public in August 2009. Fibria, which
obtains most of its revenue from exports, has fallen 18 percent
this week on increased pessimism about the global economy.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  (GGBR4 BS),  Latin America ’s largest steelmaker,
dropped 7.4 percent to 12.20 reais after reporting a 36 percent
decline in second-quarter profit as raw-material costs rose
faster than revenue. Gerdau has retreated 46 percent this year
in Sao Paulo trading as higher costs for raw materials such as
iron ore and coal, and the appreciation of the local currency,
cut profit margins.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3 BS), the iron-ore miner
controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , tumbled 16
percent to 6.11 reais, its lowest price in two years. Shares
have lost 25 percent this week on concern that the global
economic recovery is faltering, lowering demand for commodities.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BS),  Brazil ’s state-
controlled oil company, retreated 7.4 percent to 20.65 reais,
the lowest closing price since December 2008. Crude fell in New
York, erasing its 2011 gains, among growing evidence that the
U.S. economic recovery is stalling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
