Fraport AG, the operator of Frankfurt
airport, said second-quarter profit rose 22 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates, as passenger numbers increased.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed to 229.9 million euros from 188.8 million
euros a year earlier, the Frankfurt-based company said in a
statement. Ebitda exceeded the 211 million-euro average of nine
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased 14.4
percent to 617 million euros.  Fraport, which also operates terminals in cities including
 Lima , Peru, and Antalya,  Turkey , is completing a fourth runway
at its marquee site in Frankfurt,  Europe ’s third-busiest
airport, to raise flight capacity there by 54 percent. Earnings
growth in the quarter propelled an 18 percent Ebitda jump in the
first six months of the year as group traffic increased 11
percent to 43 million passengers.  “Fraport has profited from the good positioning of its
locations in the worldwide air traffic industry” during the
first half, Chief Executive Stefan Schulte said in the
statement.  Second-quarter net income jumped 71 percent to 81 million
euros, or 86 cents
a share, as financial costs declined, the company said.  Fraport is bidding jointly with Deutsche Bank AG’s RREEF
investment unit to buy the airport business that German builder
Hochtief AG is selling, according to people familiar with the
process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
