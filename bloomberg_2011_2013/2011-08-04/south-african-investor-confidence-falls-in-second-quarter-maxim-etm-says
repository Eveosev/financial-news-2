Investor confidence in  South Africa 
fell to its lowest since the second quarter of 2010 in the three
months through June, according to an index that tracks where
investors are moving their money.  The Maxim-ETM Investor Confidence Index declined to 99.1
from a downwardly revised 107.1 in the first quarter,  George Glynos , managing director of Econometrix Treasury Management,
and analyst  Russell Lamberti  said in an e-mailed note today. The
move suggests l“ittle bullish equity market impetus,” the
wrote. The gauge, which was started in 2000, was 8 percent
higher than a year earlier.  “Equity allocation has now barely changed for three
straight quarters, with most of the action in the past nine
months changes to weightings between bonds and cash,” the
analysts said.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  left its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged on July 21 for a fourth consecutive meeting after
cutting it three times last year to 5.5 percent, even as
inflation rose to the highest rate in 15 months in June.
Investors are betting rates won’t rise this year as the central
bank supports a recovery in the country’s economy, which it
described as “fragile.”  “There appears to be a tight monetary environment in South
Africa right now and the rise of input prices, administered
costs, and commodity inflation has served to eat into savings
and real incomes,” the analysts wrote. “As a result the
overall growth in new fund inflows from savers was much slower
in the second quarter and suggests a difficult environment for
funds competing for new business and for the equity space in
general.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
