ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG,  Germany ’s
biggest private broadcaster, said second-quarter earnings rose
29 percent, driven by growth at its Nordic television unit and
in video games and mobile-phone applications.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization increased to 265.8 million euros ($379.5 million)
from 205.4 million euros a year earlier, the Unterfoehring,
Germany-based said today in a  statement . That beat the 257.6
million-euro average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The company has used proceeds from the sale of Belgian and
Dutch assets to reduce debt. Lenders approved new terms
yesterday on remaining debt, under which owners KKR & Co. and
Permira Advisers LLP can cut their stake to as little as 35.1
percent of voting shares from 88 percent without triggering a
full repayment.  “Figures were quite good and driven by the still positive
ad business cycle,” Harald Heider, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in an e-mail. At the same time, the company
lacks a “good strategic position” for its digital unit.
ProSieben’s 18.50-euro price estimate and “sell”
recommendation, which Heider reiterated on June 15, are under
review, he said.  Shares Rise  ProSiebenSat.1 dropped as much as 5.4 percent to 15.81
euros and was down 3.6 percent as of 11:16 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading. The stock has fallen 28 percent this year, valuing the
company at 3.53 billion euros.  Second-quarter net income jumped 68 percent to 129 million
euros. Sales climbed 5 percent to 799.6 million euros, topping
the 784.3 million-euro average estimate. Revenue from television
advertising and program distribution outside Germany rose 16
percent, pushed by growth in Nordic markets, while the digital
unit’s video-advertising, online games and mobile applications
sales increased 9.5 percent.  ProSiebenSat.1 reiterated a forecast today that sales will
rise by a “mid single-digit” percentage this year. The company
raised the forecast last month, citing a better second quarter
than predicted.  Excluding the broadcasting and print-media operations in
 Belgium  and the Netherlands that were sold to a group led by
Finland’s Sanoma OYJ, sales rose 6.5 percent to 692.2 million
euros and recurring Ebitda increased 6.8 percent to 238.7
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
