Vietnam  aims to encourage greater
domestic use of the dong rather than the dollar and avoid a
surplus of local currency,  State Bank  of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in an interview on Vietnam Television today.  The bank will set  interest rates  for the dong and the
dollar at a reasonable level to ensure sufficient supply and
prevent speculation, Binh said in the interview.  With these measures, the dong’s exchange rate to the dollar
should stay stable until year-end, Binh told Vietnam Television.  Binh, who was approved as governor yesterday, reiterated
the bank aims to lower dong lending rates to a range of 17
percent to 19 percent. The monetary authority is looking to
reduce them from mid-September through end-2011, he said on
Vietnam Television.  The central bank will maintain a tight monetary policy in
line with Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung’s resolution passed in
February to curb inflation, he also said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
