The Philippine peso fell for a third
day on concern the central bank will impose measures to curb
volatility in the  currency market .  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is prepared to limit some
foreign-exchange transactions of lenders and is reviewing non-
deliverable forwards, Governor Amando Tetangco said in an email
late yesterday.  Government bonds  fell ahead of inflation data
for July due tomorrow.  “The monetary authority is talking of prudent measures and
some market players may have decided to close their positions
first,” said Ricky Cebrero, head of treasury at the  Philippine
National Bank  in Manila.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 42.333 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close of trading in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. Non-deliverable forwards show traders expect the currency
to weaken in the next three to 12 months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank “will not go against the fundamental
currency trend, but will not hesitate to use tools, including
imposing prudential limits on certain transactions of banks,”
Tetangco said in his email.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due March 2017 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.08 percent,
according to prices from Amstel Financial Services.  Consumer prices rose 5 percent in July from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That would compare with an increase of 5.2 percent
in June, the most in 26 months.  To contact the reporter for this story:
