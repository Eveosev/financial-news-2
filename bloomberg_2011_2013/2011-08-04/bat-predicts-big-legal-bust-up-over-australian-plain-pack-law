British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ’s
Australia unit’s Chief Executive Officer David Crow warned the
government to prepare for a legal fight if it presses ahead with
a plan that requires cigarettes to be sold in plain packages.  “There will be a big legal bust up down the road,” Crow
told a parliamentary committee on plain packaging in Canberra
today. “We don’t want a fight, but we will defend if we have
to.”  The Australian proposal is the first in the world aimed at
banning logos and color variations on cigarette packages.  New
Zealand ,  Canada  and the U.K. had considered the move before
dropping it out of concern it would be illegal, Crow told the
committee. The proposal may infringe international trademark and
intellectual property laws, the maker of Dunhill and  Australia ’s
best-selling cigarette brand Winfield, has  said .  BAT doesn’t have a number on the compensation it will seek
from the government for losing the ability to use its
trademarks, Crow said.  Under the proposed law, the name of the cigarette brand
would be printed in a uniform font at the bottom of the package,
which would be dark olive green. The legislation, if passed in
parliament, will take effect Jan. 1 and be implemented July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
