New York  Mets left-handed pitcher
Johan Santana will rest from throwing after tests showed his
surgically repaired shoulder was fatigued and otherwise normal,
the team said in a news release.  Santana, 32, who has not pitched since Sept. 2, missed a
rehabilitation start scheduled for yesterday and flew from
Florida to New York for tests on the left shoulder.  “He will resume his throwing program once his shoulder is
at full strength,” the team said yesterday in the release.  The four-time All-Star pitched three scoreless innings in a
rehab assignment July 28 for the Mets’ Class A minor-league
affiliate in St. Lucie, Florida. Santana had been on a rehab
plan that targeted a return to the major leagues by late August.  General Manager  Sandy Alderson  said two days ago that the
overriding goal is for Santana to be ready for the start of the
2012 season.  A two-time Cy Young Award winner for the  Minnesota Twins  in
2004 and 2006, Santana signed a six-year, $137.5 million
contract with the Mets in February 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
