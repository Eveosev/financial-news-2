Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
plunged as concern the economy is faltering sparked a global
equities rout that drove the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its
worst slump since February 2009.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
exporter of consumer electronics that earns half of its revenue
in the U.S. and Europe, lost 4 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest
carmaker, retreated 2.4 percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
biggest global mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer,
sank 4.2 percent as commodity prices dropped.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,280 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
9,670 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,310
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index tumbled 3.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index,
the first market to open in the Asia-Pacific region, slumped 2.3
percent in Wellington, the biggest drop since March 2009.  “It’s a panic attack from fear that growth is dropping off
a cliff,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent
of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd.
“There was an expectation that resolution of the U.S. debt-
ceiling issue would trigger a relief rally. It looks like
everyone forgot about the weakness in the underlying economy.”  U.S. options prices soared the most in four years as
investors scrambled to buy protection against greater stock-
market losses as worsening economic data sent stocks to the
longest losing streak since the  bull market  began in March 2009.  Global Rout  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2
percent today. In New York yesterday, the  S&P 500  tumbled 4.8
percent to an eight-month low of 1,200.07, erasing its 2011 gain.
The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index sank 3.5 percent to 243.16 in  London ,
the biggest decline since May 2010.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
policy makers will offer banks in the region additional cash to
ease tensions in financial markets.  Trichet indicated the ECB is reluctant to shelve further
rate hikes even as investors reduce bets on the central bank
adding to its two rate moves in 2011. While acknowledging a
“particularly high” level of uncertainty, rates are still
“accommodative” and inflation risks “remain on the upside,”
he said.  “Investors are increasingly removing risk assets, and
people are seeking some political measures,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager at the investment strategy
department at Okasan Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Even though the
economy is slowing and the Europe crisis persists, policy makers
in the U.S. have not taken measures.”  Yen Rises  The rout in equities followed yesterday’s move by the
Japanese government to sell yen to stem gains in the currency
that threaten the nation’s economic recovery. The yen
appreciated to as high as 78.67 against the dollar today,
compared with 79.41 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo
yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to
111.14 from 113.30. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters
because it cuts the value of overseas sales.  The U.S. Labor Department said yesterday that initial
claims for unemployment insurance payments fell last week to a
level that shows limited improvement in the labor market of the
world’s biggest economy. Applications for jobless benefits
dropped 1,000 in the week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest
in almost four months.  Commodities Slump  Employers probably added 85,000 workers in July, economists
project a Labor Department report to show today. That may not be
enough to reduce a jobless rate that’s holding above 9 percent,
they forecast.  Amid intensifying concerns about the global economy,
commodity prices slumped. Crude oil for September delivery fell
5.8 percent to $86.63 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Feb. 18. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
lost 1.9 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 11.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 13 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12 times for the S&P 500 and 9.9 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
