The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m.  New York  time.  The IGBC Index fell 3.2 percent to 13,420.71 while the
Colcap Index dropped 3 percent to 1601.14, in the biggest
declines since November 2010.  Oil companies dropped as crude fell to the lowest level in
five months in New York.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 4.7 percent
to 47,300 pesos, the most since March 15. Canadian stocks fell
the most in almost 25 months, led by oil and metals producers,
as commodity prices tumbled on a stronger U.S. dollar and
concern the global economy is stalling.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based oil
company with fields in  South America , fell 8 percent, the most
since April 25, to 1,720 pesos.  Isagen SA (ISAGEN CB), a Colombian energy company, fell 2.6
percent, the most since Jan. 3, to 2,275 pesos. Delays in the
companyâ€™s Amoya project could reduce margins in the next year as
the company takes on a higher debt burden, according to an e-
mailed report yesterday from Interbolsa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
