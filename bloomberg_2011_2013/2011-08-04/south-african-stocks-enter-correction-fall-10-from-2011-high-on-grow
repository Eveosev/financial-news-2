South Africa’s stock gauge fell more
than 10 percent from its 2011 high, entering a so-called
correction as commodities dropped on concern the global economy
is slowing.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index retreated 3 percent to
29,601.61 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The gauge is 11
percent down from 33,094.06 reached on Feb. 14, the highest
closing level this year.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , the world’s biggest
mining company, fell for a ninth day, its longest streak of
losses since 2002, slipping 3.4 percent. Anglo American Plc
declined 4.4 percent to the lowest since Oct. 7.  Emerging-market stocks are set for their largest weekly
decline since May 2010 as investors dumped stocks in favor of
the relative safety of gold and U.S. Treasuries after reports on
manufacturing, spending and the services industries fueled
concern the world’s biggest economy is faltering.  “It just shows that there isn’t much of a belief among
foreign investors of South Africa being an emerging market with
strong growth potential,” Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury
strategic research at Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, a unit
of  South Africa ’s fourth-biggest bank, said by phone.  Foreign investors were net sellers of 458.7 million rand
($66 million) of South African equities yesterday, taking net
sales this year to 77.9 million rand, according to data compiled
by JSE Ltd., which manages the nation’s stock and bond
exchanges. Foreign investors’ purchases of local equities have
turned negative for the first time since 2008, Cruickshanks
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
