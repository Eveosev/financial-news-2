German two-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield below 1 percent, after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said  the ECB will conduct an “operation to
provide liquidity” over six months after growth slowed.  The yield fell as low as 0.999 percent, and was four basis
points lower at 1.002 percent as of 1:40 p.m. in London. The 10-
year yield fell one basis point to 2.39 percent.  Trichet also said monetary policy in the euro region
remains “accommodative,” though ``downside'' risks to growth
may have intensified.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
