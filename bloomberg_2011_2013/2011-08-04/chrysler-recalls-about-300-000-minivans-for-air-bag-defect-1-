Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker run by  Fiat SpA (F) , is recalling about 300,000 Dodge and
Chrysler brand minivans in  North America , citing a risk of air
bags deploying when not needed and without warning.  The vehicles in this recall are the same ones involved in
an earlier recall to replace a heating and cooling system drain
grommet, the automaker, based in  Auburn Hills , Michigan, said in
a document posted today on the U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration website.  Chrysler is recalling model-year 2008 Chrysler Town and
Country and Voyager minivans and Dodge Caravans, it said on the
NHTSA site. Because of the earlier defect, moisture may have
leaked into the air-bag controls, the company said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Chrysler said it doesn’t know of any accidents or injuries
related to the air-bag defect.  “Despite the lack of field reports, we believe it is in
the best interest of our customers to replace these modules to
ensure the proper functionality of the minivan’s advanced safety
system,” David Dillon, Chrysler’s head of product
investigations and campaigns, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
