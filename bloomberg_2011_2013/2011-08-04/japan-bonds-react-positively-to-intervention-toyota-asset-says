Jun Fukashiro, senior  fund manager  at
Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, comments after the yield
on  Japan ’s benchmark 10-year bond declined below 1 percent for
the first time since Nov. 12, to 0.995 percent.  The drop came after Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said
Japan intervened unilaterally in the currency market to weaken
the yen, and after the Bank of Japan said it would end its
policy meeting today a day early.  On the fall in the 10-year bond yield to below 1 percent:  “People were thinking that the Bank of Japan would decide
tomorrow on additional quantitative easing steps to match the
intervention in  currency markets . The bank decided to move up
the schedule and act today, and the move in the yield is a
positive assessment of the decision. ”  “It’s possible that the size of the fund the BOJ uses for
making asset purchases will be increased. Government bonds of
longer maturities may also be bought, and the amount of the
securities that are purchased may be boosted.”  “The  Bank of Japan  and the government prepared in advance
to stem the yen’s rise, and are acting.  They will work until
the yen’s rise is halted. Japan and Switzerland are in the same
position. They may be sharing information as they carry out
monetary easing.’”  On the outlook for the 10-year bond yield:  “The yield may head for a level at 0.8 percent or higher,
like last summer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
