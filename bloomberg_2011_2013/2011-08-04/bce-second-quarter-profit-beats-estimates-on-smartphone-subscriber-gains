BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada ’s second-largest
wireless carrier, reported second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after luring smartphone subscribers with
discounts.  Profit excluding some items increased 10 percent to 86
Canadian cents (88 cents) a share, compared with the average
estimate of 82 cents in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 12
percent to C$4.96 billion, the Montreal-based company said today
in a statement. Analysts predicted C$4.94 billion.  Chief Executive Officer George Cope offered introductory
deals on smartphones such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone to lure
customers from  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , Canada’s largest
wireless carrier, and  Telus Corp. (T) , the no. 3. Although that push
won BCE more customers than analysts predicted, the costs of the
incentives may cut future profitability, said  Maher Yaghi , an
analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. in  Montreal .  “While the company had a strong showing in terms of
smartphone subscriber penetration, cost of acquisition and
retention has accelerated, putting pressure on margins,” said
Yaghi, who recommends buying the shares.  BCE dropped 58 cents, or 1.6 percent, to C$36.13 at 4 p.m.
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed 2.2
percent this year.  The cost of acquiring wireless customers jumped by 19
percent as BCE paid more to subsidize new smartphones to win
subscribers onto long-term contracts. Postpaid churn, a measure
of customer defections, rose to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent.  Bell Wireless  Bell Wireless, BCE’s mobile business, added 94,309 contract
subscribers last quarter. Yaghi had predicted 82,000 contract
additions. The unit generated C$52.99 in average revenue per
customer, compared with the C$54.10 estimate from Yaghi.  Net income declined 2.5 percent to C$590 million, or 76
cents a share, from C$605 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier.
That included costs related to the C$1.3 billion acquisition of
broadcaster CTV.  “It’s been a great start at Bell Media,” Cope said on a
conference call. BCE bought the broadcaster as part of Cope’s
“four-screen strategy” to add programming that Bell can sell
to customers on smartphones and tablets, as well as their TV and
computers.  Sales at Bell Media climbed 5 percent to C$529 million as
advertising revenue rebounded and added 5 cents per share in
earnings, Cope said on the call.  Wireless revenue climbed 6.1 percent to C$1.28 billion last
quarter, fueled by a 34 percent gain in data revenue. Fixed-line
revenue dropped 2 percent to C$2.63 billion, dragged lower by
landline customer losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
