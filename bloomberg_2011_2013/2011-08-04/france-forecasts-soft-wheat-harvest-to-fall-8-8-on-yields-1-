France’s soft-wheat harvest will
slide 8.8 percent after a spring drought cut yields, less than
the decline forecast a month ago, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.
The outlook for barley and rapeseed was raised.  Soft-wheat production will drop to 32.5 million metric tons
in 2011 from 35.7 million tons a year ago, the ministry said in
a  report  on its website today. The outlook was raised by 548,000
tons from the ministry’s July report.  Rain in June and July broke a spring drought, partially
restoring soil moisture and lifting crop prospects in France,
the European Union’s largest wheat producer. Milling wheat for
November delivery has fallen 17 percent in Paris trading since
the end of May.  “The cereal yields will be reduced, resulting in a harvest
decline,” the ministry said. “Rapeseed production will be up
thanks to an increased planted surface.”  Average French wheat yields are forecast to be 6.48 tons
per hectare (2.47 acres) compared with 7.24 tons in 2010, and
better than the 6.35 tons forecast in the July report.  Barley production will drop 13 percent to 8.79 million
tons, compared with 8.41 million tons forecast a month ago, the
ministry’s report shows.  France ’s rapeseed harvest is forecast to rise 4.2 percent
to 5.02 million tons, the ministry said, reversing its July
outlook for a 6 percent decline. Yields for the oilseed are seen
at 3.25 tons per hectare from 3.29 tons in 2010, and compared
with 2.98 tons forecast in July.  In a first estimate, the agriculture ministry put the 2011
corn harvest at 13.5 million tons, down 3.3 percent from the
previous year on a decline in yields and planting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
