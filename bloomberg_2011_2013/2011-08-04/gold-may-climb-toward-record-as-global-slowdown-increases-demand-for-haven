Gold traded near an all-time high as
investors sought a refuge from depreciating currencies amid
concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may provide additional stimulus
as the economic recovery falters.  Immediate-delivery gold, which jumped to a record $1,672.80
an ounce yesterday, gained as much as 0.5 percent to $1,669.35,
before trading at $1,662.05 at 2:36 p.m. in Singapore. Spot gold
has rallied 2.4 percent this week as investors sought haven
assets on concern that debt problems in the U.S. and  Europe  will
slow growth. Holdings in exchange-traded products rose to
2,178.467 metric tons yesterday, the highest level ever.  Japan  joined Switzerland in taking steps to weaken their
currencies as concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing drove
investors toward safer assets including gold, the yen and Swiss
francs. Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said Japan sold yen,
which earlier this week neared a postwar record, a day after the
Swiss central bank cut  interest rates  and said it will boost the
supply of francs to curb the “massively overvalued” currency.  “We expect investor flows to remain strong and gold’s
uptrend to continue,” said Xin Yi Chen, an analyst at  Barclays
Capital , which forecasts gold may average $1,560 this quarter.
“People are looking for a safe haven and currencies like the
franc and yen have also declined recently, so investors have
very few places left to put their money.”  December-delivery gold in  New York  rose as much as 0.3
percent to $1,671.80, after touching an all-time high of
$1,675.90 yesterday. Cash silver rallied as much as 0.8 percent
to $42.0250 an ounce, matching yesterday’s three-month high.  ‘Economic Stimulus’  “Every time we see economic weakness, there will be
discussion about more economic stimulus,” said  Richard Sichel ,
who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co. “That could be the case given the fairly
weak economic figures we’ve had.”  Reports today and tomorrow may show initial U.S. jobless
claims climbed last week, while the  unemployment rate  remained
above 9 percent, according to Bloomberg surveys. There’s a 50
percent chance of another recession, Harvard University
economics professor  Martin Feldstein , a member of the Business
Cycle Dating Committee, said on Aug. 2.  Gold for December-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose as much as 0.5 percent to a record 346.99 yuan a gram,
while futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange surged to the
highest level since 1982.  Dollar Rallies  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the U.S. currency’s strength
against six major counterparts, rallied as much as 0.6 percent
today after Japan intervened. Gold typically moves counter to
the dollar.  Gold’s relative-strength index has topped 70 since Aug. 2,
a sign that the metal may be set to drop. The price may decline
because an influx of speculators has made the rally too “hot,”
according to analyst David Hightower of the Hightower Report.  The metal may slump to $1,600 in the near term as some
investors view the rally as overdone, Hightower said in an
interview yesterday. After falling, prices may rebound to $1,730
by the yearend as investors seek a haven.  Spot platinum declined 1.2 percent to $1,760.50 an ounce
and palladium dropped 1.2 percent to $786 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
