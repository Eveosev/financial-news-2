Canadian stocks fell, completing the
biggest weekly drop in more than two years, as energy and bank
stocks declined on concern a decrease in U.S. unemployment won’t
ensure the stability of the global economic recovery.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
decreased 2.4 percent as crude futures fluctuated after five
days of losses.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  slipped 2.2 percent after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its growth forecast for the U.S.
 Magna International Inc. (MG) , Canada’s biggest auto-parts maker,
slumped 12 percent after reporting earnings that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 217.96
points, or 1.8 percent, to 12,162.17 for a 6.1 percent weekly
decline, the biggest since February 2009.  “It’s the fear of a recession,” Karl Berger, a  money
manager  at Toron Investment Management in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. The firm manages about C$400 million ($407
million). “Right now the bears have the upper hand, and until
that momentum breaks or stalls, there isn’t a lot of reason to
fight it.”  The S&P/TSX plunged 8.3 percent from July 22 to yesterday,
sliding to its lowest level relative to forecast earnings since
April 2009, as data on Canadian and U.S. gross domestic product,
as well as indexes of U.S. manufacturing and service businesses,
missed economists’ forecasts. The U.S. Labor Department today
said the jobless rate dropped to 9.1 percent as discouraged
workers left the  labor force .  Persistent Unemployment  “The lack of pickup on the unemployment front and the data
last week only confirm that without employment, people aren’t
going to spend and business confidence isn’t likely to be at
robust levels,” Berger said.  The U.S. has a one-in-three chance of a new recession in
the next nine months, Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients today.  Also today,  Statistics Canada  said Canadian employers added
7,100 jobs last month, less than half the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index fell for an eighth day and ended
the week with its biggest weekly decline since February 2009.  Suncor slipped 2.4 percent to C$32.34.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-largest energy company by
market value, retreated for a ninth-straight day, the longest
streak since 1998, losing 2.6 percent to C$35.25.  Athabasca Oil
Sands Corp. (ATH) , PetroChina Co.’s partner in oil-sands development,
slumped 6.5 percent to C$12.98 to extend its two-day loss to 17
percent.  Lenders, Insurers  The S&P/TSX Financials Index fell to the lowest level in 11
months. TD dropped 2.2 percent to C$73.85. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, the country’s fifth-largest lender by assets,
declined 1.7 percent to C$70. Insurer  Fairfax Financial Holdings
Ltd. (FFH)  lost 2.1 percent to C$383.85.  Raw-materials producers retreated as copper finished its
biggest weekly decrease since June 2010 and silver and gold
slipped.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, fell 3 percent to C$41.62. Barrick Gold Corp., the
world’s largest producer of the metal, dropped 1.1 percent to
C$44.89. Silver Wheaton Corp., the country’s fourth-biggest
precious-metals company, declined 2.4 percent to C$33.60.  Magna plunged 12 percent, the most since March 2009, to
C$38.80 after sinking as much as 25 percent earlier. Second-
quarter earnings trailed the average analyst estimate by 19
percent, excluding certain items. The company cited an increase
in raw-materials prices for a 4 percent decrease in profit.  Linamar Corp. (LNR) , Canada’s second-largest auto-parts maker,
slumped 9.1 percent to a 17-month low of C$17.05.  Directory publisher  Yellow Media Inc. (YLO)  tumbled 12 percent to
97 Canadian cents after at least three analysts cut their
ratings on the stock. The shares plunged 43 percent yesterday
after the company cut its dividend 77 percent.  Estimates Cut  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) , Canada’s
largest drugmaker, fell 5.5 percent to C$38 after at least six
analysts cut their price estimates on the shares. Valeant sank
20 percent yesterday after reporting second-quarter net income
that missed the average analyst estimate.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which develops natural-gas
engine technology, jumped 7.4 percent to C$22.81 after raising
its sales forecast for the year. The shares have gained 24
percent this year, the most among S&P/TSX industrial companies.  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , Canada’s largest construction and
engineering company, decreased 5.3 percent, the most since May
2009, to C$49.32. The company’s second-quarter earnings missed
the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Pharmacy-benefits manager  SXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXC) 
retreated for a second day after reporting earnings that trailed
its average analyst estimate, excluding certain items, slumping
8.3 percent to C$49.03. The stock’s 19 percent weekly decline
was the most since October 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
