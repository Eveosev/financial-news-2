Petroneft Resources Plc (PTR) , an oil and
gas explorer focused on Russia, said it found oil at the
Sibkrayevskaya well at License 61 in the Tomsk region.  The well encountered a 12.6-meter (41-foot) layer of oil,
exceeding pre-drill estimates, the Dublin-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The oilfield is the sixth found at License 61, according to
the statement. A Russian law reducing extraction taxes for small
oilfields from Jan. 1 will boost profit margins at qualifying
fields, Petroneft said, without identifying any deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
