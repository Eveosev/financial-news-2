Bonds of  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) 
fell to the least since at least January 2010 as investors lose
confidence in the creditworthiness of the most indebted
companies.  The homebuilder’s $797 million of 10.625 percent senior
secured bonds due in October 2016 dropped 1.25 cents to 89.5
cents on the dollar at 9:56 a.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. Its $155 million of 11.875 percent notes
due in October 2015 declined 1.5 cents to 59 cents, Trace data
show.  The  Red Bank , New Jersey-based company is graded Caa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service and CCC by Standard & Poor’s. High-
yield, or speculative-grade debt, is ranked below Baa3 by
Moody’s and less than BBB- by S&P.  The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates and includes
Hovnanian among 100 companies, dropped 1 percentage point to
98.2 percent of face value as of 10:10 a.m. in  New York . That’s
the lowest level since Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
