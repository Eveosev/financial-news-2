Cocoa fell to a six-week low on signs
that output is rising in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
grower. Sugar advanced, and coffee retreated.  From Oct. 1 to July 31, cocoa-bean deliveries to Ivorian
ports on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa rose 24 percent to
1.368 million metric tons from a year earlier, according to a
document from the Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao.  Rising supplies “could be putting a lot of pressure on the
prices,”  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in
Tampa, Florida, said by telephone.  Cocoa for December delivery slid $11, or 0.4 percent, to
settle at $2,941 a ton at 12:14 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the commodity touched $2,912, the lowest since
June 20.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery gained 0.1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to 27.79 cents a pound on ICE. Earlier, the
sweetener touched 26.99 cents, the lowest since July 1.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery slid 5.75
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.3975 a pound in  New York .  On NYSE Liffe in  London , cocoa, sugar and coffee dropped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
