Copper may fall “well below” $9,000
a metric ton on concern about a slowing global economy and
rising supply of the metal,  Societe Generale  SA said.  “It doesn’t seem impossible for copper to reach $8,000 if
macroeconomic data remain weak,” London-based analyst Jesper Dannesboe said today in an e-mailed report.  Service industries 
in the U.S., the largest part of the nation’s economy, expanded
in July at the slowest pace in 17 months and European services
and manufacturing growth eased last month to the slowest pace in
almost two years, reports showed yesterday.  Production of copper from mines will increase 5 percent
this year and 7 percent in 2012, the bank estimates. The metal
for three-month delivery fell $185, or 1.9 percent, to $9,350 a
ton by 5:25 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange.  “We feel increasingly confident that copper is mispriced
and exposed to a major selloff,” Dannesboe said. “The market
is in the process of discounting a higher probability of a
significant slowdown in the world economy” and has “yet to
take into account this, by copper standards, major supply
increase,” he said.  World demand for the metal is set to exceed output by
377,000 tons this year, according to the International Copper
Study Group. Analysts at  Barclays Capital  predict a 670,000-ton
shortfall.  Societe Generale disagrees with the view that copper will
remain scarce even in the face of a weaker world economy,
Dannesboe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
