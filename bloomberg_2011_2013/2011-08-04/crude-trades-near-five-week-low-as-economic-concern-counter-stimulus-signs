Oil fell to a five-week low in  New
York , erasing all of its gains for 2011, on growing evidence the
U.S. economic recovery is stalling, sapping demand in the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures dropped as a U.S. government report showed limited
improvement in the labor market. Crude stockpiles advanced for a
second week, according to Energy Department data yesterday. Oil
rose earlier today after the Wall Street Journal reported that
three former senior officials at the  Federal Reserve  said the
central bank should consider a new round of stimulus.  “We’re clearly in a soft patch,” said Thina Saltvedt, an
analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo, who forecasts Brent will be
capped at $118 a barrel this quarter. “Gasoline demand is
slowing, with high unemployment consumers are still a bit
skeptical. If we see stronger growth signals, prices will move
up but we haven’t seen that yet.”  Crude for September delivery declined as much as $1.18 a
barrel, or 1.3 percent, to $90.75 a barrel in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . That’s the lowest since
June 28. It was at $91.26 at 1:51 p.m. London time. The contract
is down 0.1 percent this year, having gained as much as 26
percent on May 2.  Brent for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was 1.3 percent lower at $111.80 a
barrel. For the year to date, Brent is up 18 percent. The
European benchmark contract was at a $20.51 premium to U.S.
futures, after reaching a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories rose 950,000 barrels in the week
ended July 29 to 354.9 million barrels, the Energy Department
report showed.  “Market participants seem to be concerned about growth
prospects in the U.S.,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and
energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne,
who predicts crude will average $98 a barrel in the third
quarter. Reports of stimulus “may give a short-term reprieve to
prices and forecast demand but if these weak numbers keep coming
out it’s going to swamp any positive sentiment around further
quantitative easing,” he said.  Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.7 million barrels to 215.2
million, the highest since April 1. Supplies were forecast to
increase 250,000 barrels, based on the median estimate from
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Distillate fuel
inventories, a category that includes heating oil and diesel,
increased 409,000 barrels to 152.3 million.  Bollinger Rebound  Crude in New York may rebound after prices reached
technical support along the lower Bollinger Band yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This indicator is at
$90.62 a barrel today and the next level, the middle Bollinger
Band, is at $95.84. Prices tend to change direction when they
fail to breach chart support or resistance.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 1,000 in the
week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest in almost four months,
the Labor Department said in  Washington . Economists forecast
claims to reach 405,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The four-week average also declined to
the lowest level since April.  Tropical Storm Emily will pick up speed, moving northwest
as it continues on a path that could take it to  Florida  by this
weekend, according to an advisory from the U.S. National
Hurricane Center.  Emily, with top winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour,
was 100 miles south-southeast of Port-au-Prince,  Haiti , and
moving west-northwest at 7 mph, according to an advisory posted
by the center  before 5 a.m. in Miami. The center of the storm  To contact the reporter on this story:
