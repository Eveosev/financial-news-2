Fiat SpA (F) , the Italian automaker
returning to the U.S. market after a 28-year absence, is getting
a revenue boost from American buyers choosing pricier  packages
and customized options for the 500 subcompact.  The Sport version, which costs $2,000 more than the $15,500
base 500 Pop, accounted for about half the model’s sales in the
first five months of Fiat’s return to the U.S., Laura Soave, the
brand’s chief in the region, said in an interview. The $19,500
Lounge line represented 20 percent.  In addition to the pricier trim levels, which include the
Sport’s bigger wheels, leather seats and satellite radio and
a glass roof on the Lounge line, Americans are personalizing
their Fiats.  “A lot of what we’re seeing is customers really want to
build their car,” Soave said yesterday near Atlanta, where the
Turin-based automaker opened its 94th U.S. dealership.
“Customers are willing to wait the six to eight weeks to get
the one they want.”  Fiat’s reentry into the U.S. market was facilitated by its
control of  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based Chrysler Group LLC.
 Sergio Marchionne , who heads both Fiat and Chrysler, aims to
merge the carmakers to reduce costs and generate more than 100
billion euros ($142 billion) in revenue by 2014. Chrysler’s
factory near Mexico City assembles the 500 for the U.S.  Fiat delivered 7,982 cars in the U.S. since March. The 500
is the first and only Fiat sold in the country since 1983, when
 Italy ’s biggest manufacturer pulled out.  High Inventory  The retro-styled compact, known as the Cinquecento in
Italy, will sell more than 50,000 vehicles annually in the U.S.
after Fiat opens all 130 of its initial dealerships, Soave said.
The automaker aims to reach that mark by the end of 2011.  The new stores and demand for customization has boosted
inventory to about 90 days supply at the end of July, more than
its target of 60 days, Soave said. Six dealerships opened in the
last two days of the month without reporting sales skewing the
figure higher, she said.  Fiat offers 14 exterior colors and detailing such as racing
stripes. All told, there are more than 500,000 variations of
colors and options, according to the carmaker.  The Italian manufacturer may eventually open regional
stockpiling yards throughout the U.S. to manage inventory, Soave
said. Fiat is also learning which options sell best in
particular markets as sales ramp up.  “Every month that we get more and more data, you can start
to really predict a little bit better which product needs to go
where,” she said. “There’s a balance there that we’re trying
to achieve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
