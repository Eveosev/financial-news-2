Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,
 Canada ’s second-largest energy company by market value, said
second-quarter profit rose 43 percent as higher  oil prices 
countered a decline in production.  Net income climbed to C$929 million ($953 million), or 84
cents a share, from C$651 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said today in a statement. Daily
production of oil equivalent fell to 556,539 barrels from
649,195 barrels.  Energy companies have seen profits buoyed by gains in the
price of oil. Crude futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  averaged $102.34 a barrel in the second quarter,
compared with an average of $78.05 a year earlier.  A Jan. 6 fire at the Horizon oil-sands upgrader in  Alberta ,
which turns bitumen into synthetic crude, halted production that
accounts for about 14 percent of the company’s output. Canadian
Natural is targeting average annual production of 371,000 to
406,000 barrels a day of oil and natural-gas liquids, lower than
May guidance of as much as 421,000 barrels a day.  All regulatory approvals to resume operations at Horizon
have been received, repairs are “essentially complete” and a
two-to-three week commissioning process began Aug. 2, the
company said today. Repair costs are estimated at about C$400
million to C$450 million, it said.  Canadian Natural forecast 2012  capital spending  at C$7
billion to C$8 billion, including about C$2 billion targeted for
expansion at Horizon.  Canadian Natural fell C$1.51, or 4.1 percent, to C$35.37 at
10:51 a.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares, which
have 20 buy and two hold ratings from analysts, are down 20
percent this year.  Suncor Energy Inc. is the largest Canadian energy company
by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
