Companies like  DirecTV (DTV)  and  McDonald’s
Corp. (MCD)  that frequently buy back their own shares are recommended
holdings for a “balanced global portfolio,” Citigroup Inc.’s
 Robert Buckland  said in a note dated yesterday.  Buybacks provide an opportunity to benefit when there is
limited equity demand, and low  interest rates  and cheap
valuations combine to make buybacks even more profitable,
Buckland wrote. The note listed 40 stocks that Citigroup
analysts rated “hold” or “buy” and have positive earnings
momentum, including  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  and
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)   “It makes sense to incorporate contracting-supply equities
into a balanced global portfolio,” Buckland wrote. “IBM’s
share count has almost halved since the late 1990s. Even gold
doesn’t see supply dynamics as attractive as that.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies authorized 38 percent
more buybacks in the first quarter of 2011 than a year earlier,
data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. Corporations are facing
“ripe” conditions for buying back shares, pursuing mergers and
acquisitions and increasing debt after hoarding cash since 2009,
Barclays Capital’s Jeffrey Meli said on July 22. Companies
amassed a record $1.9 trillion in cash after the 2008 credit
crisis.
