Chile ’s peso fell the most in three
weeks as copper slid for the fourth day in a row and concern
over Europe’s debt cut demand for riskier emerging-market
assets.  The peso fell 0.9 percent to 462.73 pesos per  U.S. dollar 
at 1:55 p.m. New York time, from 458.51 yesterday, its biggest
drop since July 11.  “The Chilean peso has an extremely high correlation with
copper prices, and copper has fallen dramatically,” Flavio Magnasco, an economist at Banco Falabella, said in a telephone
interview from Santiago.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
2.1 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , its fourth day
of losses. The metal has declined 25 cents per pound, or 5.4
percent, to $4.24 per pound since July 29, weakening Chile’s
terms of trade.  “There is also a lot of uncertainty surrounding the stock
markets in the U.S. and  Europe , and people tend to purchase
dollars during times of volatility because they consider it less
risky,” Magnasco said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 3 percent to 1,222.54.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, declined four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 5.36 percent. The rate has dropped for
the last six sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
