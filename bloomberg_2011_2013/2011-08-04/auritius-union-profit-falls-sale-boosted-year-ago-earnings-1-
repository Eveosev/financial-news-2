Mauritius Union Assurance Co. (MUA) , the
country’s biggest insurer by market value, said profit declined
89 percent in the second quarter through June, with last year’s
earnings boosted by the sale of shares.  Net income retreated to 36.3 million rupees ($1.3 million)
from 332.4 million rupees a year earlier, according to a
 statement  published on the Port Louis-based Stock Exchange of
Mauritius’s website today. Gross premiums increased to 398.4
million rupees from 354.9 million rupees.  For the half year through June, premiums increased by 35
percent to 806 million rupees, following the acquisition of La
Prudence Mauricienne, an insurer. Net income declined 81 percent
to 90 million rupees, as last year’s earnings were driven by a
419 million-rupee profit on the disposal of shares. The company
earned 7.4 million rupees through the sale of stock in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
