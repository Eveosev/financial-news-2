U.S. retailers including Limited
Brands Inc. and  Macy’s Inc. (M)  reported July sales that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as consumers kept spending on clothing in
the face of higher food and gas prices.  Limited, operator of the Victoria’s Secret chain, posted a
gain of 6 percent in same-store sales, surpassing the 4.4
percent average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Retail
Metrics Inc. Sales at Macy’s rose 5 percent, topping analysts’
estimates for a 4.4 percent gain.  Higher costs for cotton, fuel and labor in  Asia  have
prompted apparel chains to pass costs on to the consumer, with
some announcing price increases for this year. The cost of a
gallon of regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.65 in July, up
from $2.72 a year earlier, according to AAA, the nation’s
biggest auto group.  “It was a mixed month with slightly more wins than
losses,” Jennifer Davis, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
in  New York , said in an interview. “Limited is well-positioned
because Victoria’s Secret was strong and many of the items they
sold were full-priced.”  Same-store sales at the 25 retailers tracked by Swampscott,
Massachusetts-based Retail Metrics rose 5 percent, topping
analysts’ estimates for a 4.7 percent gain.  Limited, based in Columbus,  Ohio , fell 46 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $35.84 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, dropped $1.70,
or 6.1 percent, to $26.13. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing
Index tumbled 23.04 points, or 4.5 percent, to 492.68.  Saks Beats  Saks Inc. (SKS)  exceeded analysts’ projections by the widest
margin, posting a 15.6 percent increase that beat the average
estimate for an 8 percent gain.  Gap Inc. (GPS) ’s sales in July dropped 5 percent, compared with
analysts’ estimates for a 0.6 percent decline. The shares slid
$2.23, or 12 percent, to $16.98.  Buckle Inc. (BKE) ’s July same-store sales climbed 6.8 percent,
less than analysts’ average projection for a 10 percent
increase. The shares fell $3.99, or 9.1 percent, to $39.70.  Most chains count locations open at least a year to
tabulate same-store sales. This revenue is a key indicator of a
retailer’s growth because new and closed sites are excluded.  U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly dropped in June for the
first time in almost two years as households saved money,
bracing for higher prices on necessities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
