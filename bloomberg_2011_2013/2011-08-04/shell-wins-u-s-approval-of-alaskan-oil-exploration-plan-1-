Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  won conditional
U.S. approval for its exploration plan in Alaska’s Beaufort Sea,
a step toward tapping oil leases bought in 2005 and 2007 in
which it has invested more than $3.5 billion.  The Hague-based company may begin exploring in July 2012 if
it gets permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine
Fisheries Service, the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ,
Regulation and Enforcement said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We base our decisions regarding energy exploration and
development in the Arctic on the best scientific information
available,” Director  Michael Bromwich  said in an e-mail. “We
will closely review and monitor Shell’s proposed activities”
under the plan to ensure that operations are “conducted in a
safe and environmentally responsible manner.”  Shell’s pursuit of oil in  Alaska ’s icy waters has been
portrayed by industry and environmentalists as a first test for
U.S. offshore drilling regulators beyond the  Gulf of Mexico ,
where exploration has resumed under restrictions set after BP
Plc’s spill last year.  The company said it’s ready to respond to any spill in the
remote Arctic region, home to rare animal species such as polar
bears and beluga whales.  The approval “is welcome news,” Shell spokeswoman Kelly
op de Weegh said in an e-mail. “We look forward to continued
progress as we pursue the permits necessary to drill.”  -- Editors: Judy Pasternak, Steve Geimann  To contact the reporter on this story:
