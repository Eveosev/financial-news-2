Middle East crude oil for sale to
 Asia  climbed against its benchmark as  Saudi Arabia  raised the
price of its light oil, increasing demand for alternative
grades.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in October rose 9 cents to a premium of 1 cent a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News. Qatar Land increased 9 cents to a discount of 18 cents a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s biggest crude exporter,
raised the price of its Extra Light grade for September by 10
cents to a premium of $3.05 a barrel to the average of
benchmarks Oman and Dubai. The company cut its Light, Medium and
Heavy types.  Abu Dhabi National Oil, known as Adnoc, lowered the price
of its Murban grade for June to a premium of $3.96 a barrel to
Dubai from $4.38 for May. The type is at a premium of $3.75 to
the average of Oman and Dubai compared with $4.32 a month
earlier.  The decline in the Murban official price boosted demand
from refiners for the grade amid a gain in refining profits from
producing gasoil, said three traders who participate in the
market. The fuel’s premium was at $19.26 a barrel today, up from
$18.02 a week ago, data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-
based broker, show. The spread has widened after Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. shut its 540,000 barrel-a-day Mailiao,
 Taiwan , plant following a fire on July 30.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped for a third day,
by $1.78, or 1.6 percent, to $108.10 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. Dubai oil for delivery in October fell 1.6 percent to
$107.68. Murban decreased 1.4 percent to $112.07.  Oman futures for October delivery declined 53 cents to
$106.97 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:58 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,077 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $107.50 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai EFS dropped 10 cents to $5.57 a
barrel, according to PVM data. The exchange for swaps for
October fell 8 cents to $5.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
