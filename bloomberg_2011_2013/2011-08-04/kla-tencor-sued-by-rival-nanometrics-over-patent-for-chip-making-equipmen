KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) , a maker of computer
chip fabrication equipment, was sued in federal court in
Delaware by rival Nanometrics Inc., which accused it of
infringing two U.S. patents for alignment gear and seeks damages
after a  jury trial .  Milpitas, California-based Nanometrics, with $188 million
in sales last year, contends KLA-Tencor knew of the patents,
awarded in 2006 and 2007, and used the protected technology
anyway.  “Nanometrics has suffered damages” to be determined at a
trial, and KLA-Tencor, also of Milpitas, is “without a
reasonable basis for believing” it doesn’t infringe, according
to the complaint.  KLA-Tencor, which reported $3.17 billion in sales last
fiscal year, fell $1.52, or 3.89 percent, to $37.56 in Nasdaq
stock market trading in New York at 11:14 a.m.  Meggan Powers, a KLA-Tencor spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment on the allegations.  The case is  Nanometrics Inc. (NANO) , v. KLA-Tencor Corp., 1:11-cv-
00685, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
