Sughosh Moharikar, former head of
mergers and acquisitions at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  in India,
will join  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in the same role, said three people
with knowledge of the matter.  Moharikar, a managing director who resigned from his post
at Credit Suisse in Mumbai on July 20, will replace Amrit Singh,
who is moving back to  London  by the end of 2011 after more than
three years in India, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because no announcement has been made.  The value of mergers involving Indian companies has
declined 36 percent to $28.7 billion this year from the same
period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Deutsche Bank ranks 23rd among M&A advisers in  India  this year,
while Credit Suisse is in 17th place, the data show.  Singh, 40, will take on a broader role in mergers advisory
when he moves to London, which would involve unspecified
emerging markets, one of the people said.  Moharikar wasnâ€™t available to comment on his new role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
