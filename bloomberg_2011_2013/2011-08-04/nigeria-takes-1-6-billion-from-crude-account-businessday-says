Nigeria â€™s government has withdrawn
250 billion naira ($1.6 billion) from its excess crude account
savings this year,  BusinessDay  reported, without saying how it
got the information.  While recurrent expenditure is meeting budget targets,
investment was only 34 percent of the full-year target in the
first half of 2011, the Lagos-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
