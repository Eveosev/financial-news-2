LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ’s
tender offer for  Bulgari SpA (BUL)  has been approved by Italian market
regulator Consob, the company said in a statement today.  The acceptance period of the offer will start on Aug. 22
and end on Sept. 23 and LVMH will pay 12.25 euros for each
share, the statement said.  A group of Bulgari shareholders asked Consob to review the
sale of the luxury-goods company to LVMH, Il Sole 24 Ore
reported on July 21. The investors wanted LVMH to increase its
offer after it paid a higher price for some shares owned by the
Bulgari family, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
