The signs of panic were everywhere today. Stock markets plunged in the
U.S. and  Europe . The flight to safety saw cash pouring into
U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen in the 1950s,
out of concern that the two-year recovery in the world’s largest economy
is stalling. Italian and Spanish bond yields, on the other
hand, soared to record levels as Europe's two-week-old deal to contain
the rot of the Greek debt crisis seemed to be coming apart. One of the best measures of fear in the market is the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, or the VIX, a benchmark for  stock options . The VIX
soared to the highest in at least a year, closing at 31.66, a 35 percent gain.
The last time the index reached this level was in early July 2010, when the
first phase of Greek debt crisis was still rattling financial markets. For most of the spring and summer, the VIX gave little hint that a fresh
round of turmoil was in the offing. Even as Europe struggled to devise a second
round of assistance for Greece and U.S. lawmakers failed to reach an agreement
on raising the debt ceiling, the VIX bounced around between 15 and 20. It was
only in the last week of July that the VIX began to reflect the anxiety that
culminated in today's market rout. The VIX is still a long way from the high reached at the peak of the
2008 credit crunch. In October 2008, it touched a high of 89.53.
