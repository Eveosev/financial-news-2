Tuilagi will make his England rugby debut against  Wales  in two
days.  Tuilagi, 20, will start at outside center at Twickenham
Stadium in London in the first of England’s three warm-up
matches for the World Cup, which starts next month in New
Zealand.  “I’m really proud to be winning my first cap,” Tuilagi
said on the Rugby Football Union’s  website . “There is a lot of
competition for places and I just want to take this chance and
do the best I can for the team.”  Captain Lewis Moody returns after missing the Six Nations
with a knee injury. Saracens prop Matt Stevens will start for
the first time since 2008, following his two-year suspension for
testing positive for cocaine, while  London Irish ’s Delon
Armitage and Leicester’s  Tom Croft  get their first England
starts since 2010.  Saracens lock Mouritz Botha and Gloucester wing Charlie
Sharples, both seeking their first caps, were called up to the
squad as substitutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
