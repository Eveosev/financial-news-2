Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., supplier of
about 95 percent of  South Africa ’s electricity, and its workers
failed to resolve their differences in pay negotiations and the
dispute may go to arbitration, the Solidarity labor union said.  Solidarity, the  National Union of Mineworkers  and National
Union of Metalworkers reduced their demands for wage increases
to as high as 13 percent from 20 percent, Tommie Wedderspoon,
chief negotiator for Solidarity, said in an interview today.  Eskom hasn’t revised its offer of 7 percent and it “looks
like the parties will be heading to” arbitration, he said.  The two sides haven’t set a date for the resumption of
talks, Hilary Joffe, an Eskom spokeswoman, said by mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
