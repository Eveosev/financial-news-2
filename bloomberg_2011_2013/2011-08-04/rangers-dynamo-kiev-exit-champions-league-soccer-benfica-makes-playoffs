Scottish champion Rangers and former
semifinalist Dynamo Kiev were eliminated from soccer’s  Champions
League  in the third qualifying round.  Rangers lost 2-1 to Malmo over two matches following last
night’s 1-1 draw in  Sweden . Jiloan Hamad tied it with 10 minutes
remaining after Nikica Jelavic put Rangers ahead in the 24th
minute. The visiting team finished the game with nine men after
Steven Whittaker and Madjid Bougherra were red-carded.  Rangers drops into the second-tier Europa League after
failing to claim a spot in the group stages of  Europe ’s elite
club competition for the first time since the 2008-09 season.  Dynamo, which reached the Champions League semifinals in
1999, lost 2-1 to Russia’s  Rubin Kazan  to go out 4-1 over two
games. Norway’s Rosenberg was eliminated by tournament newcomer
Viktoria Plzen, which won its first Czech league title this year.  Benfica, the first former European Cup winner to feature in
this season’s competition, beat Trabzonspor 3-1 on aggregate to
advance to the playoffs for a berth in the 32-team group stage.  The draw for the 10 playoff matchups will take place
tomorrow in Nyon,  Switzerland . The 15 winners from the third
qualifying round will be joined by four-time European champion
Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Lyon, Villarreal and Udinese.  Playoff first-leg matches are scheduled for Aug. 16-17,
with the return games the following week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
