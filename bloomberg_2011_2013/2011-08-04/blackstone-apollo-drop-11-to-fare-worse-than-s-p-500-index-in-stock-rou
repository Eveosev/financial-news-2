(Corrects to show in 10th paragraph that Apollo had its
largest one-day loss today, not earlier this year.)  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Apollo Global
Management LLC fell 11 percent in New York trading to fare worse
than the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index amid speculation that
private-equity performance may falter in a deteriorating market.  Blackstone lost $1.66 to $13.72 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 4:15 p.m., after yesterday’s 3.9 percent
decline, and Apollo slid $1.80 to $14.93. KKR & Co. declined as
much as 11 percent before closing down 80 cents, or 6 percent,
to $12.59, extending yesterday’s 5.3 percent drop after weaker-
than-expected quarterly earnings.  Investors may be concerned that a slumping economy and
erratic markets will prevent buyout firms from selling companies
they own or taking them public, impairing their ability to
distribute profits. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8 percent today as a
global rout in equities drove the U.S. benchmark to its worst
nine-day slump since 2009.  “You’re not immune in private equity if valuations come
down and the IPO market is soft,” said Paul Schaye, managing
partner of New York-based Chestnut Hill Partners, which helps
private-equity firms identify buyout targets. “They need to
have great exits.”  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , which reported earnings and
said it would reinstate a dividend earlier today, declined 36
cents, or 8.8 percent, to $3.72.  Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. (BAM/A)  fell $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.65.  When Blackstone, Apollo and, for a time, KKR dropped more
than 10 percent, they each triggered a Securities and Exchange
Commission circuit breaker that temporarily stops short selling.
Short-sellers bet on a decline by borrowing shares and then
selling them, hoping to buy them back later for less.  Milestone Losses  For four of the firms, this was the worst performance in at
least a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Blackstone’s close represented the stock’s biggest one-day
decline since April 20, 2009, and lowest finishing price since
Dec. 20. KKR delivered its largest one-day decline since July
15, 2010, and lowest closing price since Nov. 30.  Fortress had its steepest one-day decline since May 6,
2010, and lowest closing price since Oct. 4, and Brookfield fell
to its largest single-day drop since June 4, 2010, and lowest
close since Oct. 4.  Apollo, which began trading on March 30, had its biggest
one-day decline today.  Dow Drops 512  The  S&P 500  tumbled 60.27 points to 1,200.07 in New York, a
12 percent drop from its April 29 peak and weakest level since
Nov. 30. The more than 10 percent decline since April 29 means
the index has entered what is known as a correction. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  tumbled 512.76 points, or 4.3 percent,
to 11,383.68. The MSCI World Index of developed markets slid 4.3
percent.  Two-year U.S. Treasury yields plunged to a record low amid
concern the economy is weakening.  Speculation that the global economy may relapse into a
recession has driven investors out of stocks and into the
relative safety of Treasuries, the Swiss franc and Japanese yen,
and is spurring speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will start
another stimulus program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
