The first batch of Ukrainian grain
from the new harvest was shipped to  Saudi Arabia  from Odessa
port, according to the Eastern European government’s website.  A panamax ship, the biggest ship to navigate the Panama
Canal’s locks, took 52,000 metric tons of barley, according to
the statement published today.  About 200,000 tons of grain is expected to be exported this
month from Ukrelevatorprom, a grain storage elevator in Odessa
port, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
