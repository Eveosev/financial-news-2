The premium for Syncrude weakened
after  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said it expects the
Horizon upgrader in  Alberta  to resume production in two to three
weeks.  All regulatory approvals to resume operations at Horizon
have been received, repairs are “essentially complete” and a
commissioning process began Aug. 2, the company said today. A
Jan. 6 fire at the oil-sands plant, which turns bitumen into
synthetic crude, halted output.  Steve Laut , Canadian Natural’s president, said during a
conference call today that he expects the Syncrude premium to
“shrink a bit” as the company’s upgrader returns to service.  The premium for Syncrude narrowed 25 cents to $17.50 a
barrel above West Texas Intermediate at 12:14 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$18 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed $1.05 to $22.90 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 80 cents a barrel to $23.85
over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed $1 to $19 while Poseidon’s lost $1.25 to $19.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium dropped $1.25 to $17 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to
$1 below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped 75 cents
a barrel to $23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
