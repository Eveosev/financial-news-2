U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  and
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne are planning to cut
the 50 percent top rate of income tax to 45 percent as early as
March, the  Daily Mail  reported, without citing a source for the
information.  Cameron and Osborne are seeking to make the change because
of Treasury statistics which show the current rate generates
“marginal financial gains” for government, the newspaper
reported. Allies of Osborne view a cut in the rate as necessary
to help boost growth in the economy, the Mail said.  To contact the writer on the story:
