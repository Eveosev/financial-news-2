(Corrects franc price in fourth paragraph in story that
moved yesterday.)  The  Swiss National Bank  may sell the
franc “as early as today” if Switzerland’s currency should
reach yesterday’s record against the euro, said  Chris Walker , a
currency strategist at UBS AG in London.  Switzerland’s currency reversed an earlier depreciation
against the euro after the European Central Bank left rates
unchanged and announced it has resumed bond purchases. The Swiss
National Bank yesterday cut interest rates and increased the
supply of currency to money markets in order to quell flows into
the franc as it acts as a haven.  “There is a significant risk of intervention if the franc
reaches its record,” said Walker. “This time I think it will
be with more firepower than last year.”  The franc appreciated 1.5 percent to 1.08675 per euro at
15:56 p.m. in  London . It reached a record 1.07957 per euro
before the Swiss central bank’s announcement yesterday. The
Swiss currency depreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
trade at 76.82 centimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
