Wheat futures dropped the most in
five weeks on signs that importers favor cheaper Russian grain,
reducing demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s top
exporter.  Egypt , the largest importer, bought 180,000 metric tons
from  Russia  in a tender today at $261.94 and $262.50 a ton. As
of July 22, U.S. soft wheat for export traded at $275.30 a ton.
On July 1, Russia lifted a ban on grain shipments imposed after
a drought damaged last year’s crop.  “Russia is playing the game of dumping their wheat in the
export market, and U.S. exports are going to struggle,” Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market Concepts in Wamego,
 Kansas , said in a telephone interview. “At these prices, I’m
not optimistic.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 24.5 cents, or 3.3
percent, to close at $7.255 a bushel at 1:40 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest drop since June 30. The most-active
contract has declined 8.7 percent this year.  Russia may export 20 million to 25 million tons of grain
this season, Interfax reported yesterday. The country had been
the world’s second-largest exporter until the most-severe
drought in 50 years cut production in 2010.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
