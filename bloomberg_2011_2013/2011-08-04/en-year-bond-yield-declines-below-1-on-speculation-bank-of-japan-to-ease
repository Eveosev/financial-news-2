Japan ’s government bonds declined,
reversing earlier gains, after  risk aversion  pushed demand at an
auction of 40-year debt to the lowest level on record.  Bonds fell after today’s 400 billion yen ($5.1 billion)
sale drew bids valued at 2.03 times the amount on offer, the
weakest level since the Ministry of Finance began selling the
securities in November 2007. Ten-year yields climbed above 1
percent after the auction results were announced, as bonds
erased earlier gains driven by a worldwide slump in equities.  “Because of the collapse of the global stock markets,
investors are escaping to the high liquidity markets such as
cash,” said  Satoshi Yamada , chief quantitative analyst in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The 40-year bond auction was bad as
investors refrained from aggressive bids.”  The yield on the 2.2 percent bond maturing in March 2051
jumped 14.5 basis points to 2.325 percent as of 3:17 p.m. in
 Tokyo  at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The price slid 3.003 yen to 97.422 yen.
Ten-year yields increased three basis points to 1.045 percent.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery fell 0.24 to
142.13 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
