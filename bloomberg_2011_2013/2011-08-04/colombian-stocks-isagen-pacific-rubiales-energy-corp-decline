The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:03 a.m.  New York  time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.7 percent to 13,637.24 while the
Colcap Index dropped 1.5 percent to 1,626.16.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 4.3 percent
to 47,500 pesos, a two-week low. Canadian stocks fell, led by
oil and base-metals producers, as the  U.S. dollar  surged after
the Bank of Japan sought to stem the advance in its currency.  Oil fell in New York, erasing its 2011 gains, amid growing
evidence the U.S. economic recovery is stalling.  Isagen SA (ISAGEN CB), a Colombian energy company, fell 3
percent, the most intraday since March 11. to 2,265 pesos.
Delays in the companyâ€™s Amoya project could reduce margins in
the next year as the company takes on a higher debt burden,
according to an e-mailed report yesterday from Interbolsa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
