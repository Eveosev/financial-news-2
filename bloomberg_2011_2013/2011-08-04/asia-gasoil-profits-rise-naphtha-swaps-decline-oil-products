Gasoil processing profits rose for a
second day while  fuel-oil  losses narrowed as a refinery shutdown
in Taiwan tightened supplies. Naphtha swaps fell to the lowest
in more than three weeks.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, climbed 45 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $19.55
a barrel at 11:21 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The spread was at $19.93
a barrel on Aug. 1, the highest since June 16.  September swaps for gasoil fell $1.85, or 1.4 percent, to
$127.20 a barrel. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade,
was unchanged at $1.55 a barrel.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. estimated that the July 30 fire
at its Mailiao complex caused NT$187 million ($6.5 million) in
asset damages, the company said in a statement to the  Taiwan 
stock exchange yesterday. The Mailiao refinery’s stoppage will
cause an estimated NT$83 million of loss a day, according to
statement.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 60 cents, or
9.2 percent, to $6 a barrel, PVM data showed. Losses have shrunk
58 percent since the end of April as refinery maintenance
reduced supplies.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps fell $11, or 1.6 percent, to
$660.75 a metric ton, PVM data showed. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to the 380-centistoke grade was at $9.25 a
ton, down 25 cents, as prices of higher-quality utility fuel
fell more than bunkers.  Light Distillates  September swaps for naphtha declined $19.50, or 2 percent,
to $963.50 a ton, the lowest since July 12, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, was at
$111.93 a ton from $111.06 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
