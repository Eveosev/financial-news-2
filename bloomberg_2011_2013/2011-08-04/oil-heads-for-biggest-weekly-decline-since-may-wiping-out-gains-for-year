Oil fell to the lowest in eight
months in  New York , set for the biggest weekly decline since
May, on speculation fuel demand will falter as U.S. economic
growth falters and  Europe ’s debt crisis worsens.  Futures dropped as much as 4.3 percent after slumping 5.8
percent yesterday. The U.S. added 85,000 jobs last month,
leaving the 9.2 percent unemployment rate unchanged, according
to economists surveyed before data today that will cap a week of
economic reports that showed the recovery is slowing. European
Brent crude rebounded after an oil pipeline explosion in Iran,
highlighting supply concerns from the  Middle East .  “People are afraid about recession and debt,”  Roland Stenzel , an oil trader at E&T Energie Handelsgesellschaft mbH,
said by phone from Vienna. “Everyone’s now expecting oil demand
will fall.”  Crude for September delivery dropped as much as $3.76 to
$82.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest intraday price since Nov. 26. The contract
traded at $85.60 a barrel as of 11:05 a.m.  London  time. A close
at that level would mean a fall of 11 percent this week, the
biggest weekly drop since the first week in May.  Brent for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose as much as 2 percent to $109.38 a
barrel and last traded at $107.86 a barrel. It fell as much as
2.75 percent earlier this morning. The European benchmark is up
14 percent this year. Its premium to U.S. futures widened to
$22.08 a barrel. The spread closed at a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  Pipeline Explosion  Iran ’s biggest oil pipeline exploded today in Larstan in
the west of the country, the state-run Mehr news service said.
The nation is the second-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  “The fundamentals didn’t deteriorate in one day to such an
extent to warrant this sell off,” Amrita Sen, an oil analyst at
Barclays Plc, said by phone from London. “It’s going to remain
choppy from here with the macro environment so uncertain.”  Crude in New York, which fell below a long-term Fibonacci
support yesterday, has crossed the bottom of a technical
downtrend channel at about $85.20 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength index for
West Texas Intermediate futures also dropped below 30, signaling
the market may have fallen too quickly. Today’s reading is 23.9,
the lowest since May 2010.  “I want to see if the $85 a barrel level holds for WTI and
$107 for  Brent crude , whether it will be solid or not,” said
 Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivatives sales manager at broker
Newedge Group in  Tokyo , who estimates that futures may decrease
to $83.90 in New York and $102.30 in London if prices break
below those marks.  Equities Plunge  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged as much as 3.3 percent,
extending its loss for the week to 11 percent. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index fell 4.1 percent, taking its weekly loss to 8.1
percent. That will be the steepest one-week drop since October
2008, when credit markets froze following the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brother Holdings Inc. a month earlier.  The Labor Department’s data are due at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was minus 47.6 in the
week to July 31, the lowest since May. Confidence among women
fell to the lowest level since October 2009, while Americans
making more than $100,000 a year were the most pessimistic since
November 2009.  Tropical Storm Emily was broken up by 10,000-foot (3,000-
meter) mountains in  Haiti  and the  Dominican Republic  and storm
warnings throughout the Caribbean were dropped. Emily’s maximum
winds have fallen to 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour, below
the threshold of 39 mph used to designate a system as a tropical
storm, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
