PG&E Corp. (PCG) , owner of California’s
largest electric utility, agreed to triple the amount of solar
power it will buy from a project  Sempra Energy (SRE)  is building in
Nevada.  PG&E will buy 150 megawatts from Sempra’s Copper Mountain
Solar 2 project located in Boulder City, Nevada, under a 25-year
power contract, the San Francisco-based company said in a
statement today.  Sempra is expanding its 48-megawatt  Copper Mountain Solar 1
project , the largest photovoltaic plant in the U.S., the San
Diego-based company said in a statement. Sempra expects to build
1,000 megawatts of renewable capacity by 2015, Chief Executive
Jeffrey W. Martin said in the statement.  The first 92 megawatts of Solar 2 are expected to be
installed by January 2013, with the remaining 58 scheduled by
2015, the companies said in the statement.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest maker of thin-film
panels, will also build the second phase of the project, the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said in a statement. The ground-
mounted panels will be installed in phases starting in early
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
