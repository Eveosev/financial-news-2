Retail prices for sugar in  Uganda ,
which more than doubled in five weeks, may start falling this
month as a factory resumes production and imports flow in,
according to the industry’s national technical body.  Kinyara Sugar Works Ltd., the second-biggest local
producer, is on schedule to resume operations in the third week
of August, Jim Kabeho, chairman of the  Uganda Sugar Cane
Technologists Association , said today by phone from neighboring
Rwanda. The plant extended a one-month break from the end of
July, he said.  A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the sweetener costs 7,000
Ugandan shillings ($2.66) on average at shops in the capital
city of Kampala, compared with 3,000 shillings at the end of
June. Demand from  Rwanda  and South Sudan contributed to a
scarcity of sugar in Uganda, forcing supermarkets to restrict
purchases to 2 kilograms a customer at most, according to
Kabeho.  “We are looking at three weeks, when Kinyara starts
production, for the situation to ease,” he said. “Imports are
also expected in, and the situation should change if speculation
by traders reduces.”  Uganda’s three main plants may boost this year’s sugar
output by 20 percent on enlarged capacities, according to the
association. Two others will produce 4,930 metric tons, it says.  Supply at top producer  Kakira Sugar Works Ltd.  will rise
9.2 percent to 165,000 tons, according to the association.
Output will climb 7.1 percent to 54,000 tons at Sugar Corp. of
Uganda Ltd., and Kinyara may produce 39 percent more at 126,000
tons, it says.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, consumed
346,000 tons of the sweetener last year and imported 130,000
tons, of which 67,000 tons were re-exported, according to the
association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
