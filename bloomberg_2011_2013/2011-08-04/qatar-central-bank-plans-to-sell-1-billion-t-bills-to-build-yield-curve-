Qatar plans to sell 4 billion riyals
($1.1 billion) of treasury bills next week as the central bank
seeks to set a benchmark for debt sales and soak up excess cash
from local lenders.  “The objective of this is to manage liquidity and also to
build our sovereign yield curve,” Central Bank Governor
Abdullah bin Saud Al-Thani said in a telephone interview today.  The three-month T-bills will be sold on Aug. 8 and will be
split equally between Islamic and non-Islamic securities, Al-
Thani said. Qatar has issued 10 billion riyals of T-bills of
different maturities on a monthly basis this year, the governor
said. The Aug. 8 issuance will be the fourth.  Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, has supported its banks through the global financial crisis
with cash injections and the purchase of real-estate portfolios.
The central bank lowered  interest rates  in April after credit
growth slowed and also sold 50 billion riyals of bonds to local
banks in January.  Banks’ loans-to-deposit ratio in Qatar fell to 90 percent
at the end of June from 96 percent in December as the lenders
added a combined 47 billion riyals in deposits, according to
data posted on the central bank website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
