Icelandic State Financial Investments
Chief Executive Officer Elin Jonsdottir has resigned from her
post ahead of the government’s plans to privatize its shares in
financial companies.  “Ahead there are large and important tasks,” Jonsdottir
said in a statement on the company’s  Web site . “Most notably,
plans need to be drawn up on the partial or full sale of the
government’s stakes in financial companies,” which “a new CEO
should have the opportunity to shape.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
