European stocks retreated, with the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index plunging to its lowest level in a year,
amid deepening concern that the global recovery is stalling.  Mining companies  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) 
retreated more than 8 percent as the S&P GSCI index of 24
commodities fell for a seventh day.  Rio Tinto  Group plunged 5.4
percent after posting earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 sank 3.4 percent to 243.3 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London  for its biggest decline since May 2010. The
index has declined 16 percent from this year’s high on Feb. 17
as the yield on Italian and Spanish bonds surged to records amid
speculation that Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt
crisis. The retreat has left the gauge trading at 9.9 times its
companies’ estimated earnings, the cheapest since March 2009,
Bloomberg data show.  “The market is driven by macroeconomic fears,” said
Stephane Ekolo, chief European strategist at Market Securities
in London. “There is no respite. The macro picture is leading
market participants to start believing that issues such as
sovereign debt, U.S. debt and commodity prices will likely dent
the economic recovery.”  The Euro Stoxx 50 Index tumbled 3.3 percent, extending its
slide since its Feb. 18 high this year to 21 percent, as euro-
area stocks entered a bear market. The index fell for a ninth
day, its longest falling streak since 2003.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, rose for
a seventh day, its longest rising streak since October 2008. The
gauge surged 17 percent today to 34.63 for its biggest jump
since March 16.  Interest Rates   The  European Central Bank  left interest rates unchanged as
economic growth slows and the region’s debt crisis spreads to
Italy and  Spain . ECB officials meeting in Frankfurt today kept
the benchmark rate at 1.5 percent, as predicted by all 54
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled at a press
conference in Frankfurt that the central bank has resumed bond
purchases. People with knowledge of the transactions said the
ECB bought Irish and Portuguese securities.  The  Bank of Japan  expanded its 10 trillion yen ($127
billion) asset-purchase fund by 5 trillion yen and kept its
benchmark interest rate near zero. The central bank ended its
meeting a day early after authorities intervened in  currency
markets  to stem the yen’s advance.  A measure of global equities fell 12 percent from this
year’s high on May 2, entering its first so-called correction in
more than a year. The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks in
developed and emerging markets slid 3.2 percent, its seventh day
of losses and the biggest decline since April 2009.  Spain, Switzerland Sink  National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 western European
markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and  Germany ’s DAX Index
slumped 3.4 percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 Index sank 3.9
percent.  Spain’s IBEX Index and Switzerland’s  Swiss Market Index (SMI) 
fell more than 21 percent from their peaks this year, entering
bear markets. The IBEX and the SMI sank 3.9 percent and 3.6
percent, respectively.  Xstrata plunged 8.5 percent to 1,085 pence and Vedanta
tumbled 9.4 percent to 1,486 pence. The S&P GSCI index of

to 7.4 percent. Basic-resource shares declined 5.5 percent, the
largest retreat of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Rio Tinto, Veolia  Rio Tinto slid 5.4 percent to 3,796.5 pence after the
mining company reported first-half net income of $7.6 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of $8.3 billion. The company
increased its share buyback by $2 billion to $7 billion, stating
it would be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  tumbled 19 percent to 11.60 euros,
the lowest price since its initial public offering in 2000, on
concern that the world’s largest water company will cut payouts
to shareholders following a first-half loss.  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  plunged 19 percent to 394.5 pence, the biggest
drop since its IPO in 2005. The largest provider of satellite
services to the maritime industry cut its projection for its
core mobile satellite services business as “near-term factors
will constrain growth for longer than previously anticipated.”  Givaudan SA (GIVN)  dropped 7.7 percent to 760 Swiss francs. The
maker of the fragrances for Marc Jacobs’s Lola and Paco
Rabanne’s 1 Million perfumes reported first-half earnings that
missed analyst estimates as higher raw-material costs hurt
profitability.  Hexagon AB (HEXAB)  tumbled 15 percent to 105.80 kronor. The world’s
biggest maker of measuring instruments posted second-quarter net
income of 76.3 million euros. Analysts had estimated net income
