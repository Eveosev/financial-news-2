Sue Trinh , a currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong , comments on the yen after
Japanese authorities intervened in foreign-exchange markets
today to weaken the currency.  The yen fell 2.5 percent to 79 per dollar as of 1:13 p.m.
in Tokyo, after sliding to 79.15, the weakest since July 20. The
currency climbed to a postwar high of 76.25 yen on March 17.  Japan ’s Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  “would not say
which currencies were bought.  “Nor would he comment on the size of the intervention, but
market talk is running in the vicinity of 800 billion yen ($10.1
billion) to 1.2 trillion yen. As a guide, the Japanese portion
of the coordinated intervention on March 18 was 692.5 billion
yen.  “Yesterday, Noda said 1995 efforts to counter yen rises
through both solo and multi-national currency market
intervention was a ‘useful reference.’”  On the outlook for the yen:  “Though dollar-yen has a floor for now at the double
bottom of 76.25, we continue to think the demand/supply dynamics
favor yen gains and this will only change when global rates rise
meaningfully, forcing Japanese hedge ratios lower. Recent
evidence suggests global rates will be lower for longer.  “Mitigating this somewhat is the poor political backdrop.
A July 4 Kyodo News poll showed Prime Minister Kan’s support
rating hit 19 percent, an all-time low.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
