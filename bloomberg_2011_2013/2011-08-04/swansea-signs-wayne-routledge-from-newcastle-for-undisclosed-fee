Swansea City, promoted to English
soccer’s Premier League at the end of last season, signed winger
Wayne Routledge from Newcastle for an undisclosed fee.  The 26-year-old, who agreed to a three-year contract, was
the Swans’ second arrival this week after striker Leroy Lita
joined from Middlesbrough yesterday. He’s the fifth signing of
the offseason.  “It’s going to be a difficult first season in the Premier
League, it’s going to be tough,” Routledge told Swansea’s
website. “But everyone is confident and looking forward to it.
After all, playing in the Premier League is what you dream of.”  Routledge’s career has included spells at Crystal Palace
and Tottenham. Last season he was on loan at Queens Park Rangers
and helped the team win promotion to the Premier League as
second-tier champion. Swansea was promoted after beating Reading
in a playoff final.  Earlier today, QPR signed striker DJ Campbell from
Blackpool on a two-year contract. The deal was worth a reported
1.25 million pounds ($2 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
