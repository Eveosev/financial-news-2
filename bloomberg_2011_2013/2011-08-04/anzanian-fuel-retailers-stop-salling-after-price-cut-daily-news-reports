Some fuel retailers in Tanzania
stopped selling gasoline and diesel today after government cut
fuel prices yesterday, prompting long queues at service
stations, the  Daily News  reported.  The East African nation’s Energy and Water Utilities
Regulatory Authority warned fuel retailers they may lose their
licenses if sales don’t resume immediately, the Dar es Salaam-
based newspaper reported. Most fuel stations said they had
nothing to sell, while gasoline was being sold at higher prices
in inland areas due to shortages, the Daily News said.  The official fuel prices are lower than the cost retailers
pay to suppliers, the Daily News cited Naidoo Seelan, chairman
of the Tanzania Association of Oil Marketing Companies, as
saying. The government announced a reduction in the price of
gasoline by 9.2 percent and diesel by 8.3 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
