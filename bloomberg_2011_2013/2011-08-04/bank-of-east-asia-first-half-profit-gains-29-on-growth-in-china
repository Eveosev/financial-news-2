Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23) ,  Hong Kong ’s
third-largest lender by market value, posted a 29 percent jump
in first-half profit as  China ’s economic expansion fueled growth
in loans and fees.  Net income climbed to HK$2.71 billion ($348 million), or
HK$1.24 a share, from a restated HK$2.1 billion, or HK$0.96, a
year earlier, the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. Profit beat the HK$2.08 billion average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The family-run bank led by Chairman David Li is expanding
into China as the fallout from the global financial crisis and
competition squeezes  loan margins  among Hong Kong banks to the
lowest in at least 19 years. Pretax profit in China, its largest
market outside Hong Kong, rose 64 percent to HK$1.28 billion,
contributing to 36 percent of the total.  Shares of the Hong Kong-based lender declined 0.9 percent
to HK$29.05 at the midday trading break. The stock has dropped
11 percent this year, compared with the 8.5 percent fall in the
 Hang Seng Finance Index. (HSF)   Net interest income, or the difference between revenue from
lending and payments on deposits, climbed 20 percent to HK$4.4
billion, while net fee and commission income rose 26 percent to
HK$1.71 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
