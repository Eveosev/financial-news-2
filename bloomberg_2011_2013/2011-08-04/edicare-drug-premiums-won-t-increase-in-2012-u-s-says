Premiums for Medicare prescription
drug plans run by private insurers won’t go up in 2012, the U.S.
said in a  press release .  Beneficiaries will pay $31.08 in 2012, on average, for
access to the drug plans, compared with $30.76 in 2011,
according to the program.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  led enrollment
in the drug benefit plans by publicly traded companies in the
first quarter of 2011, followed by  Humana Inc. (HUM)  and Universal
American Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Medicare Administrator Donald Berwick said that the largely
unchanged premiums, combined with drug discounts in the 2010
health overhaul, will lower out-of-pocket spending by Medicare
beneficiaries.  “It’s a competitive market and we’re seeing the effect of
good competition among Part D plans take its effect,” Berwick
said on a call with reporters announcing the rates.  The steady or decreasing premiums are being driven by
competition among the private plans as well as increased use of
generic drugs and drugs coming off of patent protection, said
Berwick and Sherry Glied, the assistant secretary for planning
and evaluation at the  Department of Health  and Human Services.  New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s top-selling drug Lipitor loses
patent protection in November. The heart drug accounted for the
second-most spending by Medicare in 2009,  according  to the
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
