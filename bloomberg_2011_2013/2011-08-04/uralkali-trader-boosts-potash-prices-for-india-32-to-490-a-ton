OAO  Uralkali (URKA) ,  Russia ’s largest
fertilizer maker by market value, said its trading company
Belarusian Potash Co. raised prices for  India  by 32 percent
because of a shortage of the soil nutrient.  BPC will supply 1.2 million metric tons to Indian Potash
Ltd. at $490 a ton through the end of March 2012, Berezniki-
based Uralkali said today in a statement. The previous contract
with India expired last March and had a price of $370 a ton,
according to a Uralkali statement in March 2010.  Rising corn and wheat prices have encouraged farmers to
boost crop output, enabling suppliers to raise potash prices.
Canpotex Ltd., a rival trader owned by North American producers
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.,  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  and  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
agreed yesterday to sell potash to India at $470 a ton in the
fourth quarter and $530 a ton in the first quarter.  “The India contract price agreed by Uralkali missed market
expectations,” said Denis Gabrielik, an analyst at Otkritie
Capital. “The price looks low given that Canpotex agreed to
supply potash to India at $500 a ton on average in October
through March.”  Uralkali fell 2 percent to 256.96 rubles at the 6:45 p.m.
close of trading in Moscow.  The company agreed in June to supply potash to China in the
second half at $470 a ton and expects that price to exceed the
latest Indian fee in the first half of 2012, according to Head
of Sales Oleg Petrov.  Slower Price Growth  “We decided that it makes more sense to start selling to
India at $490 a ton, with a premium to  China , now rather than to
wait for a sharper price increase from January,” Petrov told
reporters today by telephone.  Uralkali and Belarusian producer Belaruskali seek to ship
as much as 2.5 million tons of potash to India by March 31, or
half the country’s imports, Petrov said. That includes 300,000
tons to be shipped by the end of this year by  International
Potash Co. , a trader that will stop working with Uralkali in
2012, according to Petrov.  “We are the largest potash supplier to India, therefore we
agreed a single price for the whole eight months so both state
companies and private Indian importers supported by the
government subsidies could enjoy the same price despite their
contract size,” Petrov said.  The fertilizer company plans to announce an increase in
spot prices for  Southeast Asia  as soon as next week, Petrov
said. Spot prices are currently $510 a ton and may reach $600 by
year-end, he said, declining to comment on the extent of next
week’s increase.  In the last year, spot potash prices increased about 46
percent while price growth may slow down to 10 to 20 percent in
2012, Uralkali’s head of sales said. The global potash trade may
reach a record 60 million tons this year, Petrov said, declining
to provide guidance for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
