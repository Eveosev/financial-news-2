WageWorks Inc., the provider of
human-resources services for companies including  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,
postponed its initial public offering after U.S. stocks posted
their biggest daily decline in more than two years.  The  San Mateo , California-based company delayed its
offering until next week from today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index plunged 4.8
percent, the biggest slump since February 2009, as investors
sold on concern the global economy may relapse into a recession.  WageWorks earlier today slashed its IPO price range by as
much as 43 percent to attract demand for its shares, which it is
offering at a premium to other human-resources services
companies. The offering has faced a weak equity market, with the
S&P declining in eight of the past nine trading days, and new
U.S. health-care laws that limit the use of flexible spending
and health savings accounts, two of WageWorks’ services.  The company, which says it competes with U.S. health
insurer  Aetna Inc. (AET)  and Automatic Data Processing Inc., is
seeking to raise about $52 million selling 5.77 million shares
for $8 to $9 each, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission today. The company originally offered
the shares for $12 to $14 each.  The midpoint of the new offering range would value
WageWorks at about $212 million, or about 1.8 times last year’s
sales, more than the average of about 0.5 times sales among 17
U.S.-listed human-resources services companies with a market
value of less than $1 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Barrett Business Services Inc., TeamStaff Inc. and Fortune
Industries Inc., peers of similar size in the human-resources
industry, all trade at lower multiples than WageWorks is seeking
at the reduced range.  ‘On-Demand’ Software  Sales at WageWorks, which has 37 Fortune 100 clients, rose
20 percent in the six months through June to $69.2 million from
a year earlier, primarily because of takeovers, the company said
in its filing. Full-year sales in 2010 were $115 million, 6
percent higher than the previous year.  Customers access WageWorks benefit programs through Web-
based software, which allows the company to enhance its products
quickly, it said in its filing. This “on-demand” business
model also requires less up-front investment by customers
compared with services that require on-site software
installation, it said.  WageWorks customers offer the services to their employees
as a way to reduce taxes. Using WageWorks, employees can opt to
set aside a portion of their paychecks before being charged
income taxes, and use that money to buy public-transportation
passes or  prescription drugs .  Owners of WageWorks include VantagePoint Capital Partners,
Advent International Corp. and Camden Partners. All of the
shares in the offering are being sold by WageWorks.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and William Blair & Co. are leading
the offering, according to the filing. The shares are scheduled
to trade on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol WAGE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
