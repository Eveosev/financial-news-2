Bank of the West’s lawsuit claiming
 UBS AG (UBSN)  designed a collateralized debt obligation fund to insure
against its own subprime investment losses was dismissed.  Bank of the West, in a complaint filed in state court in
 San Francisco , said UBS created the CDO in 2007 to induce
investments from other financial institutions to insure against
the losses. That case was dismissed in November, according to a
court filing.  Jim Cole, a spokesman for Bank of the West, said today in
an e-mail that the lawsuit was settled.  Christiaan Brakman, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS,
declined to comment on the case.  Bank of the West, based in San Francisco, is a unit of
BancWest Corp., the U.S. consumer-banking unit of  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
SA. BNP Paribas is Europe’s largest lender by assets.  The case is Bank of the West v. UBS, CGC-09-489590,
Superior Court of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
