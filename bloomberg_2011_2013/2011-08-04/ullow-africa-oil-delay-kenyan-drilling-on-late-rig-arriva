Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based
explorer with the most licenses in  Africa , and its partner in
 Kenya  postponed two onshore wells after a rig was delayed.  Tullow and  Africa Oil Corp.  will start drilling an
exploration well in Kenya’s  Block 10BB  in the fourth quarter
using a  Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT)  rig, Africa Oil said late
yesterday in a statement. Drilling had been due in the third
quarter, according to a  schedule  presented by Tullow last month.  The partners will start another well at Block 10A in early
2012, rather than in the fourth quarter, the statement shows.  “Logistical issues around the shipping of the rig have
caused minor delays to our drilling program,” George Cazenove,
a London-based spokesman for Tullow, said today by telephone.  Tullow is expanding in East Africa after raising its stake
in Kenya’s offshore Block L8 to 15 percent by acquiring an
interest from  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)   Tullow and Vancouver-based Africa Oil have also hired
 China ’s BGP Inc. to explore the onshore  South Omo Block  in
 Ethiopia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
