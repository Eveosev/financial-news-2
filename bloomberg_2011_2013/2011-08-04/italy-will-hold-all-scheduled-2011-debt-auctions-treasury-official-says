Italy will hold all scheduled debt
auctions for 2011, a Treasury official said, denying a report on
the Zero Hedge website that the government may pull out of the
markets for the remainder of the year amid soaring bond yields.  All 2011 auctions are confirmed, said the official, who
declined to be identified because of government policy. The only
canceled sale was the one planned for Aug. 12, which was called
off on July 25 because of an ample supply of cash and reduced
financing needs, the official added.  The Zero Hedge website, citing Reuters, earlier reported
that the Treasury may withdraw from most “if not all” of its
remaining debt auctions this year because it has a larger cash
pile than previously thought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
