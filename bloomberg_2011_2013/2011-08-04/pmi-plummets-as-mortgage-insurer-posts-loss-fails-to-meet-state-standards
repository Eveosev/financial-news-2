PMI Group Inc. (PMI) , the third-largest
mortgage insurer, plunged by almost half after the company
posted its 16th straight unprofitable quarter and failed to meet
regulators’ capital requirements.  The risk-to-capital ratio was 58.1-to-1 as of June 30 at
the Mortgage Insurance Co. unit, above the regulatory maximum of
25-to-1 set by state watchdogs. The unit is prohibited from
writing business in six states, and waivers in four others
expire by the end of the year, PMI said in a statement today.  “We expect the number of states in which MIC is precluded
from writing new business will significantly increase,” PMI
said in the statement. The insurer plans to meet with regulators
to discuss “various capital initiatives the company is
pursuing.”  The ratio translates to a $320 million capital deficit,
said Douglas Harter, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.
Harter cut his recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from
“outperform.”  The insurer’s shortfall “greatly increases the likelihood
of PMI needing to dilute existing shareholders,” he said.  PMI slipped 43 cents, or 49 percent, to 45 cents at 10:09
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The mortgage
insurer has dropped 73 percent this year through yesterday.  PMI pays lenders when homeowners default and foreclosure
fails to recoup costs. The second-quarter net loss narrowed to
$134.8 million, or 83 cents a share, from $150.6 million, or
$1.11, a year earlier, the Walnut Creek, California-based
company said today. This year’s result included a $150.5 million
gain tied to the sale of discontinued operations.  Credit-Default Swaps  The net loss at PMI’s U.S. mortgage unit widened to $338.4
million from $115.6 million a year earlier.  Contracts protecting against PMI’s default for five years
increased 8.7 percentage points to 53.7 percent upfront as of
9:01 a.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA. That’s in
addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $5.37
million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million
of PMI’s debt.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the largest U.S. mortgage insurer,
dropped 13 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. No. 2  Radian
Group Inc. (RDN)  slumped 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
