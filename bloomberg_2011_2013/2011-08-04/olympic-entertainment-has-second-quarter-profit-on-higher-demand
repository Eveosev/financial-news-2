Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern Europe, reported
a profit in the second-quarter, helped mainly by improving
revenue in  Latvia  and Estonia.  Net income was 4.2 million euros ($6 million) after a loss
of 760,000 euros a year earlier, the Tallinn, Estonia-based
company said in a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose 16
percent to 30.7 million euros.  Sales rose 23 percent in Latvia and 10 percent in Estonia.
The two countries make up about half of the groupâ€™s gaming
income. Sales in Slovakia, which contributes 11 percent, jumped
49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
