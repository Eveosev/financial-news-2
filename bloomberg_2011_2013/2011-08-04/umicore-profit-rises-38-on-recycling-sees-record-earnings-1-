Umicore (UMI)  SA, the Belgian maker of a
third of all auto-catalysts, said first-half profit climbed 38
percent and record earnings from precious-metals recycling will
persist in the second half because of improved supply contracts
and rising investor demand for gold.  Net income rose to 174.6 million euros ($249.9 million)
from 126.9 million euros a year earlier, the Brussels-based
company said today in a statement. Per-share earnings excluding
special items such as a gain on metal and currency hedges
advanced 12 percent to 1.39 euros, exceeding the 1.375-euro
average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Umicore’s recycling business generated 62 percent of
operating profit in the first half, countering pricing pressure
for rechargeable-battery materials and a weaker dollar that
affected its joint venture with De Beers SA for industrial
diamond materials. The precious-metals refinery in Hoboken,
 Belgium , processed more and richer residues from base-metal
smelters and trading was buoyed by demand for gold in the second
quarter. Revenue growth in the catalyst business accelerated
from 13 percent in the first quarter and sales in that division
will advance about 15 percent this year, Umicore said.  ‘Comforting’ Guidance  “Good set of first-half results and a comforting second-
half guidance,”  Bernard Hanssens , an analyst at Banque Degroof
SA in Brussels, wrote in a note today. “Short-term prospects
are rather good.”  Umicore shares gained as much as 4.6 percent in Brussels
trading, ending seven consecutive days of declines, and were up
91 cents at 33.50 euros by 9:18 a.m. local time. The shares have
lost 14 percent so far this year, compared with a 6.2 percent
decline for Johnson Matthey Plc in the period.  The world’s largest precious-metals recycler said it’s
confident of reporting “record earnings” this year and
maintained its forecast for full-year earnings before interest,
tax and special items of 400 million euros to 425 million euros.
First-half earnings on that basis rose 15 percent to 214.5
million euros, in line with the 214 million-euro median estimate
of seven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Net debt dropped to 347.8 million euros from 360.4 million
euros at the end of December. Umicore will distribute an interim
dividend of 40 cents a share in September, a 23 percent increase
from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
