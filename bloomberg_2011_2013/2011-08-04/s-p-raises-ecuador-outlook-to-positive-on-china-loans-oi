Ecuador’s credit rating outlook was
raised to positive from stable by Standard & Poor’s Ratings,
which cited better growth prospects because of increased oil
revenue and financing from  China .  S&P rates Ecuador B-, six levels below investment grade.
The ratings company said loans from China and revenue from oil
exports have allowed for more public investment, which could
lead to increased growth.  “We have revised our outlook on Ecuador to positive from
stable to reflect the possibility of an upgrade if sustained
higher levels of investment lead to improved growth prospects
and higher levels of government revenues over the medium term,”
Richard Francis, an analyst at S&P in  New York , said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
