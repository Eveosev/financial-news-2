BancABC Ltd. will help restructure
the debts of Harare-based  RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ) , the state-controlled
 Herald  said, citing RioZim Managing Director Josh Sachikonye.  The exercise will be followed by a rights issue to raise an
undisclosed amount of cash to fund the re-opening of RioZim’s
Cam and Motor Gold Mine and further development at the company’s
Renco Gold Mine, the Harare-based Herald said on its website.
RioZim will seek less than the $40 million it planned to raise
in February, said the Herald, adding that Sachikonye didn’t
provide details.  The miner has arranged an underwriter for the rights offer,
the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
