Simba Energy Inc. (SMB) , a Canadian oil and
gas explorer focusing on Africa, said it had entered a
production sharing agreement with Kenya for an exploration block
in the country’s northeast.  The British Columbia-based company said securing Block 2A,
which stretches over 7,802 square kilometers (3,012 square
miles), corresponds with its plan to pursue “underexplored and
overlooked onshore basins in Africa,” according to a statement
on its website yesterday.  Existing two-dimensional seismic data and other evidence
indicates the area has an “excellent potential for significant
oil and gas discoveries,” according to the statement. The
company will begin “baseline” environmental studies before
beginning to acquire new seismic data, it said.  Simba Energy is also  searching  for oil and gas in the West
African nations of Liberia, Guinea, Mali and Ghana, among other
places on the continent, the statement said.  Dominion Petroleum Ltd. (DPL)  said on Aug. 1 it was granted
rights to explore Block L15 in Kenya’s Lamu Basin, in a two-year
agreement committing it to spend at least $2.85 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
