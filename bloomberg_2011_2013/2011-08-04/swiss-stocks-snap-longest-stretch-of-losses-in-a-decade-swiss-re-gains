Swiss stocks fluctuated between gains
and losses after the longest stretch of losses since 2000 for
the benchmark  Swiss Market Index. (SMI)   Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-biggest reinsurer,
climbed 5 percent.  Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the largest maker of flavors and
fragrances, slumped 12 percent as profit trailed projections.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, fell 0.4 percent to 5,460.64 at 2:09
p.m. in Zurich, having earlier risen 1.7 percent. The gauge has
dropped 19 percent from this year’s high on Feb. 18 as  Europe ’s
debt crisis and the slowing global economy prompted investors to
buy the Swiss franc, reducing the value of exporters’ revenue.
The broader Swiss Performance Index sank 0.6 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
