Uganda’s shilling, the world’s worst-
performing currency in the last two months, fell to the lowest
in five weeks against the dollar as demand for the U.S. currency
outweighed its sales by the central bank.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.9 percent to 2,672.5 per dollar, the weakest
intraday level since June 30, by 2:37 p.m. in Kampala, the
capital.  The central bank sold a “reasonable” amount of dollars,
the second time in a week, after witnessing volatility in the
market, Stephen Kaboyo, the director of financial markets at the
central bank, said by telephone from Kampala.  “There was volatility in the market because of offshore
demand and we had to go in to manage the volatility,” he said.
“There was so much buying at the opening but we have restored
stability.”  The shilling was also weighed down by demand for the
greenback by a major construction company that sought the U.S.
currency to import materials, Lucas Ochieng, a currency trader
at Orient Bank Ltd. said by phone from Kampala.  The shilling has depreciated 10 percent against the dollar
over the last two months, making it the world’s worst performer
in the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation
to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent this month from 15.7
percent in June, the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
