Dubai’s shares advanced, headed for
their first weekly gain in four, after quarterly earnings at
banks improved and amid investor optimism the U.S. Federal
Reserve will start further economic stimulus.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , the company that posted a 10
percent increase in profit, climbed a third day this week.  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
jumped 2 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.7 percent, the
most since July 31, to 1,538.76 at 12:27 p.m. in the emirate,
bringing the gain for the week to 2.2 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.4 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.7 percent.  “So far there are solid results from banks,” said Fadi Al Said, a Dubai-based senior investment manager at ING Investment
Management, which oversees about $518 billion worldwide. “In
the second half of Ramadan, things might get busier.”  Dubai Islamic, the U.A.E.’s biggest lender complying with
Shariah rules, on July 30 said second-quarter net income rose to
331 million dirhams ($90 million). The shares rose 1 percent to
2.08 dirhams, bringing the gain for the week to 4 percent.
 Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets, reported
an 87 percent surge in second-quarter profit on July 25. The
shares have gained 2 percent since.  Air Arabia Gains  U.S. stocks rebounded yesterday after the Wall Street
Journal reported that three former top officials at the Fed said
the central bank should consider a new round of securities
purchases to bolster economic growth. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index advanced 0.5 percent yesterday, while the STOXX Europe 600
Index increased 0.3 percent today.  The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from
sunrise to sunset and business activity slows, started this
week. About 27 million shares traded in Dubai so far today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 122 million shares,
according to data on Bloomberg.  Emaar advanced the most since Aug. 2 to 3.02 dirhams. Air
Arabia PJSC increased 0.9 percent to 67.7 fils. The  Middle
East ’s biggest low-cost airline said second-quarter profit rose
2 percent to 49.6 million dirhams as it lured more passengers
with cheaper tickets.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 1.3 percent. Kuwait’s gauge and
Oman’s MSM 30 Index were little changed. Bahrain’s BB All Share
Index slipped 0.3 percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s market is closed for
the weekend.  -- Editors: Claudia Maedler, James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
