Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. is a
leading bidder to buy  New Zealand ’s Independent Liquor in a deal
worth as much as NZ$1.4 billion ($1.2 billion), the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Independent’s owners Pacific Equity Partners and Unitas
Capital Pte. set today as the deadline for bids to take a
controlling stake, the Journal reported. Takayuki Tanaka,
spokesman for Asahi, declined to comment on the report when
contacted by Bloomberg today.  It is unclear whether Suntory Holdings Ltd., which entered
the first round of bidding, was planning on a final offer, the
Journal reported.  Independent Liquor distributes brands including Woodstock
bourbon, Whyte & Mackay scotch and Carlsberg and Tuborg beers,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
