British Land Co., the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, said first-quarter
earnings before items rose 1.6 percent after the company made
acquisitions and leased more space to tenants.  Pretax profit excluding changes in asset values and one-
time items rose to 65 million pounds ($106 million), or 7.2
pence a share, in the three months ended June 30, from 64
million pounds, or 7.1 pence, a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Chris Grigg plans projects that
will add 2.2 million square feet (204,389 square meters) of
office space through 2014 in central  London , where a shortage of
Grade A space is driving up rents. The average lease length of
British Land’s real estate, two thirds of which is retail-
related, was 11.4 years with a vacancy rate of 2.7 percent.  “The pace of capital growth is abating and onward momentum
will depend more on the development program and asset management
than market movements,” said Alan Carter, an Evolution
Securities analyst who rates the shares  “neutral.”  Net asset value rose to 583 pence a share from 567 pence
three months earlier. One quarter of the gains came from British
Land’s development projects, 80 percent of which are
concentrated in central London.  British Land fell 17 pence, or 2.9 percent, to 563 pence in
London trading. That was less than the 3.4 percent slide in
benchmark FTSE 100 Index of shares, of which it is a member, on
concerns about global economic growth prospects.  Property Values Rise  The rising value of British Land’s real estate added 83
million pounds to net income, which increased to 198 million
pounds in the quarter from 171 million pounds a year earlier.
The company will pay a first-quarter dividend of 6.5 pence a
share, unchanged from the payout of a year earlier.  “It’s been an active and positive start to the year,”
Grigg said on a conference call. “The development program is
making a decent contribution to valuations.”  Net rental income rose 3.1 percent to 132 million pounds,
lifted by rent increases and acquisitions in the previous
financial year including the Drake Circus mall in Plymouth.  The company made 326 million pounds of acquisitions since
the end of March, including 17 Virgin Active sports centers, a
London office building and recently refurbished residences also
located in the British capital.  Net debt rose to 4.59 billion pounds from 4.41 billion
pounds three months earlier. Debt represented 45 percent of the
value of British Land’s real estate, unchanged from the end of
fiscal 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
