The University of  Oklahoma  is ranked
No. 1 in the preseason college football coaches’ poll released
by  USA Today , receiving first-place votes from 42 of the 59
members on the panel.  The University of  Alabama  is ranked second, followed by the
University of  Oregon , Louisiana State and Florida State.  Oklahoma, which has played in Bowl Championship Series
title games four times since 2000, tops the preseason coaches’
poll for the first time since 2003. The last school to be ranked
No. 1 before the season and win the BCS championship was
 Southern California  in 2004.  “It’s an honor to be ranked No. 1 any time, but we
understand that the preseason ranking means very little compared
with what it will mean months from now,” Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said in a statement on the school’s athletic department
 website .  Oklahoma opens its  season  Sept. 3 against the University
of Tulsa and then has five games against opponents ranked in the
coaches’ top 25. The Sooners travel to Tallahassee,  Florida , to
play Florida State on Sept. 17.  Stanford University  is ranked sixth, while Boise State,
Oklahoma State,  Texas A&M  and Wisconsin round out the top 10.
Defending national champion  Auburn University  is 19th.  The coaches’ poll accounts for a third of the BCS
standings, which determine the two teams that play in the
championship game. Also factored in are the Harris Interactive
poll and an average of six computer rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
