Market conditions are “reminiscent”
of 2008 as concerns about government finances roil investors,
Michael Dobson, chief executive officer of  Schroders Plc (SDR) , the
U.K.’s largest independent money manager, said today.  “It has changed from a banking crisis to more of a
sovereign crisis with many of the same characteristics,” Dobson
said in an interview after Schroders released first-half
earnings. “There is something of a credit crunch going on with
banks not wanting to lend to each other.”  Dobson is the second chief executive of a U.K. fund company
in two days to compare today’s markets to 2008 when the global
financial crisis erupted. Alain Grisay, CEO of F&C Asset
Management Plc, said yesterday that the crisis of confidence
affecting markets was almost as bad as in 2008.  Spanish and Italian government bond yields have risen above
6 percent and are similar to the yields that forced  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  to ask for bailouts.  “We have had a very jumpy start to the second half,”
Dobson said. “That will continue for a while, while the macro-
economic uncertainties continue.”  Schroders first-half net income rose 21 percent to 165.6
million pounds ($270.9 million), or 58.7 pence a share, from
136.9 million pounds, or 47.5 pence, a year earlier, the London-
based company said in a statement today.  Pretax profit, funds under management and inflows all beat
estimates, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The company had net inflows of 5.1 billion pounds in the
first half, with 90 percent coming from institutional investors.
Assets under management rose 4.1 percent to 204.8 billion pounds
at June 30 from six months earlier, Schroders said.  Schroders shares fell 13 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 1,562
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading, extending their
decline this year to 16 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
