Average pork prices in 50 Chinese
cities fell at the end of July, aiding the government’s efforts
to rein in the fastest inflation in three years.  The average price of marbled pork from July 21-30 fell 0.6
percent from the previous 10-day period to 30.09 yuan ($4.67)
per kilogram, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its
 website  today. Prices for hind-leg pork dropped 0.4 percent to
31.12 yuan a kilogram, according to the statement.  A decline in the price of pork, which JPMorgan Chase & Co.
economists say possibly accounted for a fifth of June’s 6.4
percent increase in consumer prices, may signal that inflation
moderated in July. China’s central bank has raised  interest
rates  three times this year as part of its campaign to rein in
consumer prices.  The Ministry of Commerce also released data that showed
declines last month for the wholesale price of pork. Prices
dropped 0.5 percent in the 7-day period ending July 31 from the
previous week, the commerce ministry said. They fell 0.2 percent
in the week ended July 24, according to the ministry.  Prices for pork, China’s most consumed meat, have gained
more than 50 percent from last year, according to the commerce
ministry. The 6.4 percent pace of inflation in June was the
fastest since June 2008.  Consumer prices may have increased 6.3 percent in July,
according to the median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  China ’s statistics bureau is scheduled to release
July consumer-price data on Aug. 9.  Average prices for other meats rose in the final 10 days of
July, according to the statistics bureau. The average price of
chicken rose 0.7 percent from the previous 10-day period, beef
prices gained 0.2 percent and the price of mutton increased 0.5
percent, according to the bureau. Egg prices rose 2.7 percent,
the fastest rate in two months.  Rice prices were unchanged during the period, according to
the statistics bureau. Bokchoi was the only variety of fruit and
vegetable monitored by the bureau for which prices rose in the
final 10 days of the month.  --Emma Dong. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
