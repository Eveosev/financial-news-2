Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
biggest refiner, rose the most since May in Mumbai after Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee signaled ending subsidies on diesel
used by cars.  Indian Oil climbed 3.2 percent to 328.30 rupees at 3:24
p.m. in Mumbai, the most since May 27. Bharat Petroleum Corp.
gained 3.3 percent to 687.65 rupees and Hindustan Petroleum
Corp. rose 4 percent to 392.20 rupees. The benchmark Sensitive
Index declined 1.4 percent.  Mukherjee told lawmakers in the lower house of parliament
in  New Delhi  today that 15 percent of  India ’s diesel is used by
passenger cars and the government can “work out a mechanism to
see that these sections are not subsidized.” Diesel accounts
for 45 percent of the total fuel used in the country.  “After the minister’s comments, investors expect diesel
subsidies will fall at some time and the burden of the refiners
will reduce,” said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd., said by phone from Kochi.
“Lower  oil prices  this week are also boosting the shares.”  State-run refiners sell diesel, kerosene and cooking gas
below cost to help curb inflation in the world’s second-fastest
growing major economy. They lose 6.06 rupees on every liter of
diesel sold, according to  data  on the oil ministry’s website.  Crude oil in New York trading has declined 4.4 percent this
week and is trading near the lowest in five weeks. The September
contract was at $91.73 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down 20 cents, at 9:56 a.m. London
time.  Diesel consumption in May was 5.9 million metric tons and
total fuel use in the month was 12.9 million tons, according to
oil ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
