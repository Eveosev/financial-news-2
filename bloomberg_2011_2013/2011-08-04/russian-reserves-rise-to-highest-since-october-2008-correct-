(Corrects reserves total in first paragraph of story
published on Aug. 4.)  Russia’s foreign-currency and gold
reserves advanced $4.1 billion in the week ended July 29 to $535
billion, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  That’s the highest level since October 2008, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Taking into account currency fluctuations and
 gold prices , the weekly increase was $1.8 billion, Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Moscow-based Otkritie Capital,
said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  “Throughout the previous week, the Russian  currency market 
saw a significant correction after the ruble appreciated against
the bi-currency basket during the tax-payment period,”
Tikhomirov said. “The dynamics of the ruble exchange rate were
mainly determined by weak global economic performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
