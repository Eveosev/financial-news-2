TDC A/S, Denmark’s biggest phone
company, reported second-quarter profit that fell more than
analysts expected after competition for local wireless users
trimmed prices.  Net income fell to 561 million kroner ($107 million) from
657 million kroner a year earlier, Copenhagen-based TDC said in
a  statement . Analysts had expected net income of 617 million
kroner, according to the average of 14 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales were little changed at 6.54 billion kroner  TDC bought Onfone ApS in May for 313 million kroner,
removing a competitor that drove down monthly bills on the
cheapest contracts by as much as 50 percent. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in TDC’s consumer
wireless unit declined 8.3 percent in the second quarter, TDC
said today.  “The intensified price competition in residential mobility
services remains a drain on average revenue per user,” Chief
Executive Officer Henrik Poulsen said in the statement. The
Onfone acquisition together with a restructured smartphone
offering “should improve earnings in residential mobility
services towards the end of 2011.”  TDC fell as much as 2.1 percent to 46.52 kroner in
Copenhagen trading. The shares declined 1 percent, or 0.48
krone, to 47.02 kroner at 10:12 a.m. local time, compared with
at 0.9 percent advance in the  OMX Copenhagen 20 index. (KFX)   The company retained its 2011 forecast for revenue to
increase as much as 1 percent and Ebitda to advance about 2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
