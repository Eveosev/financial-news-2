by output, releases second-quarter earnings results before the
market opens. The mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg is for the steelmaker to report a profit of 498.6
million reais.  The company raised as much as 5.5 billion reais ($3.52
billion) in April, stoking speculation in news reports and by
investors that it may buy part of Usiminas.  GOVERNMENT:
