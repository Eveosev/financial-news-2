Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
second-biggest producer of the crop, climbed 41 percent in July,
surpassing a forecast as volumes of beans improved, the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments rose to 375,843 bags that have a weight of 60
kilograms (132 pounds) each, compared with 266,215 bags a year
earlier, the authority said today in an e-mailed report from the
capital, Kampala. The East African nation had forecast July
output of 320,000 bags, the agency said.  A good crop of beans in the south and the west of the
country accounted for the increase, according to an official who
declined to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak
for the agency.  Uganda may exceed its forecast of 2.6 million bags for the
12 months through September on the outlook for the crop from
those areas, the official said. The agency’s projection, made in
April, was a reduction from earlier figures after a drought cut
yields in the eastern and central regions.  Exports from the start of the season on Oct. 1 through July
rose 8.7 percent to 2.5 million bags, from 2.3 million bags in
the same period a year earlier, according a tally made by
Bloomberg News using figures provided by the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
