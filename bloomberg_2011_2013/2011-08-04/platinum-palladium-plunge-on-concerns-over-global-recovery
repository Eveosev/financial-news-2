Platinum plunged the most in almost
three months and palladium the most in more than four months in
 London  amid concern that global economic recovery may stall,
eroding demand for raw materials.  The MSCI All-Country World Index, a measure of global
equities, fell 12 percent from this year’s high in May. U.S.
initial jobless claims fell last week to a level that shows
limited improvement in the labor market. The S&P GSCI Spot Index
of raw materials dropped as much as 3.5 percent, led by declines
in energy and agricultural commodities.  “The market is very focused on the weak industrial demand
for platinum and palladium at this stage,” Walter de Wet, head
of commodities research at Standard Bank Plc in London, said by
phone. “It’s a lot on the back of the falling equities and
liquidation in commodities.”  Platinum for immediate delivery fell $58.30, or 3.3
percent, to $1,722.70 an ounce by 5:52 p.m. in London, after
dropping as much as 3.8 percent, the most since May 5. Palladium
plunged $48, or 6 percent, to $747.50 an ounce, and earlier fell
as much as 6.5 percent, the most since March 15. The metals,
used in autocatalysts, were down 2.8 percent and 6.7 percent
since the start of the year, respectively.  Manufacturing indexes from  Asia  to the U.S. to  Europe  fell
in July as demand weakened and the global recovery from
recession lost momentum, reports showed Aug. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
