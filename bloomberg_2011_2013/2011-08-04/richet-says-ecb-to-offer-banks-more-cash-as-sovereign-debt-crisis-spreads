European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the ECB will offer banks additional cash as
the region’s debt crisis spreads, increasing pressure on policy
makers to resume bond purchases.  The ECB will lend euro-area banks as much money as they
need for six months and extend its existing liquidity measures
through the end of the year, Trichet said at a press conference
in  Frankfurt  today after the ECB kept its benchmark  interest
rate  at 1.5 percent. ECB rates are still “accommodative” and
inflation risks “remain on the upside,” he said.  European officials are trying to stop the region’s
sovereign debt crisis spreading to Italy and Spain. While the
comments suggest the ECB is reluctant to shelve further rate
increases, traders are looking for signs that the central bank
will take direct steps to shore up the bonds of crisis-hit
nations.  While acknowledging a “particularly high” level of
uncertainty, Trichet said inflation expectations “must remain
firmly anchored.”  The Swiss and Turkish central banks cut rates this week and
the  Bank of Japan  announced additional stimulus measures as
concerns mount about the weakening U.S. economy and  Europe ’s
worsening crisis. The Bank of England kept its key rate at 0.5
percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
