Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  fell for a third
day, extending a one-year low on speculation the Czech lender’s
holdings of Greek  government bonds  may hurt profit and as
concern the global economy is slowing drove investors from risk.  The Czech unit of Societe Generale SA slid as much as 1.6
percent and traded down 1.4 percent to 3,639 koruna by 3:36 p.m.
in Prague, heading for its lowest close since July 2010.  Second-quarter profit shrank 36 percent because of a 1.66
billion-koruna ($97 million) impairment charge on Greek
government debt, the bank said yesterday. Komercni also said it
still holds about 7 billion koruna of bonds of the European
Union’s most-indebted nation.  “The main investment case around the dividend story is not
certain enough” because of “the potential for further
writedowns on the bank’s Greek sovereign bond holdings,” Hugo Swann, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst, wrote in a report
today.  Swann cut the share-price estimate for the stock to 3,850
koruna from 4,200 koruna and kept his “underperform”
recommendation, according to the report.  European shares and crude oil tumbled for a fifth day and
U.S. index futures dropped amid concerns a slowing U.S. economy
will dent the global recovery. The  European Central Bank  left
 interest rates  unchanged as economic growth slows and the
region’s debt crisis spreads to Italy and  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
