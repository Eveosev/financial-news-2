Sappi Ltd. (SAP)  said it expects to post a
“much-improved” operating profit excluding special items for
the full year compared with the previous 12 months.  “We expect considerable improvement in operating profit”
during the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months,
the papermaker said. “However, it is likely to be well short of
the level achieved in the equivalent quarter last year.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
