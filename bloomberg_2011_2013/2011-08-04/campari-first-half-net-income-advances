Davide Campari-Milano SpA (CPR) , the maker
of Wild Turkey bourbon, reported first-half profit that slightly
missed analysts’ estimates and said that it bought the Sagatiba
brand to expand in the Brazilian spirits market.  Net income in the six months ending June 30 rose to 75.3
million euros ($107 million) from 69.3 million euros a year
earlier, the Milan-based company said in a statement today. That
compared with the 76.7 million-euro average estimate of eight
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue climbed 14 percent to
589.1 million euros in the period as sales rose in  Germany .  Chief Executive Officer Bob Kunze-Concewitz said in May
that the company expects as much as 30 percent of sales to come
from emerging markets within five years, and that it plans to
expand in  Latin America , eastern  Europe , the Pacific region and
Africa. The company is looking to buy brands and has more than
500 million euros to spend, he said at the time. Campari is
“optimistic” about its prospects for the full year, the CEO
said in the statement today.  Campari paid $26 million for Sagatiba, which it started
selling in Latin America under a distribution agreement in March
2010. “Sagatiba, the leading super premium and fast growing
cachaca brand in  Brazil , significantly strengthens our brand
portfolio in that key emerging market,” said Kunze-Concewitz.  The shares fell 1 percent as of 11:56 a.m. in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 3.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
