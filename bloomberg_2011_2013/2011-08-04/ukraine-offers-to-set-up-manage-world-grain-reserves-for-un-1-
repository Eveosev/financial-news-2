Ukraine offered to set up and manage
a world grain reserve overseen by the  United Nations , as well as
intervene in grain markets on behalf of the organization,
according to Worldwide News Ukraine.  The reserve would contain 10 million to 12 million metric
tons of grain and “would presumably be used to regulate world
grain prices by intervening in the market in times of low grain
supply,” according to a statement from Worldwide News Ukraine
that was distributed by PR Newswire.  Agriculture ministers from the Group of 20 nations in June
agreed to study setting up local emergency stockpiles in food-
deficient countries that can be used in case of humanitarian
emergencies. There was no agreement on global reserves.  “The idea of keeping stocks in the form of large world
reserves has been more or less discarded by the G-20,”
 Concepcion Calpe , an economist at the UN’s  Food and Agriculture
Organization , said via phone from  Rome . “It’s also very costly.
I don’t believe the UN or any organization will bear the
financial cost of such a big reserve.”  Ukraine has brought a motion to the UN suggesting the
creation of a world grain reserve on its territory, according
to the Worldwide News Ukraine statement.  “This would provide for the stability of the world grain
prices as well as guarantee food security of the global
population,” according to the statement. Worldwide News Ukraine
is a Kiev-based  news agency , according to its website. The
announcement was in the state-run newspaper Uryadovy Kurier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
