South Korea ’s current-account surplus
may widen in July from June, boosted by an increased trade
surplus, the nation’s finance ministry said.  The ministry also said in its monthly economic assessment
that prices may stay high for some time due to heavy rain and
ahead of the Chuseok thanksgiving in September. It said that
external economic conditions are “highly uncertain” due to oil
prices, slowing major economies, and  Europe ’s debt woes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
