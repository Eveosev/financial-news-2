Gulf gasoline strengthened as futures
fell the most in 12 weeks on speculation that U.S. economic
recovery is stalling and demand will slow.  The crack spread, or the premium of reformulated gasoline
futures over benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil, has
fallen 15 percent since Aug. 2.  When gasoline crack margins drop “the differentials tend
to increase,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5 cent to 2 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:05 p.m. Prompt
delivery fell 18.11 cents to $2.7252 a gallon.  The differential for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago held steady at 5.5 cents a gallon.  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s Wood River refinery in Illinois started a
wet gas compressor that failed yesterday after a  power outage ,
according to filings with two agencies.  An unknown amount of material was flared after the
compressor failed, according to a  filing  with the National
Response Center. The compressor was restarted and the associated
unit returned to normal operations, according to a separate
 filing  with the  Illinois  Emergency Management Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
