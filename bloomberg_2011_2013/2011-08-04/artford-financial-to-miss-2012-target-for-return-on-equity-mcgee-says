Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer that repaid a $3.4 billion bailout last year,
said it will miss its target for return on equity next year.  “At our April 2010 investor day we targeted an 11 percent
ROE run rate for the company by the end of 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer  Liam McGee  said today in a conference call
with analysts. “We now expect it will take longer.”  McGee plans to buy back stock to help boost return on
equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests shareholder
money. Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name,
was wrong on its assumptions for economic growth and interest
rates, McGee said.  “ROE will likely remain below peers,”  Jay Gelb , an
analyst with Barclays Plc, said in a July 15 research note.
MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, and No. 2
Prudential Financial Inc. will probably report higher returns on
equity than Hartford, Gelb said.  Harford sells life insurance and property-casualty
coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
