South Africa  is investigating the
alleged dumping of frozen whole chickens and boneless cuts from
Brazil, said Thembinkosi Gamlashe, spokesman for the country’s
International Trade Administration Commission.  The commission found “prima facie proof of injurious
dumping,” Gamlashe said in an e-mail today. The investigation
started in June and should be completed in nine to 12 months, he
said.  Brazilian chicken exports to South Africa totaled $92
million in the first five months of the year, according to
Ubabef, the South American country’s poultry industry
association. The body has denied the allegation of selling
chicken at below-market prices.  South Africa is expected to import 245,000 metric tons of
chicken this year, according to data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . The country’s overall chicken consumption is
expected to reach 1.53 million tons.  South Africans  will eat on average 31.2 kilograms of
chicken per person this year, up 1.3 percent from 2010,
according to the USDA.  The allegation first emerged three years ago, initially
aimed at all poultry exports from Brazil, and is now focused on
some supplies, Ubabef President Francisco Turra said in a
statement on June 28. The body is confident the claims of
dumping will be proved untrue, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
