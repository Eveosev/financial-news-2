Crude oil wiped out all of its gains
for 2011 and natural gas closed below $4 for the first time
since March in  New York  as concern the global economy is
weakening sent raw materials prices tumbling around the world.  Twenty-one of the 24 commodities on the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index declined slipped as a rout in equities drove the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its worst nine-day slump since
March 2009. Silver dropped 5.6 percent, gold retreated from a
record and wheat slumped the most since June.  “There’s a lot of pessimistic news on the macro-economic
front and that’s hitting commodities,” said  Michael Wittner ,
the head of oil-market research at Societe Generale SA in New
York and the fourth-most-accurate forecaster for West Texas
Intermediate oil among 26 analysts ranked by Bloomberg in the
past eight quarters. “If the economy continues to slow, demand
for oil will take a hit.”  U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the lowest
level in more than two months, paced by growing dissatisfaction
among women and high earners, a report today showed. The
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was minus 47.6 in the period to
July 31, the lowest level since May, compared with minus 46.8
the prior week.  Consumer spending  dropped in June for the first time in
almost two years as savings climbed, Commerce Department figures
showed earlier this week. The  U.S. economy  grew less than
forecast in the second quarter after almost stalling at the
start of the year, another report from the agency showed.  Commodity Slump  The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell 4 percent to
644.95, the lowest level since June 27. The index is up 2.1
percent this year after being as much as 20 percent higher on
April 11.  Crude oil for September delivery declined $5.30, or 5.8
percent, to $86.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the lowest settlement since Feb. 18. Brent for September
settlement fell $6.25, or 5.5 percent, to end the session
$107.25 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “There’s a growing realization that we may be facing a
double dip or at least very anemic growth,” said  Chip Hodge ,
who oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as
senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .
“Until the economy shows signs of life, there’s nothing to turn
this around.”  Stocks Fall  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 4.8 percent to
1,200.07 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 4.3
percent to 11,383.68.  The euro weakened 1.6 percent to $1.4092 from $1.4323
yesterday. A stronger U.S. currency reduces the appeal of
dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.  “Fear and panic are good words to describe what we’re
seeing today,” said  Chris Barber , a senior analyst at Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “Anytime
markets move this hard there’s been a change in sentiment.”  Copper fell $182, or 1.9 percent, to $9,353 a metric ton on
the London Metal Exchange, bringing the drop this year to 2.6
percent. Aluminum fell 1.7 percent to $2,482 a ton, the seventh
consecutive decline and the longest losing streak since January
2009.  “Sentiment has taken its turn for the worse at the
moment,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
London. “The markets are very worried about what the
implications of fiscal austerity mean for the trajectory of
economic growth, and therefore for metals demand.”  Silver Slides  Silver futures for September delivery fell $2.327, or 5.6
percent, to $39.431 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest drop since May 11.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $7.30, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1,659 on the Comex. Earlier, the price
climbed as much as 1.1 percent and slid 1.4 percent. The metal
reached an all-time high for the third straight day.  Palladium futures for September delivery tumbled $42.15, or
5.3 percent, to $752.95 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and platinum futures for October delivery fell $55.60,
or 3.1 percent, to $1,729.40 an ounce. Both metals are used in
catalysts to remove exhausts in automobiles, and are more
dependent on economic growth than gold.  Agriculture was the second-worst sector today after energy.
Wheat fell 3.3 percent to $7.255 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Soybeans declined 2 percent to $13.4525 a bushel and
corn dropped 1.6 percent to $7.015 a bushel.  “The world economy is struggling, and that is slowing
demand,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
