LinkedIn Corp. shares fell as much as
9.4 percent after analysts at Morgan Stanley and Evercore
Partners Inc. lowered their ratings on the stock, citing concern
the professional-networking company is overvalued.  Morgan Stanley and Evercore said the stock is expensive
even after the company reported an unexpected second-quarter
profit and said revenue soared as business customers spent more
on hiring services. The stock has more than doubled since the
company’s initial public offering in May.  “Results were strong but not strong enough to justify
maintaining our ‘equal-weight’ rating,” Ken Sena, an analyst at
Evercore in  New York , said in a research note. He dropped the
stock to “underweight” and maintained a $70 price target.
“LinkedIn is the most expensive name in our coverage
universe.”  Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Devitt reduced his rating to
“equal-weight” from “overweight,” becoming the second
analyst from a LinkedIn underwriter to lower ratings on the
company. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which also helped
manage the IPO, cut their rating to “neutral” from
“overweight” in July.  LinkedIn fell as much as $9, before regaining some of the
earlier losses. It was down $4.20, or 4.4 percent, to $91.32 at
11:02 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  LinkedIn said profit before certain costs was $10.8
million, or 10 cents a share. That compared with an average
analyst estimate for a loss of 1 cent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn’s third-quarter sales forecast
also exceeded projections.  Soaring Revenue  LinkedIn, which in May became the first U.S. social network
to hold an IPO, has hired sales staff and added features to
attract recruiters and professionals. The  Mountain View ,
California-based company, which has 115.8 million members, gets
revenue from advertising, subscriptions for premium services and
by offering recruiting tools to corporations.  Second-quarter revenue soared to $121 million, LinkedIn
said. Sales from hiring services almost tripled to $58.6
million. Advertising revenue more than doubled to $38.6 million,
and sales from premium subscriptions increased 60 percent to
$23.9 million.  In last year’s second quarter, the company had profit
before some costs of $6.44 million, or 7 cents a share. Net
income in the recent period was $4.51 million, or 4 cents,
LinkedIn said.  Third-quarter revenue will be $121 million to $125 million,
the company said. Analysts had projected $113.9 million,
according to Bloomberg data.  Looking for Work  Stocks have fallen this week amid concerns about a slowing
economy. LinkedIn Chief Financial Officer Steven Sordello said a
slump could hurt LinkedIn’s growth, though people looking to
their connections to find work would continue to be drawn to the
site.  “When there’s a lot of dislocation in the marketplace,
people turn to solutions like LinkedIn where they leverage their
networks to get the help they need,” he said on a conference
call with analysts yesterday.  Brian Pitz, an analyst at UBS in New York, said signs of a
weakening economy may make investors reluctant to hold shares of
LinkedIn.  “Guys are afraid in this environment to have anything that
has a high multiple on it,” said Pitz, who has a $115 price
target and recommends investors buy LinkedIn shares. “People
are taking risk off the table.”  LinkedIn plans to increase spending on marketing and
product development in the second half, Sordello said.  “2011 remains an investment year,” he said. “We plan to
take a long-term perspective and invest aggressively in product
engineering and infrastructure.”  IPO Boost  Bolstered by publicity from its IPO, LinkedIn passed
MySpace in June to become the second-largest social network in
the U.S., with 33.9 million visitors, up 63 percent from a year
earlier, according to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc.
LinkedIn members can post their profiles on the site for free
and use it to find jobs, while companies pay to give their
recruiters more information about potential hires.  LinkedIn got 68 percent of its second-quarter revenue from
business services and premium subscriptions, and 32 percent came
from advertising and marketing on its site.  LinkedIn’s IPO helped usher in a wave of technology
offerings, the most since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000,
according to Bloomberg data. LinkedIn raised $352.8 million in
its IPO, selling 7.84 million shares at $45 apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
