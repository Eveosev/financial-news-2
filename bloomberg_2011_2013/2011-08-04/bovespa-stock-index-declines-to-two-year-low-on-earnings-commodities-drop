Brazil’s benchmark stock index posted
the biggest drop since November 2008, paced by declines in
commodities producers, on disappointing earnings and growing
concern the global economy is weakening.  The Bovespa tumbled 5.7 percent to 52,833.69 at 4:15 p.m.
 New York  time, the worst performance among the world’s 20
biggest equity markets. Billionaire Eike Batista’s mining
company MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA sank 16 percent while
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled  oil company , fell
to its lowest level since December 2008. Steelmaker Gerdau SA
slid the most since January 2009 after reporting earnings that
missed estimates. The real tumbled against the dollar and
benchmark bond yields rose.  “People are running for the hills in a way I haven’t seen
in a long time,” said Greg Lesko, who helps oversee $800
million at Deltec Asset Management in New York. “It’s across
the board selling -- a giant, get-me-out-of-everything-I-own
trade.”  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  on July 27 after falling
20 percent from its November 2010 bull-market peak. Today’s
tumble extended that decline to 28 percent. Brazilian stocks
have dropped as inflation reached the fastest pace since 2005
even after the central bank lifted interest rates eight times in
15 months.  “The domestic picture is very worrying,” said Eduardo Roche, who helps manage 3 billion reais ($1.9 billion) at Banco
Modal SA in Rio de Janeiro. “The market could get even worse.”  MMX, Petrobras  MMX slipped 1.17 reais to 6.11 as the Bloomberg Base Metals
3-Month Price Commodity Index declined 1.7 percent. Oil producer
Petrobras slumped 7.4 percent to 20.65 reais, following a drop
of 6 percent in the price of crude.  Gerdau SA,  Latin America ’s largest steelmaker, lost 7.4
percent to 12.20 reais. Net income dropped 36 percent to 469
million reais, or 28 centavos a share, as costs rose faster than
revenue, the company said today in a statement. Gerdau was
expected to post per-share profit of 35 centavos on an adjusted
basis, the average of six estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Companies from Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, to Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Latin America’s biggest
bank by market value, have reported second-quarter earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates. Itau’s profit was eroded after the
company set aside more cash to cover a rise in bad loans.  Earnings  Lojas Americanas SA,  Brazil ’s second-largest retailer by
market value, will report earnings today after markets close.
Banco do Brasil SA, Latin America’s biggest bank by assets,
exchange operator BM&FBovespa SA and brewer Cia. de Bebidas das
Americas are scheduled to report next week.  Lojas Americanas will see second-quarter profit rise 32
percent from a year earlier to 37.9 million reais, according to
the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.
That would represent a slowdown from the fourfold annual
increase in the same period in 2010.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Brazilian dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  widened by 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 190, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBIG index. The real weakened 1.7 percent to 1.5869 per dollar.  Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts
fell after central bank President Alexandre Tombini said
“moderating growth” in Brazil will help slow annual inflation
in 2011. The yield on the contract due in January 2013 plunged
18 basis points to 12.33 percent, set for the steepest drop
since August 2010.  Latin American Losses  Argentina ’s Merval index plunged 6 percent, the largest
decline among 91 equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg.
Argentina’s $54.9 billion market capitalization is about 3.9
percent of Brazil’s $1.39 trillion, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The Bovespa was the second-worst performer of the day,
followed by  Peru ’s Lima General Index, which fell 5.6 percent.
Chile’s Ipsa index dropped 3.9 percent.  With today’s decline, the Bovespa trades at 8.6 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, the lowest since March 2009,
according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors end up remembering 2008, because that was the
last time we had stress like this, apart from the flash crash in
2010,” said  Felipe Casotti , who helps manage 1.2 billion reais
at Maxima Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro.  The Bovespa’s underperformance began last year. The index
rose 1 percent in 2010, its worst-ever performance relative to
MSCI Inc.’s gauge of 21 developing nations’ stocks, after
rallying 83 percent in 2009 as Brazil recovered from the global
financial crisis.  Inflation reached 6.71 percent in June, according to the
national statistics agency. The central bank has increased the
benchmark  interest rate  3.75 percentage points since April 2010
to 12.50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
