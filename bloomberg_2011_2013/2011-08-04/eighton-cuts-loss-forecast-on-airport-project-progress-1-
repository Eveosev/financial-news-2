Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s
biggest builder, cut its full-year loss forecast, citing
increased confidence that a airport infrastructure project will
be completed within the contract deadline.  The company expects an after-tax loss of about A$408
million ($438 million) for the year ended June 30, down from the
A$427 million loss forecast in April, Sydney-based Leighton said
today in a statement. It confirmed guidance for profit between
A$600 million and A$650 million this fiscal year.  Leighton, 54 percent owned by Germany’s  Hochtief AG (HOT) , has
suffered delays and cost overruns while building the Brisbane
Airport Link road and a desalination plant in Victoria state,
prompting Chief Executive Officer  David Stewart  to flag changes
to bidding procedures and possible asset sales. The Airport Link
project is expected to be completed by the contractual date of
June 30, 2012, Leighton said today.  “Airport Link is showing good progress with the gross loss
reduced from A$730 million to A$520 million as a result of no
longer needing to provide for liquidated damages and time-
related costs,” Stewart said in the statement.  The Victorian project continues to be affected by weather
and industrial issues, he said. “These and other factors have
contributed to a further forecast deterioration of A$278 million,
which is being recognized in the 2010-11 result.”  The company fell 0.4 percent to A$20 at the 4:10 p.m. close
of trading in Sydney. Leighton is scheduled to report earnings
on Aug. 15.  David Saxelby, managing director of Leighton’s Thiess Pty
Ltd. unit, will leave the company this year, the statement said.
Bruce Munro will be acting managing director, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
