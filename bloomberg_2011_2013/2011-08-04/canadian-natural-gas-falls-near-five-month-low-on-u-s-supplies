Canadian natural gas fell to its
lowest price in almost five months as the U.S. reported a
higher-than-expected increase in last week’s inventories.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , fell 1 percent
after the U.S. Energy Department said gas stockpiles increased
44 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 29 to 2.758
trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
before the report showed an expected gain of 38 billion.  “The market is going to continue to have weather in its
eyes, but that storage report is obviously playing bearishness
to the market in the drop we’ve seen today,” Eric Bickel, an
analyst at Summit Energy Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky,
said in a telephone interview.  Alberta gas for September delivery declined 3.25 cents to
C$3.28 per gigajoule ($3.19 per million British thermal units)
as of 1:10 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. It was the  lowest price  for prompt delivery
since March 13. October gas fell 4.25 cents to C$3.305. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 15 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $3.94 per million Btu on the Nymex after dropping to
$3.915, the lowest price since March 16.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Gas Flows  The high in Dallas today may reach 108 degrees (42
Celsius), 11 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania. The  National Weather Service  has an
excessive heat warning in effect for the area until tomorrow
night.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.3 billion cubic
feet as of noon in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.64 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.06 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.05 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.71 billion cubic feet today, about 62
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 5.19 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.2843 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 0.42 cent to $3.9399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
