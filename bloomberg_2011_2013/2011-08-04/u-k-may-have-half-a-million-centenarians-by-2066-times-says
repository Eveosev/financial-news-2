Britainâ€™s rising life expectancy
means there are likely be 80,000 centenarians by 2033 and more
than half a million by 2066, the London-based Times reported,
citing an analysis by the  Office for National Statistics .  That means the state will face potentially crippling health
and welfare costs, the newspaper said.  Only 0.6 percent of people born in 1911 have reached 100,
while babies born this year have a 30 percent chance of living
to 2111, because of better medical treatment, housing and  living
standards , the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
