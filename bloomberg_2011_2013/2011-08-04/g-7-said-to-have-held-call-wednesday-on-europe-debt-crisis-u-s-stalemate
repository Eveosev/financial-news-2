Finance officials from Group of Seven
nations held a conference call yesterday to discuss the European
sovereign debt crisis and the U.S. political stalemate over
raising the borrowing ceiling, according to a G-7 official.  The calls were between senior officials rather than finance
ministers, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. No ministerial meeting is planned, the official said.  Japan  followed Switzerland today in seeking to stem
appreciating exchange rates that threatened to damage export
competitiveness by selling yen and pledging to inject 10
trillion yen ($126 billion) into the economy.  The action reflected concern that the U.S. will return to
recession, triggering a further round of asset purchases by the
 Federal Reserve , as well as over the widening in  Europe â€™s debt
crisis following a sell-off in Spanish and Italian bonds this
week.  The concerns have prompted investors to seek havens in the
currencies of Japan and Switzerland, which both enjoy current-
account surpluses, and those of emerging markets with faster
growth rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
