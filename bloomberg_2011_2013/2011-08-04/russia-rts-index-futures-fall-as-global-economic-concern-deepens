Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures fell
for a fourth straight day as yields on Spanish and Italian bonds
surged to records and crude wiped out this year’s gains,
intensifying concern that the global economy is weakening.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September declined 2.1 percent to 179,590 yesterday.  Contracts on OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer,
fell 1.6 percent and those on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-
biggest oil producer, dropped 1.8 percent. Futures on OAO
Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, retreated 2.7
percent.  Spain sold 3.31 billion euros ($4.7 billion) of bonds at
higher  interest rates  after the yield on the country’s 10-year
bond approached the 7 percent mark that heralded the bailouts of
 Greece , Portugal and Ireland. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds
rose 11 basis points to 6.19 percent.  “Russia is entirely hostage to external factors,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in
London, wrote in e-mailed comments. “The only thing which can
arrest the decline would be some form of concerted -- and
simultaneous -- central bank policy response. The perceived
lethargy and lack of unanimity is extremely damaging.”  Crude for September delivery plunged 5.8 percent to $86.63
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , erasing gains for
2011. The euro weakened 1.6 percent against the dollar, falling
to 1.4096 at 4:30 p.m. in  New York .  U.S. stocks plunged as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
4.8 percent, its biggest decline since February 2009. The 30-
stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 2.1 percent to 1,620.68 in Moscow
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
