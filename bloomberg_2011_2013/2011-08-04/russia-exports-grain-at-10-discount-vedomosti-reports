Russia exports grain as much as $30
per ton cheaper than the market price, Vedomosti reported,
 citing  Grain Union President Arkady Zlochevsky.  Russian grain exporters agreed on a 10 percent discount to
win back their market position after an export ban was lifted
last month, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Yuliya Fedorinova in
