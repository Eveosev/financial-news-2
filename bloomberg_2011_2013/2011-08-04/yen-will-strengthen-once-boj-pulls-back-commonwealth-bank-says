Richard Grace , chief currency
strategist and head of international economics in Sydney at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, comments on the dollar and yen
after  Japan  intervened to stem gains in its currency.  The Swiss National Bank yesterday lowered its target for
the three-month London interbank offered rate to “as close to
zero as possible,” from 0.25 percent.  Japan’s intervention “may be successful for a short period
of time but I don’t think it will be successful over a long
period.”  “As soon as they pull back from the market, we’ll probably
see dollar-yen go back down again.”  “Defending a particular level is probably an easier task
and we’re not sure where that level is, it may be something
close to 79 or a band between 77 and 79” yen per dollar.  On other central bank action:  “We’re seeing the policy responses from the central banks
whose currencies have strengthened the most against the  U.S.
dollar  over the last 12 months, and they’ve got more reason to
intervene.”  “I don’t think the  Reserve Bank  of Australia would go down
that road, you’re more likely to see it from New Zealand’s
central bank, but I don’t think they’re at that point yet.”  “I don’t think you’re going to see it either from the
 European Central Bank  or the Bank of England. With the Bank of
Canada, I don’t think so, but the risk is a little higher.”  “It would be very unusual for the RBA to intervene when
they’ve got an inflation problem on their hands. Why would they
want a weaker currency?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
