China ’s stocks rose for the first
time in three days on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may
consider another program to stimulate the world’s biggest
economy to prevent a recession.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. led gains for cement companies after
the government said combined profit at domestic makers of the
building material more than doubled in the first five months.
 Xi’An Aircraft International Corp. (000768)  climbed 2.9 percent after
Shanghai Securities News reported the government will make
aircraft manufacturing one of the nation’s strategic industries.  “A new round of quantitative easing would provide a short-
term boost to asset classes such as the commodity markets, and
the underlying stocks would benefit as well,” said  Wang Zheng ,
Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co., which manages about $120 million.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, climbed 5.56 points, or 0.2 percent, to
2,684.04 at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.2 percent
to 2,960.31.  The Shanghai measure trades at 12.3 times estimated
earnings, approaching the lowest since October 2008, when it was
at 12.2. The gauge slumped 12 percent from this year’s high on
April 18 on concern that growth in the world’s second-biggest
economy is slowing as the government implemented measures to
stem inflation. The central bank has raised rates five times and
ordered lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves 12
times since the start of 2010 to contain price rises, which
quickened to the fastest pace in three years in June.  Cement Stocks  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, rose 2.6 percent
to 26.19 yuan. Huaxin Cement Co., the Chinese affiliate of
Holcim Ltd., jumped 6.3 percent to 27.69 yuan. Jiangxi
Wannianqing Cement Co. gained 2.4 percent to 18.82 yuan.  China’s cement makers had a combined profit of 35.2 billion
yuan ($5.47 billion) in the first five months, the Ministry of
Industry and  Information Technology  said in a statement
yesterday. The average cement price rose by 57.24 yuan a ton in
June from a year earlier, the statement said.  Chinese listed companies’ gross profit margins may rebound
in the third quarter, bolstering earnings, Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co. said today. Companies’ net income is expected to
rise more than 20 percent this year, the brokerage said.  Shenyin recommended buying so-called cyclical stocks such
as auto and cement makers that that are most tied to economic
growth, because of low valuations, analysts led by Ling Peng
wrote in a report today. The Shanghai Composite Index may gain
500 points in the second half, the analysts wrote.  QE3  In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.5
percent yesterday, snapping a seven-day decline, after the Wall
Street Journal reported that three former top officials at the
Fed said the central bank should consider a new round of
securities purchases to bolster economic growth.  The Fed finished its second round of so-called quantitative
easing, nicknamed “QE2” by investors, at the end of June. The
program helped propel a rally of as much as 28 percent in the
 S&P 500  since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  foreshadowed the plan
on Aug. 27.  QE3 would have a “significant impact” on  China’s economy ,
pushing up inflation, Yu Bin, director of the macroeconomic
research department of the State Council’s Development Research
Center, said on July 14 in Beijing.  Monetary Tools  China should continue to use price tools,  reserve
requirements , open-market operations and a more flexible yuan to
manage inflation, the Financial News said in a front-page
commentary today. The Financial News is published by the
People’s Bank of China.  Xi’an Aircraft International climbed 2.9 percent to 11.51
yuan.  Xi’ An Aero-Engine Plc (600893)  rose 1.4 percent to 17.30 yuan.
Hafei Aviation Industry Co. jumped 2.8 percent to 25.92 yuan.  China will set up a development fund for the nation’s civil
aircraft industry, Shanghai Securities News reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
