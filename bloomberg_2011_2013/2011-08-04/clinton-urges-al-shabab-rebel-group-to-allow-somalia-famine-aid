U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  reaffirmed the U.S will make a decision on a proposed $7
billion oil pipeline for TransCanada Corp. by the end of the
year.  The Republican-led U.S. House passed a bill last week
setting Nov. 1 as the deadline for a decision. The U.S. Senate
may not consider the measure.  Calgary-based TransCanada wants to build the so-called
Keystone XL pipeline to deliver 700,000 barrels of crude oil a
day from Alberta’s oil sands to refineries in the  Gulf of
Mexico . The pipeline would cross through Montana,  South Dakota ,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  The State Department has jurisdiction over the project
because it crosses an international border. Environmental groups
have urged Clinton to reject the pipeline, citing the potential
for increased greenhouse gases and threats to drinking water
supplies. The project has been awaiting approval since 2008.  “The safety of the pipeline is one of our highest
priorities,” Clinton said in a joint appearance at the State
Department today with Canadian Foreign Minister  John Baird .  She said the final environmental impact statement on the
pipeline will be issued this month, with public hearings set to
be held in September.  ----With assistance from Jim Efstathiou Jr. in Washington.
