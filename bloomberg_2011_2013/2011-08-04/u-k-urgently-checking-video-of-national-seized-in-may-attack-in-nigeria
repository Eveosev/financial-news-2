The U.K. is “urgently checking” if
a video that appears to show a British national and an Italian
colleague abducted in northern  Nigeria  in May is authentic, its
High Commission in Abuja said.  The French  news agency ,  Agence France-Presse , said
yesterday it received a video claiming that the hostages were
kidnapped by al-Qaeda.  “We are in close contact with the Nigerian and Italian
authorities and the company” employing them, the High
Commission said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Nigerian police is “aware of the video of the two
people that were kidnapped here,” Kebbi state Police
Commissioner Lateef Junaid said today by phone from the state
capital, Birnin Kebbi. “I can’t give you any specifics now on
what we’re doing about it.”  Nigerian authorities have blamed a militant Islamic sect,
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for an upsurge in violent attacks in the mainly Muslim
north in the past two years.  Africa’s most populous country of more than 150 million
people and top oil producer is roughly split between a mainly
Christian south and a predominantly Muslim north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
