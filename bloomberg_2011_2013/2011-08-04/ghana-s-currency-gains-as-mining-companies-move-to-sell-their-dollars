Ghana ’s cedi gained against the
dollar as mining companies sold the U.S. currency to finance
their operations in Africa’s second-biggest gold producer.  The cedi strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5051 per
dollar and traded at 1.5170 by 2:16 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Mining companies sold most dollars today,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank
Plc said in an e-mailed note. “Corporate demand for dollars
also slowed.”  Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Newmont
Mining Corp. of  Greenwood Village , Colorado, have mines in
Ghana, which follows South Africa in output of the metal on the
continent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
