European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said while policy makers were not unanimous on
resuming bond purchases at today’s meeting, they should speak
“with one voice when the decision is taken.”  “We had an overwhelming majority for continuing” the bond
purchase program “which had never been interrupted,” Trichet
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in  Frankfurt 
today after the central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at
1.5 percent. Any “decision can be taken by majority as
everywhere else in the world.”  The ECB, which ceased buying the bonds of distressed euro-
area governments 18 weeks ago, was under pressure to re-enter
markets after Italian and Spanish yields soared to euro-era
records. Investors are growing increasingly concerned that
larger nations will follow Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  in
seeking bailouts as the fiscal crisis spreads across the region.  Trichet also said that today’s decisions to keep borrowing
costs on hold and lend euro-area banks as much money as they
need for six months while extending existing liquidity measures
through the end of the year, were “unanimous.”  “We took decisions which we trust were commensurate with
the observations on markets or segments of the markets,” he
said. “We clearly make the distinction between the standard
measures, which are designed to deliver  price stability  in the
medium term,” and non-standard measures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
