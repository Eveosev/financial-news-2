Laszlo Birinyi, one of the first
investors to recommend buying stocks when the bull market began
in March 2009, said he remains optimistic about U.S. equities
even after the biggest nine-day slump since March 2009.  “Our view continues that we’re in a long-term bull market,
and in long-term bull markets you have downdrafts,” he said in
a Bloomberg Radio interview today. “Everything that we’ve built
our bullish case on continues to exist.”  The  S&P 500 ’s decline from its 2011 high met the definition
of a market correction today, as it fell more than 10 percent
from the April 29 peak on concern that the economy is weakening.
Birinyi, who told investors to buy stocks when the U.S. equity
benchmark was reaching a 12-year low in 2009, reiterated his
bullish stance earlier this week when the S&P 500 wiped out its
gains for 2011.  “You just have to have a little bit of faith in the
market,” he said. “The market has this ability to look ahead,
to look beyond the short term.”  Birinyi advised investors buy stocks with “strong”
earnings and cash flow, including  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)  and  Polo
Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) , which he has recommended throughout the
year. Those stocks are up 22 percent and 9.4 percent
respectively in 2011, compared with the S&P 500’s 3.7 percent
slump. The rally, which has lifted the index 79 percent from the
2009 low, should last until 2013, based upon the length of prior
advances, Birinyi Associates Inc. data show.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities has dropped eight of
the past nine days, including today’s 4 percent decline, its
worst one-day drop since May 20, 2010, Bloomberg data show.
Traxis Partners LP’s  Barton Biggs  said that while the retreat
offers “all kinds of buying opportunities,” including Apple
Inc.,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he’s not ready
to make more purchases.  “After getting banged in the face yesterday, I’m not too
inclined to step in there again yet,” Biggs, managing partner
and co-founder of Traxis, said in an interview today with
Bloomberg Television.  The S&P 500 average correction is 13 percent, Birinyi said
today, citing his Westport, Connecticut-based firm’s research on
bull markets back to 1962. While the drop this week surprised
him, he said the decline in “marginal stocks” hasn’t concerned
him. Should companies such as Priceline,  Chipotle Mexican Grill
Inc. (CMG)  and Google start to fall, Birinyi said he would reevaluate.  “If really the strength in the market starts to falter,
that would trouble me greatly,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
