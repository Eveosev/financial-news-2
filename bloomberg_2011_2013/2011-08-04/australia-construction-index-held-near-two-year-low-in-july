Australia ’s building industry shrank
in July for a 14th consecutive month as consumer caution and
concern about higher borrowing costs weighed on house
construction, a private survey showed.  The construction performance index was 36.1 from 35.8 in
June, which was the lowest level since March 2009, according to
a survey by the Australian Industry Group and the Housing
Industry Association released in Sydney today. A reading below
50 indicates the industry is contracting.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens held the
benchmark interest rate at 4.75 percent this week, after
boosting it seven times from October 2009 to November. A report
in June showed Australia’s household savings rate rose to 11.5
percent in the first quarter, the highest level since 2009, as
consumers exhibit greater restraint.  “Consumer caution and the fear of further  interest-rate 
rises are dampening activity in residential construction,” said
Peter Burn, director of public policy at the Australian Industry
Group. “The commercial construction sub-sector is suffering as
low levels of private sector activity are not making up for the
withdrawal of government-backed projects. The decline in new
orders gives little reason for the industry to think that a
turnaround is in the wings.”  The government has been scaling back fiscal stimulus
measures, and Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in May it will end 23
years of spending growth to help return to a  budget surplus .  A gauge of housing dropped 5.6 points to 28.5 last month
and new orders slid 0.6 points to 31.6, the report showed.
Engineering work dropped 0.4 point to 38.8 while commercial work
rose 3.9 points to 37.4, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
