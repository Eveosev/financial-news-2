Jefferson County,  Alabama ,
commissioners hadn’t made a counteroffer to creditors as of last
night ahead of a planned vote today on whether to accept a
proposed deal or to declare the largest municipal bankruptcy in
U.S. history, according to local officials.  That may delay the vote, although commissioners said
anything may happen when they convene at 2 p.m. New York time.
The vote was pushed back to today at a commission meeting last
week to provide more time for negotiations.  “We don’t know what we’re going to do,” Commissioner Joe
Knight said late yesterday in a telephone interview. “We’re
going to go into executive session and we’re going to get
updated by our lawyers and go from there.”  The private meeting will let commissioners discuss whether
to seek court protection from creditors holding $3.1 billion in
sewer debt, to take an offer to reduce that debt by about $1
billion or to make a counteroffer.  Several county officials, including Knight, have said the
creditors’ last offer would force sewer rates too high for too
long, and may block needed growth in service.  Commissioners had previously proposed raising rates 7.8
percent annually for three years, followed by 3 percent
increases in two more to help make payments.  Creditors wanted 8 percent rate increases for five years,
Commissioner Sandra Little Brown said last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
