The  African Development Bank  has
approved $200 million of projects in  Kenya , and plans to upgrade
its office in east  Africa ’s biggest economy to cover other
regional countries.  The funds will be spent between 2011 and 2013 on four
projects that are currently being evaluated, Walter Odera, the
bank’s economist for Kenya, said in an interview yesterday in
the capital, Nairobi. They include a power transmission system
in Nairobi, a geothermal power project in Menengai, a road
linking Voi and Taveta in southern Kenya to neighboring
 Tanzania , and another one linking Mombasa and Nairobi to Addis-
Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, Odera said.  “ Ongoing projects  are worth about $600 million,” he said.
In the first quarter of next year the Kenyan office will be
upgraded to cover  Uganda , Tanzania,  Rwanda , Burundi, Ethiopia
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.  The AfDB, as the lender is known, is one of seven that on
Aug. 2 signed a $164 million loan accord to finance an upgrade
of the Kenya-Uganda railway operated by Rift Valley Railways
Ltd.  The loan, to which the AfDB contributed $40 million, may
help boost capacity almost four-fold, according to  Citadel
Capital SAE , which controls 51 percent of the rail operator.
It’s part of a planned $287 million investment in the railway
over the next five years, Citadel Chairman Ahmed Heikal said on
Aug. 1 in an interview in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
