A global rout in stock markets today
won’t affect  Brazil ’s ability to manage its public debt, Deputy
Treasury Secretary  Paulo Valle  said.  “Brazil is doing well,” he said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia. “We have already financed more than 80 percent
of our debt this year and in the coming months will have little
maturing.”  The Bovespa tumbled 5.7 percent today, the worst performing
among the world’s 20 biggest equity markets, paced by declines
in commodity producers, hurt by dissapointing earnings and
concern the global economy is weakening.  The Treasury and central bank will change rules for selling
public debt from Aug. 9, including the time of weekly auctions
and incentives for dealers to use electronic trading systems,
Valle said. Demand for notes should rise as the changes will add
liquidity to secondary and primary markets in the country, he
said.  “We listened to dealers and improved the system to make it
more efficient,” Valle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
