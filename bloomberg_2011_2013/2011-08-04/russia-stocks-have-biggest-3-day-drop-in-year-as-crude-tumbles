Russian stocks had their biggest
three-day drop in more than a year as oil slumped to $90 a
barrel on concern the economic recovery is faltering in the U.S.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks slipped 2.1 percent to
1,620.68 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, taking its three-day
loss to 6.1 percent, the worst since July 2010. Oil producers
OAO Gazprom Neft and OAO Rosneft declined 3.1 percent and 2.3
percent, respectively. OAO Severstal,  Russia ’s largest
steelmaker, plunged 5 percent, while OAO Gazprom, the natural-
gas export monopoly, fell 3 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index fell 2.4 percent to 1,855.69.  Crude for September delivery was at $90.32 a barrel in  New
York , at the close of equities trading in Moscow and down $1.72
from the same time yesterday. A U.S. government report today
showed limited improvement in the labor market.  “The is getting pretty nasty,” Peter Westin, chief
strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow, said by phone from Moscow.
“The economic news from the U.S. has been absolutely abysmal
now over the last few weeks and the political turmoil in America
and  Europe  has been destructive too.”  President  Barack Obama  signed a bill Aug. 1 that averted a
debt default in the world’s largest economy with one day to
spare. In Europe, officials are trying to put a firewall around
Italy and  Spain , where bond yields have surged to euro-era
records on concern that they will have to follow Greece, Ireland
and  Portugal  in seeking bailouts.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s largest miner, slumped 1.5
percent to 7,140 rubles.  Copper futures for September delivery declined 6.3 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $4.263 a pound at 10:34 a.m. the Comex in New
York. All metals listed on the London Metals Exchange retreated,
led by tin and nickel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
