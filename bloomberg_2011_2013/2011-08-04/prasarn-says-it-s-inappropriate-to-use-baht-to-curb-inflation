Prasarn Trairatvorakul, the Bank of
 Thailand ’s governor, comments on the economy. He made the
remarks at a seminar in Bangkok late yesterday.  “It may be inappropriate for Thailand to use its foreign-
exchange rate policy to curb inflation because Thailand has a
low import content. We are different from  Singapore  as they have
high import content and can effectively use this method.”  According to a central bank study, every one percentage
point increase appreciation of the baht will slow inflation by
0.15 percentage point.  “Inflation risks come in all directions - demand, supply
and also inflation expectation.  ‘‘From our study, inflation has more impact on producers
than consumers. This is partly because producers can’t pass on
their rising raw material costs to consumers that much. If the
economy grows well, consumers will have more demand and
producers can raise the prices more.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
