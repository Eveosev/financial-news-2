Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) ,
 Italy ’s third-largest insurer, said first-half profit rose on
higher premiums in the non-life segment.  Net income increased to 50.5 million euros ($72 million)
from 2.8 million euros a year earlier, the Bologna, Italy-based
insurer said today in a stock-exchange statement. That compares
with the 58 million-euro average estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Carlo Cimbri is cutting costs and
selling high-margins products to boost profitability. The
insurer’s results were affected by the increase of a regional
tax, known as IRAP, from 3.9 percent to 5.9 percent, and by 8
million euros of losses on Greek debt holdings.  “Industrial insurance management was in line with the
objectives of the business plan,” the company said in the
statement. Unipol expects that the IRAP tax increase will reduce
profit by 25 million euros in 2011 and 2012. That will cut net
income expected in 2012 from 250 million euros to 225 million
euros.  Non-life premiums climbed 6 percent to 2.2 billion euros,
while life premiums were unchanged at 915 million euros. The
combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage of
premiums, decreased to 99 percent in the first half from 103.5
percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
