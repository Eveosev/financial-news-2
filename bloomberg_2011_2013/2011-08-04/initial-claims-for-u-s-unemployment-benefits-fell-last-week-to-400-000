Initial claims for unemployment
insurance payments in the U.S. fell last week to a level that
shows limited improvement in the labor market.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 1,000 in the
week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest in almost four months,
the Labor Department said today in  Washington . Economists
forecast 405,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The four-week average also declined to
the lowest level since April.  A further reduction in the pace of dismissals may be needed
before companies gain the confidence to step up hiring, which
has slowed in the past three months. Employers added 85,000
workers in July, economists project a Labor Department report to
show tomorrow, failing to reduce a jobless rate that’s holding
above 9 percent.  “Claims are moving in the right direction, which is a sign
things probably aren’t getting worse in the labor market,” said
 Drew Matus , a senior U.S. economist at UBS Securities LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , who correctly forecast the level of
claims. “There’s still  job creation  going on but it’s just not
at a rate that’s going to make people feel more comfortable
about the economic outlook.”  The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls rose,
while those getting extended payments fell, today’s figures
showed.  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 388,000 to
425,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 47 economists. The Labor
Department initially reported the prior week’s applications at
398,000.  Stock-Index Futures  Stock-index futures maintained losses after the figures.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September declined 1.4 percent to 1,237.1 at 8:45 a.m. in  New
York . Treasuries rose, pushing down the yield on the benchmark
10-year note to 2.56 percent from 2.62 percent late yesterday.  The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure of
initial claims, dropped to 407,750 from 414,500. The average has
declined for five straight weeks.  A Labor Department official today said there were no
special factors that had an impact on the figures released
today. He said there was no indication last week’s data
reflected a partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation
Administration.  The agency had to furlough workers because Congress failed
to approve short-term funding for the agency. Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood said the inability to resolve the deadlock
over spending authorization for the  Federal Aviation
Administration  has idled about 70,000 construction workers and
4,000 agency employees.  Continuing Claims  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
rose by 10,000 in the week ended July 23 to 3.73 million.
Economist forecast the number would increase to 3.7 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
42,000 to 3.72 million in the week ended July 16.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3 percent in the
week ended July 23, today’s report showed. Forty-eight states
and territories reported a decrease in claims, while five had an
increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Risk to Spending  Sluggish job growth raises the risk  consumer spending ,
which makes up 70 percent of the economy, will struggle to
accelerate in the last half of 2011.  The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the April-June
period following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was slower than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recession ended.  The projected increase in July payrolls trails the 126,000
average so far this year. Announced job cuts have increased
recently with companies including  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Boston
Scientific Corp. (BSX)  and Merck & Co. announcing they’re paring their
workforces.  Cisco Cuts  Cisco, the largest networking-equipment maker, plans to
eliminate about 6,500 jobs, or 9 percent of its full-time global
workforce, to help trim $1 billion in annual costs and step up
profit growth. The company said on July 18 that affected workers
in the U.S. and  Canada  will be notified that week.  Boston Scientific, the second-largest maker of implanted
heart devices, said July 28 it will eliminate 1,200 to 1,400
jobs by the end of 2012 to trim costs and raised its full-year
profit forecast. The shares rose the most since March 10, 2009.  Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, plans to cut
12,000 to 13,000 jobs by 2015, expanding a restructuring program
to save as much as $4.6 billion a year. The  Whitehouse Station ,
New Jersey-based company will continue to hire in growth areas
such as emerging markets, spokesman David Caouette said July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
