Investec Plc (INVP) , the private bank and
wealth manager, said it’s in talks to buy British stockbroker
 Evolution Group Plc (EVG) , a purchase that would expand its  fund
management  and fixed income operations.  The all-stock offer is subject preconditions including a
unanimous recommendation from Evolution, Investec said in a
today. Evolution rose 4.4 percent to 83.25 pence at 8:49 a.m. in
London trading, for a market value of about 193.7 million pounds
($317 million).  Buying Evolution would give Investec access to its wealth
management business, Williams de Broe, whose assets increased by
7 percent to 6.2 billion pounds in the year through April.
Evolution also runs a fixed income sales and trading platform,
unlike most of its U.K. rivals, which focus on equities.  Brokers in the U.K. have sought to consolidate after the
credit crisis curbed financing for takeovers, hurting revenue
from advising on fundraisings and mergers. Panmure Gordon & Co.,
a rival stockbroker, spurned an approach from London-based
Evolution last year. The broker said last week that first-half
profit climbed 12 percent as funds under management increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
