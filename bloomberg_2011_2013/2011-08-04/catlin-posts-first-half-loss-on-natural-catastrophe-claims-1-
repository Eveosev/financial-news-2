Catlin Group Ltd. (CGL) , the third-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, swung into a loss in
the first half after record claims from natural catastrophes.  The firm had a pretax loss of $201 million in the six
months to June 30, compared with a profit of $86 million in the
year-earlier period, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based insurer said in
a statement today.  Catlin, like other Lloyd’s insurers such as  Amlin Plc (AML) , was
hurt by Japan’s biggest earthquake on record as well as
catastrophes in Australia and New Zealand. Amlin, the biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, declined by the most
since Sept. 11 terror attacks on Aug. 2 after warning earnings
would miss analyst estimates this year.  “The insurance industry’s performance for the full year
depends largely on Atlantic windstorm and other catastrophe
activity during the second half,” Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Catlin said a in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
