China ’s benchmark money-market rate
declined for a fourth day after the central bank added cash to
the banking system.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures funding
availability between lenders, declined the most in three weeks
as the People’s Bank of China pumped a net 44 billion yuan ($6.8
billion) into the economy this week, the most since the five
days ended July 1.  “In the short term, liquidity remains ample because of the
cash injection,” said  Chen Qiwei , a senior bond trader at
Shenzhen Development Bank Co. in Shanghai. “Traders are still
concerned the central bank may raise the reserve-requirement
ratio.”  The repo rate dropped 83 basis points, or 0.83 percentage
point, to 3.27 percent as of 11:30 a.m. in  Shanghai , according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That’s the biggest decline since July 15.  China has raised interest rates three times in 2011 and
bank reserve ratios six times to rein in inflation that was the
fastest in three years in June. The government may report on Aug.
9 that consumer prices rose 6.3 percent in July, compared with
6.4 percent the previous month, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The one-year interest rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell four basis
points to 4.05 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
