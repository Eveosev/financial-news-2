Zambia ’s largest opposition party,
the Patriotic Front, asked the  high court  in the capital,
Lusaka, to prevent President Rupiah Banda from contesting
elections on Sept 20, The Post reported, citing party spokesman
Wynter Kabimba.  Banda may not meet the constitutional requirement that both
parents of a presidential candidate are born in Zambia, Kabimba
said, according to the Lusaka-based newspaper today.  The Patriotic Front re-elected Michael Sata as its
president on July 5. Banda, 74, narrowly beat Sata in an
election in 2008, winning 40.1 percent of the vote to the
opposition leader’s 38.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
