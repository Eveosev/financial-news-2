Uncertainties of U.S. economic
recovery are generating “panic” in the markets,  Pedro Galdi ,
head strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said
in a telephone interview.  On risk perception:  “There’s the perception of a new recession. Investors are
coming out of risk and going to Treasuries and the dollar.”  On foreign investors:
“It’s panic. Individual investors are getting out of equities.
There have been many withdraws from funds. It’s not the foreign
investor. Those continue to invest in Brazilian stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
