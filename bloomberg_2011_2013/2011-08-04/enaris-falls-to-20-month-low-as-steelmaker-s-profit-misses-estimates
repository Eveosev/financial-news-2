Tenaris SA (TEN) , the world’s largest maker
of seamless pipes, fell to its lowest level in more than 20
months in Milan trading after its quarterly profit missed
analyst estimates.  Tenaris dropped 10 percent to 13.21 euros at 2:47 p.m. in
FTSE MIB Index trading in Milan, after earlier touching 12.92
euros, the lowest since Nov. 27, 2009.  The pipemaker’s second-quarter net income rose 1.8 percent
to $287.2 million, or 49 cents per American depositary receipt,
the Luxembourg-based company said today in a statement
distributed by Market Wire. Profit was forecast to be $340.2
million on an adjusted basis, the average of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The earnings miss was primarily driven by lower-than-
expected revenue” and reduced margins, James West, an analyst
at Barclays Capital Inc., said in a note to clients.  Quarterly sales from  North America , Tenaris’s biggest
market, rose 28 percent to $946 million from a year earlier,
while sales from  Europe  gained 56 percent to $279 million.
Revenue from the  Middle East  and Africa dropped 19 percent.  Tenaris expects activity in the Middle East to increase in
the second half of the year and continuing strong sales in North
America, the company said in its statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
