Global equities are the cheapest on
record relative to gold, bolstering the case for investors to
buy stocks and sell the precious metal even as economic growth
slows, according to Citigroup Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows an ounce of gold buys about $115
of earnings from companies in the MSCI All-Country World Index,
the most since Bloomberg and MSCI Inc. began compiling the data
in 1996. The ratio hit the highest since at least 1970,
according to  Robert Buckland , an equity strategist at Citigroup
who included a similar chart in a report dated yesterday.  Gold has surged 18 percent this year to $1,667.53 an ounce
as investors sought a haven amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
slowdown in the  U.S. economy . The metal is the “ultimate
greater fool” investment because it doesn’t produce cash flows
and is only worth what someone else will pay, Buckland wrote.
Measuring gold’s purchasing power relative to other assets
including equities is one way to value the metal, according to
the London-based strategist. The MSCI global stock index has
retreated 10 percent from this year’s high on May 2.  “Equities look cheap compared to gold,” Buckland wrote.  While the metal’s rally may continue, investors who are
bullish on gold should consider buying shares of mining
companies, Buckland wrote. One ounce of the metal will buy about
$80 of gold industry earnings, near the high of $88 reached in
1980, according to the strategist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
