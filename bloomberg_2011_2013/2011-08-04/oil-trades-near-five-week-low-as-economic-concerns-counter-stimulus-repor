Oil in  New York  traded little
changed, giving up earlier gains, as concerns over economic
growth and rising crude stockpiles in the U.S. countered
speculation over added stimulus by the  Federal Reserve .  September futures fell to as low as $91.92 in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange and traded at
$92.05, up 12 cents, at 1:08 p.m. Sydney time. The contract
yesterday dropped $1.86 to $91.93, the lowest since June 27.
Prices are 12 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement slid 3 cents to $113.20
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  U.S. service industries expanded in July at the slowest
pace in 17 months and crude stockpiles climbed a second week,
separate reports showed yesterday. Three former top officials at
the Fed said the central bank should consider a new round of
securities purchases to bolster economic growth, the Wall Street
Journal reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
