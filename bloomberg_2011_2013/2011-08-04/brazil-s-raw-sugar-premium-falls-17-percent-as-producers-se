The premium buyers are prepared to
pay for sugar from  Brazil , the world’s largest producer,
has fallen 17 percent over the past week on producer selling,
according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Raw sugar for loading in August at the port of Santos, the
country’s largest, is at a premium of 1 cent a pound above the
price for the October contract on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the brokerage said in a report e-mailed today. The premium was
1.2 cents a pound on July 27, it said in a report that day.  Producers prefer to sell more sugar now as the market is
“inverted, and demand was subdued,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at
the Rolle, Switzerland-based company said in an e-mail today.
“About four to five cargoes are now offered in the market.”  Sugar for loading in September at the port of Santos is at
a premium of 0.75 cent a pound to the  New York  futures price,
below the price for August shipment, a so-called inversion, or
backwardated structure of the market, data from the brokerage
showed. The premium for October loading was between 0.2 cent and
0.35 cent a pound, according to the broker.  Raw sugar for October delivery climbed 0.05 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 27.74 cents a pound by 10:42 a.m.  London  time on
ICE. White, or refined, sugar for October delivery rose $5.60,
or 0.8 percent, to $730.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
