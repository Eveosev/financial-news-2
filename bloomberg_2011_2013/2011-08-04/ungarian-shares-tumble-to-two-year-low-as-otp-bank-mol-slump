Hungary’s benchmark stock index fell
to its lowest in almost two years, led by OTP Bank Nyrt. and oil
refiner Mol Nyrt., as investors ditched riskier assets worldwide
amid mounting concern the global economy is slowing.  The BUX gauge of companies fell 2.2 percent to 20,067.15 at
its 5:06 p.m. close in Budapest, the lowest since November 2009.
OTP and Mol, which have a combined 58 percent weighting in the
index, dropped more than 3.5 percent.  Investors fled to the relative safety of gold,  U.S. debt ,
the Swiss franc and yen as signs of a global economic slowdown
spurred bets the  Federal Reserve  will start another stimulus
program. The global benchmark index tumbled more than 10 percent
from this year’s high and two-year Treasury yields declined to a
record low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
