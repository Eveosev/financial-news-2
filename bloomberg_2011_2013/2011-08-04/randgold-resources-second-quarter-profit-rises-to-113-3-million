Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a miner of
the metal in West Africa, rose to an eighth-month high in London
trading after gains in production and prices drove up quarterly
profit.  Randgold climbed 6.6 percent to 5,920 pence, the highest
price since Dec. 3. Second-quarter net income  more than tripled
from a year earlier to $113.3 million, while sales also more
than tripled to $321.2 million, the  Jersey , Channel Islands-
based company said today in a statement.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by record prices
for bullion as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes spur demand for
precious metals as a haven. Gold for immediate delivery averaged
$1,509 an ounce in the second quarter, compared with $1,197 an
ounce a year earlier.  “Randgold smashed production and earnings expectations,”
Collins Stewart Plc said in a note to investors today. “These
strong results draw attention to Randgold’s leading production
growth versus  London  peers.”  Randgold rose 365 pence by 4:30 p.m. close in London,
extending this year’s gain to 12 percent. The 21-member FTSE 350
Mining Index tumbled 5.8 percent.  The company is on schedule to meet its 750,000-ounce to
790,000-ounce full-year production target,  Mark Bristow , chief
executive officer, said in an interview in London.  Randgold said second-quarter gold output rose 97 percent to
184,711 ounces after the company’s new Tongon and Gounkoto mines
started production.  The cost of production was $645 an ounce compared with $744
an ounce in the first quarter and will fall to about $600 an
ounce by the end of the year, Bristow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
