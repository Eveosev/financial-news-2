Gasoline tumbled to a five-week low
as a U.S. jobs report indicated little improvement in the labor
market amid declining fuel demand.  Futures fell a seventh straight day as the Labor Department
reported that applications for jobless benefits decreased 1,000
in the week ended July 30 to 400,000. This follows reports
yesterday that U.S. services industries grew at the slowest pace
since February 2010, private job growth cooled and gasoline
demand declined as supplies rose.  “The sentiment in the market is we’re in recession mode,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago . “The economic numbers are reflecting what the gasoline
numbers have been telling us all along, that the economy is
slowing.”  September-delivery gasoline dropped 5.19 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.8794 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.8776, the lowest intraday
level since June 28.  The Energy Department reported yesterday that demand over
the past four weeks was down 3.6 percent from a year earlier and
stockpiles rose to the highest level in almost four months.  In another report yesterday, the Institute of Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, which covers
about 90 percent of the economy, dropped to 52.7 from 53.3 in
June. ADP Employer Services said yesterday that companies added
114,000 workers last month following a 145,000 gain in June that
was smaller than initially reported.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.2
cent to $3.703 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for September delivery fell 3.26 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.9863 a gallon on the exchange. Prices touched
$2.9849, the lowest level since July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
