China’s national short-track speed
skating team expelled Wang Meng, the country’s most-decorated
Winter Olympic athlete, after she punched Manager Wang Chunlu,
Xinhua News Agency said, citing a statement from the nation’s
General Administration of Sport.  The incident occurred after Wang, 26, was criticized for
returning to camp late after a night out with five teammates,
the official news service said. Wang, a winner of six Winter
Olympic medals, was expelled for six months in 2007 for
criticizing her coach’s tactics, Xinhua reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
