Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX) , a Greek owner of
ships that move commodities including iron ore and coal, said
second-quarter profit fell 18 percent as shipping rates
declined.  Net income dropped to $27.7 million, or 34 cents a share,
from $33.9 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier, the
Athens-based company said today in a statement. Diana was
expected to earn 35 cents a share, according to the average of
five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell to
$64.6 million from $68.7 million.  Diana kept its fleet under long-term time-charter
contracts, a strategy that protected it from declines in the
spot, or single-voyage, market. The Baltic Dry Index, a measure
of spot shipping rates in the dry-bulk market, dropped 58
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  “Despite a moderate miss, this is solid profitability,”
said Urs Dur, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets Ltd., who has
a “buy” rating on the stock. The profit number is “excellent
given dry bulk freight market conditions,” he said.  Diana declined 63 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $8.53 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. That’s the lowest close
since December 2008. The stock has dropped 26 percent this year.  “We expect that the present industry environment, caused
primarily by the supply and demand imbalance, will continue for
the near-term,” said Chief Executive Officer Simeon Palios in a
conference call.  Charter Rates  Time charters earned an average $30,597 per day, down from
$33,105 a year earlier. Daily vessel operating expense climbed
to $6,724 from $6,006.  The Baltic Dry Index averaged 1,379 in the second quarter,
down from 3,307 a year earlier, according to London-based Baltic
Exchange.  “Diana has a very high contract coverage and it’s in a
good position, even though rates declined a little bit,” said
Frode Morkedal, an Oslo-based analyst at RS Platou Markets AS.
“The drybulk fleet growth is basically too big, and demand is
at a lower level, that’s why rates have come down.”  Diana operated an average of 23 vessels during the quarter,
up from 22 a year earlier. The fleet utilization rate fell to
98.6 percent from 99.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
