milling wheat from the U.S. in a regular tender today, the
smallest volume in six weeks, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from Oct. 1 to Oct. 31, according to
Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s grain-trade division. It was the

domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 1.98 million tons

million tons purchased in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
