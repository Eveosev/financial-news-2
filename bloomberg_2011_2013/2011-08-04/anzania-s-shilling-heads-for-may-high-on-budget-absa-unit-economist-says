Tanzania’s shilling is set to gain to
the strongest since May next month after the government of East
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy approves its budget and begins
spending, according to Yonoh Mtegule, an economist at Absa Group
Ltd.’s local unit.  “After parliament passes the budget mid this month,
government expenditure will begin at the end of August and
beginning of September,” increasing demand for the local
currency, Mtegule, who works at National Bank of Commerce Ltd.,
said by phone from Dar es Salaam.  The shilling will gain to 1,530 per dollar, the strongest
intraday level since May 31, by the beginning of September,
Mtegule said. It depreciated for a second day, losing 0.2
percent to 1,593 by 2:10 p.m. in Dar es Salaam. A close at this
level would be the weakest since July 8.  Tanzanian Finance Minister Mustafa Mkulo on June 8
announced a 13.5 trillion-shilling ($8.5 billion) budget for
fiscal 2012 that included an 85 percent increase in
infrastructure spending as the government seeks to accelerate
economic growth. Parliament is debating Mkulo’s budget
proposals.  Tanzania’s shilling is Africa’s third-worst performer
against the dollar over the past six months after  Uganda  and
 Kenya ’s shillings. The country’s inflation rate climbed to 10.9
percent in June, the fastest pace in 14 months, on higher energy
and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said on July
15.  Tanzania vies with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
