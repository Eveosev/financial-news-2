Cocoa supplies may outpace demand for
a second year in the 2011-12 season starting in October as
consumption falls, according to  Ecobank Transnational Inc ., the
Togo-based lender operating in more than 30 African countries.  The surplus may be about 100,000 metric tons on top of
roughly 200,000 tons this season, Edward George, a London-based
commodities specialist at Ecobank, said in an e-mail in response
to questions today. Production lagged behind grindings, an
indication of demand, by 89,000 tons in 2009-10, according to
the London-based International Cocoa Organization.  “Grindings are more likely to fall than rise next year,”
he said in the e-mail. “We do not expect a global deficit next
year.”  The median estimate of eight people in a Bloomberg survey
yesterday was for a shortage of 59,000 tons for 2011-12 after a
record surplus of 362,250 tons this season. Output in the  Ivory
Coast , the world’s largest grower, will be 1.45 million tons
this season, and  Ghana  will produce 1 million tons, George said
in the e-mail.  Earnings from cocoa exports in Ivory Coast this season may
be slowed because of smaller beans in the mid-crop, the smaller
of two annual harvests, he said.  “The Ivorian mid-crop has produced a high proportion of
small beans and this will weaken the expected surge in cocoa
export earnings this season,” he said.  Cocoa for September climbed 5 pounds, 0.3 percent, to 1,841
pounds ($2,999) a ton by 11:10 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
