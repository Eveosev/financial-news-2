Treasuries rose on speculation the
U.S. may fall into recession and prompt the  Federal Reserve  to
inject further monetary stimulus with a third round of
quantitative easing.  Yields on two-year notes stayed within four basis points of
a record low, while benchmark 10-year debt yields were five
basis points from the least since November. Reports due today
and tomorrow may show initial U.S. jobless claims rose last week
and the economy isn’t creating enough jobs to reduce the
 unemployment rate , which probably stayed above 9 percent,
according to Bloomberg surveys. Five- and 30-year U.S. debt also
rose as stocks slid in Europe and  Asia .  “With the focus very much still on growth, we still think
Treasuries could rally as the market prices in rates staying
lower for longer,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist
at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “There’s even talk of QE3. The
recent data out of the U.S. hasn’t been great, and tomorrow’s
payrolls will be a big data point that the market will be
watching.”  Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell two basis points to 2.60
percent at 11:51 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 3.125 percent securities maturing in May 2021
added 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 104 17/32.  Two-year note yields fell one basis point to 0.33 percent,
near yesterday’s 0.3081 percent record low. Yields on five-year
securities were little changed at 1.24 percent, while 30-year
debt yielded 3.87 percent, three basis points lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
