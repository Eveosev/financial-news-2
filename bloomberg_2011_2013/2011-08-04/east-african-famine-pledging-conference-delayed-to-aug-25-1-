The  African Union  said a conference
to raise funds for more than 12 million people stricken by
drought and famine in the Horn of  Africa  has been delayed by
more than two weeks until Aug. 25.  The pledging conference, to be held in Ethiopia’s capital,
 Addis Ababa , was originally planned for Aug. 9, the  African
Union  said in an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t provide a
reason for the postponement.  Donors have committed about half of the $2.5 billion
required to deal with the crisis, the United Nations Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on its  website .  The UN on July 20 declared a famine in two regions of
southern Somalia amid drought and conflict that have left 3.7
million people, almost half the country’s population, in need of
aid. Three more areas of  Somalia  were classified as famine-hit
yesterday,  the UN said .  The crisis may spread across all of Somalia’s southern
regions within four to six weeks and carry on until at least
December, the Famine Early Warning Network and the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization’s  Food Security and Nutrition Analysis
Unit  said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
