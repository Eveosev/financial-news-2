Gasoline stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, decreased for a third week on exports, according to PJK
International BV.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 8.3 percent to 616,000 metric tons
in the week to today, the lowest level since mid-June, data from
PJK, a researcher based in the Netherlands, showed. Cargoes were
sent to Benin,  Mexico ,  South Africa , the U.S. and West Africa.
Shipments of the motor fuel arrived from Finland,  France ,
Norway, Portugal, Russia and the U.K.  The drop was “centered around cargo movements rather than
barges,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone from
Oosterhout, where the company is based.  Naphtha inventories dropped 14 percent to 38,000 tons, even
as cargoes arrived from Norway and  Russia , according to the
data. That’s the lowest level since March 17.  Fuel oil stores increased for a second week, rising 2.9
percent to 854,000 tons, PJK data show. Cargoes arrived from
France, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and the U.K. Jet fuel supplies
rose 0.8 percent to 480,000 tons on imports from Korea and the
United Arab Emirates.  Gasoil inventories were unchanged at 2.399 million tons.
Cargoes of the fuel, which include heating oil and diesel,
arrived from Aruba, Russia and the U.K. while supplies were sent
to Egypt and the Mediterranean, PJK data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
