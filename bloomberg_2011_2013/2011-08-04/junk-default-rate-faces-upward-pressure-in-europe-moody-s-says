Corporate defaults may increase in
 Europe  next year if surging borrowing costs among peripheral
countries seeps into the region’s financial system, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  The speculative-grade default rate could more than triple
to 5.3 percent in a year’s time if the debt crisis isn’t
contained, the New York-based ratings firm said today in a
report. The rate was 1.4 percent at the end of June, down from
1.9 percent in 2010 and 11.2 percent the previous year.  “Although defaults have fallen significantly since 2010,
we remain cautious regarding the possible impact of the European
debt crisis,” Albert Metz, a managing director at Moody’s, said
in the report.  Defaults may rise as banks grow wary of lending while
sovereign yields in countries such as Italy and  Spain  reach
euro-era records. Sales of junk-rated debt in Europe dropped to
3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in June after reaching 8.7
billion euros in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold junk-rated
European corporate debt instead of  government bonds  jumped 81
basis points, or 0.81 percentage point, to 639 basis points
since July 1, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  The ratio of rating upgrades to downgrades increased to
0.25 last year from 0.06 in 2009, and rose to 0.33 in the first
half of 2011, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
