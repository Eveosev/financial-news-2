Ireland’s unemployment rate rose to
the highest in six months in July as government austerity
measures weighed on spending and business activity in the
services industry slowed.  Unemployment climbed to 14.3 percent from 14.2 percent in
the previous month, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork said
on its website today. The number of claimants on the
unemployment register increased 1,500 to 447,900 from June on a
seasonally adjusted basis.  Ireland’s jobless rate has tripled since the property boom
collapsed in 2008 and  Europe ’s worst banking crisis forced the
country to accept a bailout. Total tax receipts for the first
seven months of the year rose 8.6 percent, the government said
yesterday, as it implemented austerity measures to cut the
 budget deficit .  The number of long-term unemployed increased by 45,508 in
the year through July, bringing the share of those on
 unemployment benefits  for a year or more to 40.4 percent,
according to today’s statement.  Redundancies fell 10 percent from a year earlier in July
and were down 24 percent for the January-July period on a
cumulative basis, Ireland’s labor ministry said separately
today.  Business activity in Ireland’s services industry slowed in
July as new orders declined, according to the Markit Economics
NCB Stockbrokers services purchasing managers’ index. The index
recorded a figure of 51.7, compared with 52.4 in June. Anything
above 50 marks an expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
