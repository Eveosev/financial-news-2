What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the U.S.
recovery is faltering, reducing global demand for grain to make
animal feed, fuel and food,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc in West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 13 cents to 16 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on speculation that rain in the next 10 days will
revive Midwest crops after a July heat wave, Roose said. The
dollar’s rally may erode the appeal of U.S. exports, he said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 0.3 cent to 0.5
cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower
for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on the greenback’s advance against major
currencies, Roose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
