The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.4 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 38 billion cubic feet in the week ended July
29 to 2.752 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.069 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:25 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
