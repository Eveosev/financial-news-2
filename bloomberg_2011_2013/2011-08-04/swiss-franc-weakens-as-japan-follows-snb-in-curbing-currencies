The franc weakened for a second day
versus the dollar after  Japan ’s central bank followed the Swiss
move to counter haven flows that have allowed the currencies to
appreciate, stirring speculation of further coordinated action.  The  Swiss National Bank  yesterday cut  interest rates  and
increased the supply of currency to money markets. The franc
strengthened the most against the yen as the  Bank of Japan  said
it will inject 10 trillion yen ($126 billion) into the economy
in order to quell the yen’s appreciation.  “A lot of people have been spooked by the Bank of Japan
moves today, because it signals a further risk that there could
be a similar move from the Swiss National Bank,” said Adam Myers, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  The Swiss currency weakened 0.5 percent to 77.45 centimes
per dollar at 10:14 a.m. in  London . The franc was little changed
at 1.10174 per euro after sinking as much as 1 percent. It
reached a record 1.07958 per euro before the Swiss central
bank’s announcement yesterday. The franc climbed 2.8 percent to
102.917 yen.  The Swiss government welcomes the measures the central bank
took to fight the “overvalued” franc, according to an e-mailed
statement from Bern yesterday.  “The interest-rate cuts announced yesterday are of course
weakening the franc today,” Myers said. “I don’t expect this
to have any significant long-term effect on the franc, as people
will still want to buy it as a haven currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
