Ethanol futures slumped to the lowest
price since in almost a month on signs of a slowing economy that
threatens to drain fuel demand.  The grain-based additive followed other commodities lower
after the MSCI All-Country World Index plunged 3.9 percent and
crude oil erased all of its gains from 2011. Ethanol, made from
corn in the U.S., is part of U.S. energy plans to reduce
dependence on foreign sources of oil.  “I would be hard pressed to come up with a scenario in
which ethanol could rally today in the face of these broader
market forces,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader
at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery dropped 8 cents,
or 2.9 percent, to settle at $2.642 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, the lowest price since July 7. Futures have
gained 12 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago fell 3 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.72 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel
dipped 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.845, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in New York dropped 5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$2.805 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive slipped 7
cent, or 2.4 percent, to $2.905.  Corn for September delivery decreased 12.25 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $6.9375 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for September delivery dropped $5.30, or 5.8
percent, to settle at $86.63 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Feb. 18. Prices have
fallen 5.2 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery slumped 19.41 cents, or 6.6
percent, to $2.7372 a gallon in New York. The contract includes
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
