Mexico ’s peso dropped to the weakest
since March as the Japanese government intervened in  currency
markets  to slow the yen’s gain, pushing the dollar higher
against most currencies.  The peso fell 1.9 percent to 12.0522 per  U.S. dollar , the
weakest since March 20, at 5 p.m. New York time, from 11.8193
yesterday. It was the worst performer among the six most-traded
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg today. The drop
pared this year’s gain to 2.4 percent.  The yen declined the most since 2008 after the government
stepped in to weaken the currency.  “The yen intervention is very relevant for the market,”
said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a currency strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . The Japanese
government appears to be prepared to adopt more measures to stem
the yen’s gains, which is reducing demand for the peso, she
said.  The yield on Mexico’s peso debt due in 2024 declined 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 6.36 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
1.27 centavo to 132.71 centavos per peso. The yield was the
lowest since Oct. 29.  The currency has been falling this week as concerns grow
about the economic outlook of the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner. JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the forecast for
growth in the U.S. in the third and fourth quarters yesterday.
The bank doesn’t expect the  Federal Reserve  to raise the
benchmark rate until the middle of 2013, a delay from its prior
forecast.  Bank of America cut its growth forecast for Mexico to 4
percent from 4.5 percent next year, economist Ezequiel Aguirre
wrote in a note to clients.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
buying as much as $600 million through the options every month
since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves. They allow the
central bank to accumulate dollars, insuring against outflows of
capital and limiting the peso’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
