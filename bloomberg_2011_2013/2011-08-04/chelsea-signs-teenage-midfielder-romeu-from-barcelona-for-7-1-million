Chelsea signed 19-year-old midfielder
Oriol Romeu from European champion Barcelona on a four-year
contract, the London team said on its  website .  Barcelona said the Premier League club is paying 5 million
euros ($7.1 million), with the Spanish team having a buy-back
option of 10 million euros after a year and 15 million after the
second year.  Romeu will join up with his new club after completing his
stint with  Spain  in the Under-20 World Cup in Colombia. He’s
played in each of Spain’s two matches so far, a 4-1 win over
 Costa Rica  and a 2-0 victory against Ecuador, as his nation
guaranteed its place in the knockout phase.  Oriol was with Barcelona’s neighbor Espanyol before joining
Barca’s academy in 2004, making his first-team debut at the end
of last season, Chelsea said.  The Blues, without the injured  Michael Essien , have been
trying to sign midfielder Luka Modric from Tottenham but no
agreement has yet been reached. Chelsea has also been linked
with Palermo’s Javier Pastore, who’s set to join Paris Saint-
Germain, and Anderlecht striker Romelu Lukaku.  New Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas signed goalkeeper
Thibaut Courtois from  Belgium ’s Genk. He’s been loaned to
Atletico Madrid.
