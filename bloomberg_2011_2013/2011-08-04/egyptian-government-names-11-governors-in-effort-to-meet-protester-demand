Egypt  announced nominees to replace
11 provincial governors in a move that was promised by Prime
Minister Essam Sharaf in an effort to meet protesters’ demands.  Demonstrators whose protests forced out former President  Hosni Mubarak  in February have called for state bodies to be
purged of officials affiliated with his government. Amid
furthers rallies last month, new Cabinet ministers were
appointed and hundreds of police officers were dismissed. Sharaf
promised to new provincial governors in a July 11 speech.  The incoming governors for 11 of Egypt’s 27 provinces
include those for Alexandria, Luxor and Beheira, according to a
Cabinet statement distributed to reporters in Cairo today. A new
governor has also been named for the southern province of Qena,
where the appointment of a Christian for the position was
suspended after protesters objected to his police background and
demanded that a Muslim hold the job.  Cabinet spokesman Mohamed Hegazy said the 11 nominees will
be sworn in by the military council at a date yet to be
announced. Mubarak ceded interim authority to the council when
he stepped down.  To contact the reporters on this story:
