Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS,
Slovakia’s dominant gas company, has filed a lawsuit against the
government for not allowing an increase in prices for
households, Pravda reported.  The company, which is 49 percent owned by E.ON Ruhrgas and
 GDF Suez (GSZ) , is disputing price decisions by the country’s
regulator carried out between November 2010 and May 2011, the
newspaper said, citing Pavol Adamciak, a spokesman at the
regional court in Bratislava, Slovakia.  SPP spokesman Ondrej Sebesta and Slovak Economy Ministry
spokesman Robert Merva declined to comment when reached today by
