Facebook Inc. and other social-
network operators are luring increasing numbers of Russians
online, many of them to meet new people, a survey found.  Fifty-three percent of Russians now use the Internet, up
from 39 percent last year, state-run research center VTsIOM said
today in an e-mailed  statement  from Moscow. The number of daily
users has risen 31 percent, up from 5 percent in 2006.  DST Global, a Russian Internet investment fund led by
billionaire Yuri Milner, has been expanding its interests in
Russian and global social networks, including a recent $400
million stake in San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. The holding
also owns a stake in Facebook Inc.  The number of Russian-language Twitter users passed 1
million last month, Yandex NV, the operator of  Russia ’s largest
search engine, said in separate statement today. President
 Dmitry Medvedev  and his economic aide, Arkady Dvorkovich, are
among the country’s regular users.  Forty-six percent of those surveyed by VTsIOM said that
social networks such as Facebook, the world’s largest, and
domestic rivals Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki are the best places
to meet new people online. Thirty-six percent said they have
already met people through the Internet, the survey showed.  Almost one-third of respondents, 32 percent, said the
Internet was “no place for meeting people.” Only 6 percent
preferred specialized dating sites, VTsIOM said.  The survey, conducted July 16-17, included 1,600 people and
had a margin of error of as much as 3.4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
