Egypt  is producing 695,000 barrels a
day of crude and condensates, Oil Minister Abdalla Ghorab said.  Separately, the North African country is continuing
negotiations over increasing the price of natural gas exported
to countries such as Jordan and Israel to bring them in line
with global prices, Ghorab said today in a telephone interview
from Cairo.  Egypt holds  Africa ’s sixth-largest crude oil reserves, with
4.5 billion barrels, and the continent’s third-biggest gas
reserves, with 78 trillion cubic feet (2.2 trillion cubic
meters), according to data from BP Plc. The country produced
736,000 barrels a day of oil and 61.3 billion cubic meters of
gas last year, the data show. BP, BG Group Plc, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, Eni SpA and Apache Corp. are among the companies
operating in Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
