wish to extending our condolences to you, to the Japanese
football community and, most importantly, to Naoki Matsuda’s
friends and loved ones,” FIFA President Sepp Blatter said.
“Please let them know that today the football community stands
by their side.”  Matsuda played 492 games for Yokohama F. Marinos from 1995
to 2010, scoring 26 goals and helping the team win three
