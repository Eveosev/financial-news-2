German farmers deserve more
compensation linked to losses from this year’s E. coli outbreak,
Gerd Sonnleitner, head of the country’s DBV farming association,
said,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported, citing an interview.  A European Union payment of 16 million euros ($22.9
million) doesn’t cover German farmers’ damages, the newspaper
cited Sonnleitner as saying in an e-mailed preview of an
interview to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
