Suez Environnement’s investment in
Spanish water company Aguas de Valencia is for the “long-
term,”  Europe ’s second-biggest water company said in a
statement.  Suez is delighted to contribute to greater growth in Aguas,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today. Suez
Environnement, which owns 33 percent of Aguas, doesn’t know if
any of the other shareholders in the company want to sell their
stake, it said.  The company commented after the Spanish newspaper Expansion
today reported it may seek to take control of Aguas and will
also monitor  Madrid ’s plans to sell a stake in its water
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
