Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan coffee grower,
gained as prices of the beans climbed at the latest auction in
the East African nation.  The stock increased 0.05 shilling, or 0.5 percent, to 10.35
shillings at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the
biggest advance since Aug. 1.  Kenyan coffee prices rose 6.9 percent at the latest auction
on Aug. 2 after supplies of the beans declined, the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange said in an e-mailed statement.  The average price for all the coffee sold climbed to
$346.30 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $323.89 a week
ago. The benchmark AA grade increased 5.8 percent to an average
of $492.74 from $465.59 a bag last week after supplies fell 8.9
percent to 771 bags, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
