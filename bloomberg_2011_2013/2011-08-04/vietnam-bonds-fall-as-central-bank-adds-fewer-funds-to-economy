Vietnam ’s two-year bonds declined on
speculation lenders have less cash to invest in debt as the
central bank added fewer funds to the economy. The dong dropped.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam has been lending 1 trillion dong
($49 million) a day in seven-day open-market operations since
July 13, down from at least 2 trillion dong from the end of June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Vietnam will aim to
avoid a surplus of dong and maintain a tight monetary policy,
central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in an interview on
 Vietnam Television  today.  “Now that the central bank has narrowed money injection
through open-market operations, bond demand has dropped,” said
Nguyen Hong Quang, a Hanoi-based fixed-income dealer at Bank for
Agriculture & Rural Development, the country’s biggest lender.  Two-year bond yields rose 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 12.31 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong weakened 0.8 percent to 20,590 per dollar as of
3:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,608,
unchanged since July 11, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  -- Nicholas Heath  and Diep Ngoc Pham. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
