(Corrects spelling of Georgian TV station in second
paragraph.)  Russia is monitoring the “changing”
situation in Syria, where political change is necessary,
President  Dmitry Medvedev  said.  “Naturally, we’re monitoring developments in the
situation,” Medvedev said during interviews with Georgian TV
channel PIK, Russian station RT and Ekho Moskvy radio attended
by journalists in Sochi, Russia, today. “It’s changing, as are
our reference points.”  Without political change, peace with the opposition and an
end to violence, Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad faces a “sad
end,” Medvedev said.  Separately, Medvedev said Georgia may derail Russia’s bid
to join the  World Trade Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
