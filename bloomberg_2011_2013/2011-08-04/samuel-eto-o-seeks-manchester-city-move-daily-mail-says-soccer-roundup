The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. media, with clickable links to the Web.  Eto’o Interest  Samuel Eto’o is interested in joining  Manchester City  after
falling out with  Inter Milan  coach Gian Piero Gasperini, the
 Daily Mail  reported  The Premier League club would rather keep  Carlos Tevez  than
swap him for the Cameroon striker, the Mail added.  Maicon Swap  Inter Milan is willing to trade right-back Maicon in
exchange for Argentine striker Tevez, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Inter wants a straight swap, though City values Maicon at
15 million pounds ($24.6 million) and would demand an extra 25
million pounds to release Tevez, the Mirror said.  Cole Offer  Queens Park Rangers is trying to sign Liverpool’s  Joe Cole 
on a season-long loan,  the Guardian  reported.  West Ham is also interested in signing Cole, who may prefer
to remain in the Premier League with QPR than rejoin his former
team in the Championship, the Guardian said.  Spurs Talks  Tottenham is holding talks with Real Madrid about signing
midfielder Lassana Diarra, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Spurs has ruled out hiring Newcastle’s  Joey Barton  because
it expects to get Diarra, the Mirror added.  Barton Hint     Barton has hinted that he could stay at Newcastle even
though he’s been told by the club that he can leave on a free
transfer, the Independent  reported .  “I may choose to stand perfectly still,” the Independent
cited Barton as writing on his Twitter feed. “It’s my right.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
