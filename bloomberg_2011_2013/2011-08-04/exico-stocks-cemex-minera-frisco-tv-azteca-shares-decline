The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index retreated 3.4 percent to 33,322.63.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, fell 6.1 percent to 6.87 pesos. The Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index was minus 47.6 in the week through July 31, the
lowest since May, compared with minus 46.8 the prior week.
Confidence among women fell to the lowest level since October
2009, while Americans making more than $100,000 a year were the
most pessimistic since November 2009.  TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP MM), Mexico’s second-largest
broadcast television network, tumbled 6.1 percent to 7.71 pesos.
The planned reduction of Azteca’s weighting in the benchmark IPC
stock index, which goes into effect on Sept. 1, may create
“significant selling pressure,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a
report e-mailed today.  Minera Frisco SAB (MFRISCOA MM), the mining company
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , fell 7.4 percent to 50.1
pesos. Frisco’s reduced weighting in the benchmark index may
“impact negatively on the performance” of the stock, Deutsche
Bank AG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
