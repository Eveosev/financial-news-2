Italian bonds slumped, sending 10-
year yields toward a euro-era record, as European Central Bank
debt purchases failed to reassure investors that officials in
the region have found a solution to the fiscal crisis.  The cost of insuring Italian debt surged to a record, with
credit-default swaps rising 18 basis points to 384, according to
CMA in  London . German two-year notes rose after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB will offer banks
more cash as the debt crisis spreads. Irish securities jumped as
Trichet signaled policy makers revived a bond-buying program.  With Italian bonds lower, so far the ECB’s action “doesn’t
appear to have had the desired effect,” said Eric Wand, a
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “The market
doesn’t think they have the firepower.”  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose 11 basis points to
6.19 percent at 4:58 p.m. in London. The yield reached 6.26
percent yesterday, the highest since 1997. The 4.75 percent
security maturing in September 2021 fell 0.75, or 7.5 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,415) face amount, to 89.94.  The additional yield, or spread, that investors demand to
hold 10-year French bonds instead of benchmark German bunds
widened to as much as 87 basis points, the most since the euro
was introduced in 1999. The Belgian 10-year yield spread also
reached a euro-era record, climbing to 221 basis points.  ECB Purchases  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  urged Italians not to be
“scared” by surging bond yields, saying the country will
weather the market storm, after meeting with executives, bankers
and unions on the economy.  The ECB bought Irish and Portuguese debt, according to
three people with knowledge of the transactions, who asked not
to be identified because the trades are confidential. Trichet
said subsequently at a press conference in  Frankfurt  that the
ECB’s governing council wasn’t unanimous in voting for a
resumption of bond buying.  The yield on the Irish 10-year bond slid 24 basis points to
10.40 percent, while the two-year note yield plunged 32 basis
points to 14.11 percent. The Portuguese two-year yield tumbled
50 basis points to 14.80 percent.  The ECB will lend euro-area banks as much money as they
need for six months and extend its existing liquidity measures
through the end of the year, Trichet said. The central bank held
its benchmark rate at 1.5 percent today, as predicted by all 54
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The German two-year yield tumbled as many as 21 basis
points to 0.83 percent. The intraday decline was the steepest
since July 11.  Liquidity Measures  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
contract expiring in June 2012 down 21 basis points to 1.37
percent as traders scaled back bets that the ECB will increase
borrowing costs further.  “The ECB says there is a need for an additional six-month
tender and the markets are reading that as a sign that the ECB
is concerned,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist
at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “This is the reason why the front
end of the German yield curve is crashing. We are going to be
living in an environment with lots of liquidity.”  The 10-year bund yield reversed an initial jump after
Trichet announced the liquidity measures, sliding as much as 12
basis points to 2.29 percent, an almost 10-month low. The bund
gained for the 10th straight day, the longest run of increases
since August 2005.  Not Unanimous  The rebound by bunds was due to Trichet’s comment on the
vote not being unanimous, according to  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh.  “Investors are uncertain of the extent of buying,
particularly given differences of opinion within the council,”
he said. “It is too early to expect a sustained fall in Italian
and Spanish yields.”  Spanish 10-year yields rose three basis points to 6.28
percent, while credit default swaps rose six basis points to a
record 424.  Spain ’s borrowing costs rose as it sold 3.31 billion euros
of three- and four-year notes at an auction today, compared with
its maximum target of 3.5 billion euros, the country’s central
bank said.  The 4.813 percent average yield on the notes due in 2014
compares with a yield of 4.291 percent paid on securities
maturing in October 2014 at an auction on July 7. Spain drew
bids for 2.14 times the securities on offer, compared with a so-
called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.29 at the previous sale. The
January 2015 debt drew bids for 2.4 times the 1.1 billion euros
of debt that were sold at an average yield of 4.984 percent.  Bond Returns  Spain will sell a new five-year benchmark government note
on Sept. 1, and will cancel a bond auction scheduled for Aug.
18, the Tesoro Publico said today in a statement on its website.  German bonds handed investors a 3.8 percent return this
year, compared with 5.2 percent for Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have lost 4.5
percent, while  Portugal ’s have fallen 24 percent, the indexes
show. Spanish bonds lost 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
