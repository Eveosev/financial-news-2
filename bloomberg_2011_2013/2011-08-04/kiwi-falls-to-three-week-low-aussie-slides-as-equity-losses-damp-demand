New Zealand ’s currency tumbled to a
three-week low against the dollar as Asian shares extended a
global slump, sapping demand for higher-yielding investments.  The so-called kiwi dropped against most major peers as the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid more than 2 percent. The
Australian dollar erased earlier losses against the greenback.  “Risk appetite’s severely dried up and it’s not clear it’s
going to turn around any time soon,” said Greg Gibbs, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in Sydney. “That leaves the kiwi vulnerable.”  New Zealand’s dollar dropped to 83.28 U.S. cents at 10:35
a.m. in Sydney from 83.63 cents in  New York  yesterday. The kiwi
earlier touched 82.75 cents, its weakest since July 13. It fell
to 65.60 yen from 65.97 yen yesterday, when it climbed as much
as 1.5 percent to 68.08 yen.  The so-called Aussie was at $1.0457 from $1.0464 yesterday.
It earlier touched $1.0425, the lowest since June 27. The
currency fell to 82.41 yen from 82.55 yen yesterday, when it
gained as much as 2.3 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index tumbled 4.8 percent
yesterday to its lowest level since December. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials lost 2.8
percent.  The yield on New Zealand’s two-year government note dropped
to 3.22 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate on New Zealand’s 10-year security tumbled to 4.59 percent,
the least since March 2009.  Australian  government bonds  soared, sending the yields on
two-year notes down by 37 basis points to 3.83 percent, the
biggest loss since October 2008. The 10-year yield dropped 19
basis points to 4.54 percent, the biggest decline since April
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
