Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) ,
the Kenyan unit of  South Africa ’s  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , gained for a
second day after sinking below a key level of an indicator used
in technical analysis.  The stock rose as much as 1.25 shillings, or 3.9 percent,
to 33 shillings before closing 0.8 percent higher at 32
shillings at 3 p.m. in Nairobi, the longest winning streak since
June 14.  Pan Africa shares dropped 23 percent in July, the worst
performing stock on the Kenyan exchange last month, according
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s 14-day relative strength index closed at
21.07 on Aug. 2., below the 30 level that signals to some
technical analysts a security is poised to rise. The RSI, as the
index is known, identifies possible turning points in indexes or
securities by measuring the degree that gains and losses outpace
each other in a given period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
