Copper may fall on concern demand for
the metal will weaken as economies slow, a survey showed.  Nine of 12 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 75 percent, said prices will fall next week. Two
predicted a gain and one forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was down 4.8 percent for this week at
$9,362 a metric ton by 5:30 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange.  Service industries  in the U.S., the largest part of the
nation’s economy, expanded in July at the slowest pace in 17
months and European services and manufacturing growth eased to
the slowest pace in almost two years, reports showed Aug. 3. The
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities has dropped 12 percent
from this year’s high in May.  “The outlook is worsening for many Western economies,”
 John Meyer , an analyst at Fairfax IS in London, said by e-mail
Aug. 3. “This will start to dampen demand for Asian-produced
products and services.”  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of July 29.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
71 of the past 148 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 2 Bearish: 9 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
