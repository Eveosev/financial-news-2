The rupiah was little changed near a
seven-year high as concern about a slowdown in the  U.S. economy 
was offset by optimism Indonesia’s growth outlook will attract
overseas investment.  Gross domestic product increased 6.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, compared with 6.46 percent in the
three months through March, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey before official data due tomorrow. Reports
this week showed declines in manufacturing and consumer spending
in the world’s largest economy.  “Indonesia’s fundamentals are still favorable and that’s
outweighing concerns about the slowing economy in the U.S,”
said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona
Perdania in Jakarta. “Locally, growth is still expected to be
healthy and inflation manageable.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,482 per dollar as of
10:25 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached a seven-year high of 8,453 on Aug. 2.  Consumer prices in  Indonesia  rose 4.6 percent in July from
a year earlier, compared with an increase of 5.5 percent the
previous month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said on Aug. 1.
That’s the slowest pace in more than a year.  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy likely grew by more than
6.5 percent last quarter, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi
Sarwono said yesterday. The central bank forecasts growth of as
much as 6.8 percent this year, after a 6.1 percent gain in 2010.  Ten-year  government bonds  declined yesterday. The yield on
the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 6.93 percent, according to closing
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
