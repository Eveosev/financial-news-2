Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481) ,  Taiwan ’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, posted its fourth
consecutive loss as sales of TVs slow and global economic
uncertainty weighs down demand.  Second-quarter net loss was NT$13 billion ($450 million),
compared with a NT$9.5 billion profit a year earlier, the
Miaoli, Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. The
average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for
a loss of NT$6.47 billion.  Larger rival LG Display Co. last month posted earnings that
missed estimates as supply of panels used in TVs and computers
continues to exceed demand. Chimei Innolux, formed last year in
a three-way merger, has posted a profit only once in the five
quarters since it was formed.  “The recovery we had expected in panel demand has not
materialized,” Chris Lin, a Taipei-based analyst at Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. who cut the stock to “hold” from
“outperform,” wrote in an Aug. 2 report. “Replacement demand
for LCD TVs, desktop monitors, and notebooks has been postponed
as tablets and smartphones have become preferred.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
