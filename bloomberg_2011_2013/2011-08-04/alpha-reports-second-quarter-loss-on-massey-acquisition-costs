Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , which
bought  Massey Energy Co. (MEE)  for $7.1 billion in June, slumped to
the lowest price in almost 14 months after missing analyst
estimates and saying the acquired company’s legacy contracts
were priced below market value.  Alpha fell $6.84, or 17 percent, to $33.24, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest price since June 9,
2010, and the steepest one-day decline since Dec. 18, 2008. The
shares have fallen 45 percent this year.  The company reported a net loss of $56.4 million or 36
cents a share, compared with net income of $38.8 million, or 32
cents, a year earlier and said efforts to maximize cost savings
from the acquisition will be hampered by old contracts.  “It’s going to take a Herculean effort on the part of a
lot of people,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Crutchfield said
today on a conference call with analysts and investors. “This
is about positioning your better assets for the long-term.”  Alpha said absent charges related to the Massey purchase,
net income for the quarter was $150.6 million, or 96 cents.
That’s below the $1.165 a share it was expected to earn, based
on the average of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion
and amortization were $97.2 million. Without the expenses they
would have been $361.9 million.  Massey had some of its coking coal locked in this year to
be sold at $153.11 a ton, about 54 percent below the record $330
benchmark contract during the second quarter.  Massey Retraining  Alpha has focused on training Massey employees and reducing
turnover, executives said today on a conference call with
analysts and investors. Crutchfield said Alpha is looking to
fill 400 coal mining jobs.  The company isn’t shopping for assets, he said.  “Absolutely, I can confirm we’re not” going to look for
opportunities on the scale of Massey anytime soon, Crutchfield
said.  Alpha plans to ship between 104 million and 112 million
tons of coal this year, including as much as 21 million tons of
steel-making coal.  For 2012, the company plans to ship between 120 million and
132 million tons of coal, of which between 23 million and 26
million will be metallurgical or steelmaking coal.  UBS AG said in a note to clients that the production
guidance for next year is below its expectations and that it
appears 2012 is a “transition year.”  ‘Below Expectations’  “Production guidance for ‘12 was below expectations in
both the met and thermal segments,’’ Shneur Gershuni, an analyst
at UBS in  New York , wrote in the note. ‘‘The met production
seems like there could be some material upside and the thermal
guidance suggests rationalizing some high cost production.’’  Alpha raised its estimate of expected synergies from the
Massey purchase to between $220 million to $260 million by
mid-2013, excluding other cost-saving efforts. The company
previously said it expected annual synergies to reach $150
million in the second year of operations.  Alpha’s average price per ton for coking coal jumped 50
percent to $176.08 a ton. Overall costs to mine swelled 30
percent, it said.  Costs to extract coal from its eastern operations increased
17 percent from a year earlier to $70.84 a ton amid reduced
production and shipments from its Emerald longwall mine in
Greene County,  Pennsylvania , due to sandstone and only using one
longwall for most of the quarter, Alpha said.  The process involves use of a large machine with a shearer
set against a coal seam, moving back and forth, while ripping
the coal from the pane or long wall of coal.  Alpha will repurchase shares from time to time and is
working with its board of directors to determine what amount it
will buy back, Crutchfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
