Malaysia ’s ringgit fell to a two-week
low on speculation the central bank will slow gains to protect
the nation’s exporters amid signs the global recovery is cooling.  The currency dropped for a third day after the Bank of
 Japan  sold yen to halt a 4.3 percent rally in the past two
months and pledged to add funds to the economy to support growth.
Policy makers in  Asia  may also take steps to keep the price of
their goods competitive after reports this week showed
manufacturing in the U.S. and  China  eased, according to CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. Malaysia’s  government bonds  dropped.  “Japan appears to have done Asia a favor and regional
policy makers would be more than happy to let their currencies
weaken given the poor economic outlook,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB in  Kuala Lumpur .
“Recent data have been rather weak.”  The ringgit slipped 0.4 percent to 2.9815 per dollar as of
4:37 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier reached 2.9855, the lowest level since
July 22. The currency depreciated 1.4 percent in three days.  The currency remained weaker after a trade ministry report
today showed Malaysia’s exports rose 8.6 percent in June from a
year earlier, versus 5.4 percent in May. Economists had expected
a 5.8 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.  The nation’s exports grew 6.6 percent on average in the
first six months of this year, versus 28 percent in the same
period last year, according to Bloomberg data.  Overseas shipments have barely clawed back to their pre-
crisis peak, according to a research note today from ING Groep
NV. The situation may persist for the rest of 2011 amid slower
global growth, it said.  Bonds Decline  Five-year bonds declined, pulling yields off a five-month
low. The rate on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.41 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The yield has declined 14 basis
points in the past month.  Global  funds  owned a record 184.6 billion ringgit ($61.9
billion) of local-currency debt in June, up 53 percent from end-
2010, according to data published by  Bank Negara Malaysia  on
July 29. Holdings included 91.6 billion ringgit of  government
bonds , an all-time high. The treasury is scheduled to auction
15-year bonds later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
