De Beers , the world’s largest diamond
producer, ended a 14-day strike at its South African mines,
agreeing to pay workers increases of as much as twice inflation.  Workers should start returning tomorrow and the four
affected mines should resume full production on Aug. 6, Wayne
Smerdon, head of industrial relations, said by mobile phone
today. While mine output was lost, De Beers was able to meet
buyers’ requirements throughout the strike, he said.  The strike was the first in almost two decades at De Beers,
which is trying to boost second-half output after first-half
production missed expectations. Gold, coal and steelworkers also
held strikes last month in  South Africa , where the annual
consumer inflation rate was 5 percent in June.  De Beers will boost pay by between 8 percent and 10 percent
this year, and by inflation plus two percent next year, the
diamond producer said in an e-mailed statement.  The company, 45 percent owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , is
targeting about 35 million carats of global output this year
after producing 15.5 million in the first half. South Africa
accounted for 7.6 million carats of the 33 million De Beers
produced last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
