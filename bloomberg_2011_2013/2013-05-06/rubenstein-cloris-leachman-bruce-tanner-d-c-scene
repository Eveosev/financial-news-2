Last week  Warren Buffett  dipped a toe in the Twitter-sphere, but don’t expect his friend  David Rubenstein  to follow suit.  “I’m what you’d call a last adopter,” said Rubenstein, the co-founder of the  Carlyle Group , who was hosting the annual Kennedy Center spring gala last night.  With a dinner, show and dance party keyed to “My Fair Lady,” the event raised $2.2 million.  The program featured an abbreviated version of the classic musical with Tony-award winning Jonathan Pryce as Henry Higgins and Academy-award winner Cloris Leachman as his aristocratic mother.  Rubenstein was joined by his own mother, Bettie, his mother-in-law, Sheila Rogoff, who celebrated her 90th birthday yesterday, his two daughters and wife, Alice.  At the gala’s after party where the London skyline was beamed against the wall and British pop hits were played, Leachman, 87, was holding her own on the dance floor.  She joked this was nothing compared to her stint on “Dancing With the Stars” where she was “upside down” most of the time.  Phillips Collection  “What would you do without us Italians?,” asked Ambassador Claudio Bisogniero at Friday night’s Phillips Collection gala, which raised about $700,000 for the art museum’s learning programs.  He gave the event a distinctive Italian flair by bringing the after party to his embassy, where guests played bocce ball in black tie. Cannoli, gelato and mini pizzas were served.  Supreme Court Justice  Samuel Alito , his wife Martha-Ann, and designer Roberto Coin were among those who dined at the museum earlier in the evening under sumptuous paintings by Renoir and Degas, and a visiting exhibition of Italian photographs.  Bisogniero’s involvement was part of the “Year of Italian Culture in the U.S.,” a nationwide partnership between the Italian government and U.S. institutions to underscore Italian achievements in culture, design and technology.  Bruce Tanner , chief financial officer of sponsor  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , said he enjoyed being involved through the years, but didn’t enjoy looking at the party photos, as they testify to his aging.  Among the other guests were Israeli Ambassador  Michael Oren , Egyptian Ambassador Mohamed Tawfik, French Ambassador Francois Delattre, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Peter Jacoby, vice president and director of federal relations at  AT&T Inc. (T)   National Mall  The Entertainment Software Association was among the major sponsors of Saturday night’s Ball on the Mall, now in its fifth year raising money for the Trust for the National Mall.  The green mall, known as America’s front yard, is in need of repairs and restoration. The association was represented by Erik Huey, senior vice president for government affairs, and Ali Amirhooshmand, director of federal government affairs.  Among those dancing under a white tent in the middle of the mall were Jonathan Otto, senior public-affairs specialist for Honda Motor Co., and Matthew Jacobs, a partner with Jenner & Block LLP, and husband of the trust’s president, Caroline Cunningham.
