South Africa’s  unemployment rate 
climbed to 25.2 percent in the first quarter as the retail,
finance and construction industries shed jobs.  The  jobless  rate increased from 24.9 percent in the
previous three months,  Statistics South Africa  said in a report
released today in Johannesburg. The number of people without
jobs rose by 100,000 to 4.6 million.  South Africa’s economy, the biggest on the continent, is
struggling to create enough jobs to meet President  Jacob Zuma ’s
goal of reducing the unemployment rate to 14 percent by 2020.
Economic growth will probably reach 2.6 percent this year, less
than half the 7 percent pace the government estimates it needs
to meet its jobs pledge.  The  Reserve Bank  has refrained from lowering borrowing
costs to spur job creation and promote borrowing as inflation
remains near the top of its target of 3 percent to 6 percent.
Credit demand increased at the slowest pace in about a year in
March as  consumer confidence  waned.  The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of four
economists was for the unemployment rate to reach 25.1 percent
in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
