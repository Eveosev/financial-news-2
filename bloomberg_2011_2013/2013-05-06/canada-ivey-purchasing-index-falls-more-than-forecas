Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’
 index  dropped in April, falling short of the most pessimistic
projection by economists, as deliveries slowed for the first
time this year.  The index declined to 52.2 on a seasonally adjusted basis,
after reaching a seven-month high in March of 61.6, according to
a statement on the website of Western University’s business
school. Readings of more than 50 indicate purchasing by
governments and companies advanced. The figure fell short of the
lowest forecast from 13 economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News .  The report follows indications the Canadian economy has
been regaining momentum in the first three months of the year.
Canada posted its first trade surplus in a year in March and
gross domestic product grew in February at a faster-than-
expected 0.3 percent, Statistics Canada reported last week.  Among related indexes, the employment figure rose to 55.1
from 53.1, while the inventories index dropped to 52.7 from
52.9. The supplier delivery measure fell to 49.5 from 51.3, and
the  price index  rose to 58.7 from 53.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
