Syracuse University  is the top seed in
the men’s college lacrosse tournament, while nine-time champion
 Johns Hopkins University  is left out of the field for the first
time since 1971.  It is the ninth top seed for Syracuse (13-3), which has
made the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 32
times, with a record 10 titles. The  University of  Notre Dame 
(10-4), which lost twice to Syracuse this year, is the second
seed, followed by  Ohio State University  (12-3) and the
 University of Denver  (12-4).  First-round games will be played May 11-12 at the home of
the seeded team. The championship game will be May 27 in
Philadelphia.  The Orange overcame a season-opening loss to Albany by
winning nine of their next 10 games. Syracuse won the Big East
championship last week with victories over Notre Dame and
Villanova.  Loyola University Maryland will open its championship
defense against seventh-seeded Duke on May 12. This year’s field
holds 21 of the tournament’s 41 winners, with all but five of
those unaccounted-for titles coming from the absences of  Johns
Hopkins  and Princeton.  The  Blue Jays  finished the season 9-5, with four losses
coming from tournament teams. It is the first time since the
inaugural tournament 42 years ago that the Baltimore school
wasn’t included in the field.  Two teams will make their NCAA tournament debut this year.
Northeast Conference champion Bryant (8-10) will face Syracuse
on May 12, while Detroit (5-9), winner of the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference, will play Notre Dame on May 11.  Ivy League champion Yale (11-4) will face eighth-seeded
Penn State (12-4), which is 0-2 in NCAA tournament play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
