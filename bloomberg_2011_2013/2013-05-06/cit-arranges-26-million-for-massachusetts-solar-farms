CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the financial services
company led by  John Thain , arranged a $26 million credit
facility for Citizens Energy Corp. to build five solar farms in
Massachusetts.  The ground-mounted projects will be in Devens, Holyoke,
Whately and Agawam, according to a statement today from New
York-based CIT. Citizens Energy, a non-profit that provides low-
cost energy to the poor and elderly, was founded in 1979 by
Joseph Kennedy II, a former congressman and the son of Robert F.
Kennedy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
