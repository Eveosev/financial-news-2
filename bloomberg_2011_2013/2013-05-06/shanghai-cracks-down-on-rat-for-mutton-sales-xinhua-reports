Shanghai  authorities are cracking down
on sales of mutton after police busted a crime ring selling rat,
fox and mink as the meat, the official Xinhua News Agency
 reported  today.  City police and officials from the  food safety  division
raided a market in Minhang district on May 3 after a tip-off,
and seized large quantities of meat with labels saying “New
Zealand Sliced Lamb” without production dates or ingredients,
Xinhua reported, citing unidentified people with the
muncipality’s food safety office as saying. A delivery order
indicated that some of the seized meat may have entered the
supply chain for several hot pot restaurants in the city.  China is seeking to improve food safety after recent
reports on violations sparked public outrage and increased
scrutiny on the industry. The Ministry of Public Security busted
a criminal operation that sold rat, fox and mink meat as mutton
in Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu province for more than 10
million  yuan  ($1.62 million), it said in a statement dated May
2.  Shanghai has started to collect suspicious samples of
mutton and will conduct DNA tests to confirm if it is the meat,
the report said.  Police arrested 904 people and seized more than 20,000
metric tons of illegal products in meat-related crimes over
three months, the official Xinhua News Agency said May 2, citing
the Ministry of Public Security.  Crimes included injecting meat with water and selling
diseased or chemically treated pork or chicken, according to the
public security statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
