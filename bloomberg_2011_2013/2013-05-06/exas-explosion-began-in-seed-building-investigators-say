The fire and explosion at Adair Grain
Inc. that killed 14 people in West,  Texas , involved ammonium
nitrate stored in a building with seed and other fertilizers,
according to state officials.  Investigators expect to complete a probe of the fire’s
origin and cause of the blast a week or two later than first
estimated, the Texas Insurance Department said yesterday in a
statement. Adair Grain operated the plant in the city of 2,800
people about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Waco.  The fire broke out at the site at about 7:30 p.m. on April
17 and led to the explosion a short time later. The blast left a
crater 93 feet (28 meters) wide by 10 feet deep below the 12,000
square-foot storage building. The plant was approved to hold 270
tons of ammonium nitrate, which has been linked to some of the
deadliest industrial accidents and terrorist attacks, including
the 1995 bombing of Oklahoma City’s Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building, in which 168 people died.  Investigators haven’t determined what caused the initial
fire, though they’ve ruled out the weather, anhydrous ammonium
also stored at the plant and a rail car containing ammonium
nitrate, said Rachel Moreno, a spokeswoman for the Texas Fire
Marshal’s office. About 60 to 70 investigators are at the site
and have conducted 411 interviews, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
