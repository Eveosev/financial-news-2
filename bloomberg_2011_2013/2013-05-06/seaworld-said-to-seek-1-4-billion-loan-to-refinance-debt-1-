SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the
Blackstone Group LP-controlled theme park operator that went
public last month, is seeking a $1.4 billion term loan to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Bank of America Corp. is arranging the transaction for
 Orlando , Florida-based SeaWorld, which will pay interest at 2.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
with a 0.75 percent minimum on the lending benchmark, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the deal is
private.  SeaWorld, famed for its killer whales named Shamu, is
offering the loan to lenders at 99.75 cents to 100 cents on the
dollar, the person said. Lenders are offered six months of 101
soft-call protection, meaning SeaWorld would have to pay a one
cent premium to reprice the loan in its first year.  The debt, which will come due in 2020, will refinance a
 term loan  A maturing in 2016 and a term B slice that expires in
2017, the person said.  Lenders must let Bank of America know by May 10 at noon in
New York whether they will participate in the deal, the person
said.  A $900 million term B piece and a $486 million B slice pay
interest at 3 percentage points more than Libor, with a 1
percent floor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fred Jacobs, a spokesman for SeaWorld, didnâ€™t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . A term loan A is sold mainly to banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
