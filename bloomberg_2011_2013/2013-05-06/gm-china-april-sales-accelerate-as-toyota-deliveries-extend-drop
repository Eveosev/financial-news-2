General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in  China , reported sales growth accelerated
last month, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  saw its deliveries extend
their slump in the world’s biggest car market.  GM sales climbed 15 percent to 261,870 units in April,
after a 13 percent increase the preceding month, according to
figures released today by the Detroit-based carmaker. Toyota
reported sales fell 6.5 percent to 76,400 units, the ninth drop
in 10 months.  GM saw sales of Buick and Chevrolet vehicles rise by more
than 20 percent as the company seeks to keep its lead in China
among foreign automakers for a ninth-straight year. That’s at
the expense of Japanese automakers, who are still coping with
the fallout of a territorial dispute that flared in September.  Toyota isn’t alone in reporting declines in China.
Hiroshima, Japan-based  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  last week reported a 15
percent drop in April sales. Nissan Motor Co. said wholesale
deliveries fell 8.5 percent, though retail sales rose.  Separately, Volvo Cars, the Swedish carmaker owned by
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., reported sales in the country
rose 30 percent last month, making China its biggest market.  For GM, Cadillac sales surged 99 percent to a record 4,077
units, helped by the recently-introduced XTS model. GM has made
sales of its luxury Cadillac brand a priority, with the aim of
selling 100,000 units annually in 2015 and gaining 10 percent of
the premium segment market share by 2020.  ‘Cautiously Optimistic’  Overall, GM is “cautiously optimistic” that sales in
China may reach 3 million units this year, Bob Socia, head of
operations in the country, said last month. The company sold
2.84 million vehicles in China last year and targets to sell 5
million in the world’s biggest auto market by 2015.  GM is stepping up its efforts in China as it works to
consolidate its position and fend off  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in its
largest market.  GM is spending $11 billion by 2016 on new plants, products
and people in China, which includes adding four factories by
2015 to boost capacity to about 5 million units, Socia said in a
news conference in Shanghai last month. At the same time, it
aims to add 400 sales outlets this year, eventually hitting a
total of 5,100 by 2015.  The company plans to introduce 17 new models in China this
year, with the expansion to focus on SUVs and luxury models. GM
is looking at bringing in nine new or refreshed SUVs in China
over the next five years.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
