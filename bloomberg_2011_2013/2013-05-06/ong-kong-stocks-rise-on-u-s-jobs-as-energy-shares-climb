Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index headed for its biggest gain in more than a week,
after U.S. employment grew more than forecast in April, boosting
confidence in the world’s largest economy. Materials and energy
companies led gains.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , the country’s biggest producer of the
metal, jumped 4.2 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil producer, increased 1.8 percent on higher commodity prices.
 Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker that gets half of its sales
in the U.S., rose 1.6 percent.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ,
the casino operator that doubled its profit last year, gained
2.6 percent after saying it will buy a Macau resort.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 0.9 percent to 22,891 as of
9:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, with about seven stocks advancing for
each that declined on the 50-member gauge. The index is headed
for its biggest gain since April 25. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies increased 1 percent to
10,953.22 even after a private report on the nation’s services
industries showed expansion slowed last month.  Hang Seng Index  futures gained 1 percent to 22,770. The HSI
Volatility Index advanced 1.4 percent to 15.47, indicating
traders expect a swing of 4.4 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
