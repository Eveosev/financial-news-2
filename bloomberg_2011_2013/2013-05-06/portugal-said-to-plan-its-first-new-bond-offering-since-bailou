Portugal hired banks for its first
issue of new bonds since the country asked for a bailout from
the European Union two years ago, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  Caixa-Banco de Investimento, Citigroup Inc., Credit
Agricole SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and
 Societe Generale  SA will arrange the planned sale of euro-
denominated debt due February 2024, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak
about the transaction. The offering would be the country’s first
sale of a new bond since a sale of 3.5 billion euros ($4.8
billion) of five-year notes in February 2011, two months before
the country asked for a bailout, according to Societe Generale
data.  Portugal is intending to sell the debt at a time when
 yields  on country’s existing ten-year bonds fell to the lowest
since 2010 as the decline of  interest rates  worldwide impels
investors to seek higher-yielding securities. In January,
Portugal sold a reopening of 2.5 billion euros of  bonds  via
banks.  “It’s a further sign of normalization in the euro area
sovereign bond market,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European
rates strategy at Societe Generale in Paris. “Investors have
been actively seeking to add long-dated, high-yielding,
duration.”  Spending Cuts  Officials from the European Union, the  European Central
Bank  and the International Monetary Fund are preparing to
analyze spending cuts announced by Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  on May 3, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Finance Ministry.  About 80 percent of the 5.3 billion-euro deficit-trimming
effort in the 2013 budget comes from revenue gains, including
3.7 billion euros of tax increases.  To contact the reporters on this story:
