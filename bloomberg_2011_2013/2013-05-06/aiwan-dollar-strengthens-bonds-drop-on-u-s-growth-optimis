Taiwan ’s dollar rose for a second day
and  government bonds  declined as the island’s benchmark share
index rallied to a 21-month high following U.S. jobs data that
added to optimism the world’s largest economy is improving.  The  unemployment rate  in the U.S., Taiwan’s second-biggest
export market, fell to a four-year low and payrolls expanded
more than economists forecast, reports showed on May 3. Global
funds bought $1.2 billion more Taiwanese stocks than they sold
last week, boosting net purchases for the year to $2.5 billion,
exchange data show. Developed nations’ “exceedingly
accommodative” monetary policies are increasing volatility in
 emerging markets  with large capital flows, Taiwan’s central bank
said in a May 4 statement.  “There’s some temporary selling pressure for bonds today
as the U.S. payrolls data was good,” said Stanford Chen, a
fixed-income manager at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei. “But
there’s just so much money in Taiwan now. The recent rallies in
both bonds and stocks should continue.”  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.4 percent to NT$29.492 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 10:35 a.m. local time, Taipei Forex
Inc. prices show. The currency touched NT$29.42 on April 30, the
strongest level since Jan. 28.  The local dollar was trading 0.4 percent stronger two
minutes before the 4 p.m. close on May 3 and finished with a
gain of 0.1 percent. The central bank has sold the currency in
the run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according
to traders who asked not to be identified.  Inflation Eases  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.487 against the greenback, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.58 percent.  Taiwan’s consumer price index rose 1.04 percent in April
from a year earlier, the least in 14 months and less than the
1.26 percent median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey,
official data showed today.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 rose
two basis points to 0.883 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices. The yield touched 0.86 percent on May
3, the lowest level for a benchmark  five-year  security since
July 26, 2012.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
