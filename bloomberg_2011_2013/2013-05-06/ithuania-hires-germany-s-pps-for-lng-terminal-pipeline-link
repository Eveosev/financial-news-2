Klaipedos Nafta AB, Lithuania’s state-
controlled energy company, hired PPS Pipeline Systems to connect
a new natural-gas terminal to the country’s grid after a court
lifted a temporary ban on the agreement.  PPS of  Germany  will by August 2014 build the 20-kilometer
(12-mile) pipeline link needed for a floating liquefied natural-
gas terminal on the Baltic Sea coast, the Klaipeda-based energy
company said in a regulatory statement after signing a 115
million-litai ($43 million) contract today.  Lithuania is building the LNG terminal to diversify its gas
imports and reduce reliance on  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom. A lawsuit
filed by a Lithuanian bidder that lost the pipeline tender
threatened to delay plans to complete the terminal by the end of
2014 until the Baltic nation’s Court of Appeal annulled a lower
court’s suspension of the tender on April 16.  The contract with PPS will take effect when it’s approved
by shareholders of Klaipedos Nafta, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
