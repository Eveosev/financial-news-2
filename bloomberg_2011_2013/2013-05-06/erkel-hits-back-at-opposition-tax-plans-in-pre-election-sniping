German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the economy can’t afford tax increases that the two opposition
parties proposed in their platforms for Sept. 22 elections.  “We think we should strengthen  domestic demand  in
Germany,” Merkel told reporters after talks with European and
state lawmakers of her  Christian Democratic Union  in Dresden
today. Taxing the “core wealth” of the mittelstand, the small
and mid-size companies that make up the German economy’s
backbone, “would be the completely false signal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
