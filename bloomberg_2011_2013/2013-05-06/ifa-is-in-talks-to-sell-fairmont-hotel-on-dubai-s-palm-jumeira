IFA Hotels & Resorts Co., a company
partly owned by Saudi billionaire  Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal , is
in talks with several Middle East investors to sell the Fairmont
hotel at the trunk of a man-made island in Dubai, the property
broker that’s advising IFA said.  The Kuwaiti owner of the 381-room property, which opened on
the Palm Jumeirah in January, wants to raise about $350 million
from the sale, according Gabriel Matar, head of hotels in the
Middle East and  Africa  at  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (JLL) ’s hotel unit.
Matar said a deal could be completed in the third quarter.  The five-star property has 460 meters of beach front, 2,200
square-meters of meeting and conference facilities as well as a
1,600 square-meter spa, according to IFA’s website. It also has
seven restaurants and cafes.  The sale, which would be the first on the Palm Jumeirah
since the island was built, would be one of the few hotel
transactions in Dubai’s thriving hospitality market. Occupancy
rates in the city have averaged 87 percent this year, according
to JLL.  In 2010,  Union Properties PJSC (UPP) , a United Arab Emirates
developer, sold the Ritz Carlton Hotel at the Dubai
International Financial Center for 1.1 billion dirhams ($300
million).  Joe Sita, IFA’s chief executive officer, declined to
comment when asked about the Fairmont Hotel on the sidelines of
the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
