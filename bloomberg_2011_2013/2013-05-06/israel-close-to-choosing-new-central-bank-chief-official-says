Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
top adviser Eugene Kandel said a decision on who will replace
Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer is expected within the
next couple of weeks.  Kandel who was accompanying Netanyahu on a trip to  China ,
said there is a shortlist for the post, declining to elaborate.
The list has been said to include Deputy Governor Karnit Flug
and former Netanyahu adviser Manuel Trajtenberg.  “It’s for the prime minister now to deliberate and make
his final decision,” Kandel, chairman of the National Economic
Council, said in  Shanghai  today.  The post of governor unexpectedly opened in January when
Fischer, 69, announced he would leave at the end of June, midway
through his second five-year term. Fischer, a former No. 2 at
the International Monetary Fund, said he was stepping down for
personal reasons, mostly because his family is in the U.S. and
he has achieved many of the goals he wanted to accomplish.  To contact the reporter on this story:
