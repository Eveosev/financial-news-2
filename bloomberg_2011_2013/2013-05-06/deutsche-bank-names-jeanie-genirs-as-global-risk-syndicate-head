Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  promoted Jeanie Genirs to head of global risk syndicate in the Americas, a role
that oversees new debt sales underwritten by the bank.  Genirs will be assuming the role from Nigel Cree after a
10-year career at Germanyâ€™s biggest lender, including acting as
head of its U.S. agency-debt trading desk, according to an
internal Deutsche Bank memo, the contents of which were
confirmed by Mayura Hooper, a bank spokeswoman. Cree is taking a
leave of absence and plans to relocate to  London  for a new role
at the bank, the memo said.  Deutsche Bank is the second-most-active underwriter of
corporate bonds globally this year, up from fourth place last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes have
returned 2.5 percent this year, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data, as the  Federal Reserve  holds benchmark
borrowing costs at about zero for a fifth year, spurring
investors to buy riskier assets.  The risk-syndicate position encompasses new sales of
sovereign, emerging-market and investment-grade corporate bonds.  Issuance from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers has surged to $1.46 trillion this year, topping $1.43
trillion in the similar period last year, Bloomberg data show.
 Apple Inc. (APPL) , the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, sold $17
billion of bonds on April 30 in the biggest U.S. corporate
offering on record. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
underwrote that issue.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the leading debt underwriter this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
