The Canadian government will conduct a
wide search to replace Karen Kinsley, the chief executive
officer of Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. who said in today’s
annual report that she’s given her final message.  Replacing Kinsley won’t be an easy task, said Diane Finley,
the country’s Human Resources Minister who is responsible for
CMHC, speaking to reporters today. Kinsley’s latest term ends
June 15, agency spokesman Charles Sauriol said by e-mail.  Robert Kelly, former Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. chief
executive officer, was named CMHC’s chairman last week in the
government’s latest move to bolster oversight of the federal
housing agency.  Asked if Kelly might replace Kinsley as CEO, Finley said
that chairman is the right position for him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
