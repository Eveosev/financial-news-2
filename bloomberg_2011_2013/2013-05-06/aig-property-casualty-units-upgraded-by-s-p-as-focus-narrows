American International Group Inc. (AIG)  had
the ratings of its property-casualty units upgraded by Standard
& Poor’s after Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  sold
assets to repay a U.S. bailout and simplify the company.  “Management is now focused on improving the operating
results and credit profile of the ongoing operations,” the
ratings firm said in a statement today on the New York-based
insurer, lifting the financial-strength grade to A+ from A.
“The company has been making significant investments in staff,
systems, and underwriting tools to improve the profitability of
its property-casualty operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
