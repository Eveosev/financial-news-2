Bets on declines in  Sina Corp. (SINA)  shares
plunged to a record low last week on prospects the Chinese
Internet company’s alliance with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will
propel advertising sales on its social media platform.  Short interest  on Sina slid to 0.8 percent of the total
outstanding April 29, the lowest since 2006, when London-based
researcher Markit started tracking the data. Interest was as
high as 5.6 percent Jan. 15. The Shanghai-based company surged
12 percent last week for the biggest gain since September, while
the Bloomberg China-US Equity Index climbed 1.4 percent.  Sina rallied from a four-month low after Alibaba,  China ’s
largest e-commerce company, agreed to buy 18 percent of its
Weibo.com platform April 29, forecasting revenue of $380 million
in advertising and social commerce services for the Twitter-like
service. Jefferies Group Inc. more than doubled its revenue
estimate for Weibo after the announcement and analysts project
Sina’s  sales  will expand 18 percent this year, according to the
mean of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Alibaba’s stake purchase in Weibo set a floor to Sina’s
valuation, making it senseless for those who used to short its
shares to continue do so,” Ming Zhao, founder of 86Research
Ltd., which focuses on Chinese Internet companies, said by phone
from Beijing May 3. “The companies’ revenue projection is a
minimum guarantee for the partnership, which will come from
sellers on Alibaba’s online marketplace advertising on the Weibo
platform.”  Boosted Sales  Alibaba will pay $586 million for the stake in Weibo,
according to Sina’s statement, valuing the social media service
at about $3.3 billion.  Weibo generated about $66 million in total revenue in 2012,
of which 77 percent came from advertising, Sina Chief Executive
Officer Charles Chao said on a Feb. 19 conference call. Ad
revenue from the Alibaba partnership will start being reflected
from third-quarter results, according to an 86Research client
note dated May 3.  Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng boosted her sales projection
for Sina’s Weibo to $300 million in 2013 and $552 million in
2014, an increase of more than 100 percent from her previous
forecasts, according an April 30 note. She upgraded Sina’s
shares last week, boosting the number of buy ratings to 19 out
of 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Monetizing Weibo  Sina slipped 1.3 percent to $56.23 May 3 in  New York . The
stock is up 12 percent this year, after losing 3.4 percent in
2012 and tumbling 24 percent in 2011 amid concern the Chinese
economic slowdown would make it more difficult to monetize
Weibo. The microblogging platform had 503 million registered
accounts by the end of 2012.  While Alibaba, based in Hangzhou, China, has said it has no
timetable for an initial public offering in New York, analysts
are anticipating a sale this year or in 2014. Proceeds would be
used along with additional cash to buy back stock held by Yahoo
Inc., according to a person familiar with the situation who
asked not to be named because the plans are private.   The Bloomberg US-China gauge climbed 0.3 percent May 3 to
92.48 in New York, capping its second weekly advance.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.9 percent May 3 to
$37.71, extending its weekly advance to 2.1 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.1 percent to 1,614.42,
bringing its five-day rally to 2 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 1.4 percent May 3 to
2,205.50. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in  Hong Kong 
added 0.2 percent to 10,845.99 for a weekly increase of 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
