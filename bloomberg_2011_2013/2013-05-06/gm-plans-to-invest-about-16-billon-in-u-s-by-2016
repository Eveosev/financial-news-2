General Motors Co. (GM) , profitable for 13
consecutive quarters, is planning to invest about $16 billion on
U.S. factories and facilities through 2016, more than it will
spend in  China , the company said.  “The $11 billion in capital that will be spent in China by
2016 is coming out of our joint ventures rather than  Detroit  and
is far less than the approximately $16 billion in capital GM
will invest in the U.S. over that time,” Selim Bingol, GM vice
president of public policy, said in a letter published in the
Wall Street Journal.  GM disclosed the U.S. investment figure after announcing
the $11 billion investment for its joint ventures in China last
month in  Shanghai . That was an increase from a 2011 outline to
spend $7 billion through 2015. GM through its joint ventures
sold  2.84 million  vehicles in China, its biggest market, last
year and wants to boost that to 5 million by 2015.  The Journal last week ran a commentary on its op-ed page
titled, “Welcome to General Tso’s Motors,” saying China “is
disproportionately benefiting” from the 2009 U.S.-backed
bankruptcy reorganization of Detroit-based GM. The Journal’s
editorial page previously has criticized the bailout.  GM “was in China long before the economic meltdown of
2008-2009, and not one dollar of U.S. taxpayer rescue money was
spent on our operations there,” Bingol said in the letter.
“Our Chinese joint ventures are self-funding, meaning we
require funds spent there to be generated there.”  CEO’s Strategy  The U.S. spending plan ties in with Chief Executive Officer
Dan Akerson’s strategy to boost operating margins to 10 percent
in North America by mid-decade from 7.4 percent the past three
years. GM is introducing about 20 new or refreshed vehicles in
the U.S., part of a plan to increase profits and rebound from
last year’s 88-year-low in U.S market share.  “Our investments in the U.S. and China reflect our
determination to remain No. 1 in the world’s top two markets,”
 Greg Martin , a GM spokesman, said last night.  GM has said it invested $8.5 billion in the U.S. since
emerging from bankruptcy, including efforts to prepare for
production for more fuel-efficient engines and vehicles.  GM has 31 facilities in the U.S., Martin said. That
includes 12 assembly plants, according to GM’s website. With its
China investment, GM is increasing its number of assembly plants
to 17 assembly plants, Bob Socia, the automaker’s China
president, said last month. The total number of facilities in
China will be 30 in 2016, GM said.  ‘Profit Center’  The company on May 2 reported that first-quarter net income
fell 11 percent to $1.18 billion from a year earlier. Profit
excluding one-time items was 67 cents a share, surpassing the
54-cent average of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit in  North America  before interest and taxes slipped
to $1.41 billion during the quarter from $1.64 billion a year
earlier. Profit in international operations, which include
China, slipped to $495 million from $521 million a year earlier.  “If you look at their profits, obviously, the U.S.
market” remains “a major profit center,” said Alan Baum,
analyst at Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield,  Michigan .  GM fell 0.9 percent to $31.82 at the close in  New York . The
automaker’s shares have gained 10 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
