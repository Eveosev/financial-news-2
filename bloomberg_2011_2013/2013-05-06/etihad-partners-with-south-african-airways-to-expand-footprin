Etihad Airways PJSC signed a route-
sharing alliance with state-owned  South African Airways  as the
Abu Dhabi-based carrier expands its reach into  Africa .  SAA, as the state-owned airline is known, will code-share
on 12 Etihad routes, while the Middle East airline will access
10 new African cities, the companies said today in Johannesburg.  Etihad Chief Executive Officer  James Hogan  is seeking
deeper ties into Africa, where he predicted passenger traffic
will expand 6.8 percent a year until 2016, making it the fastest
growing region in the world.  “Our road map in Africa is very limited,” he said at a
press conference. “We see code-share as a key point of our
strategy.”  SAA’s agreement with Etihad coincides with a plan to return
to profitability with the aid of cost cuts and more fuel
efficient aircraft after posting a 1.36 billion rand ($151.8
million) loss for the year ending March 2012. The airline named
Monwabisi Kalawe as CEO on April 19, as the “custodian of the
turnaround strategy,” according to Minister for Public
Enterprises Malusi Gigaba.  “We are seeing some green shoots appearing,”  acting CEO
Nico Bezuidenhout said in a interview. The airline has saved
about 1.3 billion rand in the year ending March, he said.  As part of its fleet renewal plan, the airline will lease
four Airbus A320s this year and 16 more by 2017, he said. The
Airbus will replace older  Boeing 737  and Airbus A319s, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
