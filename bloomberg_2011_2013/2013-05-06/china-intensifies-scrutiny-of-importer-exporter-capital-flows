China ’s currency regulator  said  it
will increase scrutiny of cross-border capital flows by
importers and exporters to prevent speculative funds entering
the country disguised as trade bills.  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange will send out
risk-warning notices to companies whose goods and capital flows
do not match, as well as those that are bringing big amounts of
cash into China, it said in a statement on its website.  Recipients of such notices have 10 days to explain the need
for their transactions and those that fail to comply or are
unable to provide satisfactory proof will then be placed on
SAFE’s so-called B list, which means their activities will be
closely monitored for a period of at least three months. A
return to SAFE’s A list can only take place once relevant
indicators return to a normal range, the statement said.  SAFE said it would finalize the B list and send out the
first batch of warnings before May 10. It also ordered banks to
adjust their foreign-exchange positions to comply with
regulations.  The  yuan  fell 0.03 percent to 6.1572 per dollar as of 12:01
p.m. in Shanghai, after earlier touching a 19-year high of
6.1521.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  James Regan , Robin Ganguly  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
