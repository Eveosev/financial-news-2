Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio and
 Microsoft (MSFT)  co-founder  Paul Allen  could help sell as much as $1.3
billion of art at the three New York auction houses this month.  Christie’s,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and Phillips are holding their semi-annual sales of Impressionist, modern, postwar and contemporary
art this week and next.  While there’s nothing akin to Edvard Munch’s “The
Scream,” which fetched $120 million at Sotheby’s last May, 11
lots are expected to bring $20 million or more.  Here are the highlights:  A 1921 painting by Fernand Leger depicting three women at a
table, which used to hang in the bedroom of Madonna’s New York
apartment, is going on the auction block at Sotheby’s on May 7.
With an estimate between $5 million to $7 million, the work is
being sold to benefit the  Ray of Light Foundation  that supports
educational projects and training for women.  Also at Sotheby’s,  Paul Cezanne ’s “Les Pommes” (estimate:
$25 million to $35 million). The apple assortments is part of a
collection assembled by inventor and entrepreneur Alex Lewyt and
his wife Elisabeth comprising 200 pieces expected to fetch more
than $60 million.  “L’Amazone”  Another sensation of the Lewyt collection is Amedeo Modigliani’s 1909 “L’Amazone,” a portrait of Baroness
Marguerite de Hasse de Villers in equestrian dress and chiseled,
mask-like face (estimate: $20 million to $30 million).  At Christie’s on May 8, the top lot is a charming Chaim Soutine 1927 portrait of a young pastry chef (estimate $16
million to $22 million).  Another highlight of the sale is Andre Derain’s lush 1905
painting, “Madame Matisse au Kimono,” which marked the
beginning of Fauvism (estimate: $15 million to $20 million).  The week of postwar and contemporary sales will start on
May 13 at Christie’s with a benefit auction organized in
partnership with the  Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation . “The 11th
Hour Charity Auction” includes pieces by 33 contemporary
artists, who donated their works to raise money for
environmental projects and endangered species. With pieces by
Neo Rauch, Rudolf Stingel and  Zeng Fanzhi , the group is expected
to tally $13 million to $18 million.  Barnett Newman  Barnett Newman’s monumental 1953 “Onement VI” is heading
to the block at Sotheby’s on May 14, consigned by Paul Allen
(estimate: $30 million to $40 million).  In the same sale,  Gerhard Richter ’s 1968 “Domplatz,
Mailand [Catherdral Square, Milan]” recalls World War II-era
imagery. Originally commissioned by the  Siemens Corporation (SI) , it
was the largest painting Richter had done up to that point. The
work hung in the Siemens Milan office for 30 years, until 1998
when it was sold at Sotheby’s for $3.65 million.  Jean-Michel Basquiat could set a new auction record at
Christie’s on May 15, with his 1982 painting, “Dustheads”
(estimate: $25 million to $35 million).  Drip Painting  Another highlight at Christie’s is “Number 19,” a 1948
drip painting by  Jackson Pollock  (estimate $25 million to $35
million).  The highest estimate of the season belongs to the final
evening sale at the smallest of the three auction houses.
 Phillips  scored “Four Marilyns,”  Andy Warhol ’s 1962 canvas on
which four yellow-haired images of  Marilyn Monroe  are set
against an orange background.  While the estimate is listed “upon request,”  Michael McGinnis , the company’s chief executive officer, said he
expected the work to bring $35 million to $50 million.  Muse highlights include Frederik Balfour on Hong Kong art, 
 Manuela Hoelterhoff on  opera  and  Elin McCoy  on  whisky .  To contact the reporters of this story:
