Uli Hoeness, the president of Bayern
Munich soccer club who is being investigated for  tax evasion ,
was asked to stay as the German champion’s chairman by fellow
supervisory board members.  FC Bayern Muenchen AG’s board at a meeting in Munich today
unanimously rejected the former German national team player’s
offer to step aside for the duration of the probe, the club said
in a  statement  on its website.  Bayern needs Hoeness in his position as the club prepares
for the European Champions’ League final against Borussia
Dortmund on May 25 and the German Cup final on June 1, according
to the statement.  Hoeness reported tax evasion to German authorities in
January in a bid for amnesty. Munich prosecutors are examining
whether his statement was “complete and valid,” Ken
Heidenreich, a spokesman for the prosecutors, said on April 22.  Bayern’s nine-member supervisory board includes Rupert Stadler, chief executive officer of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Bavaria-
based Audi brand;  Adidas AG (ADS)  Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer , and Edmund Stoiber, the former state premier of Bavaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
