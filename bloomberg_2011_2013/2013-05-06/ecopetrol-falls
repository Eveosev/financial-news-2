Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s state-
controlled oil producer, fell to the lowest in more than a year
after reporting a drop in first-quarter earnings that was
steeper than expected.  The stock slid 3.2 percent to 4,180 pesos at the close in
Bogota, the lowest since Dec. 19, 2011.  Net income for the quarter was 3.41 trillion pesos ($1.86
billion), down 20 percent from the year earlier and below the
average 3.99 trillion pesos of  five analysts’ estimates  in a
Bloomberg survey. The Bogota-based company reported earnings
after the market closed on May 3.  Oil futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange closed up
55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $96.16 a barrel, the highest
settlement since April 2. Ecopetrol is the world’s eighth-
largest oil company by market value.  “The lower  oil prices  in Q2 bring increased risks for
weaker Q2 results,” Citigroup analysts Pedro Medeiros and
Fernando Valle said today in an e-mailed report, adding that the
earnings miss may increase the chance of a reduced dividend.  Quarterly sales fell 7.1 percent from a year earlier to
16.75 trillion pesos. Output rose 6.4 percent to 790,800 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, from 743,400 barrels a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
