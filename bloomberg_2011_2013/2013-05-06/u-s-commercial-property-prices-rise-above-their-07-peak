Prices for U.S. commercial property
last month rose above a peak reached in 2007 as low interest
rates and financing availability helped increase values,
according to research firm Green Street Advisors Inc.  The Green Street all-property index climbed 1 percent from
the previous month and is 1 percent higher than the previous
record, from August 2007, the Newport Beach, California-based
company said today in a statement. Green Street’s index is based
on its estimate of the value of  portfolios  of real estate
investment  trusts , which tend to own high-quality properties.  “It’s likely we’ll see more gains,” Peter Rothemund, an
analyst at Green Street, said in the statement. “Real estate
continues to be attractively priced relative to the returns on
offer in the bond market.”  Low borrowing costs, an increase in lending and a
recovering economy are helping boost demand for  commercial  real
estate, Green Street said. Investors are buying office,
apartment and industrial buildings along with malls and strip
retail centers because returns are higher than for other
investments, such as government bonds.  Another measure of real estate values, the Moody’s/Real
Capital Analytics Commercial Property Price Index, was 20
percent below a 2007 peak in February, the latest month for
which figures are available, according to an April 9 statement.
The measure is based on repeat-sale transactions that occur in
the one-month period two calendar months prior to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
