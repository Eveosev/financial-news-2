The Australian dollar traded 0.2
percent from a two-week low before the  Reserve Bank  meets today
as traders bet on a 62 percent chance of an interest-rate cut.  The nation’s currency declined against its 11 of its 16
major peers as Australia’s two-year bond yield premium over that
in the U.S. fell to its lowest since Nov. 1 last week. The
median forecast of 29 economists is for the central bank to keep
rates unchanged at 3 percent. The Aussie fell against the yen as
a report showed  house prices  rose less than forecast, missing
the estimates of all 16 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “If the RBA cuts today, we’ll see a pretty big reaction in
the currency with everyone pretty much sitting on the fence,”
said David Greene, a senior corporate currency dealer at Western
Union Business Solutions, a global payment services network.
“We don’t think the RBA will cut as the economy seems to be
going okay.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0238 as of
2:03 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0254 yesterday, when it touched
$1.0222, matching the least since April 23. It slid 0.5 percent
to 101.39 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar was little changed at 85.17
U.S. cents. The currency fell 0.3 percent to 84.35 yen.  The Aussie will find support at $1.0160 and then $1.01,
said Greene. Sellers are probably clustered toward the $1.0320
level, he said. Support refers to an area on a chart where
analysts anticipate orders to buy are concentrated.  Aussie Bounce  An index of  house prices  in Australia rose 0.1 percent in
the first quarter, compared with the median forecast for a 1.8
percent gain, according to figures released by the statistics
bureau. A separate report showed that the nation had a  trade
surplus  of A$307 million ($314 million) in March, the first
since December 2011.  “They are still going to hold rates at 3 percent and we
think that the Aussie will probably bounce at the decision,”
said Alvin Pontoh, a Singapore-based Asia-Pacific strategist at
TD Securities Inc. “They’ll have to acknowledge the somewhat
weaker external environment that we’ve seen in the past month.
Whether or not they downgrade their assessment is debatable.”  The RBA is due to announce its rate decision at 2:30 p.m.
in Sydney. There is a 62 percent chance that the central bank
will lower borrowing costs, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on overnight-index swap rates.  Australia ’s two-year bond yield  advantage over  the U.S. was
at 2.31 percentage point today after touching 2.28 on May 3, the
least since Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
