South African white-corn futures
declined the most in more than four months after U.S. prices
fell on forecasts that some parts of the country will dry up
after excessive rains, improving plantings.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped by the 80-rand ($9) limit, losing 3.6 percent to 2,143
rand a metric ton, the most since Dec. 20, by the close on the
South African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery
in the same month, fell 3.6 percent to 2,132 rand a ton.  Corn slumped the most in almost a month in  Chicago  today.
The northern U.S. plains will be dry early this week, favoring
planting, while rains will dissipate in the western and eastern
parts of the Midwest Corn Belt today, Accuweather.com said in a
report dated May 3.  “The clear  weather forecasts  mean that they can continue
to plant,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader, said by
phone from Kroonstad in the Free State province. “Their market
is still volatile, but it seems there is a window of opportunity
for them.”  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white variety is a staple food in the country while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July decreased 1.5 percent to 3,440
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
