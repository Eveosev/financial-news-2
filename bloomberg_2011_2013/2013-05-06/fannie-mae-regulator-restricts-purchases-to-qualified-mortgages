Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac  are being
asked by their regulator to limit purchases to loans meeting
qualified-mortgage requirements and those exempt from Dodd-Frank
Act ability-to-repay rules.  The change announced today by the Federal Housing Finance
Agency means that beginning Jan. 10 next year, the U.S.-owned
companies wonâ€™t purchase interest-only mortgages, loans with 40-
year terms or those with points and fees exceeding thresholds
set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The government-sponsored enterprises will continue to buy
loans that meet their own underwriting and delivery eligibility
standards, FHFA said in the  statement . Most loans purchased by
Washington-based Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  of McLean, Virginia,
already meet qualified mortgage standards.  In January, the consumer bureau issued a final rule
implementing the Dodd-Frank ability-to-repay provisions,
including protections from liability for loans that meet the
criteria of a qualified mortgage as outlined in the rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
