HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , the
Brazilian startup exploring for oil and gas in the Amazon and
 Namibia , rose the most in more than a month after agreeing to
buy its first crude-producing asset from  BP Plc. (BP/)   HRT rose 7.2 percent to 4.19 reais at 12:07 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo  after surging as much as 11 percent, the most intraday
since April 4. The benchmark Ibovespa index fell 0.9 percent.  HRT agreed to pay $135 million for BP’s 60 percent stake in
the Polvo field off  Brazil ’s southeastern coast and assets
including a platform and drill rig used in the field, the Rio de
Janeiro-based company said in regulatory filing today. The
acquisition will give HRT its first access to an oil-producing
field after the company failed to discover any commercially
viable quantities of crude in its Amazonian blocks.  “Polvo is an excellent deal for HRT, since our team
includes people who participated in its discovery before it was
bought by BP,” Marcio Mello, chief executive officer of HRT,
said in the statement. “We have great knowledge of the field.”  The field, located about 100 kilometers (62 miles) off  Rio
de Janeiro ’s coast, produces 13,000 barrels of oil a day, HRT
said. A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S owns the remaining 40 percent of
the field.  Most of the purchase will be financed by a Credit Suisse AG
loan, HRT said, without disclosing the exact amount it’s
borrowing.  BP is focusing its Brazilian operations on the country’s
north after acquiring licenses in three blocks last year in the
so-called Equatorial Margin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
