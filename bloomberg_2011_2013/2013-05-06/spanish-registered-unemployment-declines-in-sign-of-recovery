Spain’s  registered unemployment 
dropped in April, lending support to the government’s forecast
of an economic recovery this year.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits fell
by 46,050 from March to 4.99 million, the Labor Ministry in
Madrid said today in an e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  expects Spain’s record 27
percent unemployment rate to start falling next year as
improving market confidence helps an economic recovery. Rajoy
has implemented the toughest austerity measures in the nation’s
democratic history since coming to power in 2011 and overhauled
labor rules to enable companies to cut labor costs.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  last month reached a preliminary accord with
unions to introduce a new night shift and freeze wages from 2014
through 2018 at its Almusafes factory near Valencia in the south
of Spain, El Mundo reported on April 18. A week earlier, workers
at  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s auto-assembly plant near Zaragoza, in
the north, accepted a two-year salary freeze starting this year.  The European Commission last week said Rajoy’s request for
two more years, until 2016, to bring back the largest  budget
deficit  in the European Union within the bloc’s limit of 3
percent of gross domestic product is “reasonable.” Both the
commission and the  International Monetary Fund  forecast
unemployment will peak this year as output contracts 1.5 percent
before the economy will return to growth in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
