OAO Russian Railways changed its 2013
cargo forecast to a decline after volumes fell for five months
and the Economy Ministry lowered its industrial output target
for the year, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Freight volumes will probably drop 2.4 percent this year,
compared with a previously expected increase of 0.7 percent, the
people said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to comment on the matter.  Russia  reduced forecasts for economic expansion to 2.4
percent this year and industrial output growth to 2 percent from
previous estimates, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said
in April. The country may slide into a recession as early as the
autumn unless it adopts stimulus measures, as the nation’s
largest companies cut investment programs, Economy Minister
Andrei Belousov said later last month.  About 85 percent of Russia’s freight, excluding products
transported by pipeline, is shipped by rail making volumes a
proxy for changes in output, according to VTB Capital.  Russian Railways’ cargo volumes fell 3.5 percent in April,
a fifth month of decline, according to an e-mailed statement
from the state-run rail monopoly today.  This year’s cargo forecast was revised after volumes
deteriorate in the first four months and with oil volumes set to
fall after the expansion of a pipeline across East Siberia, RIA
Novosti’s Prime news service reported today, citing Yelena
Kunayeva, a Russian Railways official. The company’s press
service declined to comment on her forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
