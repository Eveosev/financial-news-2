Boral Ltd. (BLD)  shares slid to the lowest
price in almost four months after the building-products maker
said third-quarter profit in its construction materials division
missed forecasts due to Australian housing-market weakness.  Boral shares were down 3.2 percent to A$4.52 at the close
of trading in Sydney, the  lowest closing price  since Jan. 15.
Earnings in Boral’s construction materials and cement unit in
the three months ended March 31 were A$19 million ($19.6
million) below forecast, the Sydney-based company said in a
regulatory filing.  “Continued weakness in the Victorian market especially
suggests that housing demand in Australia is directionally
challenged and I don’t think it’s improving at all,” Mike Kane,
chief executive officer of Boral, told reporters in a
teleconference today. “Too much product chasing too little
demand makes a difficult pricing environment to get any price
appreciation.”  The construction materials and cement division’s third-
quarter earnings were hit by declining home building in Victoria
state, project delays in both Victoria and  South Australia  and
poor weather in southeast Queensland, the company said in the
statement.  House prices  in  Melbourne , the capital of Victoria, have
fallen 5.7 percent since peaking in the third quarter of 2010,
and 9.3 percent in the Queensland capital of Brisbane since
peaking in the three months ended June 30, 2010, figures from
Brisbane-based researcher RP Data showed.  Net income before items will be between A$90 million and
A$105 million for the year ending June 30, compared with A$101.2
million a year earlier, Boral said today. Increased revenue from
liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland and  Western
Australia  and cost cuts will drive the increase, it said.  The company expects to generate as much as A$300 million
from asset and land sales by June 30, 2014, it said.  Boral  shares  have risen 3.4 percent this year, compared
with a 10.9 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
