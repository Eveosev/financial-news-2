The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development awarded Jordan $215 million in grants for liquefied
natural gas and wind power projects.  About $150 million will be used to build a 65-megawatt wind
farm in Maan and $65 million is for a gas terminal in the Red
Sea town of Aqaba, Jordanâ€™s state-run Petra news agency reported
yesterday. The grants are part of $1.25 billion Kuwait has
pledged to Jordan over the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
