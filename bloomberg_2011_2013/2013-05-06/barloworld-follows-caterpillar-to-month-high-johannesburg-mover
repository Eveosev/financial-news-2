Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , a South African
seller of equipment to mining and construction companies, rose
to the highest in more than a month after biggest supplier
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  rallied on an improved growth outlook.  Barloworld advanced as much as 3.9 percent and traded 3.3
percent higher at 98.63 rand a share by 4:21 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the highest since April 3. More than 650,000
shares traded, about 78 percent of the three month daily
average.  Caterpillar, the world’s biggest construction and mining
equipment maker, has gained more than 8 percent since it cut its
2013 profit forecast on April 22 and rose 3.2 percent on May 3,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barloworld’s share price appears to be responding to
Caterpillar’s rally as products from the Peoria, Illinois-based
company account for two-thirds of its earnings, Mark Hodgson, an
analyst at Cape Town-based Avior Research (Pty) Ltd., said in a
an e-mailed response to questions. “Global investors appear
more optimistic around better U.S job numbers and global growth
outlook,” he said.  The FTSE/JSE Africa Mining Index rose for a second
consecutive day, advancing 0.6 percent to 27,764.44 by 3:57 p.m.
in Johannesburg.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  rose for a third day,
gaining 1.3 percent, while  BHP Billiton Plc (BLT)  advanced 1 percent.
The two companies are customers of Barloworld, according to a
presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
