Traders’ expectations for swings in
the  Mexican peso  fell to an eight-week low as foreign investors
seeking to profit from the country’s higher interest rates pour
into the Latin American nation, options show.  Three-month implied volatility on options for the peso
dropped to 8.9 percent at 4 p.m. in  Mexico  City. The measure’s
1.6 percentage-point drop this year is the most among major
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso
fell 0.3 percent to 12.1086 today.  The currency has surged 6.2 percent this year, the most
among the dollar’s most-traded counterparts, as the percentage
of the nation’s $161 billion of outstanding  government bonds  in
foreign hands surged to a 13-year high. Mexico’s economy will
grow 3.5 percent this year, compared with 2 percent for the U.S.
and 3.1 percent for  Brazil , according to estimates from analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Foreign investors “are seeing macroeconomic stability in
Mexico, and they’re seeing the possibility that reforms, which
haven’t been approved for 10 or 12 years, will finally pass,”
 Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro
Garza Garcia, Mexico, said in a telephone interview. “It’s this
speculation that’s benefiting the peso.”  Mexican political rivals have worked together to push
through the biggest education overhaul in decades and
legislation to boost competition in telecommunications. They
plan to consider overhauls of tax and energy laws designed to
boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
