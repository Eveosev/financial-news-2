The yen may fall to the weakest level
in more than 4 1/2 years versus dollar if a key support level
fails to hold, according to Credit Suisse group AG.  The Japanese currency breached a support level at 98.49 on
May 3 and is poised to fall further, according to Christopher Hine, a director of  technical analysis  at Credit Suisse in  New
York . The yen could initially falter around the 100 level before
weakening to 103.10, which would be the lowest level since
October 2008, Hine said.  “We’re foreseeing that the 100 level will probably act as
a near-term cap, given the big psychological barrier,” Hine
said. “We still think the trend is higher and look for a push
to near that 103 level.”  Japan ’s currency decreased 0.3 percent to 99.30 per dollar
at 11:23 a.m. after earlier depreciating as much as 0.5 percent.
The yen touched 99.95 percent on April 11, its weakest level
since April 2009. The currency again weakened to almost the 100
level on April 22, reaching 99.90 before strengthening.  The yen has declined 12 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2.6
percent, while the  New Zealand dollar  led all gainers with a 5.5
percent increase.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
