Cotton futures rose for the third
straight session on speculation that adverse sowing conditions
may curb output in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Sugar
and coffee also gained. Orange juice and cocoa slid.  This week, wet weather will delay cotton planting in
 Tennessee ,  Alabama ,  Georgia  and the Carolinas, Maryland-based
Commodity Weather Group LLC said. Light showers probably won’t
aid crop prospects in West Texas, the top-growing region, after
light snow last week followed dry conditions. Through April 28,
14 percent of the U.S. crop was planted, down from 25 percent a
year earlier.  “The first weather scare of the planting season across the
water-soaked mid-south and southeast” is supporting prices,
O.A. Cleveland, an agricultural economics professor at
 Mississippi State University  in Starkville, said in a report.
December futures “will tend to move higher given the current
planting schedule.”  Cotton for July delivery jumped 1.1 percent to 87.35 cents
a pound at 10:03 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber
rallied 3.1 percent in the previous two sessions.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery increased 1 percent to
17.71 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery climbed 0.2
percent to $1.412 a pound.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$1.4355 a pound  Cocoa futures for July delivery declined 0.1 percent to
$2,413 a metric ton.  London’s NYSE Liffe exchange is shut for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
