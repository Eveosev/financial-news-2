A measure of job prospects in the U.S.
rose in April, indicating the world’s largest economy will
continue to create jobs.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
0.1 percent to 111.7 from the prior month’s revised reading of
111.6, the New York-based private research group said today. The
measure rose 3.8 percent from April 2012.  The index “is still signaling moderate job growth in the
coming months,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research
at the Conference Board, said today in a statement. Employment
gains will probably keep pace with economic growth this quarter
and next, suggesting productivity will remain muted, he said.  Today’s report follows Labor Department figures released
last week that showed the U.S. job market rebounded in April as
employers showed more confidence in the economic outlook.  Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a
138,000 gain in March, the Labor Department reported on May 3.
Revisions added a total of 114,000 jobs to the tally in February
and March. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to a four-
year low of 7.5 percent.  Improvements in five of the Conference Board index’s eight
components contributed to the gain in the total gauge, today’s
report showed. These included a jump in hiring of temporary
workers and a drop in claims for jobless benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
