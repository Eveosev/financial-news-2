15, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 4 basis points
to 97 as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd.. The benchmark is heading for the lowest
close since November 2010, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Markets in Japan are closed for a national holiday. The
Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3.6 basis points to 81.9 on

bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
