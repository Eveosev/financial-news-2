China’s stocks  rose to a two-week high
as commodity producers jumped on U.S. jobs data and  China United
Network Communications Ltd. (600050)  led a rally for phone companies
after its controlling shareholder increased its stake.  China  United, which controls the nation’s second-largest
mobile phone operator, climbed 2.2 percent.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) 
and Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. drove commodity stocks
higher as copper prices surged the most in 18 months on May 3.
 Guangzhou Hi-Target Navigation Tech Co. (300177)  jumped 10 percent,
sending the ChiNext index of small companies to a two-year high.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 1.2 percent to
2,231.17 at the close, the highest level since April 22. The
measure trades at 9.6 times estimated earnings, compared with
the seven-year average of 17.5, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The CSI 300 Index climbed 1.3 percent to 2,525.98.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 1.5 percent.  “Stocks are cheap at this level and some funds are moving
in on prospects for a rebound,” said  Li Jun , a strategist in
 Shanghai  at Central China Securities Co. “Even though the
economy is stagnant, it isn’t getting worse either.”  The Shanghai Composite has slumped 8.4 percent from a Feb.
6 high on concern slowing economic growth is hurting  earnings . A
private report today from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed the nation’s service industries expanded at a slower pace
last month. Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 2.6
percent up from the 30-day average, while 30-day  volatility  was
at 18.9, the highest since April 15, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Boosting Stakes  A measure of telecom stocks climbed 3 percent today, the
most among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups. China United added
2.2 percent to 3.72  yuan , the highest close since Feb. 8. China
United Network Communications Group, the controlling
shareholder, bought 21.9 million shares in the company on May 3,
according to an exchange statement.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, rose
3.6 percent to 21.33 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous, the second
largest, added 3.7 percent to 15.42 yuan.  Yunnan Copper Industry
Co. (000878) , the fourth largest, climbed 3.2 percent to 12.51 yuan.  Copper futures for July delivery soared 6.8 percent in  New
York  on May 3, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Oct. 24, 2011. The metal climbed 4 percent last week, the most
since mid-September. U.S. payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers
following a revise increase in March that was larger than
estimated, government data showed. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 140,000.  Small-Cap Rally  The ChiNext index gained 2 percent to 958.02, the highest
close since April 26, 2011. Guangzhou Hi-Target surged 10
percent to 17.24 yuan.  East Money Information Co. (300059)  climbed 10
percent to 18.48 yuan.  “The logic behind the rally for small-caps is that
investors believe the economy is stagnant so big-caps, which are
usually closely linked to the economy in terms of earnings,
don’t offer investment opportunities,” said Central China’s Li.
“They think small-caps are less tied to economic growth.”  The HSBC Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell
to 51.1 last month, compared with 54.3 in March. A reading above
50 indicates expansion. An official report last week showed
 service industries  expanded at a slower pace in April.  Slowing Chinese economic growth this year may be a
“blessing in disguise” as monetary policy could remain
accommodative, property tightening could take a breather and
policy reforms may be accelerated, according to Citigroup Inc.  Citigroup recommends Chinese property, infrastructure,
health-care, consumer, insurance and transport stocks as they
stand to benefit from accommodative policies and the
redistribution of earnings to so-called downstream industries,
analysts Minggao Shen and Ben Wei wrote in a report dated May 3.  Economic Data  The statistics bureau is scheduled to report April trade
and inflation data this week. China probably posted a 10 percent
gain in exports, unchanged from the previous month, according to
the median estimate of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Exports probably grew between 10 percent and 13 percent last
month, the Economic Information Daily reported today, citing Li
Jian, a researcher with the Commerce Ministry.  Inflation probably quickened to 2.3 percent in April from
2.1 percent in March, another survey showed. The trade report is
due to be released May 8 with the consumer-price data set for
the following day.  The yuan weakened today, retreating from a 19-year high, on
speculation demand for dollars increased after Chinese
regulators said they would step up scrutiny of the foreign-
exchange positions of banks and companies.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index rose 0.3 percent in New
York on May 3, adding to 1.4 percent gain for the week. The
 iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI)  climbed 0.9 percent. Bets on
declines in  Sina Corp. (SINA)  shares plunged to a record low last week
on prospects the Chinese Internet company’s alliance with
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will propel advertising sales on its
social media platform.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
