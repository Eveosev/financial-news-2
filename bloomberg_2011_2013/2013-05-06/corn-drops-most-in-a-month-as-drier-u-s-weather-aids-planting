Corn slumped by the most in almost a
month on forecasts that parts of the U.S. will turn drier after
excessive rains, helping farmers in the world’s largest producer
accelerate planting and rebuild global inventories.  Corn for delivery in July lost as much as 2.5 percent to
$6.445 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the biggest
intraday loss for the most-active contract since April 10.
Futures traded at $6.505, down 1.6 percent at 10:12 a.m. in
Singapore on volume that was more than double the 100-day
average for that time of day. Prices climbed 6.7 percent last
week on concern snow and rain will slow the pace of planting.  The northern U.S. plains will be dry early this week,
favoring planting, while rains will dissipate in the western and
eastern parts of the Midwest Corn Belt today, Accuweather.com
said in a report dated May 3. World inventories of corn will
probably rise to 150.9 million metric tons before the 2014
Northern Hemisphere harvests, from a forecast 125.9 million tons
this year, according to the average of as many as 17 analyst
estimates surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “There’s been substantial concern if corn will get planted
at all,”  Michael Pitts , a commodity sales director at National
Australia Bank Ltd. said by phone from Sydney today. “Obviously,
the dry weather after a lot of rain should be beneficial.”  In the U.S., reserves may total 2.038 billion bushels
before the 2014 harvests, up from a forecast 762 million bushels
this year, as production recovers after the worst drought in
seven decades, according to the average of 31 analyst estimates
in a separate Bloomberg News survey.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is scheduled to release
on May 10 its U.S. and world supply and demand outlook for corn,
soybeans and wheat for this year and 2013-2014.  Soybeans for July delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$13.79 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $13.86. Wheat lost
1 percent to $7.135 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
