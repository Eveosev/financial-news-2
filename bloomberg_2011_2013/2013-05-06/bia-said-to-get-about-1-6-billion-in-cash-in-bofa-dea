MBIA Inc. (MBI)  will get about $1.6 billion
as part of a deal to end five years of litigation against  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC)  and its Countrywide unit over claims of
defective securitized  mortgage loans , a person familiar with the
matter said.  As part of the settlement, Bank of America will get
warrants for a 5 percent stake in MBIA, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public.  MBIA first sued Countrywide in 2008 in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan for fraud and breach of contract
related to securitized home equity loans. Armonk, New York-based
MBIA guaranteed payments to investors in the securities. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America acquired 
Countrywide that year. MBIA claimed the loans were riskier 
than represented.  MBIA surged as much as 57 percent after Dow Jones Newswires
first reported the deal. MBIA was up more than 40 percent to
$14.06 at 1:32 p.m. in New York after earlier climbing to as
high as $15.45. The intraday jump is the most ever.  Bank of America’s stock climbed 52 cents to $12.76. The
shares had advanced 5.4 percent this year through the end of
last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
