Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  climbed for a second day as falling domestic stockpiles
fueled optimism that demand is increasing in the world’s biggest
consumer of the material used in construction.  The contract for October delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 1.9 percent to 3,650 yuan ($593) a
metric ton, and traded at 3,627 yuan a ton at 11:24 a.m. in
Beijing, extending a 1.1 percent jump on May 3.  Rebar inventory in China fell for a sixth week to 9.39
million tons as of May 3, Huatai Great Wall Futures Co. said in
a report today. The pace of demand for rebar is quickening as
some property developers accelerate projects, it said.  “Futures will probably extend a recovery spurred by
improving demand,” Li Meng, Shanghai-based analyst at Huatai
Great Wall, said by phone from Shanghai. The production of rebar
has slowed relative to demand, he said.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped 1 percent to $128.10
a dry ton on May 3, Steel Index Ltd. data show. The average  spot
price  for rebar was little changed at 3,571  yuan  on the same
day, said the Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
