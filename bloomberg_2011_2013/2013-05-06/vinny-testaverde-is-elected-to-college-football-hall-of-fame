Vinny Testaverde won election to the
College Football Hall of Fame following a career that included a
Heisman Trophy.  The 49-year-old former  University of Miami  quarterback was
the first of 12 players and two coaches to be named to  the Hall 
by the National Football Foundation, the organization said in a
news release yesterday. The others will be announced today.  Testaverde was a unanimous first-team All-American as a
senior during the 1986 college football season. He also won the
Heisman, given to the sport’s top player, and finished his
college career with a 23-3 record as a starter, passing for more
than 6,000 yards while throwing 48 touchdown passes. Testaverde
was the No. 1 overall selection by the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  in
the 1987  NFL draft , starting a pro career that ended in 2007.  The 2013 Hall class will be inducted at the National
Football Foundation’s 56th annual awards dinner on Dec. 10 in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
