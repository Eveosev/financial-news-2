Italy’s economy will shrink this year
more than the European Commission estimates as weak domestic
demand and investment extend the country’s longest recession in
more than two decades, the national statistics institute said.  Gross domestic product  will decline 1.4 percent in 2013
before rising 0.7 percent next year, Rome-based Istat said in
the institute’s annual report. Household consumption and
corporate investments will both decline this year.  Istat’s GDP projections compare with forecasts by the
European Commission for a 1.3 percent contraction this year and
growth of 0.7 percent in 2014. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said May 2 that the euro region’s
third-biggest economy will shrink 1.5 percent this year and
expand 0.5 percent next.  “In 2013 households will keep experiencing a further fall
in available income with inevitably negative consequences on
consumer spending,” today’s report said. “At the same time, a
recovery in investment by companies appears unlikely because of
the productive capacity utilization and of the persisting
weakness of domestic demand.”  Household spending will fall 1.6 percent, with investment
declining 3.5 percent.  Istat said that the  unemployment rate , currently near a 20-
year high of 11.7 percent, will increase to 11.9 percent in 2013
and to 12.3 percent in 2014.  Toward Recovery  Italy will begin a “mild” recovery in the third quarter,
the European Commission said on May 3. Istat also said today
that it expects a pick-up in the three months through September.  The EU’s Brussels-based executive arm said last week that
the country’s debt level will rise to a record 132.2 percent of
GDP next year. That projection contradicted an April 11
government forecast for a decline from 2014.  The nation’s newly appointed Prime Minister Enrico Letta
last week pledged a series of tax cuts to boost growth and
create jobs. Economists estimate the measures lead to more than
10 billion euros ($13.1 billion) in lost revenue in 2013.  The policy mix of tax hikes and spending cuts passed by
Letta’s predecessor, Mario Monti, pushed the country deeper into
recession while helping  Italy  bring its deficit within the EU’s
limit of 3 percent of GDP.  Istat did not include any forecasts for public debt and
deficit in today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
