Producers of Broadway’s critically
unloved “Orphans” said yesterday that the revival’s run will
end May 19, six weeks earlier than the planned June 30 closing.  Although the show received two Tony Award nominations last
week (for Best Revival of a Play and for Tom Sturridge’s
performance in a supporting role), the star, Alec Baldwin, was
passed over.  Ticket sales dipped below the show’s weekly running costs
to $398,000, according to figures released by the trade
association the  Broadway League . That’s down 11 percent from the
previous week and off 40 percent since the Lyle Kessler three-character drama began previews in March.  “Orphans” needed to take in about $440,000 a week to pay
expenses and royalties, according to a budget obtained from the
office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The show
was capitalized at about $3 million.  Baldwin was guaranteed a weekly salary of $50,000 and an
undisclosed share of profits, of which there will be none.  Tony nominations were announced on April 30. Sales jumped
10 percent for Christopher Durang’s comedy “Vanya and Sonia and
Masha and Spike.” Four of its actors, including David Hyde Pierce, were nominated. It grossed $449,000, a new high, with
room to grow. It’s playing to two-thirds capacity.  Lucky Bette  “Lucky Guy” with best actor nominee Tom Hanks, sold $1.4
million. Bereft of a single nod, “I’ll Eat You Last,” with
Bette Midler, still broke the record at the tiny Booth Theatre
-- again. Sales soared 17 percent to $753,000.  With just one nomination, for best musical revival,
“Annie” continued its slide, falling to $648,000, its lowest
since opening in November. Producers are hoping Jane Lynch
provides glee when she takes over as Miss Hannigan next week.  Overall, Broadway box office was little changed from the
previous week, taking in $24.6 million. Sales this season, which
ends in three weeks, are up 0.4 percent from 2011-12. Attendance
is down 5.5 percent, while average ticket prices are up.  Without a best musical nomination (but packed with familiar
hits), “Motown” held steady at $1.2 million.  The Cyndi Lauper musical, “Kinky Boots,” with 13
nominations, saw sales increase 3 percent to $1.1 million. Its
chief rival for the top Tony, “Matilda,” also sold $1.1
million.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and
 Richard Vines  on London dining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
