Pantheon Ventures LLP, a private-equity fund investor overseeing $24 billion, hired Michael Riak
from  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  as the firm seeks to expand its
reach to investors saving for retirement.  Pantheon appointed Riak to a newly created position as head
of U.S. defined contribution, according to an e-mailed statement
today from the London-based company. Riak, 45, is leaving his
position as director of savings and affiliate plans at Verizon.
He will start at Pantheon in June and be based in New York,
according to the statement.  “Adding high-quality private-equity investments to defined
contribution plans will help address participants’ need for
higher returns, bringing to bear the benefits of an asset class
long enjoyed by defined benefit plans and other institutional
investors,” Riak said in the statement.  Private-equity firms including  Carlyle Group LP (CG) ,  Blackstone
Group LP (BX)  and  KKR & Co. (KKR)  are looking for ways to reach ordinary
investors as a growing number of workers are pushed out of
public and corporate pension funds to so-called defined
contribution plans such as 401(k)s.  Americans held $3.57 trillion in 401(k) plans as of Dec.
31, according to the Washington-based Investment Company
Institute, a trade group for the mutual-fund industry.  Pantheon, which has offices in London,  San Francisco , New
York and Hong Kong, invests money on behalf of more than 400
institutions in private-equity funds, co-investments alongside
managers, secondary transactions and infrastructure programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
