Lynas Corp. (LYC) , the Australian company
building the world’s largest rare earths plant in Malaysia, rose
the most since January as the Southeast Asian nation’s
government extended its 55-year rule.  Lynas rose 13 percent to A$0.54 in Sydney trading at 10:35
a.m., the most since Jan. 7. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 1.1 percent.  Prime Minister Najib Razak’s coalition retained a
parliamentary majority in an election held yesterday, defeating
opposition leader  Anwar Ibrahim , who has disputed the results
and has said he would review Lynas’s permit for the plant if he
won power. The company began production in February at its
11,000 metric ton-capacity first-phase refinery in Pahang state
after protests and legal challenges over radiation concerns.  Lynas declined to comment on Malaysia’s election result or
stock price movement,  Cameron Morse , a spokesman for Lynas who
works for FTI Consulting, said by phone from Perth.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
