ERHC Energy Inc. (ERHE) , an independent oil
and gas explorer in  Africa , said it has signed a letter of
intent to sell part of its interest in an exploration block in
 Kenya .  ERHC and its potential partner will negotiate terms of an
agreement for Block 11A, which will be subject to government
approval, the Houston-based company said in a statement today.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K. explorer that found billions of
barrels from Uganda to French Guiana, in November said it had
made a second discovery in Kenya, which has East Africa’s
biggest economy, raising prospects the country will become an
oil producer.  James Arnold, an investor relations manager at Tullow,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on
whether the company was a partner in the block. Daniel Keeney, a
spokesman for ERHC, also didn’t respond to an e-mail request to
identify the partner.  ERHC signed a production-sharing contract with the Kenyan
government for the almost 12,000 square-kilometer (7,456 square-
mile) block in July, the company said. Block 11A is located on
the border of South Sudan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
