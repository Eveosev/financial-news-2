The  European Central Bank  is ready to
cut  interest rates  further if the economic outlook in the euro
area worsens, Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said.  The central bank last week lowered its  benchmark rate  by a
quarter point to a record low of 0.5 percent. “It’s a historic
low and we’ll cut again if indicators confirm the situation is
deteriorating,” Coeure said in an interview with  France Inter 
radio posted on its website.  The  17-nation euro economy  will shrink more than previously
estimated in 2013 as part of a two-year slump that has driven
unemployment to a record high, the European Commission said on
May 3. Gross domestic product in the currency bloc will fall 0.4
percent this year, more than the 0.3 percent predicted in
February, the commission forecast.  Coeure urged governments in the region to work together to
revive growth without giving up on the effort to trim deficits.  “Of course we need a strategy for returning to growth,”
Coeure said. “That doesn’t mean we need more spending. Creating
more debt is not going to solve the problem of growth in
 Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
