The yield on South  Korea ’s five-year
bonds rose the most in three weeks on speculation investors who
were betting  interest rates  would fall sold debt after central
bank Governor Kim Choong Soo signaled they may stay on hold.  Kim said yesterday that the 50 basis points of monetary
easing last year were “very big,” Yonhap News reported.
Fourteen of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
benchmark  seven-day repurchase rate  will be left at 2.75 percent
on May 9, while four predict a 25 basis-point reduction.  “As Kim gave a firm view about the legitimacy of interest
rates on hold,  market sentiment  leaned toward the rate staying
at the current level,” said Yoon Yeo Sam, a fixed-income
analyst at Daewoo Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Anticipation of the
BOK’s interest-rate cut rose after the  European Central Bank 
lowered interest rates last week and as the improvement in U.S.
jobs data eased economic concerns.”  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due March 2018 climbed
10 basis points to 2.62 percent in Seoul, the biggest increase
since April 11, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc. It
reached a record low of 2.5 percent last week. The rate on 10-
year securities rose seven basis points to 2.8 percent.  Bank of Korea  has kept borrowing costs unchanged since
October, defying pressure from the government for a reduction
even as a weaker yen threatens to hurt exports.  Won Gains  South Korea’s won closed at an eight-week high as the U.S.
employment numbers boosted optimism about a global economic
recovery. A report on May 3 showed the jobless rate unexpectedly
fell to a four-year low in the Asian nation’s second-biggest
export market after  China .  The won appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,094.48 per dollar in
Seoul and earlier touched 1,092.29, the highest level since
March 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
gained 0.7 percent against the yen, taking the advance this year
to 12.2 percent.  One-month implied volatility in the won, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.86
percent.  South Korea’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to $328.8
billion as of the end of April, from $327.4 billion at the end
of March, the Bank of Korea said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
