Bank of America Corp.  and  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  will be sued by New York for allegedly violating terms of
a $25 billion nationwide settlement over foreclosure practices.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has documented
339 violations since October 2012 of the settlement reached last
year with 49 states and the federal government, the office said
in a statement today.  Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among five lenders
that entered into the settlement, which established mortgage
servicing standards and provided mortgage relief to homeowners.
Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ally Financial Inc.
were also part of the settlement.  The agreement stemmed from a probe by state attorneys
general into claims of abusive foreclosure practices following
the collapse of the housing bubble.  Dan Frahm , a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
Bank of America, and Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo, didn’t immediately respond to
emails seeking comment about New York’s announcement.  Schneiderman has a press conference planned for later
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
