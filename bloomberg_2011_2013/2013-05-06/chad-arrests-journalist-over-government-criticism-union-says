Chadian authorities arrested a
journalist who has criticized President Idriss Deby’s
government, according to the central African country’s
journalists union.  Eric Topona, the secretary-general of the Chadian Union of
Journalists, was arrested today for causing “trouble to the
constitutional order,” Abba Mahamat Moussa, the union’s
president, said by phone from the capital, N’Djamena. The union
was “troubled by the unexplained arrest,” he said. Topona’s
father, Celestin, is the head of the opposition National Union
for Development and Renewal party.  The authorities arrested two generals after a failed coup
attempt May 1 in which at least eight people died.  Chad  detained
General Weiding Assi Assoue, a former defense minister and
regional governor, and General David Ngomine Beadimadji, head of
gendarme training in the military tribunal, as well as two
lawmakers for their role in the alleged coup bid.  Chad, which produces 114,000 barrels of oil a day and has a
$9.49 billion economy, has been ruled by Deby since he seized
power in a coup in December 1990.  In 2008, 270 people were killed during fighting between
government forces and rebel fighters who entered N’Djamena in an
attempt to overthrow Deby, according to  Medecins Sans
Frontieres , the Geneva-based medical charity.  Communication Minister Hassan Sylla Bakari didn’t answer
calls to two of his mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
