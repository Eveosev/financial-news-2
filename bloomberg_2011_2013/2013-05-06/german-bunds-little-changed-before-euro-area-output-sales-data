Spain ’s 10-year government bonds
declined for the first time in three days as an industry report
showed the nation’s services industries contracted in April,
damping demand for the country’s assets.  The securities also dropped before the nation auctions
bonds for the first time in almost three weeks on May 9.
 Portugal  hired banks to sell debt maturing in February 2024,
according to a person familiar with the matter. German  10-year
yields (GDBR10)  were little changed, after climbing the most since
January on May 3, as a report showed euro-area services and
manufacturing shrank for a 15th month in April.  “The release of the services data was lower than expected,
which cooled off the excitement among investors,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV
in Amsterdam. “Moreover, the auction can create pressure.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year bonds  climbed seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.11 percent at 5:38 p.m.
 London  time. The 5.4 percent security due in January 2023 fell
0.57, or 5.70 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,307) face amount, to
110.19. The rate dropped to 3.94 percent on May 3, the  lowest 
since May 2010.  The yield on Portuguese securities due in October 2023 was
little changed at 5.51 percent.  An index of services in Spain dropped to 44.4 in April from
45.3 the previous month,  Markit Economics  said today. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Spanish Auctions  Spain is due to sell as much as 4.5 billion euros of
securities due in 2016, 2018 and 2026 at an auction on Thursday.
It last sold bonds on April 18. Portugal’s debt sale will begin
and be priced in the near future, subject to market conditions,
according to the person familiar with the arrangements, who
asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to
speak about it.  Markit said today its euro-area  composite index , based on a
survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing and services, was
at 46.9 in April, up from an initial reading of 46.5 on April
23, and compared with a median estimate of 46.6 in Bloomberg
News  survey  of 25 economists.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.24 percent. The rate fell to
1.15 percent on May 2, the lowest level since July 23, when it
matched the record low of 1.127 percent.  Analysts from Barclays Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc last week reduced their yield forecasts for the securities
after the  European Central Bank  cut  interest rates  on May 2.  Yield Forecasts  The yield will rise to 1.40 percent at end this quarter,
Barclays analysts including head of European fixed-income
strategy Laurent Fransolet in London wrote in a note on May 3.
That compares with a previous forecast of 1.60 percent.  RBS expects the yield to fall to 1.1 percent at the end of
June, compared with 1.15 percent previously, analysts led by
London-based head of European rates strategy  Andrew Roberts 
wrote in a note the same day.  The average response of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg survey,
with the most recent projections given the heaviest weightings,
calls for the 10-year bund yield to increase to 1.42 percent by
the end of this quarter.  The ECB cut its main refinancing rate on May 2 and signaled
it was open to a negative deposit rate to boost the economy.  Euro-area  retail sales  dropped 0.1 percent in March from
the previous month, when they fell a revised 0.2 percent, the
European Union’s statistics agency in Luxembourg said today.  German bonds returned 0.8 percent this year through May 3,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
gained 8.9 percent and Italian debt earned 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
