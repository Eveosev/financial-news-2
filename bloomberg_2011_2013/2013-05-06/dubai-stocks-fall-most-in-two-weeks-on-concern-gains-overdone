Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  dropped
the most in more than two weeks on concern a rally this quarter,
prompted by an economic recovery in the emirate, was overdone.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, (DIB)  the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
Shariah-compliant lender, fell 1 percent, trimming the surge in
the second quarter to 47 percent.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  lost the most
since March 31. The DFM General Index retreated 0.9 percent, the
most since April 18, to 2,149.53 at the close in Dubai. The
measure climbed to the highest since November 2009 yesterday.  Today’s drop pared the DFM’s gain this quarter to 18
percent, the best performance among 94 indexes tracked by
Bloomberg globally. Shares on Dubai’s benchmark trade at a
 price-to-book value  of 0.9 times, the highest level in more than
three years. The gauge’s 14-day  relative strength index  fell to
75 today from 81. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts
that a security or index is poised to retreat.  The decline is due to “expected profit-taking activities
after the market reached new highs for the year,” said  Marwan Shurrab ,  fund manager  and chief trader at Gulfmena Investments
Ltd. in Dubai. “Over all, the market is moving in a bullish
formation and I would expect further upside.”  Economic Rebound  The second-biggest sheikhdom in the U.A.E. is recovering
from a property crash and a debt crisis helped by a rebound in
tourism, trade and retail. Dubai’s economy is set to expand 4.6
percent, on average, between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the
growth of the previous four years, according to government
forecasts.  Shares with a  combined value  of 473 million dirhams ($129
million) traded today, compared with a three-month daily average
of 330 million dirhams.  Dubai Islamic Bank retreated to 2.96 dirhams, while Air
Arabia, the region’s biggest budget airline, decreased 3 percent
to 99.9 fils. The shares surged 26 percent in April.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All
Share Index lost 0.2 percent. Benchmarks in  Abu Dhabi  and
Bahrain gained 0.4 percent, Oman’s rose 0.2 percent and Qatar’s
0.6 percent. Kuwait’s gauge was little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
