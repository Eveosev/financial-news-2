Hearsay Social Inc., the marketing
company co-founded by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  board member Clara Shih,
is introducing a tool that lets banks and insurers make sales
through Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.  Hearsay Social intends the service, starting today, to be a
bridge between the social networks and companies’ internal
sales-tracking systems that complies with internal and
government regulations, so employees can be comfortable closing
a sale through the sites.  “Social media only matters if it can drive sales,” said
Shih, who joined the Starbucks board at the suggestion of
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg . “While
companies are trying to figure out how to drive more ‘Likes,’
we’re trying to drive more sales.”  Hearsay is building on top of the social networking sites
that consumers use, rather than those built for companies, like
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Yammer or  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) ’s Connections.  The San Francisco startup is betting that networks of
followers on Facebook and Twitter, built out by a brand’s
marketers and advertisers, will help drive direct sales, said
Steve Garrity, chief technology officer and co-founder with
Shih.  “Once you have an engaged fan base and salespeople
positioned as reputable commentators, you’re ready to start
closing business, and this is what that does,” Garrity said.  The company has 55,000 customers, including banks and
insurers such as Allstate Corp. and  MetLife Inc. (MET) , Shih said. The
company has raised $21 million in  venture capital .  To contact the reporter on this story:
