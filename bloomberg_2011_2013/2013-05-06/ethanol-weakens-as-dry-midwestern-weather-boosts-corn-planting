Ethanol weakened versus gasoline on
speculation that dry weather in the Midwest helped corn farmers
plant more of the biofuel feedstock.  The spread, or price difference, based on June contracts
expanded 7.83 cents to 34.47 cents a gallon, as corn plunged on
forecasts for weather considered favorable for farmers to move
equipment into fields. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. Renewable Identification Numbers declined.  “As far as the corn situation, a lot of farmers were able
to get out in the fields over the weekend,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst for Price Futures Group in Chicago. “We
had wonderful weather. That’s putting some downward pressure on
ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery slipped 3.8 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.521 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 4.03 cents to $2.8657 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  About 42 percent of this year’s corn crop will go toward
ethanol production, the Agriculture Department said in its April
10 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report.  Companies across the Midwest cut output or idled plants
after last summer’s drought boosted corn prices to a record and
wiped out returns on making the biofuel.  Ethanol Production  Production averaged 857,000 barrels a day in the week ended
April 26, 4.1 percent lower than a year earlier and 11 percent
below the record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011, data
from the Energy Information Administration show.  Corn for July delivery dropped 24.75 cents, or 3.7 percent,
to $6.365 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread for July was 11 cents a gallon. That
compares with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  About 12 percent of the crop was  planted  as of yesterday,
up from 5 percent a week earlier, the Agriculture Department
said in a report today.  Below-normal production rates have left ethanol stockpiles
at the  lowest levels for this time  of year in records going back
to June 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles fell 3.2 percent to 17 million barrels in the
week ended April 26, the lowest since November 2011, according
to data from the Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Fuel Blend  The fuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates. A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to
use 13.8 billion gallons of the renewable fuel this year and
14.4 billion next year.  Compliance with the law is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached to each
gallon of biofuel that refiners can submit to the government or
trade.  The value of  corn-based ethanol RINs  increased 2 percent to
77.5 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs,
which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol
increased 4.2 percent to 87.5 cents.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline supply in the week ended April 26, up from
93 percent the previous week and the most since April 5, EIA
said in May 1 report.  Ethanol Imports  U.S. companies didn’t make any  foreign purchases  of the
fuel that week, after importing 39,000 barrels a day of ethanol
in the week ended April 19, EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.58 a gallon as of
April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped
4.5 cents to $2.775 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost
1 cent to $2.71; in Chicago the fuel fell 1 cent to $2.65; and
in  New York  the biofuel declined 3 cents to $2.77 a gallon, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the Gulf slipped 3.5
cents to 6.5 cents, the tightest since Jan. 16, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor contracted 2 cents to 12 cents, the
smallest in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
