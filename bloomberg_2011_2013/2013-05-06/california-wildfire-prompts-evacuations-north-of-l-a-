Californians are preparing for a
prolonged season of wildfires after an unusually dry winter that
left millions of acres of scrub brush in the most populous U.S.
state primed to burn.  The tinder-box conditions have sparked more than  840
wildfires  since January, about 320 more than the five-year
average, according to the state Forestry and Fire Protection
Department, known as Cal Fire. A fast-moving fire in Ventura
County over the weekend charred an area the size of  San
Francisco , forced the evacuation of a college with 4,900
students and threatened 4,000 homes northwest of Los Angeles.  Wind-swept fires across the state following similarly dry
winter months in 2008 burned more than 1.2 million acres and
killed 13 firefighters, according to Cal Fire. In 2007,
firestorms swept through  Southern California , destroying 1,500
homes, displacing almost a million residents and killing 17.  “It’s pretty shocking that we are having fires of this
size already,” said Bill Stewart, a professor of forest
economics and policy with the  University of California  at
Berkeley. “It could be a big one. I wouldn’t be surprised if we
surpassed 2007.”  The  California Department of Water Resources  announced May
2 that the state’s snowpack was 17 percent of normal. January
through March was the  driest first quarter on record  for the
state, according to the California State Meteorologist.  Budget Cuts  The dangerous conditions come as automatic  federal budget 
cuts called sequestration means the  U.S. Forest Service  has to
cut its budget even though the agency expects this year’s fire
season to match and or possibly exceed last year, when 9.3
million acres burned. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has said
the cuts mean his agency will hire about 500 fewer seasonal
firefighters than normal.  Governor  Jerry Brown  in 2011 signed a budget that reduced
the number of firefighters assigned to each engine to three from
four as a way save money and help erase what was then a $10
billion deficit. The move restored staffing levels on each truck
to where they were before October 2003, when 14 separate massive
firestorms scorched more than 750,000 acres, destroyed 1,700
homes and killed 24 people.  Brown told a panel of federal judges May 2 that one way he
could comply with their order to reduce overcrowding in state
prisons was to move 1,300 inmates to camps where they can be
deployed to help on the fire lines. California currently has
about 3,700 inmates in such camps.  1,800 Firefighters  More than 1,800 firefighters over the weekend battled a
blaze known as the Springs Fire south of Camarillo in Ventura
County. Strong  Santa Ana  winds spread the blaze to more than 43
square miles (111 square kilometers) before crews were able to
stall its growth yesterday.  The fire, now mostly under control, had forced officials to
evacuate  California State University ,  Channel Islands , and close
down portions of State Route 1, known as the Pacific Coast
Highway. While no homes were destroyed, 15 were damaged, the
Ventura Fire Department said.  Stewart said that even with the dry conditions, how long
and often strong winds blow through the summer months will
determine whether the state suffers the kinds of massive fires
that struck in 2007 and 2008.  “It’s the high winds that really drives up the acreage and
pushes the fires up into subdivisions,” he said. “We know we
have dry fuel on the ground, we know it’s going to be warm, but
what we don’t know yet is how often we are going to have
winds.”  Red Flag  The  National Weather Service  had issued red flag warnings
for most of  Los Angeles  and Ventura counties over the weekend
because of the dry Santa Ana winds, which blow desert air toward
the Pacific coast. The warning alerts area residents and
firefighters that conditions are ideal for rapidly spreading
wildfires.  Cal Fire has 4,700 full-time firefighters and foresters who
are aided by another 8,700 seasonal and local workers. The state
also uses prisoners to fight wildfires. The Corrections
Department said 82 crews, consisting of 1,093 inmates and 97
guards, were assisting in battling 14 fires across the state.  “We have already seen a big increase in the number of
fires that normally occur at this time of year, and summer
hasn’t yet arrived,” Mark Ghilarducci, secretary of the
 California  Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement.  Colorado Fires  Large wildfires aren’t limited to California. Colorado
suffered its most destructive fire season last year, with dozens
of blazes fueled by drought-ravaged grass and beetle-killed
timber. Flames destroyed at least 600 homes and charred more
than 116,000 acres. Damage was estimated at more than $450
million, with the Waldo Canyon blaze, which consumed entire
neighborhoods in the foothills around  Colorado Springs , becoming
the most expensive fire in state history.  More than  153,000  acres have burned across the U.S. this
year, though that’s half how much were scorched during the same
period in 2012, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center out of Boise,  Idaho .  To contact the reporter on this story:
