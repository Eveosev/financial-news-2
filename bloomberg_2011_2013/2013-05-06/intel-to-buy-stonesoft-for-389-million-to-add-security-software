Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, offered to buy Finland’s  Stonesoft Oyj (SFT1V)  for $389
million in cash to expand the product offering of its McAfee
security-software business.  Stonesoft investors will get 4.50 euros ($5.90) a share,
more than double the May 3 closing price, the companies said
today, sending the stock soaring. Stonesoft Chief Executive
Officer Ilkka Hiidenheimo, Chairman Hannu Turunen and Timo
Syrjaelae, a board member, who together hold 34.7 percent of
shares, accepted the offer. The Helsinki-based company’s board
recommends the deal.  The purchase would let McAfee expand its network-firewall
and evasion-prevention offerings as it competes against rivals
such as  Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  Santa Clara, California-based Intel
bought McAfee in 2011 for about $7.7 billion to add security
software to its chip-making arsenal.  “The mega-trend for cyber security isn’t showing any signs
of slowing down as you’re always hearing about some corporation
being hacked,” said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes Oy
in Helsinki. “Stonesoft has the potential to see strong growth
so this is a pretty good deal for Intel, and the offer price
makes it a good deal for Stonesoft shareholders.”  Stonesoft  shares  more than doubled, rising as high as 4.48
euros and closed at 4.45 euros in Helsinki trading. They had
jumped 42 percent this year through May 3. Intel slipped 0.1
percent to $23.93 at 12:49 p.m. in New York.  Rising Sales  The deal’s premium of 128 percent over the May 3 closing
price compares with an average premium of 96 percent in 51
computer-security deals over the past 12 months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stonesoft, founded in 1990, shed assets and scaled back its
product range during the past decade as sales waned amid
increasing competition. For 2012, the company reported 31
percent increase in sales to 40.1 million euros and earnings of
1 cent a share. Last month, it projected sales growth of 50
percent for this year. The company had 265 workers at the end of
March.  The acceptance period for the offer is scheduled to start
on May 21 and run for three weeks.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising Intel and  UBS AG (UBSN)  is
assisting Stonesoft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
