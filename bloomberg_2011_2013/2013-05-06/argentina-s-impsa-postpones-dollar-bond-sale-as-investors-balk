Argentine wind-farm operator
Industrias Metalurgicas Pescarmona SA postponed a dollar bond
sale as investors demanded higher yields than the company was
willing to pay.  Impsa, as the Mendoza, Argentina-based company is known,
had been planning to sell five-year notes overseas to yield
about 11 percent, Carla Paira, a press official, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. Existing bonds due in 2020
tumbled, pushing yields up 1.08 percentage points to a four-
month high of 13.35 percent at 1:30 p.m.  New York  time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was lack of agreement between the company and the
investors over the pricing,” Paira wrote. “Impsa will keep
monitoring the market in search of new opportunities.”  The company had hired Barclays Plc, Banco Bradesco SA and
UBS AG to arrange meetings with investors from April 29 to May
1, according to a person familiar with the discussions who asked
not to be identified because the meetings were to be private.
Argentine companies haven’t borrowed in overseas debt markets
since May 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
