Serbia ’s government will hold talks
with leaders of a majority-Serb area in northern  Kosovo  to
implement a deal normalizing the country’s relationship with its
former province, Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said.  “This is a good time to change Serbia’s image in the world
and we shouldn’t give away this opportunity,” Dacic told
journalists in Vienna today after meeting Austria’s Vice
Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.  Serbia and Kosovo initialed an European Union-mediated deal
on improving ties and have yet to work out details. The
government needs to implement the deal so that the EU’s members
can decide on starting negotiations with Serbia on joining the
bloc, Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said April 26.  The accord has raised criticism from Serbs in northern
Kosovo over concerns that their interests are being sacrificed
to benefit Serbia’s bid for EU membership. Serbia and Kosovo
have been at loggerheads since the wars of the 1990s that led to
the breakup of  Yugoslavia . Kosovo is recognized by the U.S. and
22 of the EU’s 27 members.  The talks aren’t about recognizing Kosovo as a sovereign
state and nobody has to fear that jobs will be lost, Dacic said.
