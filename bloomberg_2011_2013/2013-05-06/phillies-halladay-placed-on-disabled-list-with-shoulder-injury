Roy Halladay was placed on the 15-day
disabled list after allowing 17 earned runs in his past two
Major League Baseball starts.  Halladay is experiencing inflammation in his pitching
shoulder, the Philadelphia Phillies said yesterday on their
Twitter account. He allowed nine earned runs in 2 1/3 innings
two days ago in a 14-2 loss to the Miami Marlins, and said after
the game that he’s pitched through pain since late April.  “This kind of progressed over the last two weeks or so,”
the 35-year-old right-hander said, according to MLB.com. “This
is something new this spring.”  The two-time Cy Young Award winner is 2-4 this year with an
8.65 earned-run average. His 4.5 walks per nine innings is more
than double his career average of 1.9.  In 2010, his first season in Philadelphia, Halladay won the
Cy Young Award as the National League’s best pitcher after
throwing a perfect game in the regular season and a no-hitter in
the playoffs. He’s won at least 20 games three times in his
career, most recently in 2010.  Left-handed pitcher Joe Savery was recalled from the team’s
Triple-A affiliate to fill Halladay’s roster spot, the Phillies
said. Savery appeared in one game this year with Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
