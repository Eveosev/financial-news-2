Abengoa SA (ABG) , the largest developer of
solar-thermal power plants, will build and operate a $110
million waste-to-energy plant in Arizona.  The facility in Glendale will process about 180,000 tons of
municipal solid waste annually to generate 15 megawatts of
electricity, according to a statement today from Seville, Spain-
based Abengoa.  The company will maintain the plant under a 30-year
agreement with Chicago-based Vieste Energy LLC, a renewable-
energy developer.  Abengoa is also expected to complete this year a second-
generation biofuel plant in Kansas, and has developed water
desalination plants in regions including Africa and Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
