German stocks advanced for a fifth day
after the DAX Index rallied last week to its highest level ever,
as  France  declared an end to austerity, while  Germany  indicated
a willingness to be flexible on deficit reduction.  Linde AG gained 4.3 percent after reporting first quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as acquisitions made in
2012 boosted revenue. Xing AG climbed 0.9 percent after posting
a rise in first quarter revenue.  The DAX added 0.2 percent to 8,140.83 at 10:10 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark ended last week at 8,122.29, a
record closing high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The broader HDAX Index advanced 0.3 percent today.  In France, Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said the era
of austerity over, while his German counterpart offered
flexibility on deficit cutting. “We’re witnessing the end of
the dogma of austerity” as the only tool to fight the euro debt
crisis, Moscovici said yesterday on Europe 1 radio. “We’ve been
pleading for a growth policy for a year. Austerity on its own
impedes growth.”  Germany’s Wolfgang Schaeuble said there is a “certain
flexibility” in allowing France and  Spain  to meet deficit
targets, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported yesterday.  A report at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time may show euro-area
retail sales declined 0.1 percent in March after a 0.3 percent
drop the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of 27
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
