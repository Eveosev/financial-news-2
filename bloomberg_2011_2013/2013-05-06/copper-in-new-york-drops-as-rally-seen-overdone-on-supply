Copper futures declined in  New York  on
speculation the 6.8 percent rally at the end of last week was
overdone, given the outlook for surplus.  Refined metal production will exceed demand through 2015,
Morgan Stanley said in a report today. Money managers increased
bets that prices are heading lower for the first time in four
weeks as of April 30, U.S. government data show.  “The copper market is now shifting from a long period of
constrained mine supply to one in which new mine capacity growth
brings about the long-awaited return of the refined market to
moderate surpluses,” Morgan Stanley said. “Investor sentiment
has deteriorated and price performance has been lackluster so
far this year.”  Copper for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $3.3015 a
pound by 7:19 a.m. on Comex in New York. The 6.8 percent jump
May 3 due to U.S. jobs growth was the most since October 2011.  Money managers had net-short  positions , or wagers on
falling prices, equal to 23,368 futures and options as of April
30, up from 15,727 a week earlier, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data released on May 3 show. The net-short
positions had declined for the past three weeks.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
