Brent crude  climbed to a three-week
high as  Syria  threatened retaliation against  Israel  for an air
strike. The European benchmark grade’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate oil widened from a 16-month low.  Prices rose 1.3 percent after Syria’s state news agency
said Israeli aircraft attacked a military research center on the
outskirts of Damascus yesterday. The  Middle East  accounted for
33 percent of global crude output in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy. The gap between WTI and
Brent grew for the first time in three days. Gains accelerated
after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed to a record.  “Brent is leading the way higher, which is consistent with
international supply concerns,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “We are also
getting some broader rebalancing of the market. The U.S.
products and Brent got cheap compared to WTI, so they are
leading the way today while WTI lags.”  Brent crude for June settlement increased $1.27 to end the
session at $105.46 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange, the highest closing level since April 10. The
volume for all contracts traded was 40 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day at 3:35 p.m. in New York. U.K.
businesses were closed for a public holiday.  WTI oil for June delivery increased 55 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $96.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the highest settlement since April 2. Volume for all contracts
was 20 percent above the 100-day average.  Widening Spread  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $9.30 to WTI
futures. It ended the May 3 session at $8.58, the narrowest
differential based on settlement prices since December 2011.  Brent is the benchmark for half of the world’s oil. WTI
price gains are limited because of ample U.S. crude supplies.  Syria will use “any means” to protect its people, Omran al-Zoubi, the country’s information minister, said on state TV.
Syria deployed rocket batteries directed toward Israel, the pro-
government Damas Post website said.  Israel didn’t confirm involvement in the assault. The
Israeli army said it readied two Iron Dome missile defense
systems in the north of the country. They are designed to
intercept and destroy rockets capable of flying as far as 70
kilometers (44 miles).  Mideast Conflict  “The Israeli attacks on Syrian targets are raising fears
that the Syrian civil war could turn into a regional conflict,”
said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in New York.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  was little changed.  WTI and equities climbed last week after U.S. employment
rose more than forecast and the  European Central Bank  cut
 interest rates  to a record low.  Hedge funds and other money managers boosted  bullish bets 
on Brent crude in the week ended April 30 after three
consecutive declines, according to data from ICE. Speculative
bets that prices will rise, in futures and options combined,
outnumbered short positions by 108,741 lots, the exchange said
today in its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The gain of
9,614 contracts came after net longs hit their lowest level
since Dec. 11 the previous week.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
 hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
increased by 11,554 futures and options combined, or 6.3 percent
to 193,962 in the seven days ended April 30, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s May 3 Commitments of
Traders report.  Fuel Prices  Gasoline for June delivery rose 4.03 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $2.8657 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement since
April 9. Trading volume was 16 percent below the 100-day
average.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery increased 3.58
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.9202 a gallon on volume that was 32
percent below the 100-day average. It was the highest settlement
since April 10.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest crude exporter, raised
the June premium used to set official selling prices for its
Arab Light blend for buyers in  Asia  and trimmed discounts on all
grades to the Mediterranean and Europe.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 23.7 percent, up from 22.5 on May 3.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 579,865
contracts as of 3:36 p.m. It totaled 690,787 contracts May 3, 18
percent above the three-month average. Open interest was 1.77
million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
