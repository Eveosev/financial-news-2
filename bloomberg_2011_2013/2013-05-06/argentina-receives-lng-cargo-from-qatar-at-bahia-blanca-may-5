Argentina received a cargo of
liquefied natural gas from  Qatar  over the weekend, according to
ship-tracking data.  The Gemmata, with a capacity of about 135,000 cubic meters,
arrived yesterday at the port of Bahia Blanca southwest of
Buenos Aires, according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from Qatar’s Ras Laffan
port where it loaded the supercooled natural gas.  Officials from Energia Argentina SA, the state-run energy
company known as Enarsa, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment outside normal working hours. Brian Devlin,
Qatargas’ Doha-based spokesman, didn’t reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. Yousra Koura, a Rasgas spokesman in Doha didn’t
respond to a call to his phone seeking comment.  Argentina has no long-term LNG-purchase contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Enarsa and YPF SA have
issued seven spot purchase tenders seeking as many as 150
cargoes from December last year. YPF’s latest tender for seven
LNG shipments delivered to Bahia Blanca in the second half of
2013 closes today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
