Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish construction
company that has built more than 70 desalination plants
globally, won a 50 million-euro ($66 million) contract to design
and build Gabon’s biggest drinking water-treatment plant.  The water division of the company, which is based in the
Madrid suburb of Alcobendas, will build a plant with a daily
production capacity of 140,000 cubic meters, enough to supply
Gabon’s capital of Libreville and its surrounding neighborhoods
for at least 15 years, Acciona said today statement.
Construction is expected to last 20 months, it said.  Acciona has previously built two mini-hydropower plants and
two highways in Gabon, as the African country pursues a public
investment and economic program to transform the heavily oil-
dependent nation into a diversified emerging market economy by
2025, according to a  report  from the International Monetary
Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
