Gold’s rally from a two-year low may
not endure as the metal will probably drop to test a key support
at $1,227.20 by the end of the year, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Bullion for immediate delivery rallied 4.8 percent in the
past two weeks through May 3 after entering a  bear market  last
month. The metal touched $1,321.95 an ounce on April 16, the
lowest level since January 2011. Cash gold advanced 0.4 percent
to $1,476.61 an ounce by 1:40 p.m. Seoul time.  The “current minor bounce” should be followed by a
decline toward the support of $1,307.80 and $1,301.12, where the
2011 low and 50 percent retracement of the 2008-2013 increase
are found, London-based analysts Karen Jones and Axel Rudolph
said in a report last week. If the levels are breached, the 2009
high of $1,227.20 will become the next support, they said.  Gold slumped 12 percent this year after rallying for the
previous 12 years. Holdings of global exchange-traded products
backed by the metal have declined 14 percent this year to the
lowest since October 2011.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support levels are marked by
clusters of buy orders, according to technical analysts, who say
that past moves may be used to predict trends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
