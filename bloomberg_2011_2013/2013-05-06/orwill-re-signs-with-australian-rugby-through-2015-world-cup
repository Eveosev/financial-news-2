James Horwill  signed a new two-year
contract with the Australian Rugby Union and Queensland Reds
Super Rugby team that takes the Wallabies’ 2011 Tri-Nations-
winning captain through the 2015 World Cup.  Second-rower Horwill, who’s been restricted to 35 Test
matches for Australia after injuries ruled him out of the 2010
and 2012 international seasons, also led the national team to
third place at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.  “Obviously it’s been frustrating at times, but you have to
take the bad with the good,” Horwill, 27, said in an e-mailed
statement. “I’m happy to have my future resolved.”  Horwill played his most-recent Test in December 2011. He
missed all  Australia ’s matches last year because of a ruptured
hamstring that also delayed his start to the 2013 Super Rugby
season and is aiming to regain his Wallabies spot for the series
against the British and Irish Lions starting June 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
