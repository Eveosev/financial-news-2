Russia’s ruble-denominated bonds
rallied, pushing yields to record lows, as oil gained and
investors speculated the central bank will cut  interest rates .  The yield on the benchmark OFZ due February 2027 fell eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.77 percent by 12:05
p.m. in Moscow, extending a decline of 55 basis points in April.
The ruble weakened 0.2 percent against Bank Rossii’s target
dollar-euro basket to 35.4526. The Russian currency lost 0.1
percent against the dollar to 31.0825.  The “key idea on the market” of Bank Rossii’s lowering
interest rates in May will allow the yield on the 2027 OFZ to
decline to 6.50 percent in “the mid-term,” Dmitriy Gritskevich, an analyst with OAO Promsvyazbank in Moscow, said
in a note to clients. The central bank will cut the refinancing
rate by 25 basis points this quarter to 8 percent, according to
the median forecast of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Oil in  London  rose for a third day, gaining 0.2 percent to
$104.42 per barrel. Oil and gas export provide as much as 50
percent of the Russian state budget revenue.  Flows into Russia-dedicated funds increased to $327 million
in the week to May 1, OAO Gazprombank said in a research note
today, citing EPFR Global data. Inflows into emerging markets-
dedicated bond funds reached a record high of $2.54 billion, the
bank said.  The Federal Statistics Service plans to publish consumer-
price data for April tomorrow or on May 8. In March  annual
inflation  declined to 7.0 percent from 7.3 percent in the
previous month.  Putin’s Demand  President  Vladimir Putin  has called on the government to
submit a plan on boosting the economy as it grows at the slowest
pace since a 2009 contraction. Bank Rossii cut rates on loans
backed with gold and non-market collateral, as well as the costs
of some longer-term repurchase operations, by 25 basis points on
April 2.  Both  India  and the European Central Bank cut rates last
week. While other central banks have reduced borrowing costs,
Bank Rossii has resisted, creating “pressure” on policy
makers, according to Tradition Analytics.  “As a result there is room for Russian bonds to strengthen
further through May after a strong showing in April,” Tradition
Analytics said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
