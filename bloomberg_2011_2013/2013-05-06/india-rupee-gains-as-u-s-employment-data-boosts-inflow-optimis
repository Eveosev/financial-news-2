India’s rupee rose for the first time
in three days on speculation U.S. jobs growth will bolster
demand for emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  were steady.  The  unemployment rate  in the world’s largest economy fell
to a four-year low and payrolls expanded more than economists
forecast, reports showed on May 3. Global funds boosted holdings
of Indian shares by a net $300 million on May 2, the most in a
month, exchange data show. The rupee’s gains will be limited
after central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said there was very
little chance monetary policy would be eased further.  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 53.87 per dollar as of
9:49 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This compares with gains of 0.4 percent for the  Thai baht  and
the  Taiwan dollar . One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.43 percent.  “Good U.S. data is favorable for flows into  Asia ,” said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong
Kong . “The rupee’s gain is lower relative to other Asian
currencies today, showing that the  Reserve Bank  of India’s
guidance is weighing on the currency.”  The RBI lowered its repurchase rate to 7.25 percent from
7.50 percent on May 3, the third cut this year, to boost an
economy growing at the slowest pace in a decade. “The baseline
case is that the possibility of easing is practically non-
existent,” Subbarao said in a Bloomberg TV  India  interview in
Mumbai on May 4. Any expectation that the outlook is for
“another salvo” of loosening is “inaccurate,” he said,
adding inflation and the current-account deficit will determine
the path of monetary policy.  Debt Buying  The central bank will buy as much as 100 billion rupees
($1.9 billion) of debt due in 2017, 2024, 2025 and 2032 tomorrow,
the monetary authority said in an e-mailed statement after the
market closed on May 3. The RBI may have to boost the frequency
of debt purchases to manage cash in the banking system until
economic conditions allow more easing, Kowalczyk said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was
little changed from May 3 at 7.75 percent in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.85 per
dollar, compared with 54.92 on May 3, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 54.55
versus 54.42. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
