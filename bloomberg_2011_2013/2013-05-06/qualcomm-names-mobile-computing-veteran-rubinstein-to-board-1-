(Corrects fourth paragraph of story from May 6 to show
that Qualcomm has 12 directors.)  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the largest seller of
semiconductors for mobile phones, named former  Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  executive Jonathan Rubinstein to its board.  Rubinstein, 57, has more than 30 years of experience in the
mobile, computing and consumer-electronics industries, San
Diego-based Qualcomm said today in a statement.  Rubinstein was senior vice president for product innovation
at Hewlett-Packard until January 2012. He served as chairman and
chief executive officer of mobile-computing company Palm Inc.,
which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010. At Apple,
Rubinstein contributed to the creation of the iPod and
overhauled the company’s engineering teams and product plans
leading up to the introduction of the iMac computer.  Qualcomm, whose chips dominate the mobile-phone market, is
trying to move into tablet and computer chips, putting it into
competition with  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest semiconductor
maker. Rubinstein will become the 12th board member at Qualcomm,
where Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs also serves as
 chairman .  Qualcomm  shares  rose less than 1 percent to $63.86 at the
close in New York. They have gained 3.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
