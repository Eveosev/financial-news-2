Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) ’s board recommended
shareholders vote for a  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  takeover bid at a
meeting this month, even while saying it’s not ready to announce
a decision on a counteroffer by  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   In a letter to investors, Clearwire said it was endorsing
the $2.97-a-share bid after rejecting an earlier Sprint offer of
$2.60. After consulting with independent financial and legal
advisers, the board’s special committee concluded that the
current price is fair. Sprint, which already owns more than 50
percent of Clearwire, is seeking to buy the remaining stake in a
$2.2 billion deal.  “The Clearwire board has unanimously concluded that the
proposed transaction with Sprint is the best strategic
alternative for stockholders, representing fair, attractive and
certain value, especially in light of the company’s limited
alternatives and the well-known constraints of its liquidity
position,” the Bellevue, Washington-based company said in the
statement.  Investors are scheduled to vote on the offer on May 21.
While it’s endorsing the Sprint bid, Clearwire said the move
doesn’t represent a decision on a $3.30-a-share counteroffer
from Dish, a satellite-TV company that’s also attempting a
separate takeover deal for Sprint itself.  Clearwire has “no decision yet to announce” on Dish, said
Mike DiGioia, a spokesman for the company. “Other offers,
including the one from Dish, remain under evaluation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
