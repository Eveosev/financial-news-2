Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S.
meat processor, fell the most in more than two months after
cutting its full-year revenue forecast and posting quarterly
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as feed costs rose.  The shares dropped 4.9 percent to $23.70 at 9:59 a.m. in
New York after earlier  falling  6.2 percent, the most intraday
since Feb. 26. Revenue in the fiscal year through September will
be about $34.5 billion, the Springdale, Arkansas-based company
said today in a statement. In February, it  forecast  $35 billion.  Earnings excluding one-time items were 36 cents a share in
the three months through March 30, compared with the 45-cent
average of 11  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.8
percent to $8.42 billion, trailing the $8.57 billion average of
11 estimates.  Tyson said it sees higher chicken-feed costs in the full
fiscal year. The 2012 drought in the U.S., which led to higher
grain costs, is also leading to increased costs for hog and
cattle producers, it said. Tyson predicts a decline of as much
as 3 percent in fed cattle and a drop in beef exports.  “Our EPS for the quarter wasn’t at the level we’d like,
but on an adjusted basis, we’re about where we were at this
point last year,” Chief Executive Officer Donnie Smith said in
the statement. “I’m still confident our results for 2013 will
be better than 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
