The  World Trade Organization  upheld a
complaint filed by the European Union and  Japan  against local-
content requirements in the Canadian province of Ontario’s
green-energy program.  The WTO’s Appellate Body today maintained a previous finding 
that provisions in Ontario’s Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) program 
requiring a minimum local content in renewable power projects 
violate the WTO’s “national treatment” rules, Bloomberg BNA 
reported.  Under these rules, countries must not treat imported goods
differently from locally produced goods in the application of
national laws, regulations and requirements. The FIT program
grants generators of wind and solar energy a guaranteed price
for power delivered into the provincial electricity system
provided they meet a minimum required domestic content level in
the development and construction of the qualifying generation
facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
