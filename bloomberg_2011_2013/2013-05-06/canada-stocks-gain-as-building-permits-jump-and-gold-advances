Canadian  stocks  rose for a third day
as financial and industrial shares gained amid a jump in
building permits and commodities producers advanced as gold
prices rallied.  Penn West Petroleum Ltd. advanced 7.1 percent after
appointing Rick George, former chief executive officer of Suncor
Energy Inc., as its new chairman. Rubicon Minerals Corp. and
Barrick Gold Corp. rallied at least 1.8 percent as gold
increased. Canadian National Railway Co. and Bombardier Inc.
increased 1.5 percent as industrial shares rallied.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 42.43
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,480.46 at 10:13 a.m. in Toronto,
the highest level since April 11. The benchmark equity gauge has
gained 0.4 percent this year.  Canadian building permits rose for a third month in March,
with the faster-than-expected gain led by government buildings
in  Alberta  and schools in Ontario.  Gold gained in New York on signs of a slowdown in investor
sales of exchange-traded funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
