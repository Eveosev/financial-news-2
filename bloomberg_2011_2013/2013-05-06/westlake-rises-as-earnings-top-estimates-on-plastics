Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK) , the U.S.
plastics maker controlled by the billionaire Chao family, gained
the most in six months after posting first-quarter earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as margins widened on price gains.  Westlake rose 4.9 percent to $86.50 at 9:16 a.m. in  New
York . The shares earlier rose as much as 6.1 percent, the most
intraday since Oct. 16.  Net income rose to a record $123.3 million, or $1.84 a
share, from $87.8 million, or $1.31, a year earlier, Houston-
based Westlake said today in a statement. That tops the $1.28
average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales of $864.6 million exceeded the average estimate of $856.8
million.  Chief Executive Officer Albert Chao, whose family owns 69
percent of Westlake, is boosting production along the U.S. Gulf
Coast as hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, cuts costs for
natural gas, a key raw material for plastics. Costs for raw
materials and energy fell in the quarter while prices rose for
products such as PVC pipe.  “Pricing initiatives for polyethylene and PVC appear to
have also contributed meaningfully during the quarter, leading
to improved year-over-year and sequential margin improvement,”
Don Carson, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial
Group who rates the shares neutral, said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
