Virtus Health Pty Ltd.,  Australia ’s
biggest provider of fertility services, plans to sell shares in
an initial public offering that may raise A$291.5 million
($298 million), according to a presentation document.  Virtus, part-owned by buyout firm Quadrant Private Equity
Pty Ltd., and its investors will sell shares at A$4.92 to A$5.68
each, according to the material obtained by Bloomberg. The stock
will start trading on June 14 and part of the funds will be used
to pay debt, according to the document. A spokeswoman for
Sydney-based Virtus declined to comment on the deal’s details.  After the sale, Virtus will have a market capitalization of
as much as A$449.4 million, according to the presentation,
making it the largest company to start trading on the Australian
 stock  exchange since October. The company’s 33 fertility clinics
in Victoria, Queensland and New South  Wales  provided 35 percent
of the IVF treatment cycles performed last year in Australia,
according to the presentation.  The stake held by the company’s fertility doctors will be
cut in half to about 23 percent after the share sale, while
Sydney-based Quadrant will reduce its 46.5 percent holding to
about 10 percent and have one seat on the Virtus board,
according to the presentation.  The share sale is being conducted by  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Morgan
Stanley, according to the document.  To contact the reporters on this story:
