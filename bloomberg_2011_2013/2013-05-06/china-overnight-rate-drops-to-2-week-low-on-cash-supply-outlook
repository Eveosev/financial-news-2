China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped to a two-week low on speculation cash supply will
improve after banks meet their  reserve requirements .  Chinese lenders have to adjust cash holdings placed with
the central bank on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month. The
People’s Bank of China gauged demand for seven- and 14-day
reverse-repurchase contracts and 28-day  repurchase agreements ,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions.  “Banks have borrowed enough cash before making payments
today,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China
Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “There
is a temporary improvement in cash supply.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, to 2.79 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched 2.64 percent, the lowest
level since April 22. The  seven-day rate  fell three basis points
to 3.20 percent.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed six basis points to 3.28 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.52 percent government bonds due February
2023 rose two basis points to 3.44 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
