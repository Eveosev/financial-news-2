Bakken oil on the  spot market  weakened
after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  restarted the pipeline that takes the crude
to its pricing point in  Minnesota  from fields in North Dakota
and Montana.  Enbridge Inc. restarted Line 81, which can carry as much as
210,000 barrels a day into Clearbrook, Minnesota, on May 4, said
Larry Springer, a Houston-based spokesman for the company.
Enbridge shut the line May 2 after crews discovered contaminated
soil near the pipe in North Dakota during an integrity
inspection.  Bakken oil in Clearbrook weakened by 75 cents to $4.75 a
barrel below West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, at
12:07 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the
widest discount for the crude since Jan. 14. The spread weakened
by $1 to $5.50 a barrel, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc.  Bakken  production  in  North Dakota  increased 6.2 percent to
715,150 barrels a day in February, according to the state
Industrial Commission. The Enbridge line is the only pipeline
out of the Bakken region. About 71 percent of crude production
from the formation left North Dakota by train in February,
according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
