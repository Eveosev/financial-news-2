PG&E Corp. (PCG)  should pay $2.25 billion
for a 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion in  California  that
killed eight people, the city of San Bruno said.  The city recommended to the California Public Utilities
Commission that PG&E pay the state a $1.25 billion cash fine,
San Bruno officials said in a statement today. PG&E and its
shareholders also should have to pay another $1 billion in
planned pipeline safety work and not be allowed to collect
reimbursement for those costs from customers, the city said.  “We call on the CPUC to demonstrate that it is a tough
regulator by imposing fines and penalties that will send a
message that safety is a top priority and that gross negligence
and recklessness will not be tolerated,” San Bruno Mayor Jim Ruane said today at a press conference ahead of PG&E’s annual
shareholder meeting in San Francisco.  Parties today are submitting their recommendations for
fines in a state regulatory probe into a PG&E gas line blast
that destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno. The commission probably
will assess a final penalty later this year, PG&E Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Anthony Earley said during an earnings
conference call last week.  PG&E, based in San Francisco, fell $1.3 percent to $46.63
at 1:18 p.m. in  New York .  Enhancing Safety  “PG&E has taken accountability and we fully expect a
penalty from the CPUC,” Brittany Chord, a PG&E spokeswoman,
said in a telephone interview. “The amount of that penalty is
still an open question, but we believe every dollar of any
penalty should be directed into work that enhances the safety of
the system and benefits PG&E customers.”  Separately, the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy
group, is recommending that PG&E pay $1 billion to fix neglected
pipelines and $720 million in fines and other penalties,
according to an e-mailed statement.  The CPUC’s Consumer
Protection and Safety Division is expected to file its demand
for fines and penalties later today.  The blast has cost PG&E’s shareholders $1.4 billion in
mandated safety work and other expenses, the company said on May
2. It precipitated the retirement of former Chairman and CEO
Peter Darbee and forced the state’s largest utility owner to
freeze its dividend. PG&E has set aside at least $200 million
for fines, according to a May 2 regulatory filing.  An administrative law judge still must rule on the fines
and make a proposed decision for penalties. The five-member
CPUC, which may amend that proposal, will then have to vote on
the final penalty.  Analysts have estimated the fine will be $477 million,
according to a January Wells Fargo & Co. report produced on
behalf of PG&E.  To contact the reporter on this story:
