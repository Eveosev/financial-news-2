(Corrects mass-market gambling revenue in 6th paragraph.)  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest
casino company, posted a 12 percent increase in first-quarter
profit as high-stakes gamblers spent more at its 20 casinos in
Macau.  Net income rose to HK$1.92 billion ($247 million) from
HK$1.71 billion a year earlier, according to a statement to the
 Hong Kong  Stock Exchange. Gambling revenue climbed 10 percent to
HK$21.7 billion.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or adjusted Ebitda, rose 11 percent to HK$2.1
billion.  SJM is benefiting as new attractions, more hotel rooms and
an improved rail connection draw more mainland Chinese visitors
to Macau, the world’s biggest gambling center. Deutsche Bank AG
estimated casino revenue will rise 17 percent to $44.5 billion
this year.  Macau is the only place in China where casinos are legal.
The city raked in a record $38 billion  gross gaming revenue  last
year, with two-thirds of that coming from the high-stake
gamblers, or so-called VIPs.  SJM’s gambling revenue from VIPs, or high rollers, rose 13
percent to HK$15.1 billion for the quarter ended in March. Mass
market revenue climbed 4.7 percent to HK$6.22 billion.  SJM, founded by Hong Kong tycoon  Stanley Ho , faces rising
competition as rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  expand. They have been adding new
attractions such as shopping malls and entertainment shows in
their resorts on Macau’s increasingly popular Cotai strip to woo
gamblers.  SJM, the former casino monopoly, runs 20 out of the 35
casinos in Macau. None of its casinos are located on the Cotai
strip, a piece of reclaimed land that’s been built into Asia’s
equivalent of the Las Vegas strip. It won a land grant in
October to build its first casino resort in Cotai strip.  Shares of SJM climbed 2.5 percent to HK$19.76 in Hong Kong
before the earnings announcement. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
gained 0.99 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
