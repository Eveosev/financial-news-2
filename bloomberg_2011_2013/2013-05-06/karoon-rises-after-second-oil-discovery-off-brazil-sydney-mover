Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR) , an explorer
with prospects in  South America , rose the most in four years in
Sydney trading after making its second oil discovery this year
off the coast of  Brazil .  Karoon climbed  as much as 28 percent to A$5.12, the most
since April 27, 2009, while Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index gained as much as 1.4 percent. The shares traded at A$4.96
as of 11:48 a.m. local time.  Oil was found at the Bilby-1 exploration well in Brazil’s
 Santos Basin , with evaluation of the discovery expected to
continue through May, the Mt. Martha, Victoria-based company
said today in a statement. That follows the company’s oil
discovery at the Kangaroo-1 well in January.  Karoon, cited in December as a possible takeover target by
Citigroup Inc., is exploring off the coasts of Brazil and Peru
after scrapping a proposed initial public offering of its South
American business in November 2010. Colombia’s  Pacific Rubiales
Energy Corp. (PRE)  agreed in September to acquire a 35 percent stake
in Karoon’s blocks off Brazil.  Work is under way to obtain a drilling rig to appraise the
Kangaroo and Bilby fields and other prospects, Karoon said today.
The three-well drilling program comprising Kangaroo, Emu and
Bilby will finish after the evaluation of Bilby-1, the company
said. Oil was confirmed from sampling a more than 200-meter
(656-feet) section, Karoon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
