Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a provider of
water-purification systems that use activated carbon and
ultraviolet light, reported first-quarter results that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Sales slipped to $135 million compared with $137 million a
year earlier while earnings of 18 cents a share on a profit of
$9.8 million topped seven analysts’ median estimate of 14.5
cents a share, Pittsburgh-based Calgon said today in a
statement.  The company, whose shares have risen 21 percent this year,
expects margins to increase after completing the second phase of
its cost-reduction plan and price increases take effect, Chief
Executive Officer Randy Dearth said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
