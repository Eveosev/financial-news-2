Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest drugmaker, has started offering its impotence drug Viagra through a company-sponsored website to combat counterfeit versions that are sold online.  Men prescribed the erectile dysfunction medicine can order the drug at Viagra.com. The prescriptions will be verified and completed by Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest U.S. provider of  prescription drugs .  “There are almost 24 million searches a year for Viagra online,” said Victor Clavelli, senior director in Pfizer’s primary care unit, said in a company statement. By helping men obtain Viagra through the official website, the company seeks to “rein in the distribution” of fake versions of the drug.  Pfizer in 2011 conducted a chemical analysis of pills purchased from 22 websites that ranked high in an online search for the phrase “buy Viagra.” The analysis found that roughly 80 percent of the pills claimed to be Viagra were counterfeit and didn’t contain full doses of the active ingredient as advertised, the New York-based company said in the statement.  Sales of Viagra were $2.05 billion in 2012, Pfizer reported in a regulatory filing.  The website “is providing a resource for patients to be able to get their prescription in a safe and legitimate way,” Jennifer Kokell, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in a telephone interview. “We expect to learn from this.”  Pfizer  shares  rose 1.1 percent to $29.03 at the close in  New York . The company has gained 29 percent in the past 12 months.
