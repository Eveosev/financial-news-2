Harvard University  and the
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology  agreed with the city of
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where both schools are located, to
jointly promote sustainable uses of energy and other resources.  The two universities and the city will collaborate on
designing long-term strategies for coping with climate change
and incubating “green” technologies that can be replicated by
other communities, Harvard said today in a statement on its
website. Companies including  Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) , Novartis
AG’s Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research and Whole Foods
Market Inc. will also participate, Harvard said.  MIT scientists have been developing efficient sources of
power through an energy initiative that was started by former
president Susan Hockfield seven years ago. Harvard and MIT are
already collaborating with the city on sustainability projects
such as the Hubway bike-sharing system, the schools said in
separate statements.  “We have much to gain from continuing to work together to
confront  climate change ,” Harvard President Drew Faust said in
the school’s statement. “I hope other leaders across the city
are inspired to join us -- and our partners in the private
sector -- in creating a healthier and more sustainable
Cambridge.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
