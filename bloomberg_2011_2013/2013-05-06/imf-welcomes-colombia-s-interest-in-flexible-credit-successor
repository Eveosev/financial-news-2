The  International Monetary Fund 
welcomed  Colombia ’s request to renew its precautionary credit
line with the fund and protect its economy from potential
shocks.  While Colombia’s economy is expected to grow faster than 4
percent this year, “downside risks remain significant,” Deputy
Managing Director Nemat Shafik said in an e-mailed statement
today.  A successor to the current credit line, which was approved
two years ago, “would provide Colombia with useful protection
against external tail risks and as, with previous arrangements,
allow the country to preserve policy flexibility, while
strengthening its policy buffers further,” she said.  Shafik said she’ll “move rapidly” to seek approval from
the IMF’s board. The fund in 2011 agreed to a $6.2 billion
 credit line .  “A sharp worsening in global economic and financial
conditions would adversely affect the outlook for Colombia’s
exports, growth and financing needs,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
