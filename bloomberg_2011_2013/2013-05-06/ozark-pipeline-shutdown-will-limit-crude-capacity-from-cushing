Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s planned shutdown of
the Ozark pipeline for 10 days starting June 10 will reduce
capacity to move oil from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Enbridge will shut the line, which has the capacity to
carry 215,000 barrels of crude a day to Wood River, Illinois,
from Cushing, for planned maintenance, said Larry Springer, a
Houston-based spokesman for the company. Monthly throughput will
be reduced by 40 percent, he said.  The shutdown will cut takeaway capacity from Cushing by
about 70,000 barrels a day for the month, said  Andrew Lebow ,
senior vice president for Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .  “It will have a very modest impact, but it shouldn’t be a
game-changer,” Lebow said. “Unless something goes wrong with
the maintenance and the outage is longer, then it could become
more significant.”  Crude  supplies  at Cushing fell 1.38 million barrels in the
week ended April 26 to 49.8 million, according to Energy
Department data. Inventories rose to a record 51.9 million
barrels on Jan. 11.  Stockpiles have more than tripled since 2008 amid surging
domestic production and lagging infrastructure. The glut in
Cushing has caused West Texas Intermediate futures, which
averaged a premium over European Brent futures before 2011, to
drop to an average discount of $17.47 a barrel in 2012.  That discount has shrunk by more than half since Feb. 8,
when it reached $23.44 in intraday trading, as  Enterprise
Products Partners LP (EPD)  and Enbridge’s Seaway pipeline increased
flows out of Cushing and other companies ramped up projects to
move crude from West Texas to the  Gulf Coast  instead of Cushing.
The discount grew 72 cents to $9.30 a barrel today.  “If this was a year ago, it would be a lot worse,” Lebow
said of the Ozark shutdown. “Now that the infrastructure is
being built, takeaway is much more efficient than it was a year
ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
