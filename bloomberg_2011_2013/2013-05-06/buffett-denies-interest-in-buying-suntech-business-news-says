Warren Buffett , chairman of  Berkshire
Hathaway (BRK/A)  Inc., has no plans to buy Suntech Power Holdings Co.,
the China Business News said, citing an interview with him.  Buffett said he has never had interest in acquiring the
solar company, China Business said, citing comments during an
interview at Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting.  Suntech, the Chinese solar company with its main unit in
bankruptcy proceedings, has gained 27 percent since the Hong
Kong Economic Times reported on April 8 that Buffett’s
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. may purchase the company.  Wuxi, China-based Suntech slipped 7.4 percent to 61.14
cents when last traded in New York on May 3, taking its decline
for the year to 60 percent. The company said last week that its
bankrupt unit will meet with creditors earlier than anticipated
as it reported a 48 percent drop in revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
