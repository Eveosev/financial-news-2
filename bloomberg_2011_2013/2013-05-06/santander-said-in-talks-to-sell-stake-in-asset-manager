Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest
bank, is in talks to sell a minority stake in its asset
management unit to U.S. private-equity firms Warburg Pincus LLC
and General Atlantic LLC, two people familiar with the situation
said today.  Talks are at an advanced stage and a deal could be reached
soon, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the transaction isn’t public yet.  Santander has been selling off assets, including a stake in
its  Mexican (SANMEXB)  bank last year and its Colombian lender in 2011, as
it seeks to bolster capital ratios after absorbing losses on
Spanish real estate holdings. The bank’s asset management arm
had about 160 billion euros ($210 billion) of funds under
management at the end of the first quarter.  The London-based Sunday Times  reported  the plans yesterday.
A spokesman for Santander, who asked not to be identified in
line with bank policy, declined to comment.  Santander’s former Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz
said in an April 25 news conference that the bank was in talks
over for its asset management business with potential
“partners” that may be interested in participating in a
“bigger” project. The bank abandoned a previous attempt to
sell the asset management and insurance businesses in 2008
because of market conditions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
