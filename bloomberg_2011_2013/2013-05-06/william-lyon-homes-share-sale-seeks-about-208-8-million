William Lyon Homes (LWHS) , a builder that
emerged from bankruptcy last year, seeks to raise as much as
$208.8 million in a public stock offering.  The company, which trades over the counter, and an existing
stockholder plan to sell 8.7 million shares for $22 to $24 each,
according to a statement today by the Newport Beach, California-
based builder.  William Lyon joins at least two U.S. homebuilders that have
conducted public offerings this year as investors seek to
capitalize on the housing market recovery. In March, U.S.
builders  broke ground  on homes at an annual pace of more than 1
million for the first time since June 2008, according to the
Commerce Department. Demand for new construction has been
increasing as buyers seeking to take advantage of low  mortgage 
rates find a tight  supply  of existing homes for sale.  Backers of William Lyon Homes include Paulson & Co., the
firm run by John Paulson, who earned $15 billion in 2007 betting
against subprime mortgages; Luxor Capital Group LP, a New York-
based investment manager; and Thomas Barrack Jr.’s Colony
Capital LLC, which lent $206 million to William Lyon before its
bankruptcy. Luxor is offering about 2.2 million shares in the
sale and will trim its stake to 30 percent from 47 percent.
Paulson’s stake will decrease to 11 percent from 14 percent, and
Colony’s stake will drop to 3.9 percent from 5 percent.  Homebuilder IPOs  Tri Pointe Homes Inc., an  Irvine , California-based builder
backed by Barry Sternlicht and co-founded by former William Lyon
executives Doug Bauer, Thomas Mitchell and Michael Grubbs,
raised $267.6 million in a January IPO, including the
overallotment option.  Taylor Morrison Home Corp., based in Scottsdale,  Arizona 
and backed by Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital Group LLC and David Bonderman’s TPG Capital, raised $722.9 million in an April IPO,
including the overallotment option.  William Lyon Homes had a net loss of $11.6 million on
revenue of $372.8 million from Feb. 25, 2012, when it emerged
from bankruptcy, to Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.
The company sold 883 homes for an average price of $277,000 at
communities in  California , Arizona,  Nevada  and  Colorado .  The company had a net loss of $3.5 million or 3 cents a
share for the quarter ended March 31, according to a May 3
