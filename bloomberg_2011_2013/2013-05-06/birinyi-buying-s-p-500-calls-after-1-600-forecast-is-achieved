Birinyi Associates Inc., whose
prediction the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  would reach 1,600
came true last week, purchased options betting on more gains.  Birinyi, among the first to advise buying U.S. stocks
before the bull market began in 2009, said the  S&P 500  may climb
18 percent to 1,900 should it conform to bull markets that began
in 1982 and 1990. The Westport, Connecticut-based firm run by
Laszlo Birinyi bought an unspecified amount of $170  calls  on the
 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) , according to a report e-mailed to
 Bloomberg News  today. They will become profitable if the S&P 500
gains more than 5 percent by December.  “In addition to the historical parallels, we still view
sentiment as subdued and nowhere approaching extremes,”
Birinyi, president, and Jeffrey Yale Rubin, an analyst at the
firm, wrote in the May 3 report.  The S&P 500 has jumped 13 percent this year and added 4
percent since April 5, when a report showed employers in March
added the fewest workers in nine months, less than the most-
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The index  rallied  2
percent last week to 1,614.42, an all-time high, and surpassed
Birinyi’s previous target of 1,600 as earnings reports exceeded
analyst estimates and home sales rose.  The  exchange-traded fund  that tracks the S&P 500 rose 0.3
percent to a record $161.78 at 10:39 a.m. New York time. The S&P
500 advanced 0.2 percent to 1,617.69. The December call contract
on the ETF grants the right to buy 100 shares of the fund for
$170.  Birinyi’s year-end forecast compares with the 1,601 average
of 17 Wall Street strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose
estimates range from 1,390 to 1,760.  The S&P 500 has gained 139 percent since March 9, 2009, led
by consumer, financial and industrial stocks. The bull market is
the biggest since an eight-year advance of 302 percent in the
1990s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
