The friend of the former KPMG LLP
partner in  Los Angeles  who allegedly provided him with insider
information about the auditor’s clients agreed to plead guilty
and to pay about $1.3 million in illegal profits, the U.S. said.  Bryan Shaw, 52, the owner of a San Fernando Valley jewelry
store, agreed to admit to one count of conspiracy, according to
a statement today from U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los
Angeles. The former KPMG partner, Scott London, 50, was charged
last month after Shaw had started to cooperate with prosecutors.  “These two men were close friends who shared dinners,
concerts, sporting events and secret information that brought
profits to each of them,” Birotte said in the statement.
“London provided, and Shaw was all too happy to use,
proprietary information that should have remained
confidential.”  Nathan Hochman , Shaw’s lawyer, didn’t immediately return a
call to his office for comment on the plea agreement.  London’s lawyer said after his client’s initial court
appearance that he expected London to plead guilty at his
arraignment May 17. London is accused of passing inside
information about  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  and  Skechers USA Inc. (SKX)  in
exchange for cash, jewelry and concert tickets.  The case is U.S. v. London, 13-mj-01058, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
