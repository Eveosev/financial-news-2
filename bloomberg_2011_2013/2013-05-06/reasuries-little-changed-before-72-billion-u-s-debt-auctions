Treasury 10-year note yields  rose  to a
three-week high as the U.S. prepared to sell $72 billion of debt
this week with the jobs market showing signs of recovery.  The U.S. will auction $32 billion in three-year notes
tomorrow, $24 billion in 10-year notes the next day and $16
billion of 30-year bonds on May 9. The 10-year yield rose 11
basis points on May 3, the most since Sept. 14, after a report
showed employment gained more than forecast in April and the
 unemployment rate  fell to a four-year now.  “The good jobs report and the auctions are weighing on the
market,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Federal Reserve. “One decent number aside, not much
has changed, as the economy is still weak and the Fed is still
buying. We are nearing the top of the yield range and these
cheaper levels should bring in decent demand to the auction
process.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.76 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2
percent note due in February 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000
face value, to 102 4/32. The yield reached the highest since
April 12.  Bond trading was closed in Europe and  Asia  for holidays.  Bill Rates  Rates on Treasury one-month bills  fell  below zero for the
first time since Dec. 31, reaching negative 0.005 percent.  Benchmark yields traded above the 200-day moving average
for the first time since April 12. The difference between yields
for  U.S. debt  maturing in two and 10 years widened to 1.56
percentage points, the most since April 10.  Benchmark 10-year note yields could fall as low as 1.5
percent by the middle of the year, Dominic Konstam, global head
of interest-rates research in New York at Deutsche Bank AG, a
primary dealer, wrote in a note to clients on May 3.  “The Fed retains a ‘wait and see’ stance with regard to
the scope of the global slowdown,” he wrote. “This suggests to
us that yields can continue to fall toward the cyclical lows
until it becomes clear that either the slowdown was a transient
pause that refreshes, or a more serious slowdown that warrants
additional response.”  Debt Auctions  The $72 billion of debt sold this week comes as $59.6
billion of outstanding debt will be paid down and as the  Federal
Reserve  is scheduled to buy as much as $12.3 billion in
Treasuries this week.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$721 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.01 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The auctions are going to fare pretty well because of the
set-up we saw last week,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co. “There’s still demand for Treasury paper.”  Market-based expectations for the path of inflation in the
next 10 years have moderated, with the  difference  between 10-
year yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and U.S.
debt not indexed for inflation narrowing to 2.30 percentage
points, down from 2.59 percentage points on March 14. The
difference, known as the break-even rate of inflation, equals
the market’s forecast for the rate of increase in consumer
prices.  Price Data  Inflation rose 1 percent in March, the slowest since
October 2009, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, the
personal consumption expenditure index deflator. The index rose
1.3 percent in January and February.  “There are reasons why we’re at these yields,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams
Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors.  Bond investors are gaining confidence that Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  will unwind the central bank’s unprecedented $3.3
trillion  balance sheet  without sparking a crash similar to 1994,
when former Fed Chairman  Alan Greenspan  surprised the market by
doubling  benchmark  lending rates in 12 months.  Though sovereign-debt levels have more than quadrupled to
$23 trillion, yields for  10-year Treasuries (USGG10YR)  are 5 percentage
points lower than they were in 1994 and forward measures show
the current 1.74 percent level rising only to 2.04 percent in a
year. Policy makers’ forecasts of no rise in the target interest
rate for overnight loans between banks until 2015 are damping
yields in a market dominated by the Fed’s $1.84 trillion, or
15.4 percent of the $11.94 trillion in marketable U.S. debt.  Fed Policy  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement
following a two-day meeting in  Washington  on May 1 that it will
maintain its bond buying at the current monthly  pace  of $85
billion and is prepared to raise or lower the level of purchases
as economic conditions evolve. Policy makers also left in place
their statement that they plan to hold the target rate around
zero as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  Payrolls expanded by 165,000 workers last month following a
revised 138,000 increase in March that was larger than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed May 3 in Washington.
The median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected a 140,000 gain. The jobless rate fell to 7.5 percent,
the lowest since December 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
