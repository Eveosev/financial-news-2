Lending units of  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and  Ford Motor Co. (F) , the two largest U.S. automakers, are selling
$3.5 billion of bonds.  General Motors Financial intends to issue $2 billion of
senior notes in its first debt offering in almost nine months to
help fund its purchase of Ally Financial Inc.’s international
operations and to repay debt, the company said today in a
regulatory filing.  Ford Motor Credit today sold $1 billion of 1.7 percent,
three-year notes that yield 140 basis points more than similarly
dated Treasuries and $500 million of floating-rate securities
with the same maturity that pay 125 basis points more than the
London interbank offered  rate , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, was set at 0.275 percent today.  The GM debt will probably be issued in three-, five- and
10-year portions and may be sold May 8, according to a person
familiar with that offering who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set. Proceeds will be used to finance a
portion of its $4.2 billion deal for  Ally (ALLY) ’s operations in  Europe 
and  Latin America , to repay an inter-company loan and to fund
working capital.  Formerly GMAC  Ally, formerly known as GMAC Inc., was owned by GM until
2006, when the automaker sold 51 percent to Cerberus Capital
Management LP. GMAC almost collapsed under the weight of bad
subprime mortgages during the financial crisis.  GM last issued new bonds in August with a $1 billion sale
of 4.75 percent securities due 2017, Bloomberg data show.  The GM finance unit’s $500 million of 6.75 percent debt due
June 2018 traded May 2 at 114.5 cents on the dollar to yield
3.59 percent, or 294.7 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Those bonds are rated
Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service and an equivalent BB- at
 Standard & Poor’s .  Ford’s offering may be used for the purchase of
receivables, for loans and for retiring debt, the  unit  said
today in a filing. The company is rated Baa3 by Moody’s, the
lowest level of investment grade, and BB+ by S&P, the highest
category of speculative grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
