Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-largest video-game publisher, reached a multiyear agreement with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  to create games based on “Star Wars” characters after Disney said it would stop making them itself.  Under the agreement announced yesterday, Electronic Arts, based in  Redwood City ,  California , gains the right to develop new “Star Wars” titles for game consoles, computers and mobile devices. Disney will “retain certain rights to develop new titles within the mobile, social, tablet and online game categories,” the companies said in a joint statement.  The deal, terms of which weren’t disclosed, expands upon an existing agreement  Electronic Arts (EA)  had with Lucasfilm Ltd. to license “ Star Wars ” characters for an online multiplayer title for personal computers called “Star Wars: The Old Republic.”  Disney in October agreed to buy Lucasfilm in a cash and stock deal valued at about $4.05 billion, adding to franchises it already owns including Pixar and Marvel. In April, it said it would shutter LucasArts, the San Francisco-based game-making branch of Lucasfilm with the plan of licensing other companies to make “Star Wars” games rather than develop them internally.  “Our agreement unlocks a whole new future of ‘Star Wars’ games that will span consoles, PCs, tablets, mobile and more,” Frank Gibeau, president of Electronic Arts’ Labels unit, said in a  blog  posting yesterday.  Electronic Arts rose as much as 2.8 percent in extended trading after climbing 1.9 percent to $18.29 at the close in  New York  yesterday. Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose less than 1 percent at the close to $65.06.
