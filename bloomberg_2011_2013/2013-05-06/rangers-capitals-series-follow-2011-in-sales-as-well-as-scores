The  New York  Rangers’ playoff series
with the  Washington Capitals  is mirroring their matchup of two
years ago, and so are resale ticket prices.  The clubs met in the first round of the 2010-11 National
Hockey League playoffs and the Capitals won the first two games
at home, just as they did to open this year’s postseason.  With the series moving to Madison Square Garden for Game 3
tonight, the least expensive resale ticket is $134, or $3 less
than Game 3 in 2011, according to the secondary-market ticket
aggregator  TiqIQ .  “Get-in is fairly comparable to that series, which makes
sense since the Rangers come back to MSG in the same position,
down 2-0,” said Chris Matcovich, a spokesman for New York-based
TiqIQ. “It wouldn’t be a big surprise to see prices rise
steadily if the Rangers are able to win tonight to get the
series back to 2-1, similar to 2011 as well.”  The cheapest tickets for Game 4, scheduled for May 8,
currently are $129, which is $19 less than the equivalent 2011
contest. The Capitals won the 2011 best-of-seven series in five
games. Resale prices for all games averaged $373 that year, $24
more than this year’s matchups.  A Rangers’ loss tonight “should create a fairly sharp
sell-off,” Matcovich said in an e-mail. “Buyers who are
speculating that the team will win and want to go to Game 4
should buy now.”  Washington , the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, has
never won the  Stanley Cup . The sixth-seeded Rangers’ most recent
championship was in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
