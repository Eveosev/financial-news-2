German stocks  were little changed
after the  DAX (DAX)  Index rallied last week to its highest level ever,
as  France  declared an end to austerity, while  Germany  indicated
a willingness to be flexible on deficit reduction.  Linde AG gained to its highest since at least 1992 after
reporting first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as
acquisitions made in 2012 increased sales. Xing AG climbed 1.4
percent after reporting an increase in first-quarter revenue.  The DAX added 0.1 percent to 8,132.26 at 10:25 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark ended last week at 8,122.29, a
record closing high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The benchmark has risen 6.8 percent this year amid speculation
that central banks will maintain their stimulus measures. The
broader HDAX Index also gained 0.1 percent today.  “From a technical perspective, the strong movement of the
DAX, rising 2 percent on Friday to close at a new record level
can be interpreted as a new buying trigger,” Roger Peeters,
chief executive officer at Close Brothers Seydler Research in
Frankfurt, wrote in a note. “The intraday, all-time high is
only around 30 points away and investors are asking the
question, when will the market reach a new all-time-high?”  In France, Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said the era
of austerity is over, while his German counterpart offered
flexibility on deficit cutting. “We’re witnessing the end of
the dogma of austerity” as the only tool to fight the euro debt
crisis, Moscovici said yesterday on Europe 1 radio. “We’ve been
pleading for a growth policy for a year. Austerity on its own
impedes growth.”  Deficit Flexibility  Germany’s Wolfgang Schaeuble said there is a “certain
flexibility” in allowing France and  Spain  to meet deficit
targets, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported yesterday.  A report at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time may show euro-area
 retail sales  declined 0.1 percent in March after a 0.3 percent
drop the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of 27
economists.  Linde, which is competing with Air Liquide SA to be the
world’s biggest industrial gas producer, advanced 3.8 percent to
148.15 euros. Operating profit climbed 13 percent to 953 million
euros ($1.25 billion), the Munich-based company said, beating
the 935 million-euro average estimate of eight analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 10 percent to 3.99 billion euros.  Xing climbed 1.4 percent to 40.54 euros. The professional-
networking provider reported first-quarter revenue of 19.6
million euros, compared with 17.7 million a year earlier.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
rose by 11 percent to 5.3 million euros.  Celesio AG rose 3.8 percent to 15.82 euros, its highest
price since February 2012, after Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH said it
isn’t in discussions to sell part of its 50.1 percent holding in
the German drug wholesales to CVS Caremark Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
