Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, hired Teresa McTague to oversee a
$10.8 billion portfolio as interest rates near record lows
pressure investment income.  McTague, formerly a portfolio manager at the General Re-New
England Asset Management unit of  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , will be U.S. chief investment officer at Aflac.
She’ll be based in New York and report to CIO Eric Kirsch, the
Columbus, Georgia-based firm said today in a statement.  Kirsch has been adding managers to help run Aflac’s
portfolio after joining from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 2011.
He hired Lori Evangel from  MetLife Inc. (MET)  as chief risk officer in
January and in August named Issei Sasaki to oversee investments
in  Japan , the company’s largest market.  McTague, 57, has “extensive knowledge and expertise related
to global portfolio management and insurance strategy,” Kirsch
said in the statement.  The return on Aflac’s U.S. portfolio dropped to an average
of 5.86 percent in the three months ended March 31, from 6.48
percent a year earlier as bond yields fell, according to a
document on the company’s  website .  At General Re, McTague helped manage assets for insurance
clients. She has also worked at Johnson & Higgins and Alexander
& Alexander, Aflac said. McTague received a bachelor’s degree in
economics from the University of California at Berkeley and an
MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  To contact the reporter on this story:
