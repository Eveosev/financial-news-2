Copper futures fell for the first time
in three sessions on concern that demand will slump in  Europe  as
global supplies increase.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank in April
for a 15th straight month, a report from London-based Markit
showed today. The European Commission said on May 3 that the
region’s economy will contract more than estimated. Copper
 stockpiles  monitored by the London Metal Exchange are close to
the highest since 2003.  “All the data we’re seeing suggests no rebound in Europe,
as well as slowing in  China  and sub-par growth in the U.S.,”
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “We’re still not seeing any inordinate
demand for copper, and supplies are adequate.”  Copper futures for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to $3.296
a pound at 10:35 a.m. on the Comex in New York. On May 3, the
metal jumped 6.8 percent, the most in 18 months, after U.S.
payrolls increased more than analysts forecast.  Money managers boosted wagers on falling prices to 23,368
futures and options in the week ended April 30 from 15,727 a
week earlier, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
showed on May 3. The net-short  position  declined in the previous
three weeks.  The London Metal Exchange is closed today for a national
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
