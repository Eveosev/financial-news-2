Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s
administration must speed up a probe into the alleged purchase
of votes in the July elections before a pact among the top
parties to pass economic bills can resume, an opposition Senate
leader said.  The impasse in the so-called Pact for  Mexico  can be
overcome once names of those suspected of wrongdoing are
disclosed and the government shows a willingness to punish them,
said Senator Miguel Barbosa in an interview today at Bloomberg’s
Mexico City office. Opposition parties circulated last month
video and audio tapes of officials from Pena Nieto’s party
allegedly arranging to buy votes in the July elections for
Veracruz state officials through funds from government anti-
poverty programs.  The government was forced to delay plans to present new
rules to boost bank loans after opposition parties said the
agreement to help the government pass bills to accelerate growth
was suspended because of the corruption allegations. Pena Nieto
said April 23 he won’t tolerate the use of any government
programs for electoral purposes.  “The dialogue is suspended; the building of proposals is
suspended,” said Barbosa of the Democratic Revolution Party,
the nation’s third largest party. “To renew it, to re-activate
it, results of the investigation into the alleged acts need to
be disclosed, so that if there are irregularities they are
corrected and those responsible are punished.”  Pena Nieto’s government said April 24 the parties agreed to
restart talks. The former ruling  National Action Party  and the
PRD say they still need signs the government will crack down on
vote buying before they’ll return fully to the negotiating
table.  To contact the reporters on this story:
