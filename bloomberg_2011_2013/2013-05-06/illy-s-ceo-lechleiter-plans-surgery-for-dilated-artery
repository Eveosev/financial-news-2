Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  said  John Lechleiter ,
the drugmaker’s chairman and chief executive officer, will
undergo surgery for a  dilated aorta , an asymptomatic condition
from which he is expected to recover.  Lechleiter, 59, is scheduled to have surgery May 13 to fix
the condition that was caught on an unrelated exam, the
Indianapolis-based company said in a statement. He is expected
to return to work in several months, Lilly said in the
statement.  “It is a serious situation but it has been caught early
enough,” Edward Sagebiel, a Lilly spokesman, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. “He is expected to make a full
recovery.”  In Lechleiter’s absence, Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice will serve as acting CEO and Ellen R. Marram, Lilly’s lead
independent director who has been on the board since 2002, will
serve as acting chairman, the company said.  A dilated aorta is a bulge or ballooning of the large
artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and
abdomen, according to the  National Institutes of Health . The
condition can often develop before causing any symptoms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
