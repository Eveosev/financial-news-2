Thomas Marano is leaving the chief
executive officer’s post at  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ’s bankrupt
Residential Capital mortgage unit as creditors wrangle over who
will pay for the firm’s soured home loans.  Marano, recruited in 2008 to turn around New York-based
ResCap, agreed to continue as an outside director to help
facilitate a smooth transition while he pursues other interests,
according to a statement today from the firm. He remains
chairman, according to Alex Stockham, a ResCap spokesman at
Rubenstein Associates Inc.  ResCap was among the biggest U.S. subprime lenders,
specializing in loans to people with weak credit. Such loans
were blamed for fueling the U.S. housing bubble, and record
defaults propelled ResCap into bankruptcy in May 2012. Marano, a
former head of mortgages and asset-backed securities at Bear
Stearns Cos. before it collapsed in 2008, became ResCap’s non-executive chairman in April of that year as losses mounted, and
was named chairman and CEO three months later.  Ally, formerly known as GMAC Inc., has said it wants to
stage an initial public offering to repay a U.S. bailout valued
at $17.2 billion. Ally CEO Michael Carpenter put those plans on
hold, saying that ResCap’s fate must be decided first.  Creditors are pressing to make Ally responsible for some of
ResCap’s debts and have resisted Carpenter’s offer of $750
million to cover their claims. Carpenter has said the claims
aren’t valid and called his offer a “hostage payment” to buy
peace.  Ally, based in  Detroit , specializes in auto lending and
also runs an online consumer bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
