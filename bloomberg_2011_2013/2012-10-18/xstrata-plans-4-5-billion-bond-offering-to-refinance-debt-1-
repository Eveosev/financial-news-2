Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the world’s largest
exporter of coal burned by power stations, plans to sell $4.5
billion of secured debt in a four-part offering through a
financing unit to repay maturing obligations.  Xstrata Finance Canada Ltd. intends to issue $1.25 billion
of three-year notes to yield 140 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, $1.75 billion of five-year debt at a
relative yield of 170 basis points, $1 billion of 10-year
securities at a spread of 220 basis points and $500 million of
30-year debentures at 235 basis points, according to a person
familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Xstrata, which has $2.9 billion of  bonds maturing  through
2016, may also use proceeds for general corporate purposes, the
person said.  Xstrata, the target of a takeover bid by  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  now valued at about $33.6 billion, is selling
the bonds after its board recommended accepting an increased
offer on Oct. 1. The transaction, five years in the making,
would couple Glencore’s trading operations with Xstrata’s coal,
copper and zinc mines, creating a group with 130,000 employees
in more than 40 nations.  Xstrata last sold dollar-denominated debt a year ago, when
the finance unit issued $3 billion of securities in a four-part
deal. Its $700 million of senior unsecured, 3.6 percent bonds
due January 2017 traded at 106.2 cents on the dollar to yield
2.08 percent Sept. 18 with a 140 basis-point spread over
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The bonds may be rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
signaling the debt is subject to moderate credit risk, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
