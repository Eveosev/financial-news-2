Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  led
borrowers raising at least $20 billion in the second-busiest day
this year for U.S. corporate bond sales.  Xstrata, the world’s largest exporter of coal burned by
power stations, raised $4.5 billion in four parts, while  Redwood
City , California-based Oracle sold $5 billion in its first
offering in more than two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales are the highest since $26.9 billion was raised
on March 5.  Borrowing costs on dollar-denominated debt are hovering at
unprecedented lows, with average yields on the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master index reaching
3.6 percent today. Companies are issuing debt as opportunities
on the calendar free from election- and holiday-related
disruptions diminish before year-end, according to Simon Mayes
at BNP Paribas SA.  Issuers “have an eye on the upcoming elections and
anticipate a quieter period in the election week, and the week
in the lead up,” Mayes, head of the financial institutions
group syndicate in  New York , said in a telephone interview.
“Leaving issuance to December is not a recommended strategy in
terms of running out of time and going into the holiday
period.”  Glencore Bid  Yields on bonds from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers fell to an unprecedented 3.591 percent on Oct. 16,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master index. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures fell to 222
basis points, the lowest since April 2011.  Xstrata, the target of a takeover bid by Glencore
International Plc, issued $1.25 billion of 1.8 percent, three-
year notes to yield 140 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1.75 billion of 2.45 percent, five-year debt at a
relative yield of 170 basis points, $1 billion of 4 percent, 10-
year securities at a spread of 220 basis points and $500 million
of 5.3 percent, 30-year debentures at 235 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the bonds, issued by Xstrata
Finance Canada Ltd., will be used to repay maturing obligations.  Oracle, the world’s largest supplier of  database software ,
raised $2.5 billion each of 1.2 percent, five-year securities at
a relative yield of 45 basis points and 2.5 percent, 10-year
debt at a spread of 68 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Largest Custodian  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the world’s largest custody
bank, raised $1.5 billion selling $600 million of 0.7 percent,
three-year fixed-rate debt at spread of 33 basis points, $400
million of three-year floating-rate notes to yield 23 basis
points more than the quarterly London interbank offered rate,
and $500 million of 1.3 percent securities due January 2018 at a
spread of 55 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest U.S. bank whose third-
quarter results today beat analysts’ estimates, sold $2 billion
of 4.875 percent, 10-year subordinated securities at a spread of
310 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The sale was its first
benchmark offering of subordinated debt since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
