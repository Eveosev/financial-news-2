Lithuania can increase public
spending by an average 6 percent a year beginning in 2014 and
still have a balanced budget by 2016, Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte  said, citing growth forecasts and European Union aid.  “If the economy develops as currently forecast and the law
on fiscal discipline is kept, then public finances will become
balanced in 2016, not because of, but despite, whoever is
running the government,” Simonyte said today in a  statement 
from Vilnius, the capital.  Three opposition parties who have pledged to increase
spending may form a new coalition government after a second
round of parliamentary elections on Oct. 28. Two of them won
more votes in the first round on Oct. 14 than Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius’s Homeland Union-Christian Democrats.  Budget revenue growth is projected to accelerate from 1
percent in 2013 to about 8 percent a year in 2014 and 2015,
making it possible to spend more and also reduce the deficit,
Simonyte said. The  Finance Ministry  in September forecast
economic growth of 2.5 percent this year, 3 percent in 2013, 3.4
percent in 2014 and 4.3 percent in 2015.  In the draft 2013 budget sent to parliament this week, the
government proposed cutting the deficit to 2.5 percent of  gross
domestic product  from this year’s planned 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
