Treasuries pared a gain after
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said Greece should get more
time on budget targets as European Union leaders gathered for a
two-day meeting in Brussels.  U.S. government debt  advanced earlier, after the biggest
two-day selloff in seven months, as German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  said Greek reforms were moving at a “snail’s pace”
while clashes broke out in central Athens during a second
general strike in three weeks. Thirty-year yields earlier slid
for the first time in four days as the Labor Department reported
that initial jobless claims rose more than forecast last week.  “There was a favorable headline for Greece, talking about
positive developments, and the market started to trade off,”
said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  in New York at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Fed. “As we do back up and see a move to higher rates, there
are willing buyers.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.81
percent at 12:13 p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices, after touching 1.78 percent. The 1.625 percent
note due August 2022 gained 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 98 9/32. The yield rose  16 basis points  over the
previous two days, the most for a two-day period since March 14,
and yesterday surpassed the 200-day moving average of 1.808
percent.  Yields on 30-year bonds fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.99 percent after climbing above 3 percent
yesterday for the first time since Sept. 19.  The U.S. plans to auction $7 billion of 30-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, with the securities poised to
draw a record-low yield.  To contact the reporters on this story:
