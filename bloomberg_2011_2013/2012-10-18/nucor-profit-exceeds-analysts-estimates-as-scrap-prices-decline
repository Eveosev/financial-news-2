Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, posted third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates after a decline in the price of scrap
metal used as a raw material.  Net income declined to $110.3 million, or 35 cents a share,
from $181.5 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier, the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding a loss on an asset sale and a charge related to the
purchase of inventory were 45 cents, exceeding the 43-cent
average of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales dropped 8.6 percent to $4.8 billion from $5.25
billion, missing the $4.83 billion average of 14 estimates.  The average scrap costs in the quarter decreased 11 percent
to $380 a ton from $427 in the previous quarter and 15 percent
from a year earlier, Nucor said in the statement.  Steelmaking costs  at U.S. electric arc furnaces, a type of
plant Nucor uses to remelt scrap, averaged $524 a metric ton in
the quarter, 16 percent less than a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of  No. 1 heavy melt , a
grade of scrap steel, dropped 17 percent to $365 a ton in the
same period, according to Metal Bulletin data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
