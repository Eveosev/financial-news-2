Novavax Inc. (NVAX) , a Rockville, Maryland-
based biotechnology company, climbed 4.9 percent after reporting
positive results from two early trials of its avian influenza
vaccine.  Novavax  closed  at $2.35, for its biggest percentage gain
since Oct. 1. The shares have risen 87 percent this year.  Results for a first phase of trials for the H5N1 bird flu
vaccine fulfill criteria set by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, and development of the drug will proceed, the
company said in a statement yesterday. The vaccine’s safety was
acceptable with no serious side effects and there is sufficient
data to move to the next testing stage, Novavax said.  “It looks like the data is pretty spectacular in terms of
the immune response to the flu vaccine,” Gregory Wade, an
analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said in a
telephone interview. “I think the company is very excited about
this positive result.”  The objective of the two trials, using a total of 666
patients, was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of
the company’s vaccine, with or without an adjuvant.  Wade, who rates the stock outperform and has a $6 price
target, said the time frame for licensing for the drug could be
in 2015 and that the need for the  is based on whether a strain
of the virus breaks out.  “The government does keep a stockpile at the ready in
order to address any potential pandemic,” he said. “We would
expect there would be annual stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
