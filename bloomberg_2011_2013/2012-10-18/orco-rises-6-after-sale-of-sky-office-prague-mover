Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA headed for
the highest price in about five months after it sold the Sky
Office in Dusseldorf to Allianz Real Estate  Germany .  Orco rose 3.6 koruna, or 5 percent, to 75.5 koruna as of
10:27 a.m. in Prague trading. That would be the highest level
since May 29 based on closing price basis.  Orco said yesterday it agreed to sell the Sky Office in
Dusseldorf for an undisclosed price. The deal is expected to
close within two months, the developer said.  The news is “positive” for Orco and probably caused a
strengthening of the shares in the last few days,  Komercni Banka
AS (KOMB)  analyst Miroslav Adamkovic wrote in a note to clients today.
However, the fact the company didn’t disclose the price is
“startling”, said Adamkovic, who has a “hold” on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
