U.S. leveraged-loan returns in 2013
won’t match this year’s performance, according to Beth MacLean,
a  money manager  at Pacific Investment Management Co.  “We’re not going to repeat” 2012’s results, MacLean said
yesterday during a panel at the Loan Syndications and Trading
Association’s annual conference in  New York . “A lot of the
 capital gains  have been taken out of the market.”  Newport
Beach , California-based Pimco is manager of the world’s biggest
bond fund.  Leveraged loans have  returned  9.7 percent so far in 2012,
according to the Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100
index. The high-yield debt is on pace to reach 12.3 percent by
year-end for what would be the second-best annual return on
record, the index shows.  The  Federal Reserve  has pledged to keep  interest rates  near
zero through mid-2015, spurring investors to take on more risk
in junk-category loans as they hunt for yield. Loan prices have
 climbed  5.5 cents this year to 96.29 cents on the dollar,
reaching a 19-month high on Sept. 21, according to the S&P/LSTA
loan index.  The Fed is “pushing everyone out the risk spectrum” to
look for new ways to invest, MacLean said. Senior-secured loans
are providing investors with attractive all-in coupons because
floors on the London interbank offered rate are “so
pervasive,” she said.  More than 95 percent of loans sold to non-bank investors
this year have Libor floors, Meredith Coffey, executive vice
president of the LSTA, said in an e-mail, citing research from
S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.  Libor Floor  As of September, 61 percent of loans in the S&P/LSTA loan
index had Libor floors, she said.  Libor is the lending benchmark for leveraged loans, a type
of high-yield, high-risk debt ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by S&P.  While three-month Libor is 0.32 percent today for U.S.
dollar loans, corporate borrowers offered investors an average
minimum on the lending benchmark of 1.33 percent in September,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Loans typically produce an annual return of 5 percent,
according to Markit Group Ltd. Last year, the debt returned 0.62
percent as loan prices dropped 5.7 cents to 90.75 cents at the
end of 2011 from a peak of 96.48 in February, according to the
S&P/LSTA loan index.  Most LSTA  members  attending yesterday’s conference expect
2013 returns will range from 4 percent to 8 percent, according
to an audience survey taken during one of the panels. Of those
surveyed, 39.1 percent said gains would be 6 percent to 8
percent, while 38.8 percent expect leveraged loans will return 4
percent to 6 percent.  Junk bonds  have returned 13.4 percent this year, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index, while the  S&P 500
Index (SPX)  has rallied 16.2 percent, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
