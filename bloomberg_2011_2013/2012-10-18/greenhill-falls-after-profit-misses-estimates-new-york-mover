Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the investment bank
founded by Robert Greenhill, fell the most since July after
reporting third-quarter profit that missed analystsâ€™ estimates
as advisory revenue fell.  Greenhill slid 7.8 percent to $47.07 at 9:50 a.m. in New
York. The shares had gained 40 percent this year through
yesterday.  Net income increased to $8.59 million, or 28 cents a share,
from $8.56 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based firm said yesterday in a statement after the close of U.S.
markets. The  average estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 36 cents a share. Advisory revenue
fell 13 percent to $72.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
