South Korea may link an energy
taxation system to emissions as part of efforts to reduce
 greenhouse gases , the  finance ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement.  The government is preparing a long-term plan on energy and
climate change and will announce it at the end of this month,
according to the statement.  Under the plan, the government may open an electricity
wholesale market to attract private companies to the nationâ€™s
smart grid network project. Additionally, South Korea, which
imports all of its crude oil needs, is considering setting up an
international exchange of oil products that combines online spot
and futures markets, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
