Mexican growers are offering to
raise the floor price of tomatoes shipped to the U.S. in order
to salvage a 16-year-old agreement with the Commerce Department,
according to Jeff Weintraub, senior vice president at Fleishman-
Hillard Inc., which is representing the growers.  U.S. importers and the Mexican farmers say the absence of
an agreement may trigger tariffs. U.S. producers, led by the
Florida industry, say they want a free market in the tomato
trade. The Commerce Department issued a preliminary decision
last month to end the agreement.  The offer by the Mexican growers, which would add 18
percent to 25 percent to the floor price depending on the type
of tomato, was presented today to the U.S. Commerce Department,
Weintraub said in an e-mail.  The proposal would extend the current agreement to cover
100 percent of Mexican tomatoes instead of the current 85
percent, Martin Ley, a representative for the growers from
 Mexico , said in an interview after meeting with Commerce
Department officials.  Commerce Department didnâ€™t comment on the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
