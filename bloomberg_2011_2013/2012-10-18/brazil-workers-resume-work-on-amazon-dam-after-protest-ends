More than 2,500 workers building the
Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, the world’s third-largest, in
 Brazil ’s Amazon are returning to work at a site closed by
protests last week.  The workers will arrive at the construction site this
afternoon, a member of the press department for the consortium
building the dam said by telephone.  Indigenous tribes, peasant farmers and fisherman on Oct. 8
seized control of one of three construction sites, alleging that
its developer, Norte Energia SA, hasn’t followed through on a
pledge to invest in communities affected by the project. Norte
Energia met with the protesters and agreed to build health
clinics and schools for indigenous groups, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The meeting was a step forward, because for the first time
state government lawyers were present, said Maira Irigaray,
Brazil program director for Amazon Watch, a San Francisco-based
environmental watchdog.  “The agreement they made was legally binding, which means
if Norte Energia doesn’t comply this time there will be fees and
we can go after them,” Irigaray said by telephone from
Altamira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
