Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first time in a week as businesses started to accumulate dollars
to meet month-end obligations.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy weakened as
much as 0.2 percent to 85.25 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent lower at 85.15 a dollar by 3:01 p.m., in Nairobi, the
capital.  “The shilling is oscillating within a narrow band with
businesses trying to accumulate at favorable levels as we head
toward the month-end where demand for dollars is expected to
pick up,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based
 Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said by phone.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 6.05 billion shillings ($71
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements , an official who
asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by phone.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1,580
a dollar, while the Ugandan shilling depreciated by less 0.1
percent to 2,575.45 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
