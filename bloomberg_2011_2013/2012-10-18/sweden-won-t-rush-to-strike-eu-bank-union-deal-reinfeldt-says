Sweden  won’t rush to strike an
agreement on a European banking union that doesn’t satisfy the
Nordic country’s demands, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said
in an interview today in Bucharest.  A deal needs to include “a full fiscal backstop that lies
within the nation state where the bank is active” so that the
Swedish state, banks and taxpayers won’t be responsible for
covering losses at financial institutions in other European
Union countries, he said.  “There’s no rush, it’s better to have this with quality in
place and not to push it too fast because these are complicated
matters,” Reinfeldt said. “I will listen and will try to make
changes in the proposals.”  Reinfeldt is preparing for a two-day gathering in Brussels
where EU leaders will discuss how to found a common supervisor
to assuage market worries over the state of some of the region’s
banks. Sweden, which is a EU member, but hasn’t adopted the
euro, needs stricter capital requirements than European peers
because its banking sector is relatively large, Reinfeldt said.  The Swedish premier, half-way through his second four-year
term as head of government, said non-euro countries must have
influence over the structure of supervision if they are to join
a banking union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
