Mexico’s peso fell the most among
major Latin American currencies after a report showed
unemployment claims were higher than forecast in the U.S., the
biggest market for the nation’s exports.  The peso depreciated 0.4 percent to 12.8438 per U.S. dollar
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the biggest decrease among the
dollar’s most-traded counterparts in Latin America. It rose
yesterday to 12.7875, the strongest closing level since Oct. 4.  The peso weakened “after jobless claims came out slightly
above expectations,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco
Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said in a telephone
interview. “With unemployment and employment being strong
indicators of the health of the economy, that’s why they affect
the peso.”  Jobless claims in the U.S., which buys about 80 percent of
Mexico’s exports, increased to 388,000 in the week ended Oct. 13
from a revised 342,000 in the prior period that was the lowest
since February 2008, the Labor Department reported today. The
median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a rise in claims to 365,000.  The figures had a bigger impact on Mexico than other
countries because of the trade ties to its northern neighbor,
Cordova said.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price decreased 0.28 centavo to
139.53 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
