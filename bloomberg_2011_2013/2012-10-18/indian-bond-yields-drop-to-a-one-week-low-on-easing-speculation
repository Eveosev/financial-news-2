India’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield to the lowest level in more than a week, on optimism
the central bank will take measures to spur bank lending and
counter a slowdown in  Asia ’s third-largest economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will reduce lenders’  reserve 
requirements by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent at its next
policy review on Oct. 30, according to 10 of the 17 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News , to free up funds for lending. One
predicted a 50-basis point cut while the rest see no change. The
monetary authority last lowered the so-called  cash reserve ratio 
on Sept. 17. It has held the  repurchase  rate at 8 percent after
a 50 basis point decrease in April.  “Expectations of monetary easing, either a repo-rate cut
or liquidity injections, will build up as we approach the policy
meeting,” Barclays Plc analysts including Rohit Arora wrote in
a research note today. “We suggest staying long 10-year
bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.14 percent
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
That’s the lowest level since Oct. 9.  Quarterly growth in  India ’s $1.8 trillion  economy  slowed to
an average 5.4 percent in the first half of this year, from 7.5
percent in the whole of 2011, according to government data.
Annual growth in  bank loans  has averaged 17 percent so far in
2012, compared with 21.4 percent a year earlier, central bank
data show.  The one-year interest-rate swap, derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
