Blackstone President  Tony James  said
allegations that the biggest buyout firms colluded to rig bids
for transactions are untrue and that they may have been
politically motivated in an election year.  “The lawsuit is a complete fabrication and a bunch of
malarkey,” James said today in a conference call discussing
 third-quarter earnings.  It’s “permissible and a requirement to
team up. In a competitive environment you want to pick the
strongest partner you can,” he said  To contact the reporters on this story:
