There is a lot of hair in India. That was the blinding insight that started our quest to develop a disruptive business in India's men's grooming market. Our idea was to port the efficient, affordable  QB House  model that is popular in Singapore and other Asian markets to India (QB House is detailed in the section titled "Remember: Quality is Relative" of  The Little Black Book of Innovation ). We would launch a series of single-chair kiosks that offered high-quality hair cutting, shaving, and related grooming services at affordable prices. We saw a wide open market, what is sometimes called a white space, blue ocean, or greenfield market.  Whatever your color of choice, pioneering new markets feels exciting. Who wouldn't want to do what hasn't been done before? Think of all the rewards awaiting innovators that follow in the footsteps of organizations like Google and Cirque de Soleil. However, companies should approach unpopulated market spaces with a dose of caution. Before you invest big to attack white space, ask why the market is uninhabited. Perhaps a technological constraint, regulatory barrier, or entrenched behavior stopped its development. That suggests an opportunity. But there are three, less promising possibilities: The third area ended up being the killer for our men's grooming business. The business model that worked on paper didn't work in the marketplace. To get to reasonable revenues, our single-chair kiosk needed what we called a "hero barber," one that would draw in and retain customers. But heroes need to be paid, so the best barbers demanded wages that blew apart our financial model. A branded store with multiple chairs might have been a viable model, but given other priorities we decided to shut the business down. Before targeting a white space do a simple thought experiment: put yourself in the shoes of its natural "owner." As Innosight Ventures Partner Pete Bonee explains it, "Ask yourself, with some degree of discipline: Why hasn't this been done before? Who are the people who might have done it? Did they try? Why did they or didn't they? If the business opportunity is obvious to us why hasn't it been obvious to other smart people? What do they know that we don't?"  If your success is predicated on everyone else being too dumb to spot this wonderful opportunity, proceed with caution. That white space might just be fool's gold.
