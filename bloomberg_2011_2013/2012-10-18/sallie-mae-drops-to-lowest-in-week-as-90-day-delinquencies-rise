SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as  Sallie Mae , fell to the lowest in a week after the company
said long-term delinquencies rose last quarter.  The shares dropped 1.2 percent to $16.96 in  New York , the
lowest since Oct. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Newark, Delaware-based lender said in a statement that
delinquencies of more than 90 days rose to 5.3 percent in the
three months ended Sept. 30, up from 5 percent in the year-ago
period. The company’s third-quarter core earnings, excluding
items such as the market gains and losses of derivatives
contracts, were $277 million, or 58 cents a share, exceeding the
54 cent  estimate  of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “I can’t confess to being particularly happy about the
near-term credit picture,” Chief Executive Officer Albert Lord
said on a conference call to discuss the results with analysts
and investors. “The fact is the economy remains very slow,”
increasing the number of borrowers in delinquency.  More Americans than forecast filed  applications  for
 unemployment benefits  last week, according to a Labor Department
report today. Initial jobless claims increased to 388,000 in the
week ended Oct. 13, up from a revised 342,000 in the prior
period, and more than the 365,000 median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sallie Mae is forecasting $3.2 billion of private education
loan originations in 2012, and expects that number to increase
in 2013, Lord said on the call. “We do see the market
growing,” he said. “We intend to grow it by more aggressively
marketing.” Legislation passed in 2010 cut companies out of the
market for government-guaranteed lending.  Outstanding student  loans  are now more than $1 trillion, as
student borrowing has surpassed credit cards as the largest
source of unsecured  consumer debt , according to the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
