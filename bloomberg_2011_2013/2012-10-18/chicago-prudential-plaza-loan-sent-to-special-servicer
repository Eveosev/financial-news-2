A loan on two downtown Chicago
office towers owned by BentleyForbes Group LLC, a Los Angeles-
based real estate investor, was transferred to a special
servicer because default is imminent,  Fitch Ratings  said.  The balance of the debt on Prudential Plaza is $205
million, Fitch said today. BentleyForbes bought the towers,
which have a total of 2.2 million square feet (204,000 square
meters), for $470 million in 2006 as U.S. commercial-property
prices were peaking.  The first building was completed in 1955, and Two
Prudential Plaza opened in 1990, according to the property’s
 website . The largest tenant at One Prudential Plaza is Baker &
McKenzie LLP, which occupies 21 percent of the rentable space in
the 41-story tower. The  law firm  plans to leave when its lease
expires at the end of November, according to loan data compiled
by Bloomberg.  A telephone message for C. Frederick Wehba II, president of
BentleyForbes, wasn’t immediately returned.  Special servicers negotiate with landlords on behalf of
investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities.  BentleyForbes also owned the 55-story Bank of America Plaza
in Atlanta, which was sold at auction in February to the holder
for $235 million of debt after the borrower missed mortgage
payments. BentleyForbes had purchased the building, the tallest
in the southeast, for $436 million in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
