Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) ,  Australia ’s largest
retailer, posted the fastest first-quarter sales growth from
supermarkets open at least a year since 2009 as promotions and
food price inflation drove growth.  Same-store food and liquor revenue rose 2.3 percent in the
three months ended September, Sydney-based Woolworths said in a
statement today. That is the fastest pace since the company
reported 5.8 percent growth in the first quarter of 2009.  Growth in the quarter was helped by a return of food price
inflation, after three consecutive quarters of declining prices.
Woolworths has also used the opening of new stores to drive
total sales, which rose 4.3 percent to A$15.2 billion ($15.8
billion) in the quarter, amid weak  consumer spending  driven by
 sentiment  that’s had a negative reading for at least the past
six months.  “Woolworths has enjoyed underlying improvement,” Michael Simotas, a Sydney-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in an
Oct. 16 note to clients.  Woolworths  shares  rose 0.1 percent to A$29.18 at 10:49 a.m.
in Sydney. The stock has gained 16 percent this year compared
with a 13 percent rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
