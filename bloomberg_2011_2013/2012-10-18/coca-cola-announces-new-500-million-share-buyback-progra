Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soft drink maker, authorized a new plan to buy back 500 million
shares, valued at about $18.9 billion at yesterday’s closing
price, as it returns cash to investors.  The new authorization doesn’t affect the plan to buy back
$2.5 billion to $3 billion in stock this year, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. Coca-Cola said its current
repurchase program was authorized in 2006.  Coca-Cola has risen 48 percent since Chief Executive
Officer  Muhtar Kent  took over in July 2008, compared with an 9.9
percent gain for rival  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  Kent has pledged to reach
$200 billion in revenue for the company and its bottlers
globally by 2020, double the sales generated in 2010.  “This company is in a good spot -- they don’t know what to
do with all their cash except to give it back to shareholders,”
 Jack Russo , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis ,
said in a telephone interview. “They’ve been active share
repuchasers for a long time.”  Coca-Cola  rose  0.3 percent to $37.84 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 8.2 percent this year.  Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents,
payable Dec. 17 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 30. The
company completed a 2-for-1 share split in August.  The company had $18.1 billion in  cash and equivalents  as of
Sept. 28. Coca-Cola authorized the repurchase of as many as 300
million shares in 2006.  Kent has adjusted prices and introduced new products to
cope with weaker demand in European nations facing a persistent
debt crisis and slowing growth in  China  and Brazil. Earlier this
week, the company reported a 3.9 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as sales volumes in Europe improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
