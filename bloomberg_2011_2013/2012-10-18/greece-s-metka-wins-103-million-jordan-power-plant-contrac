Al Samra Electric Power Co. signed a
$103 million agreement with  Metka SA (METTK)  to increase the Jordanian
company’s plant capacity by 146 megawatts, state-run Petra news
agency reported.  The project is expected to be operational in July 2013 to
meet the expected load on electricity in the summer, the news
service reported, citing Amjad Rawashdeh, the plant’s director
general.  This is the second project awarded Metka in less than a
month. In September, the Greek company won a $155 million
contract to increase the Al Samra plant’s capacity by 143
megawatts. The agreement to that deal will be signed in the next
few days and will be implemented within 28 months, said
Rawashdeh.  Metka added 1.5 percent to 8.09 euros, with 259,461 shares
traded, or approximately 4.6 times the three-month average daily
volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
