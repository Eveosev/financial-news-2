A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , the U.S.
electric-car battery maker that filed for bankruptcy this week,
won court approval to borrow as much as $15.5 million from
Johnson Controls Inc. while it prepares to sell its assets.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey approved the interim
financing at a hearing today in Wilmington,  Delaware , after
Johnson Controls cut the  interest rate  to 13.5 percent from
15 percent following talks held during a break. A123 is
scheduled to return to court Oct. 30 to seek approval of the
remainder of the $72.5 million loan.  A123, the recipient of a $249 million federal grant, said
it would sell its automotive-business assets to Milwaukee-based
Johnson Controls in a deal valued at $125 million. A123, based
in Waltham,  Massachusetts , listed assets of $459.8 million and
debt of $376 million as of Aug. 31 in Chapter 11 documents.  The company said in August that it was working on a deal
with Wanxiang Group Corp., China’s largest auto-parts maker, for
financing in exchange for a majority ownership stake. Wanxiang
had planned to invest as much as $465 million in A123, giving
the Hangzhou, China-based company a stake of as much as 80
percent, A123 said in an Aug. 16 statement.  A123 said it decided to scrap the previous agreement with
Wanxiang as it filed for  bankruptcy protection . Wanxiang “was
extremely interested” in providing the so-called debtor-in-
possession loan, leading to a “spirited round of discussions,”
D.J. Baker, an attorney for A123, told Carey.  ‘Very Competitive’  “We have presented a very competitive bid proposal that is
superior to the one that Johnson Controls has proposed,” Bojan Guzina, a Wanxiang attorney, told the court.  A123 decided to accept the loan from Johnson Controls after
the auto-parts maker offered new terms, including the reduced
interest rate, the ability for A123 to seek financing from any
source and an agreement to waive all upfront fees upon
refinancing.  The case is In re A123 Systems Inc., 12-49658,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
