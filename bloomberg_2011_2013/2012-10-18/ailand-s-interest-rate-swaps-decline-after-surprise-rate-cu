Thailand ’s  interest-rate swaps 
dropped by the most since August after a surprise interest-rate
reduction spurred speculation more cuts will follow. Government
bonds fell and the baht was steady.  The central bank cut its  one-day bond repurchase rate  by a
quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent yesterday, a
decision predicted by three of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The rest forecast no change. The one-year swap rate
reached a 13-week low after the Bank of Thailand said the global
economic outlook remained weak and the “substantial degree of
uncertainty” could hamper exports.  “The market is most likely to price in further cuts until
further signals from the central bank, or we see a turnaround in
the data,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong.  The one-year onshore swap, the fixed cost needed to receive
a floating payment, dropped 11 basis points to 2.75 percent as
of 8:47 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the steepest decline since Aug. 3 and the lowest level
since July 25.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of the Thai
economy, fell 3.4 percent in September from a year earlier after
a decrease of 7 percent in August, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before government
data due between Oct. 19 and Oct. 26.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.11 percent. The rate
slumped 19 basis points yesterday.  The baht traded at 30.62 per dollar, compared with 30.61
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
