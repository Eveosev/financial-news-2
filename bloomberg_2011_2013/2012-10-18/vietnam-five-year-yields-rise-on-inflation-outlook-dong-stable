Vietnam ’s benchmark bonds fell,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level since May, on
concern inflation will accelerate. The dong was little changed.  Investors are demanding higher rates, “especially when the
 consumer price index  is forecast to drive up by the end of the
year,” Nguyen Thanh Khiem, a Hanoi-based bond analyst at
BaoViet Securities Co., wrote in a research note released today.  Vietnam’s inflation has bottomed and will probably peak in
the middle of 2013 at about 12 percent, Matt Hildebrandt,
Singapore-based economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said at a
conference in  Ho Chi Minh City  today. Consumer-price gains
quickened to 6.48 percent in September from 5.04 percent the
previous month, official data show.  The  yield  on five-year notes climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 10.37 percent, the highest since May
3, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,845 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,850 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
