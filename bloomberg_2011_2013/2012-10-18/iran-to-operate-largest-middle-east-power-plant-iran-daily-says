Iran  will begin operating a power
plant capable of generating 3,000 megawatts, Iran  reported ,
citing Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Mohammad Behzad.  The Damavand combined-cycle plant, which the state-owned
newspaper said is the largest of its type in the Middle East,
has 12 units for burning natural gas to produce electricity and
six units that will use steam, Behzad said, according to the
report. Damavand, near Tehran, cost 2 billion euro ($2.6
billion) to build and is now complete, the newspaper said,
without specifying when the facility will start operating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
