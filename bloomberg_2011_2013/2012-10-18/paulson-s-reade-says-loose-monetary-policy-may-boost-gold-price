John Reade, senior vice president at
Paulson & Co., made the following comments at the SALT
conference in  Singapore  today.  “I think gold has an appropriate place in a portfolio
during certain macroeconomic circumstances and I think that’s
right now.  ‘‘Under the right macroeconomic circumstances, gold is a
good place to be and those circumstances will continue to play
out over the next few years.  ‘‘And there is no doubt the expectation or the announcement
of QE4 or QE infinitive has been positive for gold and I would
expect gold will do well in this environment where central banks
will continue to print and where monetary policy is still in an
extraordinary condition.  ‘‘We are in a low-growth environment with high U.S.
unemployment for the next few years. I can’t see any way
monetary policy can be normalized quickly.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
