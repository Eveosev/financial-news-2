OpCapita LLP, the U.K. private-
equity firm, is considering a sale of the Comet electronics
chain after receiving approaches for the retailer, Sky News
reported, citing people it didnâ€™t identify.  OpCapita took over the 240-store chain from Kesa
Electricals Plc in February after receiving a 50 million-pound
($81 million) dowry, Sky News said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
