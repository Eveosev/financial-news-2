Traders’ human rights may be
violated by plans to punish Libor riggers and insider traders
with tougher penalties including jail terms, some EU nations
have warned.  Talks on the law have stalled over concerns that a
combination of penalties from prison terms to fines and bans may
clash with so-called double-jeopardy rules that prevent two sets
of punishments for the same offense, according to a progress
report published on the  EU’s website.   The law “may give rise to tensions” with this rule,
enshrined in the bloc’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, according
to the document, which doesn’t identify the countries concerned.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, has
urged swift adoption of the law to prevent any repeat of the
scandal engulfing Libor and other interbank rates. The
legislation would empower courts to hand jail terms to those
found guilty of market abuse and insider dealing. It would also
set out minimum administrative sanctions, such as fines, for
offenders.  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark  interest rate  for more
than $360 trillion of securities, was shaken following  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s admission in June that it submitted false rates. The
revelations provoked renewed calls for tougher oversight of the
financial system and pushed regulatory and criminal probes of
Libor and other interbank lending rates, such as Euribor, to the
top of the political agenda.  Cyprus, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, is
seeking guidance from EU finance ministers on how to continue
work on the draft law, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
