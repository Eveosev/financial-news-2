China ’s power output in September
fell to the lowest level in four months as economic growth
slowed for a seventh quarter.  Electricity production was 391 billion kilowatt-hours, the
least since 390 billion in May, data from the National Bureau of
Statistics showed today in Beijing. The figure was down 11
percent from August and up 1.5 percent from a year ago,
according to the data.  The world’s second-biggest economy expanded 7.4 percent
from a year earlier in the three months ended September, the
statistics bureau also said today. That matched the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 43 economists. Industrial
production advanced 9.2 percent in September from a year
earlier, compared with 10 percent in the first nine months of
2012.  “The slower power growth was caused mainly by the slowdown
of China’s manufacturing sectors, which have been hit hard by
shrinking exports,” said Leo Wu, a Shenzhen-based analyst at
Guotai Junan Securities Ltd. “Power output and consumption will
not see a major improvement in the last quarter as long as
China’s manufacturing industries still struggle with securing
enough demand.”  Separate data from the statistics bureau today showed
China’s oil refiners processed 38.76 million metric tons of
crude in September, up 7 percent from a year ago and the highest
level since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
