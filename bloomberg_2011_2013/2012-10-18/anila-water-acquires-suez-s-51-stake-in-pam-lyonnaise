Manila Water Co. (MWC)  agreed to acquire
 Suez Environnement Co. (SEV) ’s 51 percent stake in PT PAM Lyonnaise
Jaya, which holds the concession contract for western Jakarta.  No terms were given by the utility, which supplies water to
half of the Philippine capital. Closing of the deal is subject
to certain government and regulatory approvals in Indonesia and
other conditions, Manila Water said today in a filing with the
Philippine Stock Exchange.  PAM Lyonnaise has been serving western Jakarta since 1997
under a 25-year agreement with PAM Jaya, a government entity
owned by the province of Jakarta. The company has a total water
supply of more than 700 million liters (185 million gallons) a
day and 5,300 kilometers (3,300 miles) of pipe network,
according to  Manila Water ’s filing.  Suez, Paris-based, is the second-largest water company.  Manila Water shares slipped 0.4 percent to 28.40 pesos, its
fifth straight day of declines, the longest losing stretch since
May 16. The stock has risen 46 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
