The first abortion clinic on the
island of Ireland is scheduled to open today, with opponents
preparing a protest outside its doors in central Belfast.  Marie Stopes International , which has 629 centers in 40
countries, is opening the clinic in downtown Belfast in the U.K.
region of  Northern Ireland  at 1:00 p.m.  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have some of
the toughest anti-abortion laws in  Europe . In Northern Ireland,
the procedure can only be performed in the first nine weeks of
pregnancy and only if a women’s health is at serious risk. South
of the border, abortions are illegal unless a women’s life is at
risk.  “Our unborn children must be protected,” Bernadette
Smyth, head of Precious Life, an anti-abortion group, said on
the organization’s  website , laying out its plans for a “a
massive peaceful prayer rally” at the clinic today. “It is
vital that all good people of faith be there to pray to stop
this terrible evil.”  The clinic’s director, Dawn Purvis, a former lawmaker in
Northern Ireland’s power-sharing assembly, said last week Marie
Stopes will operate strictly within the U.K. region’s laws.
Elsewhere in the U.K., abortions can be carried out up to 24
weeks and with no need to show a woman would have severe
psychological or physical harm should she give birth.  Last year around 1,000 women from Northern Ireland traveled
to mainland U.K. for abortions, according to Britain’s Health
Ministry. Some 4,000 women from the  Republic of Ireland  traveled
to Britain for terminations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
