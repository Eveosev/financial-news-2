Kingfisher Airlines Ltd., until 2011  India 's second-biggest airline by market share, has this month appeared to enter the terminal stage of a prolonged and painful descent into bankruptcy and stasis. Dependent for the last few months on the goodwill of its employees, many of whom have not received their salaries since March, Kingfisher on Oct. 1  terminated  the last few flights  on its schedule after the staff went on strike.  A notice on the airline's website  said it was "hopeful of resuming operations on October 21, 2012." But with the airline already more than $2 billion in debt, passenger confidence lost after months of abrupt alterations or cancellations of scheduled flights, no immediate prospect of a fresh infusion of capital from a new investor and no revenue after India's aviation regulator asked it  to stop taking fresh bookings , it is hard to see how the airline can -- or indeed why it should -- resume operations. Last month,  Kingfisher's share price , currently hovering around 11 rupees (about 20 cents) from a 2008 high of about 280 rupees, jumped briefly after the government announced that for the first time, foreign investors could buy a stake of up to 49 percent in domestic airlines. But Kingfisher's owner, the flamboyant liquor baron  Vijay Mallya , has failed to find any parties interested in his business, and the airline's latest dose of troubles provides little hope of a turnaround. Indeed, the only reason it has continued to function this long, after years of slipping ever deeper into debt, is because it has been seen, like some U.S. banks after the recession of 2008, as "too big to fail." Many of Kingfisher's creditors are state-owned banks, such as the  State Bank  of India, and they would take a severe hit if the company went under. Last month a consortium of lenders said they could loan no more money to the airline and gave Mallya  one month  to put together a plan to rescue the company, possibly by selling stakes in his liquor business, United Breweries Ltd. ( Mallya's net worth  from the combined holdings of his conglomerate continues to be more than $1 billion). But, as Mythili Bhusnurmath wrote in the Economic Times  late last year : The pipeline should have been turned off long ago. Kingfisher's promise when it launched commercial operations in 2005 --  "Welcome to a world without passengers"  -- was meant to tell customers they could expect a special class of service onboard. But this phrase seems destined to be quoted in Indian business schools as a cautionary tale about trying to do far too much far too fast in a business as risky and capital-intensive as aviation. Earlier this year, the journalist Mihir Mishra  provided a good overview  of Kingfisher's many strategic errors and its failure to lay a solid foundation in the manner of another low-fare airline,  IndiGo , that now regularly shows a profit (partly because of a rapid increase in market share after the collapse of Kingfisher). When the recession of 2008, the rising costs of aircraft turbine fuel year on year, and the recent drop in the value of the rupee against the dollar were added to Kingfisher's ambitious expansion into both the low-fare segment and international flight operations in 2008, the result was a financial quagmire. In the Hindu Business Line , the aviation analyst Kapil Kaul offered a summary of Kingfisher's troubles, and suggested the airline's management needed to shut it down instead of limping along on a truncated schedule heavily dependent on the goodwill of employees owed many months of arrears: And  in the Sunday Guardian , the editor MJ Akbar had some scathing words about the Kingfisher management's latest misstep, that of claiming that it was being let down by striking employees. Akbar's complaint went beyond the particular example of Kingfisher, and asked if language itself didn't become hopelessly devalued currency by being dragged through the distortions of PR- and corporate-speak. (One could point to similar linguistic acrobatics in the controversial  Indian mining company Vedanta's massive public-relations exercise  earlier this year, titled, in the face of all evidence, "Creating Happiness.") Akbar wrote: In  a long letter,  by turns cajoling and indignant, to disaffected employees in August this year, Mallya said that "our Company will be re-capitalised" and threatened to "stop my own support as a few are effectively holding the entire Company to ransom." The sand has now almost run out of the hourglass of Mallya's promise, or bluster, and there is something perverse about his inability to admit to errors of judgment of his own, and his perception that staffers should draw on their own reserves of capital to save him from the embarrassment of a total shutdown. Meanwhile, in the wake of the disappearance from the skies of a major player in an industry with many entry barriers, Indian fliers will have to put up, at least in the short-term, with higher prices. Harsh Joshi wrote in the  Wall Street Journal : Joshi also notes: Kingfisher was a big part of the takeoff of that growth story, but it sure looks like it didn't plan to fly the whole way.
