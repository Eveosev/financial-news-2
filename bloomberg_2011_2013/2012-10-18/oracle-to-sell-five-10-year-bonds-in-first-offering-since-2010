Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  plans to sell $5
billion of debt in two parts in its first bond offering in more
than two years.  The world’s largest supplier of database software may sell
$2.5 billion each of five-year securities to yield 45 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 10-year debt at
a relative yield of 68 basis points, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. The sale may be completed as soon
as today.  Proceeds from the sale of the senior, unsecured securities
will be used to refinance debt and for general corporate
purposes, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the terms aren’t set.  The company last tapped the bond market with a new offering
in July 2010, issuing $3.25 billion in a two-part sale.  The new bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service
and an equivalent A+ at  Standard & Poor’s , said the person.
Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the sale for the
Redwood City, California-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
