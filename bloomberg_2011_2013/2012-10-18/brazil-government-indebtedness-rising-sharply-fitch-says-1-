Brazil’s government debt is rising
“sharply” and is on the high side of the median for BBB-rated
sovereign securities, said  Shelly Shetty , Fitch Ratings senior
director and head of Latin America sovereign debt.  “Brazil’s Achilles’ heel is public finances,” Shetty said
in an interview in Sao Paulo following a speech on the country’s
sovereign rating. “The government overtaxes and overspends. The
stock of debt is higher than peers and interest rates are higher
which means that the interest burden to revenue is 15 percent,
compared to the median 7 percent” for BBB sovereign peers.  Risks related to Brazil’s growing public debt are offset by
greater confidence that the country’s growth and investment
prospects are improving, Shetty said to reporters in Sao Paulo.  The country will grow about 4.2 percent in 2013, compared
to 1.5 percent this year, she said. Growth recovery along with
high inflationary expectations and a “tight” labor market will
push the central bank to increase benchmark borrowing costs from
a record-low 7.25 percent in the second half of 2013, though the
rate will stay in single digits, she said.  She said  Brazil ’s credit rating, along with most Latin
American peers, is stable and “very well anchored.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
