MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) , a venture
between  Pansy Ho  and MGM Resorts International, won a land grant
to develop a second casino resort in  Macau .  MGM  China  has made an initial payment of 450 million
patacas ($56 million) to the Macau government for the HK$20
billion ($2.6 billion) project which will be funded by loans and
internal resources, the casino operator said in a statement to
Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday.  The approval allows MGM China to build on the city’s
increasingly popular Cotai strip, where the operator doesn’t
have a presence. Sands China Ltd. and  Galaxy Entertainment Group
Ltd. (27)  are also expanding Cotai facilities that combine hotels and
casinos to draw so-called mass-market gamblers, who provide
wider margins.  “Getting the approval to build its first casino in Cotai
will help to broaden MGM’s customer base,” said Edwin Fan, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Bank of China International.  MGM China jumped 4.3 percent to HK$14.24 at the close in
Hong Kong trading, the highest gain since Sept. 7. MGM Resorts
rose 2.3 percent to $11.17 in  New York  trading on Oct. 18, the
highest close since Sept. 17.  Casino Resort  The casino, with a lease term of 25 years and a total land
premium of 1.29 billion patacas, will include 1,600 hotel rooms,
500 gaming tables and 2,500 slots built on a 71,833 square meter
site, it said.  The project, which will take as long as 36 months to build,
will be MGM’s first on the Cotai strip, a piece of reclaimed
land that is Asia’s equivalent to the Las Vegas Strip.  “The company has already secured project financing for the
development,” Fan said. “But there’s a high chance it will cut
its dividend payout ratio.”  MGM China is the fourth company to receive a go-ahead this
year to expand on the Cotai Strip in Macau, the only place in
China where casino gambling is legal.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) ,  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  and Galaxy have already won approvals
to step up their presence in the world’s biggest gambling hub.  Macau gambling revenue rose 12 percent to 23.9 billion
patacas in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
