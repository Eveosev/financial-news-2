Ethanol futures increased for a
second day on higher corn prices and a drop in inventories.  The biofuel was bolstered by corn’s 2 percent gain today
and an Energy Department report yesterday that ethanol
inventories fell 1.4 percent last week. U.S. ethanol is made
from corn and blended into gasoline.  “A lot of it had to do with the corn rally, and we drew
down inventories yesterday,” said Jerrod Kitt, director of
research at Linn Group in  Chicago . “You’ve still got ample
ethanol in inventory, technically, but there’s just a feeling
that there’s less of it around.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery climbed 3.1 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $2.422 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has risen 9.9 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 2 cents to $2.49
a gallon in  New York , 3.5 cents to $2.425 in Chicago, 3 cents to
$2.48 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $2.565 on the West Coast.  Corn for December delivery gained 15.25 cents to $7.6075 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 2 cents to $92.10 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery slid 3.66 cents to $2.7451 a
gallon on the Nymex, the sixth consecutive decline. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
