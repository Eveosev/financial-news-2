New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie  and his wife, Mary Pat, reported adjusted gross income for last year of $567,772, up 26 percent from 2010, according to returns released today by his office.  The couple paid $141,158 in federal taxes for a rate of 24.9 percent, higher than the 20.5 percent paid by President  Barack Obama  and Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney ’s 14.1 percent. The Christies, who live in Mendham Township, also paid $37,585 in property taxes and $19,830 for child care.  The Christies reported combined wages of $469,151, with $307,372 from Cantor Fitzgerald LP, where Mary Pat was a vice president in Summit. She became a managing director at  New York-  based Angelo, Gordon & Co. last month, according to  Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for the governor.  The couple also reported $161,779 of pay from the state of New Jersey, according to the returns.  “I’ve got three words for you fellas -- joint checking account,” Christie, 50, a first-term Republican, said at an Oct. 16 town-hall meeting in West Milford. “It all goes to the same place, baby.”  No Fun  He joked that this was “Mary Pat’s least favorite week” because the couple released the financial information. The governor said 2011 marked the 26th consecutive year his wife out-earned him.  Christie and his wife reported adjusted gross income in 2010 of $449,607, according to  returns .  They listed $26,224 in gifts to charity for 2011, without disclosing where their contributions went.  New Jersey led the U.S. in combined state and local tax burden in 2009, according to the Washington-based  Tax Foundation , a nonpartisan research group. The state also has the highest property-tax bills, which averaged $7,759 last year.  The governor in 2010 signed legislation limiting annual property-tax increases to 2 percent. This year, he has fought with Democrats in the Legislature who refuse to release $183 million set aside for income-tax relief until state revenue reaches Christie’s projections.
