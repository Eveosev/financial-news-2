Indonesia’s bonds advanced, pushing
the 10-year yield to a two-month low, on speculation foreign
funds are chasing higher returns as other Asian central banks
cut  interest rates . The rupiah was little changed.  Overseas investors added  3.59 trillion rupiah  ($374 million)
to their sovereign debt holdings this month through Oct. 16,
finance ministry data show. Thailand unexpectedly cut borrowing
costs yesterday, following  South Korea  last week, while the
Philippines’ central bank governor said Oct. 10 there was room
to lower rates.  Bank Indonesia  kept its  reference rate  unchanged
for an eighth month on Oct. 11.  “Indonesia’s rates remain higher compared with other
 emerging markets  in Asia,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the head of
treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. “The
rupiah will remain range-bound as the central bank guards
against volatility.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.72
percent as of 9:12 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. That was the lowest level since
Aug. 6.  The rupiah traded at 9,575 per dollar, after closing at
9,574 yesterday, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency touched 9,657 on Oct. 11, the weakest level
since October 2009. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
