OCI Co. (010060) ,  South Korea ’s biggest maker
of polysilicon for solar cells, sank to a four-year low in Seoul
trading after reporting a worse-than-estimated 87 percent drop
in quarterly operating profit.  OCI slid as much as 3.4 percent to 156,500 won, before
trading 3.1 percent lower at 9:50 a.m. on the Korea Exchange.
That’s the lowest intraday level since Oct. 29, 2008. The
benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.3 percent.  Operating profit dropped to 33 billion won ($30 million) in
the three months ended September from 252.4 billion won a year
earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The
 average  of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 79.9
billion won. Solar manufacturers from  China  to the U.S. are
under pressure because oversupply has depressed prices.  “It’s an earnings shock,” Kim Seung Woo, an analyst at
Samsung Securities Co., wrote in a report, where he cut his
share-price estimate by 19 percent to 183,000 won. “There’s
still considerable uncertainty over the timing of a polysilicon
price rebound.”  The spot price of polysilicon has been falling since
February, dragging down the price of long-term contracts for the
material derived from sand. Such contracts, which still account
for a large part of sales, are now in the $23 to $25 a kilogram
range, according to most analysts. Only last year they averaged
about $51 a kilogram, depending on quality, BNEF data shows.  Woori Investment & Securities Co. and NH Investment &
Securities Co. also reduced their share-price estimates on OCI.
The  stock  has fallen 28 percent this year, compared with a 7.2
percent gain in the Kospi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
