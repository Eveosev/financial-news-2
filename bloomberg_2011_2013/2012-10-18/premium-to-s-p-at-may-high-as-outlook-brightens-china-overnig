Chinese equities  climbed in  New York 
to their highest valuation relative to U.S. stocks since May as
rising retail sales and expanding industrial production signal
the world’s second-largest economy is reviving.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. added 0.5 percent to a five-month
high of 96.21 yesterday. China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.
posted the longest rally since 2003 and PetroChina Co. climbed
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted their price targets.
Twelve-month non-deliverable  yuan  forwards weakened the most
since Aug. 15 after the currency rose beyond 6.25 per dollar in
 Shanghai  for the first time in 19 years.  Companies on the China-U.S. gauge trade at 19 times
estimated earnings, the highest valuation in five months and the
 most expensive  relative to stocks on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index since May, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Speculation of
a Chinese recovery has been driving the gains and was reinforced
by data released yesterday showing  industrial production 
rebounded last month from a three-year low in August and retail
sales climbed the most in six months.  “We’re seeing a whole set of good data and people expect
fourth-quarter growth to pick up,” Michael Ding, lead portfolio
manager of the China Regional Fund at U.S. Global Investors,
which oversees $2.2 billion of assets, said by phone from  San
Antonio  yesterday. “This will benefit industrial raw materials
and equipment companies the most.”  China ETF Gains  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose an eighth day for its
longest stretch of gains since January 2009, adding 0.3 percent
to $37.45. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.2 percent to 1,457.34 after
Google Inc. reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed
estimates.  China Petroleum,  Asia ’s largest oil refiner also known as
Sinopec, rose 0.5 percent to $105.31 in New York, the highest
level since May 2. Its 11-day rally was the longest since June
2003.  The 12-month price estimate of Sinopec’s American
depositary receipts was  lifted  by Goldman by 9 percent to $121,
according to a report yesterday, citing lower  oil prices  and
attractive valuation. The bank maintained a buy recommendation
on the stock.  Crude for November delivery was little changed at $92.1 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have
declined 6.8 percent this year.  Gas Price Reform  PetroChina, the nation’s largest oil producer, climbed 0.7
percent on its fourth day of gains to $141.22, the highest since
May 7.  The Beijing-based company is the biggest beneficiary of
 China ’s natural gas pricing because it has the largest reserves
among domestic peers, Banerjee wrote in the report. Goldman
raised the ADR’s price target to $142 from $130, reiterating a
neutral rating.  China’s top economic planner has indicated it may relax
price controls on natural gas and fuels in the second half,
PetroChina President Zhou Jiping said at a post-earnings
briefing on Aug. 23.  The Chinese  economy  expanded 7.4 percent last quarter from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said yesterday. That
matched the median projection of 43 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The growth pace for the  first nine months  was 7.7
percent, and the government has a full-year target of 7.5
percent.  ‘Green Shoots’  Industrial production increased 9.2 percent last month,
rebounding from a three-year low of 8.9 percent in August, and
retails sales advanced the most in six months at 14.2 percent,
yesterday’s data showed.  There has been increasing amount of evidence of “green
shoots” from industries including transportation, commodities,
exports, property, retail and manufacturing, according to a
report yesterday from Ting Lu, China economist at Bank of
America Corp. China’s third-quarter GDP may be a trough,
although it may take another couple of quarters for growth to
significantly recover.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s fourth-largest coal miner,
advanced 2.4 percent to a two-month high of $16.84. China Life,
the nation’s largest insurer, gained 2.2 percent to $43.94 after
posting a 5.7 percent tumble, the biggest slump in seven months,
on Oct. 17. Its ADRs traded 0.2 percent  below  the Hong Kong
stock, narrowing from a 3.4 percent discount a day earlier.  Ctrip.Com Jumps  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) , the nation’s largest online
travel agency, surged 6.4 percent to $19.86, the highest close
since May 17. The company traded at 16.8 times its estimated 12-
month profit. The multiple had dropped to 10.3 on July 17, the
lowest since 2005.  “The valuations in Chinese stocks are mostly still
relatively low and have upside potential,” U.S. Global
Investors’ Ding said. “Any further downside in corporate
earnings won’t be as bad as what we saw in the first half.”  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s most-popular search engine,
sank 1.5 percent to $113.18, retreating from a two-week high,
after Google’s third-quarter earnings report.  Qihoo 360
Technology Co. (QIHU) , a Beijing-based  software developer  which started
a search engine in August, dropped 2.6 percent to $21.66.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  jumped 1.2 percent yesterday
to a one-month high of 2,131.69. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  climbed 1.4
percent to 10,636.25, the highest level since May 4.  China’s yuan strengthened 0.07 percent to 6.2503 per dollar
in Shanghai yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The rate touched 6.2446 earlier in the day, rising
beyond 6.25 per dollar for the first time in 19 years. Twelve-
month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.23 percent to 6.3665,
declining the most since Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
