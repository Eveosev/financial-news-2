Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $5.2 billion in the first nine
months of 2012 to pay investment-bank employees, a 9 percent
decline from a year earlier.  The ratio of compensation to revenue in the unit fell to
44.9 percent, compared with 48.4 percent in the same period a
year earlier, when excluding accounting gains and losses related
to the firm’s credit spreads. That’s still higher than  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment bank.
Compensation and benefits for all of Morgan Stanley totaled $12
billion in the first nine months, down 4 percent.  Pay expenses at the institutional-securities unit, which
includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred
pay for bankers and traders, were $1.6 billion in the third
quarter, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today on its  website .  The world’s biggest banks are cutting costs amid concerns
that the global economy will slow revenue growth and new capital
rules will depress returns. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 54, said in an interview with the
Financial Times published earlier this month that Wall Street
employees are “still overpaid.”  Job Cuts  Morgan Stanley, which said in July it planned to reduce
more than 700 positions during the rest of the year, eliminated
901 jobs in the quarter ended Sept. 30. In the past 12 months
the company shed 4,519 employees, or 7 percent of its workforce,
from job cuts and unit sales.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, cut
compensation expenses at its investment bank by 9.4 percent in
the first nine months of the year as the business generated 7.1
percent less revenue. It was enough to give each of the
division’s 25,884 employees $269,703.  Goldman Sachs set aside almost $11 billion to pay employees
in the first nine months of the year, up 10 percent from the
same period in 2011 as revenue climbed. Goldman Sachs’s cost was
equivalent to $336,441 for each of its 32,600 workers as of
Sept. 30.  Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees. Average pay per worker
doesn’t reflect the amount of money employees actually receive.
Top executives and revenue producers sometimes receive
multimillion-dollar awards, while clerical workers get smaller
salaries.  Companywide Compensation  Adjusted for accounting gains and losses related to the
firm’s credit spreads, known as debt-valuation adjustments or
DVA, revenue at the Morgan Stanley’s institutional-securities
unit fell 1.27 percent to $11.5 billion in the nine months.  Morgan Stanley’s companywide compensation, the firm’s
largest expense, was enough to pay each of its 57,726 employees
$207,757 for the nine months, up from $201,542 for each of the
62,245 employees at the end of the third quarter of 2011,
according to figures released today. The bank doesn’t report how
many people work in institutional securities.  Morgan Stanley’s brokerage division, which employed 16,829
financial advisers at the end of September, set aside $6.15
billion for pay in the nine months, down 1 percent from a year
earlier. The unit’s compensation cost, which is set by a fixed
grid for some employees, was 61 percent of the division’s
revenue, down from 62 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
