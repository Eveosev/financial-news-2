The following is the text
of  Canada â€™s wholesale trade report for August from
Statistics Canada.  Wholesale sales rose by 0.5% to $49.7 billion in August,
following two consecutive monthly declines. Higher sales in the
food, beverage and tobacco subsector, and the machinery,
equipment and supplies subsector, were the main contributors to
the increase.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.5% in August.  Sales increase in four out of seven subsectors  In August, four out of seven subsectors, representing 56%
of total sales, reported increases.  The largest advance was in the food, beverage and tobacco
subsector, where sales rose 2.3% to $9.5 billion. The gain was
based solely on growth in the food industry (+2.7%), which
posted its largest advance since February 2010. This increase
followed a decline of 2.1% in July.  The machinery, equipment and supplies subsector rose 1.4%,
the fourth increase in five months. All four industries in this
subsector posted gains in August, with the farm, lawn and garden
machinery and equipment industry (+4.3%) and the construction,
forestry, mining and industrial machinery, equipment and
supplies industry (+1.4%) accounting for two-thirds of the
increase.  After relatively flat sales since April 2012, the building
material and supplies subsector gained 1.0% in August. This
increase reflected higher sales in all three industries of the
subsector.  The largest decrease occurred in the miscellaneous
subsector, where sales fell 1.9%. This was the fourth
consecutive decrease in the subsector. The chemical (except
agricultural) and allied product industry (-4.8%) and the
agricultural supplies industry (-2.8%) accounted for most of the
decline in August.  The motor vehicle and parts subsector (-0.7%) and the
personal and household goods subsector (-0.5%) also reported
losses in August.  Wholesale sales up in most provinces  Sales were up in eight provinces in August, with Ontario,
British Columbia and  Quebec  accounting for most of the national
increase.  Sales in Ontario, which account for close to 50% of total
wholesale trade, advanced 0.9%, partially offsetting a decline
in July. Sales in Ontario have increased six out of eight months
since January 2012.  Sales in British Columbia gained 1.5%, the first increase
in three months.  In Quebec, sales rose 0.4%, following a 0.9% decrease in
July.  Saskatchewan reported the largest sales decrease (-6.2%),
the third consecutive monthly decline. Lower sales in the
agricultural supplies industry contributed to the drop in August.  Inventories continue to increase  Inventories rose 0.8% to $61.6 billion in August, a ninth
consecutive monthly increase. Overall, 12 of the 25 industries
registered higher inventories.  The largest increases in dollar terms were in the motor
vehicle industry (+8.7%) and the construction, forestry, mining
and industrial machinery, equipment and supplies industry
(+1.8%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio was unchanged at 1.24 in
August.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
current dollars, unless otherwise noted. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010 -
x/2010003/part-partie3-eng.htm).  Total wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by
deflating current dollar values using relevant price indexes.
The wholesale sales series in chained (2007) dollars is a
chained Fisher volume index with 2007 as the reference year.  Data for total wholesale sales in volume, including the
chain Fisher volume index, have been revised from January 2004
onward to reflect methodological enhancements. In addition, the
reference year has changed from 2002 to 2007 for these volume
data. For more information, see Sales in volume for Wholesale
Trade. ( http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb -
