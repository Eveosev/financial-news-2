Germany is proposing to toughen
Greece’s access to international aid by setting up an escrow
account outside its reach to guarantee payments of interest and
debt to creditors, a government official said.  Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who suggested that
Greece will get more aid even while struggling to meet the
conditions, wants a lasting solution to the country’s debt
crisis to restore confidence in financial markets, the official,
who asked not to be named, told reporters.  The so-called troika of European Commission,  European
Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund  yesterday said it
expects a staff-level agreement in coming days that would pave
the way for the next payment of aid funds to the debt-stricken
country. Under Germany’s proposal, that money would go to the
special fund.  A final deal will help unlock a 31 billion-euro ($40.6
billion) aid installment that the country needs to avoid a
default.  Greece  remains on life support with the country mired
in its fifth year of a recession that has shrunk the economy by
almost 20 percent.  “It will not happen that there will be a ‘Staatsbankrott’
in Greece,” Schaeuble said in English at a forum in  Singapore 
on Oct. 14, using the German word for sovereign default. The
escrow account would be outside Greece’s control and force the
country to cut spending or raise taxes to make ends meet, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
