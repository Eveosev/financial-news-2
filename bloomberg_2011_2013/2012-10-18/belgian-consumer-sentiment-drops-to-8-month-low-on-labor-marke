Belgian  consumer confidence  fell to
an eight-month low in October as concerns over joblessness
reached the highest level in more than 2 1/2 years amid a
bleaker economic outlook.  The consumer sentiment indicator for  Belgium , the euro
area’s sixth-largest economy, dropped to minus 17 from minus 14
a month earlier, the Brussels-based National Bank of Belgium
said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest reading
since minus 20 in February.  A gauge measuring concerns about rising unemployment
increased to 50 from 40 the previous month, the highest since
March 2010. The sub-index gauging households’ assessment of the
Belgian economy in the coming year fell to minus 16 from minus
11, the biggest retreat since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
