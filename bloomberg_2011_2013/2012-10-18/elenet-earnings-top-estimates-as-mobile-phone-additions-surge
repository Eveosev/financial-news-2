Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET) , the
Belgian cable operator  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)  seeks full control
of, reported earnings that beat analyst estimates because of a
release of bonus and fringe benefit accruals amid record mobile-
phone customer additions.  Adjusted  earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 8.5 percent to 200.1 million euros ($262.1
million) in the third quarter, the Mechelen, Belgium-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts projected 197.6
million euros, the average of eight estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to 367.3 million euros.  Telenet gained 65,500  mobile-phone subscribers  in the
quarter, the most since the cable operator began offering
wireless telephony in 2006, after the introduction of its King
and Kong mobile rate plans during the quarter. About 16 percent
of Telenet’s cable-TV clients have already switched to the
company’s mobile service and Chief Executive Officer Duco Sickinghe said he expects customer gains to accelerate in the
current quarter.  “As of next quarter, mobile telephony should overtake
digital TV in showing the strongest revenue growth,” Chief
Financial Officer Renaat Berckmoes told reporters in Mechelen.
“From a free cash flow point of view, mobile telephony offers
us a very interesting return on investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
