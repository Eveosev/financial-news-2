Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
increased 15 percent the past week, the most since November,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose 1.43 million barrels to 10.8 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest percentage gain
since the week ended Nov. 16. Supplies climbed to the highest
since April 11.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rebounded 1.23 million barrels, or 12 percent, to
11.4 million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the highest
level since July 4.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen fell 284,000 barrels,
or 1.4 percent, to 19.3 million, according to the data. That’s
the third drop in four weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
