The U.S.  PGA Tour  will take
operational control of the Canadian Tour on Nov. 1, the American
golf circuit said.  Canada ’s leading golf series will be known as PGA Tour
Canada and provide access for its leading money winners to the
Web.com Tour, a lower-level professional circuit operated by the
PGA Tour.  PGA Tour Canada will have at least eight tournaments in
2013 with a minimum purse of $150,000 for each event. The U.S.
tour said in a press release it has a goal of expanding to 12 or
13 events across Canada.  Since its start in 1986, 172 Canadian Tour players have
advanced to play on the U.S. tour, including 2003 Masters
Tournament winner  Mike Weir , a native of Sarnia, Ontario.  The U.S. tour, the richest in the world, loaned the
Canadian Tour what it termed “strategic and financial support”
last season while evaluating the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
