Tunisia’s government issued two
decrees aimed at ensuring the freedom of the press, after a mass
strike by journalists who complained about perceived efforts to
restrict freedoms in the country after last year’s uprising.  The strike yesterday organized by the Journalists’
Syndicate and involving about 1,200 people was the first ever by
the press in the country. The protest reflects concerns by the
media about a crackdown on freedoms after Islamists rose to
power in a nation once seen as among the most secular in the
Arab world.  The government, which is headed by the Islamist Ennahda
movement, issued the decrees late yesterday after the strike had
ended, ceding one of the demands of the media. The protest led
to the failure of most newspapers to publish today.  While the decrees were first issued last November, the
ruling troika of Ennahda, Ettakatol and Congress for the
Republic did not ratify them at the time. One decree guarantees
the freedom of the media. The other, while also regulating the
broadcast sector, is aimed at limiting direct oversight of
content by government officials.  Several newspaper reporters, editors and managers have
faced threats or court cases over articles they published. In
February, Attunissia’s director general, Nassredine Ben Saida,
was jailed after the paper published a photo of a famous
Tunisian soccer player posing with a nude model. He was released
a month later, amid an outcry by rights groups, after paying a
fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
