Sugar fell to a four-week low on
signs of increasing production in  Brazil , the world’s biggest
grower. Cocoa rose, while orange juice dropped.  Sugar-cane output in Brazil’s center south, the main
growing region, may climb to 538 million metric tons next
season, compared with 512 million tons in the previous year,
 Jonathan Kingsman , the founder of Kingsman SA, said today at a
conference in  London . In an interview, Kingsman said he may
revise his forecasts next week, with production in the 2013-2014
crop year as large as 575 million tons.  Traders “worry about prices as everyone anticipates a
larger Brazilian crop,”  Michael McDougall , the head of the
Brazil desk at Newedge Group in New York, said in an e-mailed
report today. “Other countries appear to be producing large
crops, even though prices have slid.”  Raw-sugar for March delivery declined 1.6 percent to close
at 19.79 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching 19.67 cents, the lowest since Sept. 19.  Global supplies will outpace consumption by 6 million tons
this year, according to Julio Borges, the director of JOB
Economia & Planejamento, a researcher.  Effective Nov. 5, the daily trading session for sugar
futures and options contracts will be reduced by an hour, with
trading starting at 2:30 a.m.  New York  time instead of 1:30
a.m., ICE said today in a statement. No changes were made to
settlement hours.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained 2.2 percent to
$2,438 a ton in New York.  Also on ICE, orange-juice futures for January delivery
declined 2 percent at $1.1425 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
