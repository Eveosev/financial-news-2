European (SXXP)  stocks climbed for a fourth
day as a measure of U.S. manufacturing beat estimates, while
investors awaited the outcome of a two-day summit of the
European Union’s leaders.  Wincor Nixdorf AG (WIN) ,  Europe ’s biggest maker of automated
teller machines, rallied 11 percent.  Nestle SA (NESN)  retreated 1.7
percent as the world’s biggest food company reported nine-month
sales growth that missed analysts’ estimates.  Remy Cointreau SA (RCO) 
sank the most in 3 1/2 years after France’s second-biggest
distiller posted an improvement in first-half sales that fell
short of forecasts.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent to 276.18 at
the close, after earlier retreating as much as 0.3 percent. The
equity benchmark has  rallied 18 percent  from this year’s low on
June 4 as European Central Bank policy makers agreed on an
unlimited asset-purchase program and the  Federal Reserve 
announced a third round of quantitative easing.  “U.S. figures supported the cause of the bulls who remain
in the ascendancy,” said  Angus Campbell , head of market
analysis at Capital Spreads in  London . “With the EU summit
underway, investors are content to stick with equities as the
situation in Europe is showing a few signs of improvement.”  The Stoxx 600 climbed to its highest level since Sept. 25
yesterday as Moody’s Investors Service left unchanged its
investment-grade debt rating on  Spain  and house building surged
to a four-year high in the U.S.  U.S. Manufacturing  In the U.S., a measure of manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region jumped to 5.7 this month, beating the  median analyst
estimate  for a reading of 1.  A separate report from the Labor Department showed that
 initial jobless claims  climbed to 388,000 in the week ended Oct.
13, from a revised 342,000 the previous week. The  median
estimate  of 49 economists had called for an increase to 365,000.  EU leaders gathered in Brussels for a two-day summit.
French President  Francois Hollande  earlier said that efforts to
stem the debt crisis may unravel if  member states  fail to
deliver on their promises. He called on the euro area to
introduce a banking union, provide economic help to countries
that reduce budget deficits, and show investors that  Greece  can
stay in the single currency if it abides by its commitments.  The 27-nation EU has struggled to maintain momentum on its
plan to put the ECB in charge of banks across the euro area.
Skeptics have questioned the scope of the ECB’s supervisory
powers and how losses would be shared.  Spain’s Bonds  The yield  on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell to a six-
month low after the country sold 4.61 billion euros ($6 billion)
of securities due in 2015, 2016 and 2022. The government had
planned to auction 4.5 billion euros of debt.  The Bank of Spain said the country’s bad-loans ratio jumped
to a record 10.5 percent in August.  China ’s industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset
investment all accelerated in September. A separate release from
the National Bureau of Statistics showed that  gross domestic
product  expanded 7.4 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier. That matched the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News
survey and compared with 7.6 percent growth in the second
quarter. GDP rose 2.2 percent from the previous period, a four-
quarter high.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18
western-European markets today. France’s CAC 40 gained 0.2
percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.1 percent. Germany’s DAX
climbed 0.6 percent.  Wincor Nixdorf surged 11 percent to 34.07 euros on
speculation that its new open-source technology platform will
lead to more profitable mobile-payment systems.  Wilh. Wilhelmsen ASA (WWASA)  soared 5.8 percent to 42.20 kroner,
its biggest rally in five months. The Norwegian shipper of a
third of automobiles transported by sea proposed that it pays a
 second dividend  of 4 kroner per share for 2012.  Nestle, Remy  Nestle slipped 1.7 percent to 61.20 Swiss francs for the
biggest drag on the Stoxx 600. The world’s largest food company
reported in a statement that revenue excluding acquisitions,
divestments and currency swings gained 6.1 percent. The average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had called for
sales to climb 6.3 percent.  Remy Cointreau plunged 8 percent to 80.24 euros, its
biggest drop since March 2009.  Organic revenue  rose 13 percent
in the six months through September, the company said. That
missed the median estimate of nine analysts for an 18 percent
gain. Revenue climbed 5.3 percent in the second quarter. It had
surged 24 percent in the first three months of the fiscal year.  Man, Swatch  Man Group Plc (EMG)  slumped 9.9 percent to 83.4 pence. The
world’s biggest publicly traded hedge-fund manager said outflows
increased 57 percent in the third quarter.  “Investor sentiment and -- consequently -- the outlook for
flows continues to be subdued,” Chief Executive Officer  Peter Clarke  said in a statement.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest watchmaker, lost 2.4
percent to 386 francs and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the
owner of the Cartier brand, fell 3.5 percent to 60.10 francs.
Swiss watch exports declined 2.7 percent in September from a
year earlier, according to a report from the Federation of the
Swiss Watch Industry.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  slid 4 percent to 42.78 euros after the
paintmaker booked a 2.5 billion-euro writedown for its
decorative-coatings business.  The company overestimated market growth, Chief Financial
Officer Keith Nichols said in a conference call today. Demand
for its Dulux paint range has fallen. Akzo will introduce
further cost-cutting measures to counter the slowdown, he said.  Modern Times Group AB (MTGA) , the Swedish broadcaster with
operations in 35 countries, plummeted 22 percent to 218.90
kronor, the biggest decline since its initial public offering in
1997. The company reported third-quarter net income of 310
million kronor ($47 million), missing the 320 million-krona
average analyst estimate.  A gauge of European media shares dropped 0.9 percent.
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , the U.K.’s largest
commercial broadcaster, lost 2.1 percent to 733.5 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
