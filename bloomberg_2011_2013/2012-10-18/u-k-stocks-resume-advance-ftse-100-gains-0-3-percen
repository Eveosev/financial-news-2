U.K. stocks resumed an advance,
sending the benchmark FTSE 100 Index up 0.3 percent to 5,928 at
9:54 a.m. in  London . The gauge erased its advance earlier,
falling as much as 0.1 percent.  The FTSE 100 yesterday climbed to a one-month high after an
unexpected drop in the countryâ€™s unemployment and a surge in
U.S. new-house construction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
