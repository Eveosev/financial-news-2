The Philippine peso retreated from a
four-year high on speculation importers stepped up dollar
purchases to take advantage of a more favorable  exchange rate .  The currency fell 0.4 percent to 41.32 per dollar as of
4:25 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
41.120, the strongest level since March 2008. The peso gained
6.1 percent this year, the second-best performance among the 11
most-active Asian currencies, as foreign funds bought $1.9
billion more local shares than they sold, exchange data show.  “The 41 to 41.20 range appears to be a support level” for
the dollar versus the peso, said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market
strategist at Manila-based  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  “This level is a
sweet spot for importers.”  One-month implied volatility for the peso, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 15 basis points
to 5.25 percent. A support is a level on a price chart that
analysts predict will act as a floor in a declining market.  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.66 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  The  Philippines  plans to increase sales of government debt
in the local market this year by 9 percent to 585.1 billion
pesos ($14.2 billion), according to a funding plan obtained from
the Department of Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
