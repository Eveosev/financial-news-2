Australia ’s dollar touched the
strongest level in a month versus the Japanese currency after
Chinese retail sales were higher than forecast.  New Zealand’s dollar weakened against most of its major
counterparts as global equity prices fell and before the central
bank reports credit-card spending for September. The South
Pacific currencies were buoyed after data showed  China ’s
industrial production accelerated in September, boosting
prospects for exports.  “The data supports our long-held view of a soft landing in
China, which is supportive of currencies like the Canadian
dollar and Australian dollar,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency
strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in Toronto, wrote to clients
yesterday.  The Australian currency rose as much as 0.7 percent to
82.522 yen, the highest since Sept. 19, before trading 0.3
percent higher at 82.174 yesterday in New York. It fell 0.2
percent to $1.0366.  New Zealand’s currency declined 0.4 percent to 81.84 U.S.
cents and was little changed at 64.88 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent and the
MSCI World Index was little changed.  China’s  gross domestic product  expanded 7.4 percent during
the third quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing yesterday. That matched the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 43 economists.  Separate reports showed industrial production increased 9.2
percent in September from a year earlier, retail sales advanced
14.2 percent and fixed-asset investment excluding rural
households rose 20.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
