The direct recapitalization of
Spanish banks by the euro area’s permanent rescue fund isn’t an
urgent issue, a Spanish government official said.  The prospect of direct bank rescues became less relevant
after stress tests revealed that Spain’s lenders required less
than half of the 100 billion euros ($131 billion) approved by
euro-area states, a Spanish official told reporters in Brussels
today during a meeting of European Union leaders.  Spain estimated on Sept. 28 it may need about 40 billion
euros to recapitalize its banks. The government has played down
the necessity of seeking additional aid while pushing for
progress on a European banking union. Its  borrowing costs  have
dropped since the European Central Bank offered in August to buy
bonds on the secondary market of countries that request aid from
the euro-area rescue fund and agree to conditions.  Further aid for Spain isn’t urgent as the country’s last
auction today shows it can finance itself, the official said on
condition of anonymity in line with government policy. Spain
will consider whether to seek assistance after the ECB has
completed the design of its bond-buying mechanism, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
