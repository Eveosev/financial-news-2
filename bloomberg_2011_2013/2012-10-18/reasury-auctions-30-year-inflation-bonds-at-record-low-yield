The U.S. auction of $7 billion in
30-year inflation-indexed bonds sold at a record-low yield as
investors continue to pay a premium to guard against the threat
of rising consumer prices.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities sold today drew
a yield of  0.479 percent , versus the average forecast of 0.483
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The yield on the  10-year note 
touched a one-month high as French President  Francois Hollande 
said before a meeting in Brussels that European leaders “are
almost there” in agreeing on a program to address the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  “The auction went well -- 30-year break-evens are cheap
relative to the rest of the curve, and that makes 30-year TIPS
look more attractive,” said  Richard Gilhooly , an  interest-rate 
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit in  New
York . “There is still demand for inflation protection given the
Fed’s activities. And that demand should grow, resulting in
higher break-evens.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.83 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the highest level
since Sept. 18. The 1.625 percent note due August 2022 lost 1/8,
or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 1/8.  The yield rose 16 basis points over the previous two days,
the most for a two-day period since March 14.  Yields on current 30-year bonds rose two basis points to
3.02 percent, the highest since Sept. 19.  Break-Evens  The  difference  in yields between 30-year bonds and TIPS, a
gauge of what traders expect for inflation, have risen this
year, touching 2.53 percentage points today, up from 2.13
percent in January.  The gap, known as the break-even rate, rose to 2.66 on
Sept. 13 after the  Federal Open Market Committee  said it would
begin a third round of the quantitative-easing stimulus
strategy, buying $40 billion of mortgage debt every month until
the economic recovery is well-established.  “The Fed pushing down nominal rates near record levels,
and the belief that their accommodative policies will eventually
lead to inflation down the road, has continued to buoy TIPS,”
said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP
Paribas SA, which as a primary dealer is obligated to bid at
auctions. “It’s the only point in the TIPS curve where you can
buy and earn something in real terms, given the market’s view of
inflation.”  Bidder Participation  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than regular Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s adjusted based on the Labor
Department’s consumer price index.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities sale’s  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid
with the amount offered, was 2.82, compared to an average of
2.71 over the past seven auctions.  Indirect bidders , a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 49.1 percent of the bonds,
compared to an average of 39.7 percent at the past seven
auctions. It was the second highest percentage after February’s
55.2 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.2 percent,
versus an average of 18.9 percent at the past 7 auctions.  TIPS have returned 6 percent this year after gaining 14
percent in 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. The broader Treasury market has returned 1.4 percent
this year, compared with 9.8 percent in 2011, the indexes show.  Fed Pledge  The Fed in September extended until mid-2015 a pledge to
keep its benchmark  interest rate  at virtually zero. Policy
makers acted as unemployment, which Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has
called a “grave concern,” dropped below 8 percent in September
for the first time since January 2009.  The Fed is mandated by Congress to aim for  price stability 
and maximum employment.  Treasuries extended gains earlier as  jobless claims 
increased by 46,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Oct. 13 from a
revised 342,000 the prior period that was the lowest since
February 2008, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a rise in claims to 365,000.  The Fed bought $1.891 billion of Treasuries due from
February 2036 to August 2042 as part of its program to replace
$267 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further
and counter rising risks of a recession.  Europe Crisis  Treasuries pared earlier gains as European leaders met to
contain the region’s debt crisis exactly three years after
 Greece  touched off the turmoil by revealing a bigger-than-
expected  budget deficit . Under discussion were joint banking
supervision and options for closer economic and fiscal union.
Included is a proposal for pooling euro-area debt that is
supported by  France , Spain and  Italy  and rejected by German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  “I’m in favor of moving forward,” Hollande told reporters
as the two-day summit began. Suggesting electoral considerations
are holding Merkel back, he said Germany and France have a joint
responsibility to get the euro area out of crisis and “we are
almost there.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
