Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s largest custody bank, is offering $1.5 billion of bonds
after reporting third-quarter earnings yesterday that climbed a
more-than-estimated 11 percent.  The bank may sell $600 million of three-year fixed-rate
debt to yield 33 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $400 million of three-year floating-rate notes at a
relative yield of 23 basis points more than the quarterly London
interbank offered rate, and $500 million of securities due
January 2018 at a spread of 55 basis points, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  Bank of New York last sold dollar debt in May, issuing $500
million of 1.969 percent, five-year debentures to yield 110
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The new bonds may be rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
and A+ by Standard & Poor’s, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because terms aren’t set. Bank of New York, Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, and UBS AG are
managing the offering, which may be completed as soon as today.  Net income at the bank increased to $720 million, or 61
cents a share, from $651 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier,
the New York-based bank said in a statement yesterday. Profit
beat the 54-cent-a-share average estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
