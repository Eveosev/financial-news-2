Peruvian bank lending will grow as
much as 18 percent this year and next without creating risks to
the financial system, said the president of the countryâ€™s
banking association, Asbanc.  Economic growth of about 6 percent and demand from new
customers will allow a faster rate of loan expansion than in
developed economies, Oscar Rivera told reporters in  Lima  today.
Demand for sol-denominated loans is stronger than for credit in
dollars, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
