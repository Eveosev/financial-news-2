Poland ’s five-year bond yields slid
to a record low after two monetary policy makers talked about
cutting borrowing costs as soon as next month.  The yield on notes maturing in July 2017 fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.08 percent as of 5:40
p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty traded little changed at 4.0984 per
euro.  The Polish currency depreciated to a two-week low yesterday
and bond yields fell after industrial output shrank the most in
more than three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The data shows a “more decisive” rate cut is needed next
month, Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, a member of the Monetary Policy
Council, told reporters in Warsaw today. A  rate cut in November
may start a “short cycle,” PAP newswire cited policy maker
Anna Zielinska-Glebocka as saying.  “The industrial output data sealed a rate cut in
November,” Janusz Dancewicz, the Warsaw-based chief economist
of DZ Bank Polska SA, wrote in a research note. “The central
bank may now try to send a strong signal that it’s not oblivious
to what’s happening with economic growth and will cut rates by
50 basis points straight away.”  Speaking separately in an interview with PAP, fellow rate-
setter  Adam Glapinski  said he “won’t rule out” voting in favor
of easing at the Nov. 6-7 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
