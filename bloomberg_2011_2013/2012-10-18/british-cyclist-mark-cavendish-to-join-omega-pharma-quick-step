Mark Cavendish , a British sprinter
who’s won 23 Tour de  France  stages, quit Team Sky to join
Belgium’s Omega Pharma-Quick Step.  Cavendish is leaving after Manchester, England-based Sky
focused its priority this year on team leader Bradley Wiggins,
according to the team website. Wiggins became the first British
winner of the Tour de France in July.  Cavendish, 27, took his 23rd stage win on the last day of
the French race, moving him ahead of  Lance Armstrong  and into
fourth place in the all-time list.  Cavendish won three Tour de France stages with Team Sky
including the final-day sprint after Wiggins was among riders to
help lead him to the finish line.  With the HTC-Highroad team in 2011, Cavendish won five
stages and took the green jersey as the first British winner of
the points classification.  Seven-time champion Armstrong was stripped of his race wins
by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in August.  His former teammate Levi Leipheimer was fired by Omega
Pharma two days ago after he admitted doping earlier in his
career in an affidavit published by USADA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
