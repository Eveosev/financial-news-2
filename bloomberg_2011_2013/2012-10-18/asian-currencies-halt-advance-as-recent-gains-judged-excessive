Asian currencies halted a five-day
advance as some investors judged recent gains as excessive and
after data showed economic growth slowed for a seventh quarter
in China, the region’s biggest export market.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index ’s 14-day relative-
strength index was at 72 today, above the 70 level that
indicates to some traders that a decline is likely. The gauge
has rallied 2.2 percent in the second half. Asia’s biggest
economy expanded 7.4 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, official figures showed today, after growing 7.6
percent in the previous three months. China is the biggest buyer
of goods shipped from South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.  “Technically, some consolidation is necessary for Asian
currencies after their recent rallies,” said  Tsutomu Soma ,
manager of the investment trust and fixed-income business unit
at Rakuten Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “There remains concern
about China’s slowdown and with that, it’s hard for investors to
aggressively buy riskier assets.”  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most
active currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.03 percent to 117.81
as of 4:43 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The measure touched 117.87
yesterday, the highest level since February. The Philippine peso
fell 0.4 percent to 41.32 per dollar, India’s rupee slipped 0.2
percent to 53.975 and Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to
9,594 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rupee halted a two-day gain also before European
leaders begin a two-day summit in Brussels today to tackle their
debt crisis. Global funds cut  holdings  of Indian shares on Oct.
16 for the first time since Sept. 20, the latest regulator data
show. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government took steps last
month to cut fuel subsidies and allow more foreign investment in
some industries.  Capital Outflows  “We are seeing outflows, which is the main factor driving
the rupee,” said Vikas Babu, a trader at  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai.
“At times when global risk appetite is low, there is also
increased concern about whether the government can go through
with and implement its proposed reforms.”  The peso retreated from the strongest level in more than
four years on speculation importers stepped up dollar purchases
to take advantage a more favorable  exchange rate .  The peso opened at 41.12 per dollar, the highest level
since March 2008. It has advanced 6.1 percent this year, the
second-best performance among the 11 most-active Asian
currencies, as foreign funds bought $1.9 billion more local
equities than they sold, according to exchange data.  Yuan Strengthens  “The 41.00 to 41.20 range appears to be a support level”
for the dollar versus the peso, said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief
market strategist at Manila-based  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  “This level
is a sweet spot for importers.” A support is a level on a price
chart that analysts predict will act as a floor in a declining
market.  China’s  yuan  added 0.07 percent to 6.2503 per dollar and
touched a 19-year high of 6.2446 as the central bank set the
daily fixing at the strongest level since June 20. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  said the government is confident of achieving annual
targets as economic growth has started to stabilize, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. U.S. Republican
presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  reiterated he will label
China a currency manipulator if he wins next month.  “The yuan got support from various factors including the
political pressure from the U.S. elections and the central
bank’s reference rate,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst at
China Merchants Bank Co. in Shenzhen. “Some investors are
convinced that  China’s economy  will regain growth momentum.”  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit depreciated 0.2 percent to
3.0385 per dollar and Thailand’s baht declined 0.1 percent to
30.64. Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.269, while
South Korea’s won rose 0.1 percent to 1,104.38. Vietnam’s dong
was little changed at 20,845.  To contact the reporter on this story:
