Metka SA (METTK)  signed a $103 million
agreement to boost generating capacity at Samra Electric Power
Co.’s plant in Jordan by 146 megawatts, state-run Petra news
agency reported.  The project, to be completed by July 2013, will help Samra
Electric meet expected power demand next summer, the state-run
agency said, citing Amjad Rawashdeh, the plant’s director
general. Metka, based in Athens, won a $155 million contract to
increase the plant’s capacity by 143 megawatts, Petra reported
on Sept. 24.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. The kingdom’s power stations have had to switch to
costlier fuels such as diesel after repeated interruptions in
natural gas supplies caused by sabotage of the export pipeline
in neighboring  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
