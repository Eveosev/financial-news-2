The eldest son of Philadelphia
Eagles coach  Andy Reid  died of a heroin overdose at the team’s
preseason training camp, a  Pennsylvania  coroner said today.  Garrett Reid, 29, was found dead in a dorm room at  Lehigh
University  in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, during the National
Football League team’s August camp. He had been working as a
strength and conditioning coach for the Eagles since his release
from prison in 2009.  Andy Reid took a six-week leave from the team in 2007 after
the arrest of Garrett and another son, Britt Reid.  Northampton County Coroner Zachary Lysek said today in a
televised news conference that Garrett Reid’s body showed signs
of persistent heroin use.  “Unfortunately Garrett Reid did have a battle with drug
use,” he said.  Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said
his office was investigating the source of the heroin Reid used,
along with syringes and needles found in his gym bag.  Garrett Reid was sentenced to 23 months following a guilty
plea to charges of recklessly endangering another motorist and
driving under the influence after causing a traffic collision.
Police found him in possession of heroin and amphetamines after
the accident.  Britt Reid pleaded guilty to charges including felony
possession of a firearm without a license after he was accused
of pointing a handgun at another driver in a traffic
confrontation on the same day. Britt Reid served 22 months in
jail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
