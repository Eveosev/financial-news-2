Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, reported
third-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates after
sales tumbled in the European Union.  Net income fell 6.3 percent to $2.23 billion, or $1.32 a
share, from $2.38 billion, or $1.35, a year earlier, the New
York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit totaled $1.38 a share.
Analysts projected $1.39, the average of 15 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  European Union nations facing a debt crisis and high
unemployment saw smokers cut back or switch to contraband
cigarettes or roll-your-own varieties. Sales in the region
slipped 15 percent in the third quarter.  Total cigarette shipments slipped 1.3 percent, hurt by a
decline of 8.1 percent in the European Union. Volume rose 3
percent in Eastern Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa and 0.6
percent in Asia.  Shipments fell on “another very weak performance in Europe
not completely offset by robust growth throughout the rest of
the world including  emerging markets ,”  Christopher Growe , an
analyst with Stifel Financial Corp. He recommends buying  Philip
Morris  shares.  The company missed analysts’ profit estimates for the first
time in eight quarters, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Philip Morris revised its full-year profit forecast,
projecting $5.12 to $5.18 a share. In July, it had predicted
earnings of $5.10 to $5.20 a share. Analysts anticipate $5.20,
the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Philip Morris  fell  4.2 percent to $88 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
