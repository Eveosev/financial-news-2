European policy makers who think
Spain and Italy won’t need aid or new fiscal programs now that
their debt costs have dropped are misreading the markets,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s  Jacob Frenkel  said.  The drop in sovereign interest rates doesn’t mean the
crisis is over, and outside aid won’t work without a program to
fix underlying causes, said Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase
International, in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop.”  “The reason why yields have declined is because the market
expects them to have the program,” Frenkel said. “The issue is
not just financing, it is adjustment, and if they don’t do the
adjustment, the financing will just be throwing good money after
bad.”  Spain sold more debt than planned and yields on Spanish 10-
year bonds fell to a six-month low last week after Moody’s
Investors Service affirmed the nation’s credit rating on signs
that policy makers will seek aid. Italian bond yields also
dropped to their lowest levels since March last week, although
they have since erased that decline.  Frenkel said the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic
increase in U.S. taxes and spending cuts that will take effect
unless Congress reaches a compromise, is the biggest threat to
the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
