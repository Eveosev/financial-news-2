Latvia’s bank regulator asked the
country’s general prosecutor to investigate how confidential
details of bank transfers from Latvijas Krajbanka AS were made
public.  The details of the transfers, which took place after the
lender was seized by regulators in November last year, are
“confidential client information, the disclosure of which is
subject to criminal liability,” the regulator said in a
 statement  on its Website today. It asked the prosecutor to
investigate on Oct. 16, it said.  Latvian regulators imposed Krajbanka’s withdrawal
restriction on Nov. 17 after Lithuanian regulators placed
restrictions on the lender’s parent Bankas Snoras AB. Lithuania
and Snoras have filed criminal and civil suits in  London  against
the banks’ former owners,  Vladimir Antonov  and Raimondas
Baranauskas, for alleged fraud. Both of them deny all charges.  Details of the transfers were published this week on the
Website Pietiek.com as Janis Brazovskis, the deputy head of the
bank regulator, faced a parliamentary vote to reconfirm him for
another term. The vote, scheduled for today, was delayed to give
Brazovskis and the regulator time to explain the transfers to
the public, said Janis Reirs, chairman of the parliament’s
budget and finance committee, on Latvijas Radio  today .  The transfers, which amounted to about 55 million lati
($103.6 million), were partly the payment of client transfers
registered before the bank was taken over, the regulator said in
the statement.  -- Editors: Elizabeth Konstantinova, James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
