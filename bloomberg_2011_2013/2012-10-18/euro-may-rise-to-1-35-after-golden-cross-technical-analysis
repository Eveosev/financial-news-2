The euro may climb to more than
$1.35 before the end of this year after trading above its 200-
day average in the past month,  Miller Tabak  & Co. said, citing
trading patterns.  Europe’s 17-nation currency may form a so-called golden
cross, where the 50-day moving average goes above the 200-day
average, as soon as Oct. 24 if the euro stays above $1.30,
 Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in
New York, wrote in a client note dated yesterday. In technical
analysis, a golden cross signals a bullish trend and occurs when
a short-term moving average passes above a longer-term line.  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3088 at 3:40 p.m. London
time, snapping two days of gains that resulted in a 1.3 percent
appreciation. The 50- and 200-day moving averages were $1.2762
and $1.2831, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The euro
last reached $1.35 in December.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
