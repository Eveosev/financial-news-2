Investors spent more on office
properties in Germany through September than in any initial
nine-month period for five years, buying more than twice as much
in Berlin and Munich than the same period last year.   Office properties valued at 6.27 billion euros ($8.22
billion) were sold in the first nine months of 2012, a 50
percent increase from 2011, according to data compiled by  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA’s German real estate unit.  “Safety-oriented investors see good conditions here due to
the relatively stable economic and employment situation,” Sven
Stricker, head of investment at BNP Paribas Real Estate GmbH,
said in a statement today. “Office investments have a good
medium-term outlook, assuming the euro crisis doesn’t
escalate.”  Demand for German property has jumped this year as
investors seek a safe place to put their money amid the risk the
euro zone’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen. Germany’s
economy,  Europe ’s largest, is forecast to grow 0.8 percent this
year, according to the government. The economies of the 17
nations that share the euro are together forecast to contract
0.4 percent, according to the European Central Bank.  Office investments rose 172 percent in Berlin and 138
percent in Munich,  Germany ’s most expensive city for workplace
properties. Investments in Hamburg, Cologne and Dusseldorf
declined, Paris-based BNP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
