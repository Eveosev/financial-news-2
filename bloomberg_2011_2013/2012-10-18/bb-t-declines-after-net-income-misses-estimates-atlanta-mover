BB&T Corp. (BBT) , the ninth-largest U.S.
bank by deposits, fell the most since June after reporting
third-quarter profit that missed analystsâ€™ estimates.  BB&T declined $1.58, or 4.9 percent, to $30.69 at 9:48 a.m.
in New York.  Net income rose 28 percent to $469 million, or 66 cents a
share, from $366 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier, the
Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based bank said today in a
statement. Excluding merger costs, earnings were 70 cents a
share, compared with the 72-cent average estimate of 32 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
