Germany ’s 10-year government bonds
fell a fourth day before Spain auctions up to 4.5 billion euros
($5.9 billion) of securities and European Union leaders gather
for the start of a two-day summit in Brussels.  The decline pushed the 10-year  yield  to the highest level
in four weeks. Spanish 10-year yields fell to a more than  six-
month low  yesterday after Moody’s Investors Service said Oct. 16
it would keep the nation’s credit rating at investment grade.
France is scheduled to sell as much of 10.5 billion euros of
notes and inflation-linked bonds today, while Ireland auctions
three-month bills.  German 10-year bund yields rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.66 percent at 7:21 a.m. London time, the
highest since Sept. 19. The 1.5 percent bond due September 2022
fell 0.22, or 2.20 euros per 1,000-euro face amount to 98.57.
The two-year yield added less than one basis point to 0.11
percent.  Spain’s  10-year yield  tumbled as much as 34 basis points to
5.46 percent yesterday, the  lowest  since April 4, and was at
5.47 percent today.  The Iberian nation plans to sell bonds maturing between
2015 and 2022. It last auctioned the securities due in 2022 on
Sept. 20 at an  average yield  of 5.67 percent.  France  will auction as much as 8 billion euros of notes
maturing between two- and five years, and up to 2.5 billion
euros of inflation-linked bonds due in 2021.  German bonds returned 2.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities advanced 3.5 percent, while French debt earned 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
