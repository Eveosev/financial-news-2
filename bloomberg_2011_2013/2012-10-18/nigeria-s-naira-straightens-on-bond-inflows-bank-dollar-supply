Nigeria ’s naira appreciated as
offshore investors bought the country’s debt and the central
bank increased dollar sales at its twice-weekly auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer advanced 0.1
percent to 157.45 a dollar at 11:42 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has strengthened 3.1 percent this
year, the second-best performer in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria sold 75 billion naira ($476 million) of bonds at an
auction yesterday, with bids totalling 244 billion naira, the
Debt Management Office published on its website today. The
 Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $312 million in its two auctions
this week, the highest total in three weeks according to its
website.  The naira gained “due to sufficient dollar supply from
central bank and foreign inflows into  government securities ,”
Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts at Ecobank
Transnational Inc. in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients today.  The central bank kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at a record 12 percent on Sept. 18 to control inflation and
bolster the naira, Governor Lamido Sanusi said. The inflation
rate fell to 11.3 percent in September, from 11.7 percent in
August, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said
yesterday. The central bank’s goal is to bring the inflation
rate down to less than 10 percent.  Yields on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent debt maturing January
2022 fell 28 basis points to 13.39 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website. The yield on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 fell six basis points to 4.58 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.8865 a dollar in Accra, the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
