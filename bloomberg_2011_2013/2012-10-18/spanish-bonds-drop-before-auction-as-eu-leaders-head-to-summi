Spain’s government bonds rose for a
third day after the nation sold more than its maximum target at
a debt auction and as European Union leaders gathered in
Brussels for a two-day summit.  The country’s 10-year yields dropped to the lowest level
since April as German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told lawmakers in
Berlin that stability was taking hold after three years of
crisis in the euro area. Spanish securities have surged this
week after Moody’s Investors Service said it would keep the
country’s credit rating at investment grade.  France  auctioned
notes and inflation-linked bonds today and Ireland sold bills.  “The Spanish auction went as well as could be expected,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank
Plc in London. “Yields are a bit lower and the volumes they
managed to do on the 10-year was a positive. Some positive
comments out of the European meetings today should also offer
some support.”  Spain’s benchmark  10-year yield  fell 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 5.35 percent at 4:05 p.m.  London  time,
the  lowest level  since April 2. The 5.85 percent bond maturing
in January 2022 gained 0.875, or 8.75 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,310) face amount, to 103.575.  The government sold a combined 4.61 billion euros of
securities due in 2015, 2016 and 2022, compared with a maximum
target of 4.5 billion euros.  The Treasury auctioned 1.5 billion euros of 10-year bonds
at an average yield of 5.458 percent, down from 5.666 percent
when they were last sold on Sept. 20. Investors bid for 1.88
times the amount on offer, versus 2.85 times in September. The
2015 securities were sold at an average yield of 3.227 percent
and the 2016 notes at 3.977 percent.  EU ‘Solidarity’  Merkel, addressing German lower-house lawmakers hours
before the EU leaders meeting, proposed a European Union
“solidarity” fund to bolster competitiveness in struggling
member countries.  “To give all member states the opportunity then to improve
their competitiveness and to actually be able to implement these
commitments, I propose that we introduce a new element of
solidarity,” she said in her speech today at the Reichstag
parliament building.  French President Francois Hollande said the subject of
today’s summit was not fiscal union by banking union.  “The only decision we have to take, to confirm in fact, is
the putting into place of a banking union by the end of the
year, notably the first step, which is the banking
supervision,” he told reports in Brussels.  Moody’s Rating  Moody’s said on Oct. 16 it would leave Spain’s credit
rating at investment grade, citing a reduction in the risk of
the nation losing market access because of the European Central
Bank’s willingness to buy its bonds.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-
year bonds instead of its two-year notes shrank for the first
time in six days. The spread narrowed eight basis points to 262
basis points.  France sold 7.97 billion euros of two-, three-, four- and
five-year notes. The five-year securities attracted an average
yield of 0.92 percent, down from 0.98 percent on Sept. 20. The
nation also auctioned inflation-linked bonds maturing in 2021.  German 10-year yields were little changed at 1.62 percent
after rising 19 basis points over the previous three days.  “Bunds are taking a pause for breath after the recent
sell-off ahead of the start of the EU summit,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh.  Italian Notes  Italian notes fell for the first time in seven days, with
the two-year yield climbing seven basis points to 2.07 percent.  The Italian Treasury said it received orders of more than
10 billion euros over the past three days for the inflation-
linked bonds it is selling to retail investors, more than its
two previous offers combined. The order period ends today.  Italy’s index-linked securities have returned 23 percent
this year, headed for their best year according to indexes
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch dating back to 2003.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by Greece and  Italy , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  German bonds returned 2.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 3.5 percent, and French debt gained 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
