Equatorial Guinea will trim exports
of its Zafiro crude for December to three cargoes, one less than
November, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The West African nation will also ship three consignments
of Ceiba grade, unchanged from next month, according to a
separate schedule. All cargoes are for 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
