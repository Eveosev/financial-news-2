Iraq  issued an arrest warrant
against former  central bank  governor Sinan Al-Shabibi on charges
of corruption, the state news agency NINA said.  Shabibi is currently outside Iraq, NINA said, citing an
unidentified lawmaker.  The government two days ago named Abdul-Basit Turki as
interim governor of the Central Bank after it began an
investigation into alleged financial impropriety by Shabibi.  An Iraqi court in September sentenced Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, the top Sunni Muslim politician, to death in
absentia on terrorism charges, according to Abdel Sattar al-
Bairaqdar, spokesman for the supreme judicial council.  Hashimi, who has the right to appeal the sentencing, left
 Baghdad  late last year after an arrest warrant was issued for
him. State-sponsored Iraqiya television aired what it described
as confessions by his bodyguards saying that they committed
murder at his request in return for money. Hashimi said the
confessions were fabricated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
