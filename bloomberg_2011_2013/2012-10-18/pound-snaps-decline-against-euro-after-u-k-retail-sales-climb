The pound snapped two days of
declines against the euro after U.K. retail sales rose more than
analysts forecast in September, adding to signs that the economy
is recovering from a recession.  Sterling pared a drop versus the dollar as the sales data
followed figures yesterday showing jobless claims unexpectedly
slid last month and payrolls increased. Gilts were little
changed as the Debt Management Office sold 3.75 billion pounds
($6.05 billion) of seven-year securities.  “The data shows there might be a bit more momentum behind
the economy and people are looking for evidence that the U.K. is
coming out of recession,” said  Simon Smith , chief economist at
FXPro Group Ltd. in London. “The labor-market data yesterday
showed employment rising and that was taken as a positive for
the pound.”  The pound strengthened 0.1 percent to 81.18 pence per euro
at 4:33 p.m. London time after weakening 0.8 percent over the
previous two days. The U.K. currency was little changed at
$1.6135 after falling as much as 0.2 percent before the data.  Retail sales including fuel gained 0.6 percent from August,
when they fell 0.1 percent, the  Office for National Statistics 
said. The median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 0.4 percent gain. Jobless-benefit claims
dropped 4,000 to 1.57 million in September, the statistics
office said yesterday.  ‘Small Gains’  The pound “registered small gains on stronger retail
sales,” Elsa Lignos, a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank
of Canada in  London , wrote in a note to clients. “Our
economists point out these are volatile data.”  Britain’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year,
according to a Bloomberg survey. That compares with predictions
for 2.1 percent growth in the U.S. and a 0.5 percent contraction
in the euro area. The government will release U.K. gross
domestic product data for the third quarter on Oct. 25.  The pound will probably weaken against the dollar because
of the “structural weakness” in the U.K. economy, according to
Robert Savage, New York-based chief strategist at currency-hedge
fund FX Concepts LLC.  The currency is “toppy on a fair-value basis,” when it
approaches $1.62, he said in an interview in London yesterday.
“Fair value is probably around $1.45 and I would forecast the
pound to weaken to $1.52 by the end of next year.”  Sterling will probably stay at $1.60 through next year, a
Bloomberg survey of economists’ forecasts showed. It last traded
as low as $1.52 in July 2010.  Currency Indexes  The pound has weakened 0.9 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 2.9
percent and the dollar dropped 4.2 percent.  The Debt Management Office sold 4.5 percent gilts maturing
in March 2019 at an average yield of 1.128 percent. That
compares with a yield of 1.495 percent at the previous auction
on May 1.  The 10-year gilt yielded 1.91 percent. The price of the
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 was 98.57.  Gilts returned 1.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
2.2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
