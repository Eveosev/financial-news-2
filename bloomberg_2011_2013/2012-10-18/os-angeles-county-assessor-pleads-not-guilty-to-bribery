Los Angeles County Assessor John
Noguez pleaded not guilty to charges he took $185,000 in bribes
from a tax consultant and cut the property values of the
consultant’s clients in exchange.  Noguez, 47, entered a plea through his lawyer at an
arraignment hearing in Los Angeles County Superior Court. He’s
charged with 24 felony accounts, including accepting bribes,
perjury, conspiracy and misappropriation, and faces more than 30
years in prison if convicted, according to county prosecutors.  California Superior Court Judge Shelly Torrealba denied a
request by Noguez’s lawyer, Michael Proctor, to lower his $1.36
million bail amount at today’s hearing. She scheduled a bail
review hearing on Oct. 22.  “This is an extreme abuse of public trust,” Torrealba
said. “I’m not prepared to change bail at this time.”  Noguez, who took a leave of absence as county assessor in
June, was arrested yesterday. The tax consultant, Ramin Salari,
also pleaded not guilty through his lawyer at the hearing. Both
men are in custody.  The case is The People v. Rodriguez aka Noguez, BA403666,
Los Angeles County Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
