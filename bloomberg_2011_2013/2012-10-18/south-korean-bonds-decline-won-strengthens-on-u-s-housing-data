South Korea ’s government bonds fell
and the won advanced to an almost one-year high as U.S. housing
data improved and Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the country’s
economic situation last quarter was “relatively good.”  Housing starts jumped 15 percent last month to an 872,000
annual rate, the fastest since July 2008, Commerce Department
figures showed yesterday. China’s growth has started to
stabilize, the Xinhua News Agency said yesterday, citing Wen’s
comments to industry leaders.  Asia ’s largest economy grew 7.4
percent in last quarter, matching the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey and compared with a 7.6 percent expansion
in the previous three months, official data showed today. The
 Kospi (KOSPI)  share index rose for a third day.  “Investors are guessing  China ’s GDP may be good after the
Premier’s comments, and with data from the world economy’s two
main pillars showing improvement, we’re seeing risk-on
sentiment,” said D.J. Park, a Seoul-based fixed income analyst
at Samsung Futures Inc.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2015 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.84 percent in
Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. That’s the highest rate
since Sept. 21. The one-year interest-rate swap advanced one
basis point to 2.83 percent.  Sales at major South Korean department stores declined 0.8
percent from a year earlier in September after a 6.9 percent
drop in August, a government report showed today.  The won advanced 0.1 percent to 1,104.38 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,102.50 yesterday, the strongest level since 0ct. 31, 2011.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, slipped 23 basis points to 5.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
