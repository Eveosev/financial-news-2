British journalism gets a drubbing
in a quirky  London  theater production.  “Enquirer” is set in different parts of an empty building
near the Barbican. You’re constantly on the move, viewing skits
rooted in real life that show media people as bribing boozers.  The staging is full of surprises. One minute, you watch an
old-school editor being interviewed at his leather-topped desk;
the next, you see the doors of a standing cabinet slide open to
reveal a reporter clicking at a newspaper-wrapped typewriter.  The text is less gripping, full of banal musings and lots
of expletives. “Journalism is a sexy profession full of ugly
people,” goes one of the better lines.  “Enquirer,” which ends tomorrow, is still worth seeing
for its inventiveness and first-class cast.  Mother at the Trampery, 188-192 St John Street,
Clerkenwell, EC1V 4JY, until Oct. 21. Information: +44-20-7638
8891 or  http://www.barbican.org.uk .  If all this drama leaves you hungry, Burger & Lobster has
just opened a branch nearby on St. John Street. The choice is
simply burger or lobster and the price -- with a side salad and
fries -- is 20 pounds ($32.30). There’s no website or phone
number yet. The address is 40 St. John Street, EC1M 41Y. For
Burger & Lobster:  http://burgerandlobster.com/ .  Saturday  It’s been 35 years since  John Travolta  worked the dance
floor in his flashy white “Saturday Night Fever” disco suit.  The suit is now on display in a show of Hollywood costumes
at the Victoria & Albert Museum. There’s something for every
generation: from Judy Garland’s gingham dress in “The Wizard of
Oz” (1939), to  Audrey Hepburn ’s chic sheath in “Breakfast at
Tiffany’s” (1961) to  Johnny Depp ’s scruffy garb in the 2011
“Pirates of the Caribbean.”  The show ends Jan. 27, 2013. Information:
 http://www.vam.ac.uk/hollywoodcostume  or +44-20-7907-7073.  Rocca di Papa is a neighborhood Italian a short walk from
the V&A. It’s in a building that was once part of Christie’s and
retains the original features. Information:

guitar ace, who had a 17-year break between albums until
“Bingo!” in 2010, will be reprising his hits “The Joker,”
“Fly Like an Eagle” “Abracadabra” and “Rock’n Me.”  Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, NW1 8EH: +44-844-482-8008,

with support acts including electropop act  Shh . Alternatively,
the Cribs join the Q Awards series of concerts.  O2 Academy Islington, Parkfield, N1 OPS: +44-844-477-2000
or  http://www.toyahwillcox.com . Q Awards, The Forum, 9 Highgate
Rd, NW5 1JY: +44-844-847-2405;  http://www.hmvforum.com .  Sunday  Steve McQueen aims a pistol, drives a Jag and takes a
sulfur bath with his wife in 1963 photographs you can see at the
Atlas Gallery.  The intimate shots by Life magazine’s John Dominis date
back to a time when the racecar-loving McQueen was yet to become
the world’s most popular actor. His untimely death in 1980 at
age 50 makes the pictures that much more touching.  “Steve McQueen: King of Cool” ends Oct. 27 at the Atlas
Gallery, 49 Dorset Street, W1U 7NF. Information:
