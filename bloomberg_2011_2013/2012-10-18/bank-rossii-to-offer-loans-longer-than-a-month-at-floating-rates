Bank Rossii will start offering cash
for more than one month to lenders at variable interest rates
next year, Deputy Chairman Sergey Shvetsov said.  Russia ’s central bank is likely to use its so-called Ruonia
rate for the longer-term repurchase loans, currency swaps and
loans that use non-market assets as collateral, Shvetsov told
journalists after speaking at the State Duma in Moscow today.
The regulator will continue offering loans with a duration of 31
days or less at  fixed interest rates .  “We are adding longer loans for the banking sector without
pushing up the yield curve,” Shvetsov said. “The yield curve
should be set by the market.”  The Ruonia rate, introduced in September, 2010, is the
average rate lenders in Russia charge each other for deals
struck in unsecured ruble debt.  Offering longer-term loans at variable rates will
“greatly” increase the amount of long money in the banking
system, Shvetsov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
