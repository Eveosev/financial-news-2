UBS AG (UBS)  is offering a leveraged
exchange-traded note tied to an index of mortgage real estate
investment trusts.  The ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Mortgage REIT ETN, which
started trading yesterday under the ticker MORL, pays twice the
returns of the Market Vectors Global Mortgage REITs Index. The
gauge tracks the overall performance of publicly traded REITs
around the world that derive at least half of their revenue from
mortgage-related activity, according to a  prospectus  filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The bank charges an investor fee of 0.4 percent a year, a
redemption fee of 0.125 percent and a financing expense of 0.40
percent plus the three-month London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, according to the prospectus. The ETN is UBSâ€™s second real
estate-linked  note  this year, after the ETRACS Monthly Pay
2xLeveraged Dow Jones International Real Estate ETN on March 21.  In September, UBS redeemed 12 ETNs tied to the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the VIX.  Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS, declined to comment.  Libor is the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
