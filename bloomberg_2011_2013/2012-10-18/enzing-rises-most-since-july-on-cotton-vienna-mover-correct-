(Corrects location of analyst in fourth paragraph.)  Lenzing AG (LNZ) , an Austrian maker of
cellulose fibers, rose the most in three months in Vienna
trading after cotton futures climbed to the highest since May.  Lenzing, whose fibers are used in clothing fabrics and
compete with cotton, jumped as much as 5 percent, the biggest
gain since July 18. The stock traded up 4.5 percent at 70.58
euros as of 1:29 p.m. local time, making it the best performer
on the 45-company  Bloomberg EMEA Chemicals Index. (BEUCHEM)   The fiber maker can sell its products, made mostly from
wood, at higher prices when cotton rises. Cotton futures for
December delivery rose by the exchange limit of 3 cents to 77.86
cents a pound in  New York  yesterday after U.S. inventories fell.  Lenzing, which has slumped 21 percent in seven months, has
underperformed and is now “attractively valued,” said Stephan Trubrich, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Vienna. “On
top of that, there is the strong rise of the cotton futures in
the last few days.”  Lenzing is based in the Austrian town of the same name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
