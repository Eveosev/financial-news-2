Nicolas Pictet, a managing partner
at  Pictet & Cie ., said it would be “very difficult to still
earn money” should Swiss banks have to verify their customers
are tax-compliant through a signed declaration, HandelsZeitung
reported.  Such a system would create “endless bureaucracy,” the
 Swiss newspaper  cited Pictet as saying in an interview.  Switzerland  is developing a “white-money strategy” that
may include stricter due diligence requirements to prevent
wealth managers accepting undeclared assets, the federal
government said in February. Measures may include self-
declarations from customers and an obligation on banks to ensure
their clients are tax-compliant.  Swiss private banks may earn less if they only handle tax-
declared money from European clients, HandelsZeitung cited
Pictet as saying. “The fees are not much lower but we must
provide more in return,” he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
