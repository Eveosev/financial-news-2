Nordic power contracts are
overvalued for the next four to five months as traders
overestimate the risk of high prices in the winter period,
according to Coeli AB, a Stockholm-based hedge fund manager.  Traders anticipating lower-than-planned output from Swedish
nuclear reactors and betting on cold weather are creating an
“excessive  risk premium ,” Henrik Wennberg, a trader at the
 money manager  in charge of the Power Surge hedge fund, said by
phone from  Stockholm .  “There are lots of bullish buyers who push the market up,
betting on cold weather,” Wennberg said. “When low
temperatures actually set in, sometimes in mid-November,
sometimes in January, the  market sentiment  bucks.”  Power for November traded at 39.75 euros ($52.08) a
megawatt-hour at 2:31 p.m. on the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy
exchange in Oslo. While the contract may rise before its expiry
on Oct. 31, power prices on the day-ahead market will average 37
euros next month, Wennberg said.  The probable average day-ahead spot price for January
through March may be 36 to 37 euros, given average precipitation
and temperatures for the next four to five months, indicating
that the benchmark near-quarter contract is 4 to 5 euros
overpriced at the latest trade of 41.65 euros, Wennberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
