Nestle SA (NESN) , the largest food company,
reported nine-month sales of 5.6 billion Swiss francs ($6.07
billion) for its bottled water products.  That represents 5.8 percent organic growth and 4 percent
real internal growth in the first nine months of the year, the
Vevey, Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. It
reported water sales growth in all regions, fueled by  North
America  and the emerging markets.  In the U.S. and Canada, Nestle said it “continued to see
dynamic growth in the premium waters Perrier and S.Pellegrino as
well as in the value brand Nestle Pure Life.” Among regional
brands, “Poland Spring and Ice Mountain were highlights,” it
said.  European growth was “good in the third quarter,
particularly in France, the U.K., Poland and Hungary. Vittel,
Buxton, Perrier and S.Pellegrino were key contributors.” 
The  emerging markets  “grew double-digit” as Nestle Pure Life
and local brands such as La Vie, Erikli and Al Manhal
“performed well,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
