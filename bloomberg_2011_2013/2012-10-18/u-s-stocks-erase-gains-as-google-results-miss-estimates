U.S. stocks erased gains as Google
Inc. tumbled as it reported third-quarter results that missed
analysts’ forecasts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1 percent to
1,460.10 at 12:39 p.m. in New York, after gaining as much as 0.4
percent earlier.  Google tumbled 8.2 percent after third-quarter adjusted
earnings amounted to $9.03 a share, below analyst estimates for
$10.65.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
