French President Francois Hollande
pressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel to overcome the demands
of her re-election campaign to complete an agreement on a
European banking union.  “Merkel has her own deadline, in September 2013,”
Hollande said today as he entered a European Union summit in
Brussels, referring to  Germany ’s elections. “I can understand
this difference in calendars, but we have a common
responsibility with Germany that is to get the euro zone out of
its crisis.”  Hollande said European leaders must strike a deal on EU-
wide banking supervision by year-end, following a June
blueprint. “I will tell her that we must apply the decisions we
took together on June 29, which are good decisions,” adding
that “with Merkel we will discuss the next steps, but before
starting on new topics we must complete the banking union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
