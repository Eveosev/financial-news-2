Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average recording its longest winning streak in
two months, after U.S. housing starts jumped to a four-year high
and the yen weakened.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 44 percent of its
sales in  North America , jumped 4 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction-machinery company that relies on  China  for 14
percent of its revenue, surged 4.7 percent after China’s third-
quarter economic growth met estimates. Yaskawa Electric Corp.
soared 6.7 percent after the servomotor producer’s equity rating
was raised to buy at BNP Paribas SA.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2 percent to 8,982.86 at the 3 p.m.

a third above the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index rose
1.7 percent to 752.30, with all 33 of the gauge’s industry
groups advancing. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday
ordered his Cabinet to draw up economic stimulus measures by
November to fight persistent deflation.  “U.S. homes and car sales are rebounding from the plunge
after the Lehman shock, and recovery momentum will be
maintained,” said  Mitsushige Akino , an executive officer at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co., which oversees about 40
billion yen ($505 million). “There are rising expectations the
government will put strong pressure on the Bank of Japan for
further easing to overcome deflation.”  The Topix has gained 4.6 percent from Sept. 6, when the
 European Central Bank  initiated a global wave of stimulus, with
the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan following suit.
Shares on the equity gauge trade at 0.90 times book value,
compared with 2.25 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.54
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
advanced 0.4 percent yesterday after housing starts jumped 15

Inc. in 2008. Tomorrow is the 25th anniversary of the Black

from 14.5 million in August, the U.S. Department of Commerce
reported on Oct. 2.  The Japanese currency fell against all of its 16 major
counterparts as expectations increased the  Bank of Japan  will
boost stimulus measures at the end of the month.  Yen Weakens  The yen depreciated to as low as 79.22 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 78.64 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Japan’s currency weakened to 103.85 against
the yen from 102.94. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Honda jumped 4 percent to 2,557 yen. Canon Inc., a camera
maker that gets 80 percent of its revenue overseas, rose 3
percent to 2,619 yen.  Pressure for stimulus is rising as the Bank of Japan at its
end of the month policy meeting will release economic
projections expected to show consumer prices, excluding fresh
food, missing a 1 percent inflation goal in the next two fiscal
years, people familiar with the matter said on condition of
anonymity because the discussions are private.  “More investors in the stock and currency markets hope
that  Japan  will undertake drastic stimulus measures like the
U.S. and Europe, as the BOJ’s easing measures have so far not
been enough,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank
Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about $76 billion.  China Growth  Exporters to China gained after the nation’s Bureau of
