Australian business confidence
hovered near the lowest level in a year as falling commodity
prices and a weaker mining boom weighed on the outlook for
hiring and orders, a private survey showed.  The third-quarter confidence index increased to minus 2
from a revised minus 3 in the April-June period,  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  said in a survey released today. The gauge
of current conditions rose to 1 from minus 2, it showed.  “Business confidence improved marginally in the quarter,
but remained at downbeat levels,” Melbourne-based National
Australia said in the report. “Global uncertainties especially
on the mining outlook, the persistently high Australian dollar,
weak forward orders and the impact of fiscal consolidation are
weighing on firms’ future expectations.”  National Australia’s confidence index for the next three
months held at 5, it showed. The employment gauge held at minus
1 and the reading on forward orders stay at minus 2. The survey
of more than 900 companies was conducted Aug. 27 to Sept. 12,
National  Australia  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
