South Africa ’s state-owned oil and
gas company is in talks with  Mozambique ’s petroleum exploration
company about cooperating on projects.  “We’re in talks with  Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos 
because the upstream is with them, and we’ve got to understand
how the value chain works so we can better access some of the
resources,” Petroleum Oil & Gas Corp. of South Africa SOC Ltd.
Chief Executive Officer Nosizwe Nokwe-Macamo said in an
interview today in Maputo, the capital.  Mozambique is home along with Tanzania and Kenya to the
world’s biggest natural-gas discoveries in a decade. Petroleos
de Mocambique SA, the state-run petroleum-products distributor
known as Petromoc, and PetroSA in December signed an agreement
to cooperate in oil trading and supply in southern  Africa .
Petromoc is also involved in the talks with ENH and PetroSA,
Nokwe-Macamo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
