Tunisiaâ€™s state grains office is
seeking to buy two cargoes of durum wheat, each amounting to
25,000 metric tons, according to two traders with direct
knowledge of the tender.  The office wants the shipments for delivery next month or
in December, said the traders, who declined to be identified
because they are unauthorized to speak to the media. The
deadline for bids is tomorrow, they said. Durum is the hard
variety of wheat used to make couscous, a staple dish in western
North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
