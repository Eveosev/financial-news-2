South Africa’s  Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  suspended an investigation
into its procurement processes after a forensic report was
leaked to the main opposition party.  The department has “lost faith” in Ernst & Young LLP, the
U.K.-based company that compiled the document, after the
 Democratic Alliance  received a copy, the government said in an
e-mailed statement today. The report confirmed “substantial
evidence of irregular contracts awarded” to  Smit Amandla
Marine , a division of Amsterdam-listed  Royal Boskalis
Westminster NV (BOKA) , the department said Oct. 1.  “The department has lost faith in the work of Ernst &
Young and, as a result of these concerns, has resolved to put
the investigation on hold,” it said.  Ernst & Young is “engaging with the Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and will comment further if
appropriate,” the tax and advisory company said in reply to e-
mailed questions.  The forensic report  found evidence  of the department’s
fisheries branch awarding irregular contracts to Smit Amandla
Marine from 1995 to March this year. Evidence indicated
government was defrauded of about 1.6 billion rand ($185
million), the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
said.  Clare Gomes, a Cape Town-based spokeswoman for Smit-Amandla
Marine, was not immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
