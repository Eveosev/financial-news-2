The rand declined for the first time
in three days as metal prices and stocks fell after U.S. jobless
claims climbed more than forecast, raising doubt about the pace
of recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  South Africa’s currency retreated as much as 0.9 percent,
and traded 0.4 percent weaker at 8.6357 per dollar as of 4:06
p.m. in Johannesburg, having gained as much as 0.7 percent
earlier. The currency advanced 2.2 percent in the previous two
trading days. Yields on 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 dropped two
basis points to 6.63 percent.  Jobless claims increased by 46,000 to 388,000 in the week
ended Oct. 13 from a revised 342,000 the prior period that was
the lowest since February 2008, more than the 365,000 median
forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Copper fell as
much as 0.7 percent in  London , and South Africa’s benchmark
stock  index  dropped for the first time in four days.  “The bias of risks to the currency is still negative,”
Brice Donald, a Johannesburg-based currency strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., the nation’s biggest rand trader, said
by phone. “The commodity cycle is against us, and domestic
fundamentals are rather fragile.”  Metals and other commodities account for 45 percent of
South Africa’s exports, according to government data. The nation
has the world’s biggest reserves of platinum and chrome. The
U.S. accounts for 8 percent of South Africa’s exports.  The rand’s decline was hastened as it failed in earlier
trading to hold below 8.550 per dollar, seen as a significant
support level to further dollar declines, Donald said. Support
levels are where traders cluster orders to buy a currency or
security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
