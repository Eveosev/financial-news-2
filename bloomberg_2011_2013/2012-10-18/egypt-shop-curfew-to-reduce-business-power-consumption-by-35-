Egypt ’s decision to order shops and
cafes to close at 10 p.m. will reduce the commercial sector’s
electricity consumption by 35 percent, Aktham Abou el-Ela, a
spokesman for the Electricity Ministry, said today.  The commercial sector accounts for 8 percent of the
country’s total electricity consumption, Abou el-Ela said by
phone.  The move will increase unemployment by 3 percent to 4
percent, affect tourism and lead to losses of 25 billion
Egyptian pounds ($4.1 billion), the Federation of Chambers of
Commerce said yesterday according to Al-Ahram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
