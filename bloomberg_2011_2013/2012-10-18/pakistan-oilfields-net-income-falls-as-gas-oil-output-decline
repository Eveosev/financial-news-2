Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL) , the
nation’s third-biggest energy explorer, said profit for the
first-quarter fell 26 percent because of a decline in oil and
gas production.  Net income fell to 2.57 billion rupees ($27 million), or
10.85 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from
3.45 billion rupees, or 14.61 rupees a share, a year earlier,
the Rawalpindi-based company said in a filing today. Sales fell
9 percent to 7.15 billion rupees.  Oil production declined 7.5 percent to 4,451 barrels a day,
compared with the same period last year, said Shahid Ali, a
research analyst with MM Group of Companies in Karachi. Gas
output also fell 9.2 percent to 83 mmcfd from a year before.  “There has been an abnormal decline in at least four
fields the company operates,” Ali said. “The fields, which are
located in the country’s north, contribute 25 percent to the
company’s total production, down from 35 percent in 2010. The
company has not been aggressive in initiating exploration
activity on their new fields either.”  Pakistan Oilfields fell as much as 1.5 percent to 404.75
rupees, the lowest since Aug. 10, at 9:39 a.m. local time in
Karachi  trading . The shares have advanced 18 percent this year,
compared with a 41 percent gain in the benchmark KSE100 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
