accelerated in September.  Metal for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.5
percent to $8,260 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
traded at $8,232 at 12:05 p.m. Beijing time. Zinc, lead and
aluminum rose 0.4 percent.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold and silver are poised to drop for the first time in
three days as gains in dollar before European Union leaders hold
a summit on the region’s debt crisis reduce demand for bullion
as a store of value.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,748.65 an ounce at 2:04
p.m. in Singapore, after advancing 0.7 percent in the past two

wheat rose.  Soybeans for November delivery advanced as much as 1
percent to $15.2425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
before trading at $15.22 at 3:25 p.m. Singapore time. The price

1956 curbed production.  Corn for delivery in December climbed 0.5 percent to $7.49
a bushel, while wheat futures for the same month rose 0.5
percent to $8.6075 a bushel. Corn reached a record $8.49 in

signs of a rebound in China’s economy last month, increasing

strengthen.  Rubber for March delivery gained 1.8 percent to end at

Commodity Exchange, taking gains over the past three days to 2.8
percent. Rubber for delivery in January rose 1.2 percent to
25,610  yuan  ($4,094) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Palm oil advanced for a second day after China, the world’s

industrial production and retail sales accelerated in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
