European coal for next year declined
for the first time in three days on lower  oil prices  as more
Americans than forecast filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  last week.  Thermal coal for 2013 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp dropped 0.5 percent to $95.05 a metric ton as of 5 p.m.
in London, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Brent
oil for December settlement fell 90 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$112.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
