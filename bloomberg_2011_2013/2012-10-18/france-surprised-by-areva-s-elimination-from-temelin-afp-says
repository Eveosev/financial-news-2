The French government was
“surprised” by  Areva SA (AREVA) ’s elimination by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  from its
tender to build two nuclear reactors at the Temelin power
station in the  Czech Republic , AFP reported late yesterday,
citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Vincent Floreani.  The French authorities hope that Areva will be allowed to
clear up “misunderstandings” regarding its tender offer in the
course of its appeal, AFP said. The world’s largest supplier of
nuclear fuel and services was excluded from the bidding process
on Oct. 5 after CEZ said it failed to meet legislative and
commercial requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
