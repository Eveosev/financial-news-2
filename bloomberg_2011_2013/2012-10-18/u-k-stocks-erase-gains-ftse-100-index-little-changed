U.K. stocks erased gains, leaving
the benchmark FTSE 100 Index little changed at 5,908.09 at 8:27
a.m. in  London . The gauge earlier rose as much as 0.2 percent.  The FTSE 100 yesterday climbed to a one-month high after an
unexpected drop in the countryâ€™s unemployment and a surge in
U.S. new-house construction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
