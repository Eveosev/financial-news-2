Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL) ,
 Russia ’s largest miner of the metal, increased sales 16 percent
in the first nine months of the year as output and prices rose.  Revenue climbed to about $1.97 billion from $1.7 billion a
year earlier, London-listed Polyus said today in a statement.
Gold production advanced 9 percent to 1.2 million ounces.  Gold companies have boosted output to benefit from prices
that have gained more than 10 percent since the start of 2012,
approaching $1,800 an ounce this month. Polyus rival Polymetal
International Plc increased its annual output target yesterday
after quarterly volumes rose, and said dividends would expand.  Polyus reiterated its full-year production target of 1.6
million ounces even after third-quarter sales fell 3 percent on
lower volumes from the Olimpiada mine. A “strong” performance
at Blagodatnoye helped counter the decline, VTB Capital said.  Polyus has net cash of $632 million, 19 percent more than
at the end of the first half, according to the statement. The
 stock  rose 1.1 percent, the most in a week, to close at 214.75
pence in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
