Chelsea captain  John Terry  won’t
appeal against a four-match ban and 220,000-pound ($355,000)
fine for racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in a game
last October, he said in a statement.  The penalty was imposed by an independent panel appointed
by the Football Association.  ``I want to take this opportunity to apologize to everyone 
for the language I used,'' Terry said. ``Although I'm disappointed
with the F.A. judgment, I accept that the language I used,
regardless of the context, is not acceptable on the football field
or indeed in any walk of life."  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
