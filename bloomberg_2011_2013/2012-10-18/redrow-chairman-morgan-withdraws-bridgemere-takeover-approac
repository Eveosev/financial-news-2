Redrow Plc (RDW)  fell the most in almost
two months in  London  trading after Chairman  Steve Morgan 
abandoned takeover talks with the U.K. homebuilder that he
founded 38 years ago.  Redrow was down 3.8 percent at 156.4 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close of trading, the biggest decline since June 25. The shares
closed yesterday at the highest since October 2009. Today’s
volume was 10 times the three-month daily average.  Bridgemere Securities Ltd., led by Morgan, along with
Toscafund Asset Management LLP and Penta Capital LLP, yesterday
said they had terminated a takeover approach announced Aug. 31.
The group had said it may offer 152 pence a share for Redrow.  The companies said they reserve the right to make or
participate in an offer for Redrow within the next six months.
Morgan, 59, bought 15.4 percent of Redrow stock in May, lifting
the stake he controls to about 40 percent.  Morgan left Redrow in 2000 and returned as chairman a
decade later after becoming dismayed that its homes appealed to
lower-income buyers. In a 2010 interview, Morgan said the
company he founded in 1974 was “in my blood.”  Redrow has had the fifth-biggest gain of seven homebuilders
in the Bloomberg  EMEA Home Builders Index (BEUHBLD)  this year, which has
risen 56.8 percent. The homebuilder on Sept. 19 said full-year
profit more than doubled, beating analysts’ estimates, as it
sold more expensive homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
