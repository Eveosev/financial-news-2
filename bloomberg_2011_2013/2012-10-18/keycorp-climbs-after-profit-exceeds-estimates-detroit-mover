KeyCorp (KEY) ,  Ohio ’s second-largest bank,

profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  KeyCorp rose 5.2 percent to $8.85 at 9:31 a.m. in New York.
Operating net income fell 6.6 percent to $214 million, or 23
cents a share, from $229 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier,
the Cleveland, Ohio-based bank said today in a statement. That
exceeded the  average estimate  of 21 cents a share from analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 8.1 percent to $1.12 billion
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
