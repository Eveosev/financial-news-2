U.S. stock futures extended losses
as more Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week.  S&P 500 futures expiring in December fell 0.2 percent to
1,453.7 at 8:33 a.m. in New York. The equity gauge has rallied
16 percent so far this year as economic data topped estimates
companies posted better-than-expected earnings and the  Federal
Reserve  announced a third round of bond purchases.  Jobless claims increased by 46,000 to 388,000 in the week
ended Oct. 13 from a revised 342,000 the prior period that was
the lowest since February 2008, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The median forecast of 49 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a rise in claims to 365,000.  The typical pattern of large increases in unadjusted claims
at the start of the quarter seems to have shifted by a week in
one state, causing the adjusted data to become volatile, a Labor
Department spokesman said as the figures were released to the
press.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
