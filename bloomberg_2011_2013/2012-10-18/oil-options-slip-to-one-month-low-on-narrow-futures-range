Crude oil options volatility dropped
to the lowest in a month as the underlying futures were little
changed for a fifth day.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 27.79 percent at 4:20 p.m. in  New York , down
from 29.61 yesterday. It was the lowest for options nearest to
expiration since Sept. 7.  Crude oil for December delivery dropped 2 cents to settle
at $92.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange jobless
claims increased more than forecast. It was the fifth
consecutive day that futures moved less than 25 cents.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $80 puts, which dropped 7 cents to 18 cents a barrel at
5:04 p.m. with 3,725 lots trading. December $75 puts were the
second-most active, with 3,150 lots exchanged as they declined 3
cents a barrel to 5 cents.  Bearish bets accounted for 60 percent of the 35,246
contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would fall made
up 54 percent of the 117,083 contracts traded.  December $85 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 8,977 lots changing hands. They fell 12 cents to
74 cents a barrel. December $90 puts declined 18 cents to $1.94
on volume of 8,452.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,854 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 52,044 lots
