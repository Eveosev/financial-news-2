Clicks Group Ltd. (CLS) ’s full-year
earnings rose 9.6 percent as the South African cosmetics and
music retailer used price promotions to win customers unwilling
to spend money.  Earnings per share in the year through Aug. 31 increased to
2.72 rand from 2.48 rand a year earlier, in line with the
average estimate of  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales jumped
9.5 percent to 16.2 billion rand ($1.88 billion) with middle-
income consumers remaining under financial pressure, the Cape
Town-based company said today in a statement.  “The health and beauty markets have been reliant on
promotional activity to sustain sales volumes and attract value-
conscious consumers,” David Kneale, chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  South African retail sales in August increased 6.4 percent
on a yearly basis, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said
yesterday, accelerating from a revised 2.9 percent growth in
July. The country’s central bank cut  interest rates  by 0.5
percentage point to 5 percent on July 19 to stimulate the
economy as the debt crisis in Europe damped exports.  Consumer
confidence  was near a four-year low in the quarter.  Clicks  fell  as much as 1.5 percent to 57.15 rand and was
trading down 0.6 percent at 9:33 a.m. in Johannesburg. That
pared the stock’s gain this year to 28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
