Copper fell for the fourth time in
five sessions as European-debt concerns and a bigger-than-
expected rise in U.S. unemployment claims dim demand prospects.  French President  Francois Hollande  said efforts to stem the
European Union’s fiscal crisis may unravel if  member states  fail
to deliver on promises. The region’s leaders gathered for a two-
day summit that starts today. U.S. jobless claims increased to
388,000 last week, exceeding the 365,000 estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists, a Labor Department report showed today.
Copper rose last month by the most since January on bets that
central-bank stimulus measures would boost demand.  “We’re seeing selling after the recent rally as people
focus on  Europe ,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at
Vision Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “The jobless claims are also certainly a negative.
The market is in a sort of wait-and-see mode on economic data,
but nothing has been strong enough to really drive it one way or
the other.”  Copper futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$3.743 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  Europe accounts for 18 percent of global copper usage,
Barclays Plc estimates.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months was unchanged at $8,220 a metric ton ($3.73 a pound).  Zinc was also unchanged in London, while aluminum, nickel
and tin rose. Lead fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
