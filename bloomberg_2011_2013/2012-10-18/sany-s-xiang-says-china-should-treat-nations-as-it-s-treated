Sany Group Co. board member Xiang
Wenbo said China should treat other nations as it is treated in
trade and investment.  Xiang made the comments at a press briefing today in
Beijing, held after U.S. President Barack Obama blocked a Sany
affiliate from proceeding with a planned Oregan wind-farm
project because of national security concerns. Wind-farm owner
Ralls Corp., controlled by Sany, is suing Obama in a bid to
reverse the ban.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
