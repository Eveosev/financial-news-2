OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
company, climbed to the highest level in seven months on bets
the company will acquire BP Plc’s local venture to match Exxon
Mobil Corp.’s output.  Rosneft led gains on the Micex Index, adding 2.9 percent to
219.47 rubles, the highest since March 16. OAO TNK-BP Holding,
the traded unit of BP’s Russian venture, fell 3.5 percent.  Rosneft submitted a bid today to buy BP’s 50 percent of
TNK-BP for a mix of cash and shares that values the whole
venture at $50 billion to $56 billion, a person with knowledge
of the matter said. Rosneft has the fourth-biggest weighting in
the Micex at 6.9 percent. Rosneft already has a preliminary
accord with BP’s billionaire partners in TNK-BP, another person
said. Absorbing the company would raise oil and gas production
to about 4.5 million barrels a day.  “Rosneft is boosting its presence on the market, trying to
consolidate its stake in the sector,” Sergey Vakhrameev, an
analyst at IFC Metropol in Moscow, said by phone.  TNK-BP dropped the most since June 1 when BP said that it
would pursue a sale of its stake in Russia’s third-largest oil
producer, unwinding a nine-year investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
