Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) ’s Indian cement
subsidiaries said they have made no provisions for a total $422
million of anti-competition fines levied by their market
regulator as they are counting on a successful appeal.  ACC Ltd. (ACC)  and  Ambuja Cements Ltd. (ACEM)  have filed appeals and
according to their lawyers have “good grounds” to believe the
appeals will be successful, the divisions said in separate notes
to their third-quarter earnings statements today.  The cement-makers were fined about 194 million francs ($210
million) and 196 million francs respectively by India’s
competition commission for price fixing in June. The commission
asked for the fines to be paid  within 90 days .  Holcim’s Indian units made up about 20 percent of Holcim’s
4 billion francs in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization last year and sold 45 million
metric tons of cement, according to a Holcim  presentation .  It may take between two and four years for a final appeal
hearing, an official at the Builder’s Association of  India ,
which is opposing Holcim in the case, said July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
