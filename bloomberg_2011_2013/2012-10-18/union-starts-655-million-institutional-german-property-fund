Union Investment GmbH ,  Germany â€™s
second-largest property fund manager, started a 500 million-euro
($655 million) fund to buy offices, shops and hotels.  The UniInstitutional German Real Estate, aimed at
institutional investors, will acquire properties valued at about
20 million euros to 50 million euros, the company said today in
a statement.  German property has been one of the biggest beneficiaries
of the  European debt crisis  as investors seek a safe place to
put their money. Investors poured about 2.6 billion euros into
open-ended German real-estate funds in the first eight months of
this year, more than three times as much as in the same period a
year ago, according to  data  compiled by the German Funds
Association BVI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
