Trades in about half a dozen
Australian equities including  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and  AMP Ltd. (AMP)  surged at the open in the absence of
company news, prompting inquiries by the market regulator.  ANZ, which closed yesterday at A$25.96, opened 6.4 percent
higher when 836,205 shares changed hands in 349 trades, all at
the ask price of A$27.63, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The stock fell back to A$26.13 within a minute.
Insurer AMP  jumped  4.5 percent.  The incident comes 2 1/2 months after  Knight Capital Group
Inc. (KCG) , one of the biggest market makers in U.S. stocks, bombarded
American exchanges with mistaken orders in the first minutes of
trading on Aug. 1. The company blamed the mishap on defective
software. Two weeks ago, orders for Indian stocks improperly
entered by a Mumbai brokerage sent the S&P CNF Nifty Index down
16 percent over eight seconds before it rebounded.  “It’s unlikely that someone was consciously manipulating
prices but it could easily be that something’s gone wrong,”
said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management
in Sydney who manages more than $350 million. “There’s a
greater chance of something like that happening today because it
was an options expiry day. It was very unusual and we’d also
like to know why it happened.”  The Australian Securities and Investment Commission has
commenced informal inquiries into the incident, Andre Khoury, a
Sydney-based spokesman for ASIC said in a statement.  ASX Ltd. (ASX) ,
operator of the country’s main bourse, referred questions to
ASIC, according to Sydney-based spokesman Matthew Gibbs.  First Phase  Equity derivative contracts on indexes expire today,
according to the  ASX website . The stocks that moved unusually
today are those attached to companies whose tickers begin with
the letters A and B. Australia’s market opens in phases
according to the alphabetical order of tickers,  ASX  said.  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) , which closed yesterday at A$14.84, opened
4.3 percent higher when 177,416 shares changed hands in 107
trades at the price of A$15.84. It has  traded  at an average
price of $14.95 since five minutes after the open.  AMP Ltd. opened 4.5 percent higher when 1.1 million shares
were exchanged in 157 trades at A$4.85. The stock has since
traded at an average price of A$4.70, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Brambles Jumps  Brambles Ltd. (BXB) , a supplier of shipping pallets, jumped 7.5
percent to A$7.69 straight after the open before falling to
A$7.38 within the first minute of trade. It was at A$7.305 at
1:45 p.m. in Sydney. The first trades of the day were crossed
from two off-exchange transactions for a total of 50,000 shares
at A$7.65, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “ASIC is aware of a surge in the share price of a number
of major ASX 200 stocks this morning and, in line with its
normal practice, is looking into the matter and has commenced
enquires with the market participants involved in trading in
these stocks and related derivatives,” Khoury said. “This is
not a formal investigation.”  Regulators around the world are scrutinizing market
structure and electronic trading after a series of malfunctions.
In May 2010, a broker’s algorithm set in motion events now known
as the flash crash, which briefly wiped $862 billion from U.S.
stocks. The Nasdaq Stock Market in May this year was overwhelmed
by order cancellations and trade confirmations were delayed on
the first day of trading in Facebook Inc., the largest initial
public  offering of 2012.  Financial Hub  Australia  is trying to increase its presence as a financial
hub by opening up the equity market, allowing Chi-X Australia
Pty from last year to compete as an alternative stock venue.  ASX in November last year began using a platform catering
to high-frequency traders called PureMatch, part of efforts to
counter competition from Chi-X. It described the platform as a
“high-speed, low latency order book” for the most liquid
shares and  exchange traded funds .  Australian regulators are considering requiring all trading
algorithms to have an inbuilt “kill switch” to immediately
disable them if they malfunction, ASIC Chairman Greg Medcraft
told a conference in Sydney Oct. 10.  “There’s certainly been some strange moves,” said  Chris Weston , a Melbourne-based trader at IG Markets Ltd. “We don’t
yet know much about what the issue was.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
