Jyske Bank A/S (JYSK)  jumped the most in
almost nine months in Copenhagen trading after Denmark’s second-
largest listed bank posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Jyske Bank rose as much as 8.1 kroner, or 4.7 percent, to
180 kroner, its  steepest intraday increase  since Jan. 23, and
traded 3.1 percent higher at 177.2 kroner as of 9:42 a.m. local
time.  The lender’s second-quarter net income jumped more than
fivefold to 468 million kroner ($82.1 million) from 81 million
kroner a year earlier, after loan impairments dropped 37 percent
to 235 million kroner. The bank’s profit beat the 259 million-
krone average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Danish lenders were hurt by soaring loan losses when the
country’s property market collapsed more than four years ago.
About a dozen lenders have failed since 2008, and more face
insolvency as  Denmark  teeters on the brink of its second
recession in less than a year, the financial regulator has
warned.  Still, Jyske Bank Chief Executive Officer Anders Dam is
ready to spend 18 billion kroner to buy Danish rivals. In an
interview on Oct. 9, he predicted the Nordic nation’s financial
industry will lose half of its banks by 2020.  Jyske Bank today said that it still forecasts full-year
loan impairment charges and guarantee provisions to be between
1.6 billion kroner and 2 billion kroner. Third-quarter charges
and provisions of 235 million kroner compared with 925 million
kroner in the three months through June, when Jyske implemented
more stringent guidelines for loan-impairment charges and
provisions for guarantees from the Danish financial regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
