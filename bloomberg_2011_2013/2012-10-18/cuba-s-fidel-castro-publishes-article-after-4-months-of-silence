Cuba’s former President  Fidel Castro 
published a column in the state-run Granma newspaper today, his
first public statement in four months.  The  letter , signed by Castro yesterday, congratulated a
Cuban medical clinic for 50 years of service. Since handing over
power to his brother Raul in 2006, Castro has mostly remained
out of public view and was last seen meeting Pope Benedict XVI,
who visited the communist island in March.  Instead of speeches, Castro writes columns in state-run
media known as “Reflections,” which have grown more infrequent
over the past year.  His last letter was published on June 19. Castro has not
publicly congratulated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on his
re-election victory, sparking renewed speculation that his
health is failing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
