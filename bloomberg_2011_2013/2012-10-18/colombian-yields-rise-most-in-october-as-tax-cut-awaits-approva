Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose the
most since May, extending their increase from a record low, as
legislation that would reduce taxes foreigners pay on fixed-
income investments awaited approval by Congress.  The yield on the 10 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
July 2024 climbed six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
6.14 percent, according to the central bank. That is the biggest
increase on a closing basis since May 23. It fell on Oct. 12 to
6.03 percent, the lowest level since the debt was first sold in
2009. The price dropped 0.613 centavo to 131.675 centavos per
peso today.  “Euphoria on the tax bill led to accelerated gains” in
peso bonds, said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de
Bogota SA, the country’s second-biggest bank. “Investors have
reduced demand for TES as it’s hard to see how much more room
for gains there are and obviously we have to wait and see what
is finally passed in Congress.”  Legislation submitted this month would reduce taxes
foreigners pay for profits on fixed-income investments to 12.5
percent from 33 percent. The bill includes government peso bonds
sold in the local market and corporate debt. Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  has said he hopes the legislation will be
approved by year-end.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,796.41 per  U.S. dollar ,
extending its rally this year to 7.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
