Egypt â€™s Ministry of Housing,
Utilities and Urban Development is considering changes that will
ensure the poor have better access to social housing and will
seek to combat corruption in the industry, state-run Al-Ahram
newspaper reported today.  The plan includes amending six laws, as well as introducing
a new social housing bill, al-Ahram said, citing Housing and
Urban Communities Minister Tareq Wafiq. A new fund for social
housing will be established, Wafiq added, without providing
further details.  The ministry will also introduce a unified construction law
that governs the sale of land, to eliminate legal challenges and
corruption in the real estate industry, and cut down the number
of regulations and entities involved in the construction
process, Ahram cited Wafiq as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
