Soybeans rose the most in five weeks
on signs that demand is increasing for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest grower and exporter. Corn also gained.  Soybean  exports  from the start of the marketing year on
Sept. 1 through Oct. 11 totaled 4.7 million metric tons, up 57
percent from the same period a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Exporters sold 523,382 tons in the week
through Oct. 11, up 4.5 percent from the prior seven days,
according to the USDA.  “Our export business is looking good,” Mark Schultz, the
chief market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co., said
by telephone. “There’s still a lot of business being done.”  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 2.4 percent
to settle at $15.455 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Sept. 12. Futures have surged 18
percent since mid-June as the worst U.S. drought since 1956
curbed production.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 2 percent to
$7.6075 a bushel in  Chicago . The price is up 50 percent since
June 15 because of dry weather in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
