Bulgaria will sell the state’s 33
percent stakes in two local units of  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech
power producer, on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange starting on Oct.
29.  The sale will be for 1,650 shares in the grid operating
unit CEZ Electro Bulgaria and 63,624 shares in the power
distribution unit CEZ Razpredelenie Bulgaria, the asset-selling
agency in the capital Sofia said in an e-mailed statement today.
The sale will be managed by the Sofia-based  Central Cooperative
Bank AD. (4CF)   The government expects to raise at least 100 million lev
($67 million) from the sale, Privatization Agency Executive
Director Emil Karanikolov said in an interview on Oct. 3.  The government sold its minority stakes in most of the
seven power distributors in 2005 to  Germany ’s  E.ON AG (EOAN) , CEZ AS
and  EVN AG (EVN)  in the run-up to joining the European Union. Bulgaria
sold the minority stakes in the two units controlled by EVN for
about 93 million lev nine months ago and got about 70 million
lev from selling the minority stakes in the two companies ran by
Czech utility Energo-Pro two weeks ago.  E.ON sold its Bulgarian companies to Energo-Pro last year.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from international lenders. The government is working
to cut the budget gap to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product
this year from 2.1 percent last year to help contain the impact
from the euro-area crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
