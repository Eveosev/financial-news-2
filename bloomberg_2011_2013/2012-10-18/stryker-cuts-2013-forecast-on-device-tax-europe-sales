Stryker Corp. (SYK)  cut its earnings
forecast for 2013, saying the medical device excise tax starting
in January and poor performance in Europe will crimp the
company’s growth.  Net income for the third quarter rose to $353 million, or
92 cents a share, from $327 million, or 84 cents, a year
earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement. Earnings
excluding one-time items were 97 cents, one penny below
estimates, while sales of $2.05 billion fell shy of forecasts
from 28 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The medical device excise tax will claim $100 million
annually, said Chief Executive Officer Kevin A. Lobo, who took
the helm of the company on Oct. 1. While Stryker had said it
would absorb those costs and still grow at least 10 percent,
that goal is no longer possible, Lobo said in a conference call.
The company now targets 2013 earnings excluding certain items of
$4.25 to $4.40, an increase of 5 percent to 8 percent from 2012.  “We are taking a more conservative stance that reflects
the current uncertainties and mitigates the risk of a shortfall
relative to expectations,” Lobo said.  Stryker  declined  less than 1 percent to $52.56 at 10:19
a.m. in  New York . The shares had gained 6.3 percent this year
through yesterday.  Stryker also reduced its  forecast  for 2012 to $4.04 to
$4.07 a share, from $4.09, largely because of sales shortfalls
in southern Europe and  Germany  and lagging capital equipment
sales, Lobo said.  Sales Expectations  “In the month of September, we did not see the expected
acceleration in growth in sales outside the U.S., as well as
with our capital businesses, resulting in a misalignment between
our top line and spending,” he said. “We are assuming this is
the new normal. That’s the reason for the adjustment for the
guidance in 2012 and 2013.”  Rectifying the situation in  Europe , which is evenly split
between company-specific issues and the greater economy, is
Stryker’s top priority, Lobo said.  “We’re going to be taking more aggressive action,” he
said, declining to be more specific. “The challenges have more
to do with basics, management and leadership, staying close to
the customer and not getting distracted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
