Danaher Corp. (DHR)  fell the most in
almost a year after cutting its profit forecast for a second
time amid lower demand for automation and testing equipment.  The shares slid 4.7 percent to $53.45 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since Oct. 31. They previously gained
19 percent this year, outpacing a 16 percent increase by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company, based in  Washington , reduced its 2012 earnings
per share target to $3.14 to $3.19 from a July projection of
$3.19 to $3.26.  “Clearly the macroeconomic headlines are having an impact
on our growth,” Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said on a
conference call today with analysts. “The operating environment
is likely to remain challenging going forward.”  Culp said today he increased a cost-restructuring goal to
$120 million from $100 million to resist pressure from the
slower economy. Danaher has announced acquisitions of about $1.5
billion since the beginning of the year to supplement sales.  Third-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent to $548.7 million, or
77 cents a share, from $523.4 million, or 74 cents, a year
earlier, according to a company statement. That trailed the
average estimate of 79 cents from analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
