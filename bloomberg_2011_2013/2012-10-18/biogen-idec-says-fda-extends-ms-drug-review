Biogen Idec  Inc., the third-largest
U.S. biotechnology company, said the Food and Drug
Administration extended the review of its experimental multiple
sclerosis medicine by three months.  The FDA didn’t request more studies of the drug BG-12, the
Weston, Massachusetts-based company said in a statement today.
The three-month extension is a standard period, Biogen said.  The drug is meant to treat relapsing-remitting MS, the most
common form of the illness. The disease affects more than 2.1
million people worldwide and about 400,000 Americans, according
to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Patients with RRMS
get attacks that degrade their neurological function, followed
by periods of recovery.  Biogen  declined  2.7 percent to $149.56 at the close of  New
York  trading.  Current therapies include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd.’s Copaxone and Biogen’s drugs Avonex and Tysabri. Biogen,
drew $2.7 billion in sales of Avonex last year and $1.1 billion
for Tysabri. Other treatments include  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Gilenya, the
first pill approved for the disease;  Sanofi (SAN) ’s Aubagio, another
pill that was approved in September; Bayer AG’s Betaseron and
 Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s Rebif. More treatments are in development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
