Dell Inc. (DELL)  is releasing a product
combining hardware and software as newly hired President Marius Haas targets businesses to try and halt a sales slump by
expanding demand for the company’s data center gear.  Dell will deliver a computer system that integrates server,
storage and networking in the same box, Haas said at an event in
San Francisco. With that approach, Dell will be able to knit
together technology from its acquisitions, Haas said.  The executive, who joined Dell in August from private-
equity firm KKR & Co. and spent a decade at  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
oversees development and marketing of Dell’s data center
servers, storage, and networking gear. The company is relying on
that division to help compensate for the growth slowdown for
personal computers.  “Investors are underestimating Dell’s enterprise
potential,” Haas said at a press conference.  Global PC shipments shrank by 8.3 percent to 87.5 million
in the third quarter, according to market researcher Gartner
Inc., signaling a shift by consumers and businesses toward
smartphones and tablets, and away from the products that were
once Dell’s bread and butter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
