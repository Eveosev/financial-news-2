Homebuilding stocks are poised to
break out of a monthlong holding pattern and extend the year’s
biggest gains among U.S. shares, according to  Justin Walters , a
co-founder and managing partner at Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a  Standard & Poor’s  index of
11 builders has gained 86 percent, more than five times as much
as the  S&P 500 . Yesterday, the industry gauge rose above this
year’s intraday peak of 455.94, reached Sept. 21, before ending
the day at 448.16.  The retreat left the index near the top of its 35-point
closing range during the past five weeks. Any close this month
that exceeds the September high will trigger further gains for
the builders, Walters said yesterday in an interview.  “They’ve got all the momentum behind them right now,” the
Harrison, New York-based analyst said. “People are willing to
ride them higher,” especially as the housing industry shows
signs of recovering, he said.  S&P’s builder index added 3.2 percent yesterday after the
government said housing starts climbed 15 percent and building
permits rose 12 percent in September. Both increases surpassed
the average estimates of economists in a Bloomberg survey and
resulted in the highest annual rates since July 2008.  “Sentiment was so depressed on the industry for so long”
that the stocks have plenty of room for further gains, Walters
said. Yesterday’s close for the industry gauge was 58 percent
below its record, set in July 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
