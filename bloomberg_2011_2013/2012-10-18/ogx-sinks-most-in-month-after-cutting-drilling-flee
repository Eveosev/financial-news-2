OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell the
most in more than a month after saying its reducing its
exploratory drilling fleet.  OGX fell 5.9 percent to 5.2 reais in Sao Paulo, the biggest
drop since Sept. 14. It was the second-biggest decline on the
benchmark Bovespa index.  The company returned the Ocean Ambassador drilling rig to
 Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO)  as it focuses on developing
fields where it struck oil in the past two years, it said in an
e-mailed response to questions today. The Rio de Janeiro-based
company plans to start producing from a third well at the
Tubarao Azul field in  Brazil ’s southeastern Campos Basin in the
fourth quarter of this year.  The reduction of the drilling fleet came earlier than
investors were expecting and contributed to the share’s price
drop, Erick Scott Hood, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
SLW Corretora, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  OGX will reduce capital expenditures to about $1.2 billion
in 2013 from $2 billion this year as it cuts spending on
equipment rentals, Chief Financial Officer Roberto Monteiro said
in a Aug. 15 conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
