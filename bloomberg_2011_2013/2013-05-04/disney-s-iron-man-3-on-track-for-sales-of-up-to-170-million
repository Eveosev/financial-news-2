“Iron Man 3,” the superhero movie
from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Marvel division, may earn as much as $170
million in its opening weekend, placing it among the best debuts
ever, box-office tracker  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said.  That would be the second-best premiere since “The
Avengers,” also from Marvel, opened with $207.4 million a year
ago. The current No. 2 is  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s “Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,” which had sales of $169.2
million in 2011.  A big debut for “Iron Man 3” would start Hollywood’s
summer on a positive note as domestic ticket sales year to date
lag the year-ago period by 12 percent. With potential
blockbusters including “Star Trek” and “Man of Steel” lined
up, the momentum could carry through to September, allowing
studios and theaters to approach 2012’s record $10.8 billion box
office.  Yesterday’s showings in 4,253 theaters generated $68.3
million in receipts, the ninth-biggest single-day gross ever,
Hollywood.com said. The top single-day take was the $90.1
million earned by Warner Bros. “Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows - Part 2.”  “Iron Man 3” has already opened internationally and
generated big numbers which, in turn, has prompted U.S.-based
analysts to raise their estimates for its run in the U.S. and
 Canada . The movie has generated $361 million in global ticket
sales, including $15.6 million from late-night screenings at
U.S. theaters May 2, Disney said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  “Iron Man” had $38.7 million on its first day in 2008,
and $98.6 million in its opening weekend. “Iron Man 2” earned
$51.2 million in its first day in 2010, and $128.1 million for
its debut weekend, Hollywood.com said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
