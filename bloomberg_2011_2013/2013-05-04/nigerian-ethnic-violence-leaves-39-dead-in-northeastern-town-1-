Violence between Muslims and
Christians in the northeastern Nigerian town of Wukari in Taraba
state left 39 people dead, according to the police.  More than 30 people were injured and more than 30 homes
were burned yesterday in clashes between Hausa Muslims and Jukun
Christians, Joseph Kwaji, a police spokesman, said today by
phone from the Taraba state capital, Jalingo. The military and
police were deployed to quell the unrest, he said.  “Right now in front of my house I can see three bodies of
people shot probably by the soldiers,” Ali Shehu, a resident,
said by phone yesterday.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
nation of more than 160 million people, is almost evenly split
between a largely Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south.  A 24-hour curfew was imposed on the town following the
violence, Kefas Sule, a spokesman for the Taraba state
government, said by phone from Jaling  Nigeria has faced increased sectarian turmoil in the north.
The government has been battling Islamist militant group Boko
Haram, which wants Islamic rule over the West African nation and
has been blamed by authorities for a surge in bomb and gun
attacks across the north and Abuja, the capital, since 2009. The
attacks have killed hundreds of people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
