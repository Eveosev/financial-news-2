Longshot Princess of Sylmar won the $1
million Kentucky Oaks to give trainer  Todd Pletcher  a chance to
sweep the top race for 3-year-old fillies and the  Kentucky Derby 
at  Churchill Downs. (CHDN)   Pletcher, who has five horses entered in today’s Derby,
would be the first trainer to win the double since Ben Jones had
Real Delight in the Oaks and Hill Gail in the Derby in 1952.  “When we were looking at our fillies’ chances, I told some
people, ‘If they go fast early and this filly settles, I give
her an outside chance,’” said Pletcher, who had four fillies in
yesterday’s Oaks.  Princess of Sylmar, going off at 38-1 with jockey  Mike
Smith  aboard, ran 1 1/8 miles in one minute, 49.17 seconds at
the Louisville, Kentucky, track. Smith could also sweep the Oaks
and Derby with a win aboard Pletcher’s Palace Malice.  Princess of Sylmar returned $79.60 to win, $29.40 to place
and $14 to show on a $2 bet. Second-place Beholder paid $9 and
$5.60, and Pletcher entry Unlimited Budget paid $3.80 to show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
