The Great Barrier Reef should be
placed on a list of World Heritage sites in danger if  Australia 
doesn’t limit the building of new coal export terminals and
improve water quality, the  United Nations  said.  New port developments in Queensland state could damage the
heritage value of the reef, the world’s largest, the UN’s
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO,
said in a  report  issued in Paris yesterday. Named developments
include one at  Balaclava Island  near Rockhampton, where Glencore
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  wants to build a terminal exporting 35 million
metric tons of coal a year.  Queensland has five coal and natural gas infrastructure
projects committed to go ahead with a combined value of A$6
billion ($6.2 billion) and another 13 which may be feasible
valued at A$26 billion, according to a  government report  last
October.  The UNESCO report said that while progress has been made in
several areas to protect the reef, more must be done to improve
water quality and prevent coastal development that may damage
the site. Failure to do so should mean the barrier reef is
considered for admission to a list of World Heritage sites in
danger, which  already includes  the Florida Everglades and
Sumatra’s rainforests, at a UNESCO meeting next year, the body
said in the report.  “Urgent and decisive action is needed to address these
issues,” UNESCO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
