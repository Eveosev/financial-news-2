Real Madrid beat Real Valladolid 4-3
to keep the title race going in Spanish soccer’s Primera Liga
for at at least another week.  Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to lead Real to the home win
at the Bernabeu Stadium. Real pulls within eight points of
Barcelona, which hosts Real Betis tomorrow. Barcelona would have
captured the title if it won and Real lost this weekend.  In  France , Marseille beat Bastia 2-1 to ensure Paris Saint-
Germain can’t win the Ligue 1 championship tomorrow. Marseille
moves to within six points of PSG, which hosts Valenciennes,
with three games left.  In  Germany , Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich drew 1-1 in
a warmup for their Champions League final on May 25. Bayer
Leverkusen beat Nuremberg 2-0 to clinch third place and an
automatic place in next season’s Champions League.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
