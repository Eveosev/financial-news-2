Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , the world’s eighth-
largest oil company by market value, reported first-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates after declining crude
prices pared sales.  Net income fell 20 percent to 3.41 trillion pesos ($1.86
billion), from 4.27 trillion pesos in the  year-earlier  period,
the Bogota-based state-controlled company said today in a
regulatory filing. The figure compares with an average net
income of 3.99 trillion pesos from five analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ecopetrol shares have declined 20 percent in Bogota this
year as production growth slows after the company failed to make
large discoveries in past years. The shares rose 0.7  percent
today to 4,320 pesos.  Sales fell 7.1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier
to 16.75 trillion pesos.  Output rose 6.4 percent to 790,800 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, from 743,400 barrels a year earlier. Ecopetrol
is targeting average daily production of 798,000 barrels in
2013.  Colombia ’s government owns about 88 percent of the oil
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
