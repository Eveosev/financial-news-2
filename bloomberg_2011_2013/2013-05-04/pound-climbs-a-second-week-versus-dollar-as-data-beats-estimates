The pound strengthened for a second
week against the dollar as economic reports that exceeded
analyst estimates boosted confidence that growth is
accelerating.  Sterling climbed to an 11-week high versus the greenback as
reports from U.K. business confidence to manufacturing,
construction and services output beat forecasts. Benchmark 10-
year gilts fell for a second week as demand for the safest
assets waned and investors sought higher-yielding assets. The
U.K. auctioned 50-year index-linked debt at a negative yield for
the first time on April 30.  “The data hasn’t been exactly good but the expectations
have been so deflated that the hurdle for upside surprises is
very low,” said Adam Cole, head of Group-of-10 currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “We’re still
positive on sterling.”  The pound advanced 0.6 percent in the week to $1.5566 at
5:11 p.m. London time yesterday after touching $1.5606 on May 1,
the most since Feb. 13. Sterling was little changed at 84.25
pence per euro.  Sterling has appreciated 2.6 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. That’s the
best performance among the 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by the gauge and comes after the nation avoided an
unprecedented triple-dip recession in the first quarter. Even
so, it has weakened 2.7 percent this year. The euro rose 1.5
percent in the month, while the dollar dropped 0.6 percent.  Economic Confidence  A gauge of services rose to 52.9 last month, according to
data yesterday. The median estimate of 27 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for the measure to stay unchanged at 52.4.
U.K. manufacturing shrank at a slower pace in April and a
Hometrack Ltd. report showed average house prices in England and
 Wales  matched the biggest increase in three years on April 29.  The 10-year  gilt yield  posted a weekly gain of five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.73 percent, after
increasing two basis points in the previous week. The 1.75
percent security due September 2022 fell 0.4, or 4 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 100.21.  The U.K. sold 500 million pounds of 2062 securities on
April 30 at a so-called mini tender with a real yield of minus
0.213 percent, the lowest ever for a 50-year inflation-protected
bond. The 30-year  break-even rate , a gauge of expectations for
retail prices over the next three decades, ended the week at
3.35 percentage points, within 15 basis points of the highest
since August 2011.  The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee will leave
stimulus unchanged when meets on May 8-9, according to Bloomberg
surveys.  Governor Mervyn King has wanted to expand the Bank of
England’s 375 billion-pound asset-purchase target for three
consecutive months and was outvoted at April’s meeting by six
policy makers who saw risks to inflation expectations as
weighing against further monetary easing, minutes showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
