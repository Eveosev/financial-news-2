Swansea striker Miguel Michu may miss
the rest of the Premier League season with a hamstring injury,
manager Michael Laudrup said.  Mihcu left today’s 0-0 home draw against  Manchester City 
during the second half. Laudrup wasn’t sure if the Spaniard had
torn his hamstring, but said the injury was bad enough to
probably keep him from the final three games of the season.  “He has a hamstring problem,” Laudrup said in his post-
match press conference. “I’m not sure if he’s torn it, but even
if it is less than that, this was his last game of the season.”  Michu has scored 21 goals since joining Swansea from
Spanish club Rayo Vallecano for 2 million pounds ($3 million)
last July.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
