The partner of  France ’s Socialist
President Francois Hollande costs taxpayers almost 20,000 euros
($26,228) a month in salaries for her entourage -- about half
the bill for her predecessor, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.  The state pays 19,742 euros a month in salaries for Valerie Trierweiler’s five staff, according to a  statement  by the
National Assembly in response to a question posed by a deputy.
That compares with eight staff at a cost of 36,448 euros for the
former fashion model.  Bruni-Sarkozy’s total expenses, which included the cost of
maintaining a website, were more than 60,000 euros a month, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
