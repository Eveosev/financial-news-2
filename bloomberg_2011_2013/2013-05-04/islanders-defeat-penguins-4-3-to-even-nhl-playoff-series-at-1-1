The New York Islanders overcame two
first-period goals by  Sidney Crosby , who was playing for the
first time in more than a month, and defeated the host
Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 to even their playoff series at 1-1.  In another National Hockey League first-round series, the
 Montreal Canadiens  won 3-1 against the visiting Ottawa Senators
to even that series at one game apiece. Later tonight, the
Chicago Blackhawks try to take a 2-0 lead in their series
against the  Minnesota Wild  and the San Jose Sharks seek a 2-0
lead at the Vancouver Canucks.  Crosby, who had missed the previous 13 games with a broken
jaw, scored twice in the opening 7 1/2 minutes of the game as
the Penguins took a 3-1 lead. Evgeni Malkin had opened the
scoring for Pittsburgh 43 seconds into the game.  The Islanders tied the game on second-period goals by Colin
McDonald and Matt Martin, and Kyle Okposo had the decisive score
midway through the third period.  Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is set for May 5 at
Uniondale,  New York .  Crosby, 25, was injured during a March 30 game and didnâ€™t
return to practice until April 26. At the time of the injury, he  led the NHL with 56 points, with 15 goals and a league-best 41
assists in 36 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
