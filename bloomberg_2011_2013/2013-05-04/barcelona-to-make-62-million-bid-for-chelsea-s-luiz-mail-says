Barcelona is preparing a 40 million-
pound ($62 million) offer for Chelsea defender  David Luiz  after
its exit from the Champions League, the Daily Mail said.  Barcelona was willing to offer 35 million pounds for the
Brazilian after last season before turning its attention to
other targets, the Mail said. Luiz, 25, signed a new contract
with Chelsea last year that runs to 2017, the newspaper said.  Barcelona was beaten 7-0 by  Bayern Munich  in its two-match
Champions League semifinal. The Spanish league leader is
confident it can take advantage of the undecided managerial
situation at Chelsea to pry Luiz away, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
