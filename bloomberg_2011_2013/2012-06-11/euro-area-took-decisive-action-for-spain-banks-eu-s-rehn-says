The euro area took “decisive
action” in agreeing to provide  Spain  with a bailout of as much
as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) to shore up its banking
industry, European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  The total amount includes “a safety margin,” Rehn said
today in the text of remarks to the European Parliament in
Strasbourg,  France .  Rehn cited European Commission reports released on May 30
saying Spain is among EU nations with “serious” economic
imbalances. “Based on the in-depth reviews, the commission
concluded that Spain and Cyprus are facing very serious
imbalances, not least in their financial sectors, which need to
be addressed as a matter of urgency,” Rehn said.  Cyprus Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said today that
requesting an EU rescue was one of the options under
consideration as it struggles to recapitalize its second-biggest
bank. Cyprus, the euro zone’s third-smallest economy, has been
shut out of markets for more than a year.  Rehn said the “unprecedented strengthening” of economic
and fiscal coordination in the euro area over the past two years
“has been accompanied by a certain degree of risk
mutualisation.”
The “renewed intensification” of the debt crisis “has shown
that we need to think beyond these achievements,” he said.  “We need to map out the main steps towards full economic
union, to complement and strengthen our existing monetary
union,” he said. “Demonstrating the unequivocal political
commitment of member states to the euro will be part of
restoring confidence in the euro area.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
