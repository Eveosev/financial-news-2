BP Plc (BP/)  can’t have access to 21
documents including e-mail communications between the White
House and other top U.S. officials during the  Gulf of Mexico   oil
spill  of 2010, a federal judge ruled.  BP asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Shushan last month to
review the e-mails on U.S. policy deliberations during the
response to the spill, including efforts to cap the well. BP
sought the e-mails to defend against claims over the spill
brought by the U.S.  The U.S. objected to turning over the e-mails to BP,
telling Shushan they were protected from disclosure by the
deliberative-process privilege, which shields government policy
discussions from being made public.  “BP’s need for the documents does not outweigh the
interest of the U.S. in protecting the deliberative process,”
Shushan said in a four-page order today in New Orleans. “BP’s
challenges to all 21 documents will be denied.”  The blowout and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon in April
2010 killed 11 workers and set off an oil spill that the
government has estimated at more than 4 million barrels. The
accident prompted hundreds of lawsuits against BP;  Transocean
Ltd. (RIG) , the Vernier, Switzerland-based owner and operator of the
rig; and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , which provided cementing services.  The U.S. government sued BP, Transocean and BP’s partners
in the well, Mitsui & Co.’s MOEX Offshore 2007 and The
Woodlands, Texas-based  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , alleging
violations of federal pollution laws.  Louisiana  and  Alabama  sued
as well. MOEX has settled the federal pollution claims.  ‘Simply Unfair’  BP argued in court papers that it would be hampered in its
defense against the U.S. claims if the government was allowed to
bar access to the documents on attempts to control the spill.  “Where as here, the  United States  wishes to recoup large
monetary penalties by bringing criticisms of BP’s source control
efforts and flow rate estimates, it is simply unfair for the
United States, at the same time, to shield from discovery
documents that describe BP’s collaboration with the United
States,” the company said in a June 8 letter to Shushan.BP
said the documents were relevant to its defense against expected
claims for Clean Water Act penalties that are partly based on
“the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of
the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the
discharge.”  Scott Dean , a spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on today’s ruling.  ‘Chill Discussion’  Gregory H. Woods, general counsel for the U.S. Energy
Department, categorized the e-mails as policy “deliberations”
among top federal officials in three areas: the release of
information to the public, the issuance of guidance and
directives to BP, and the starting or stopping of “specific
response actions during the spill.”  “Disclosure of these documents would chill the open and
candid discussion of internal opinions, ideas, and strategies”
among federal policy makers, including the Executive Office of
the President, during a future incident like the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill, Woods said in a court filing June 6.  The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana ( New Orleans ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
