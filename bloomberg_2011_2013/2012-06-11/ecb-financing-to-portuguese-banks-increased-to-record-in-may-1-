The  European Central Bank ’s
 financing  to Portuguese lenders rose to a new record in May, the
Bank of  Portugal  said.  ECB financing increased to 58.7 billion euros ($73.6
billion) from 55.4 billion euros in April, the Lisbon-based Bank
of Portugal said today on the BPStat portion of its website. ECB
financing levels had previously peaked at 56.3 billion euros in
March.  In April last year, Portugal became the third euro-area
country after Greece and Ireland to require aid and will receive
78 billion euros under its agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The plan earmarks 12
billion euros for Portugal’s lenders, if needed.  Spain  on June 9 became the fourth euro member to seek a
bailout since the start of the region’s debt crisis more than
two years ago with a request for as much as 100 billion euros in
loans to rescue its banking system.  The  Portuguese government  announced on June 4 that it has
committed to inject more than 6.6 billion euros in  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  and state-owned Caixa Geral
de Depositos SA to recapitalize the lenders.  As part of the Portugal’s aid plan, the country’s lenders
were required to raise core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9 percent
by the end of 2011 and 10 percent by the end of 2012. In
addition, the EU banking regulator ordered the region’s banks to
have a 9 percent capital ratio by the end of June after marking
down their holdings of sovereign debt to market prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
