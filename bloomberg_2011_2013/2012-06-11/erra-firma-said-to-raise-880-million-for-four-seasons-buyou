Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
the U.K. private-equity firm founded by Guy Hands, plans to
raise 565 million pounds ($880 million) to fund its acquisition
of nursing-home operator Four Seasons Health Care Ltd.  Terra Firma will fund the buyout with 525 million pounds of
secured and unsecured bonds and a loan, according to three
people with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified because the details are private. The financing is
being arranged by Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The buyout firm is issuing 350 million pounds of secured
notes due June 2019 through Elli Finance (U.K.) Plc, said the
people. The bonds are rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
four levels below investment grade, and an equivalent B+ by
 Standard & Poor’s . The issuer can redeem the securities after
three years, said the people.  The 175 million pounds of unsecured bonds are being sold
through Elli Investments Ltd. and are rated Caa1 by Moody’s,
seven steps below junk, and a level higher at B- by S&P. These
notes mature in June 2020 and can be redeemed by the issuer
after four years, according to the people.  The 40 million-pound loan, in the form of a revolving-
credit facility from which funds may be drawn again once they’ve
been repaid, has a six-year lifetime and may be increased by 35
million pounds, the people said. The  credit line  will pay
interest of 400 basis points more than the  London interbank
offered rate , or Libor.  Philip Walters, a London-based spokesman for Terra Firma,
declined to comment.  Terra Firma said on April 30 it would buy Four Seasons for
as much as 825 million pounds. The company operates 445 care
homes and 61 hospitals and special units in the U.K., the Isle
of Man and Jersey and recorded about 100 million pounds of
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
