Poland  carried out its first public
sale of euro-denominated bonds in five months as yields decline
on European attempts to contain the debt crisis.  The government sold 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of
Eurobonds due on Jan. 19, 2023 at 195 basis points above mid-
swaps, according to a banker involved in the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the terms weren’t yet public.  The spread is the lowest at a public sale by Poland in more
than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
Poland’s existing Eurobonds due in 2022 fell four basis points
to 3.69 percent at 5:51 p.m. in Warsaw, within seven basis
points of a record-low on June 7, the data show.  Poland is coming to the market after meeting 70 percent of
this year’s financing needs by May 31, opting to sell more debt
early in case the neighboring euro area crisis escalates and
increases borrowing costs for the European Union’s biggest
eastern economy. Polish debt prices rose after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on June 6 that his bank may do
more to stimulate the stalled euro region economy.  “The ministry is making the most of the improved sentiment
on the market,” Miroslaw Budzicki, fixed-income analyst at PKO
Bank Polski SA, the country’s largest lender, said by phone from
Warsaw.  Smallest Spread  The spread on the 3.75 percent coupon Eurobonds is the
smallest in a public sale since the country sold 2021 bonds at
150 basis points, or 1.5 percentage point, above mid-swaps in
January 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Poland sold 750 million euro of bonds due in March 2017 at
237 basis points above mid-swaps on Jan. 10,  Finance Ministry 
data show. It also sold 527 million euros in registered bonds
due on Feb. 24, 2022 on Feb. 10 at 242 basis points above mid-
swaps, according to the ministry.  Poland hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, Erste Group Bank
AG and ING Groep NV to manage the sale of “10-year benchmark
bonds in euros,” Malgorzata Brzoza, a spokeswoman for the
Finance Ministry, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
