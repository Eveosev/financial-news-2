The conflict in  Syria  has started to
resemble the sectarian war in Bosnia as the country edges toward
collapse, Britain’s Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said.  “It is looking more like Bosnia in the 1990s, being on the
edge of a sectarian conflict in which neighboring villages are
attacking and killing each other,” Hague told Britain’s  Sky
News  yesterday. “It is not so much like  Libya  last year, where
of course we had a successful intervention to save lives.”  The international community remains reluctant to use force
in Syria, where the  United Nations  estimates more than 10,000
people have been killed. Russia has cited the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization’s military intervention in Libya as an
example of what is sees as the abuse of UN resolutions to bring
about a change of government. President Bashar al-Assad has
repeatedly blamed the violence on terrorists and foreign forces
seeking to undermine the state.  Syrian security forces killed nine people today, Al Arabiya
television reported. Fifty-three people were slain by Syrian
security forces yesterday, the  Local Coordination Committees , an
activist group, said on its website.  “International unity” is the only way to end the
violence, Hague said.  In the 1990s, U.S., U.K. and French troops were part of a
NATO force that intervened to end the conflict in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, scene of the greatest carnage in the Balkan wars.
The bloodshed in Bosnia was the worst in  Europe  since World War
II and included the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at
Srebrenica in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
