China’s stocks  rose the most in
almost two weeks after the nation’s trade expanded more than
economists estimated and easing inflation provided leeway to
policymakers to ease monetary policy.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (601919) , the world’s largest operator of
dry-bulk ships, climbed 3.8 percent on prospects increasing
imports and exports will boost demand for marine transport.  SAIC
Motor Corp. (600104)  led an advance for automakers after passenger-car
sales beat analyst expectations.  China  Dongfanghong Spacesat Co.
jumped the most since November 2010 after the Xinhua News Agency
said the government will launch a manned rocket for a docking
mission this month.  “The May economic data are a little better than expected
and the government will continue to loosen policies given these
figures are still at relatively weak levels,” Dai Ming, a  fund
manager  at  Shanghai  Kingsun Investment Management & Consulting
Co., said by phone today.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 24.41 points, or 1.1
percent, to 2,305.86 at the close, the biggest gain since May
29. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 1.3 percent to 2,558.26. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, retreated 0.4 percent in  New York 
on June 8.  The Shanghai measure slid 3.9 percent last week, the most
since the five days ended Dec. 16, as concerns about a deepening
slowdown overshadowed the first cut in lending and deposit rates
since 2008. Thirty-day  volatility  on the gauge was at 15.77,
compared with this year’s average of 18.66. About 6.8 billion
shares changed hands on the index on June 8, 24 percent lower
than the daily average this year.  Exports Jump  China Cosco gained 3.8 percent to 4.87  yuan .  China Shipping
Container Lines Co. (601866) , the country’s second-largest carrier of
sea-cargo boxes, rose 3 percent to 2.79 yuan.  Exports climbed 15.3 percent in May to a record, the
Beijing-based customs bureau said yesterday, exceeding all 29
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Imports rose 12.7 percent
compared with estimates for a 5.5 percent gain.  China’s trade report is “surprisingly reassuring,”
 Michael Kurtz , Hong Kong-based global head of equity strategy at
Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview
today. “After the rate cut last week, we were all primed for a
very weak set of data.”  Consumer Stocks  Inflation slowed to 3 percent, compared with the 3.2
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Production
increased 9.6 percent, lower than a projected 9.8 percent gain,
and retail sales climbed 13.8 percent, less than the estimate
for a 14.2 percent gain.  China’s “surprising” trade data doesn’t change prospects
for more policy easing given signs of easing consumer-price
inflation, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The fact that CPI came down faster than expected allows
for more policy flexibility,” Helen Zhu, chief China equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in a Bloomberg television
interview in  Hong Kong . “The trade data is a little bit
surprising indeed but we don’t think that will seriously sway
the policy makers’ intentions.”  A measure of consumer staples stocks on the CSI 300 slid
0.3 percent today, the most among the 10 industry groups.
Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, lost 1.4 percent to 235.55 yuan.  Wuliangye
Yibin Co. (000858) , the second largest, fell 1.1 percent to 32.19 yuan.  The Shanghai Composite has advanced 4.8 percent this year.
Stocks in the measure are valued at 9.97 times estimated
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 17.8, according
to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai index is poised to gain a further 10 percent
from current levels, spurred by government measures to boost the
economy including easier monetary policies and increasing
infrastructure spending, Gao Ting, chief China strategist at UBS
Wealth Management, said in an interview in Shanghai today.  Spain Bailout  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 1.9 percent today
after  Spain  asked for a bailout of as much as 100 billion euros
($126 billion) to help shore up its banks, fanning expectations
European leaders will step up effort to counter the debt crisis.  “Spain is a very important and big member of the euro zone
and policy makers won’t abandon Spain,” Kingsun’s Dai said.  SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, rose 2.3 percent to 14.93
yuan.  Great Wall Motor Co. (601633) , China’s biggest pickup truck maker,
advanced 4.3 percent to 17.28 yuan. FAW Car Co., which makes
cars with Volkswagen AG, added 2.7 percent to 12.21 yuan.  Deliveries, including multipurpose and sport-utility
vehicles, rose by 22.6 percent to 1.28 million units last month,
Chen Shihua, statistics department head at the China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers, said over the weekend at a briefing
in Beijing. That beat the 1.2 million average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Manned Docking  China Dongfanghong led gains for aerospace companies,
jumping 6.6 percent to 13.52 yuan. China will send three
astronauts into orbit later this month to perform the first
manned docking with its Tiangong-1 space module, Xinhua reported
over the weekend.  Aerospace Communications Holdings Co. surged 6.3 percent to
9.15 yuan.  Beijing Aerospace Changfeng Co. (600855)  added 3.8 percent to
9.47 yuan.  Chinese stocks traded in New York rose for the first time
in six weeks. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-
traded Chinese companies in the U.S. advanced 3.5 percent last
week, snapping a five-week slump that sent the gauge to an
eight-month low on June 4.  The iShares FTSE  China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest U.S.-
listed China exchange-traded fund, retreated 2.8 percent to
$32.81 on June 8, trimming its gain last week to 0.4 percent.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Ravil Shirodkar  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
