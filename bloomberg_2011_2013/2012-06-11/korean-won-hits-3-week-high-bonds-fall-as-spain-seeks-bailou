South Korean  government bonds 
plunged, with the five-year yield increasing by the most this
year, and the won strengthened as Spain sought a bailout for its
banks and China’s exports beat estimates.  The 100 billion euros ($126 billion) asked for by Spain on
June 9 is about 2.7 times the funds deemed necessary by the
 International Monetary Fund  in a report released the previous
day. China’s overseas sales rose in May at more than double the
pace analysts estimated, official figures showed over the
weekend. South  Korea ’s  producer-price inflation  eased to a 29-
month low of 1.9 percent, central bank data showed today. The
benchmark five-year yield dropped four basis points last week.  “Yields fell recently on bets the  Bank of Korea  may lower
 interest rates , but with Spain asking for a bailout, investors
have started to doubt whether a rate cut will be necessary,”
said Yum Sang Hoon, a fixed-income analyst at SK Securities Co.
in Seoul.  The yield on the 3.5 percent government bonds due March
2017 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.44
percent at the close in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
That’s the biggest one-day increase for a benchmark five-year
 note  since Dec. 19.  Three-year debt futures dropped 0.25 percent to 104.62 and
the one-year interest-rate swap rose four basis points to 3.33
percent. The Bank of Korea held its benchmark seven-day
repurchase  rate  at 3.25 percent for a 12th month on June 8.  The won advanced 0.8 percent to 1,165.85 per dollar, the
biggest gain in two weeks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,164.70 earlier, the strongest
level since May 22. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 13 basis
points to 10.40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
