Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco President  John Williams  said Europe posed a
“significant threat” to the stability of the global financial
system.  “While the global financial system is stronger than it was
three years ago, it remains vulnerable,” Williams said in the
text of remarks given in San Francisco today. “In the worst
case, the European crisis could undermine the financial
improvements in  North America  and Asia.”  Williams added that economic conditions overseas are
“deteriorating,” with China undergoing a “marked
deceleration.” Europe “looks to be in recession,” he said.
Growth in the U.S. remains “moderate,” he said at a forum on
Asian banking and finance at the San Francisco Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
