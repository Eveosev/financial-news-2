Raw sugar prices traded in  New York 
may fall to 18 cents a pound in the “near term,” a level at
which millers in top producers Brazil would make more ethanol at
the expense of the sweetener, according  Societe Generale SA. (GLE)   Sugar and ethanol are made from the raw material cane.
Below 18 cents a pound, it would be more favorable for millers
to make anhydrous ethanol, the type used to blend with gasoline,
 Michael Haigh , global head of commodities research at the bank
in New York, said in a report e-mailed today. The commodity has
fallen 12 percent this year to 20.45 cents a pound by 12:17 p.m.
in New York as global supplies outpaced demand.  “Sugar prices are likely to continue falling in the near
term,” Haigh said in the report. “We continue to expect a
global sugar surplus as the Brazilian harvest is underway.”  Global sugar production will be 4.58 million metric tons
higher than consumption in the 2012-13 season that starts in
October, the bank forecast. That would be a third consecutive
year of surplus. Supplies in the current season are forecast to
be 6.39 million tons higher than demand, it said.  Raw sugar prices will average 22.5 cents a pound in the
second quarter, down from a previous forecast of 23.9 cents a
pound, SocGen said. In the final three months of the year,
prices will average 23.4 cents a pound, down from a previous
estimate of 24 cents a pound, according to the report.  White Sugar  On NYSE Liffe, white sugar will be at $598 a ton in the
third quarter and $617 a ton the following three months, the
bank forecast. That compares with previous estimates of $605 a
ton for the third quarter and $608 a ton for the final one.  “A significant drop in production during the Brazilian
harvest is the key upside risk to prices,” Haigh said. Rains in
 Brazil ’s center south are delaying the crop and may reduce the
sugar content in the cane, he said.  Coffee supplies may outpace demand by 6.5 million bags in
2012-13 as production climbs in Brazil, the top grower,  Societe
Generale  said. Prices of arabica beans traded in New York have
fallen 31 percent this year as producers in the South American
country sold parts of the crop from 2011 and 2012 at the same
time, Haigh said.  “The sell-off seems overdone, in our view,” he said.
“Even recognizing modest global growth over the next few years,
global inventories are just now reaching historical levels.”  Production in  Colombia , the second-biggest arabica grower,
will rise 6 percent next season, SocGen said.  Arabica coffee will average $1.662 a pound in the third
quarter and $1.7446 a pound in the last three months of the
year, the bank estimates. The commodity was down 0.3 percent at
$1.569 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
