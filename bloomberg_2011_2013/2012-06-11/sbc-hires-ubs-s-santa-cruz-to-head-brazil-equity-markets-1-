HSBC Holding Plc hired Matias  Santa Cruz  from  UBS AG (UBSN)  to head Brazilian equity capital market
operations.  Santa Cruz, who was at UBS for more than a decade, will
initially work on share sales in the region from New York, HSBC
said in an e-mailed statement. Santa Cruz is scheduled to
relocate to Sao Paulo later this year to oversee equity capital
markets in Latin America’s biggest economy, according to the
statement.  “Matias is a well respected banker with a deep knowledge
of the equity capital markets and an excellent record in
executing deals for Brazilian and Latin American companies,”
Gerardo Mato, HSBC’s head of global banking for the Americas,
said in the statement.  Santa Cruz will report to David Noble, head of  equity
capital markets  for the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
