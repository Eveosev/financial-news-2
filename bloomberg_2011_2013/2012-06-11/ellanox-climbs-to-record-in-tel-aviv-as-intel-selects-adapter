Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  surged to
the highest level on record as the Israeli supplier of
technology used to transfer and store data said its adapter
silicon was selected by  Intel Corp. (INTC)   Shares of Mellanox, based in Yokneam Elit, Israel, jumped
3.9 percent to 254.5 shekels, or the equivalent of $65.72, at
the close in Israel. That was the highest price since the
company’s offering in 2007. The Nasdaq-traded stock rose 5.1
percent to $64.81 by 10:27 a.m. in New York after earlier
gaining as much as 11 percent to the highest price on record.  Mellanox’s ConnectX-3 FDR InfiniBand adapter silicon has
been selected by Intel for use in their I/O Expansion Modules
and half-width server boards, the company said in a statement
distributed today. The adapter will allow Intel to deliver
higher performance and application efficiency, and to reduce the
consumption of power, Mellanox said in the statement.  Mellanox said last week its technologies were chosen for
use by a Chinese developer and an undisclosed U.S.-based stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
