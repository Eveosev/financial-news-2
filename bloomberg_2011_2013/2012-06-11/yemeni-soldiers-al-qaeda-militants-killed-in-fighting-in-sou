About 25 al-Qaeda militants and four
Yemeni soldiers were killed today in fighting in the southern
province of Abyan, the al-Masdar independent website reported.  Yemen’s air force launched several strikes against militant
positions, helping ground troops advance and recapture a
munitions plant that had been under their control, al-Masdar
said. The army is now a few kilometers from the city of Jaar, a
stronghold of the militants, the  Defense Ministry  said on its
website. Government forces also carried out artillery and air
strikes on another rebel position in the city of Shaqra, on the
 Gulf of Aden , according to Saleem Ali, a resident.  In the capital, Sana’a, army leaders loyal to former
President Ali Abdullah Saleh have abandoned opposition to a
change of command at the Third Brigade of the elite Republican
Guard, according to the Defense Ministry. The brigade was
formerly led by one of Saleh’s sons, and some loyalists had
resisted a change of command that was part of the Gulf-brokered
peace agreement under which Saleh relinquished power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
