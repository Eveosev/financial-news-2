International arrivals at Greek
airports fell 5.1 percent in the first five months of the year,
according to the  Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises .  The number of people arriving from abroad declined to 2.27
million in the five months, from 2.39 million in the year-
earlier period, the association said in a statement on its
 website  today.  In May, international arrivals dropped 6.7 percent to 1.18
million. Thirteen airports that account for 95 percent of air
arrivals from abroad were surveyed.  Athens International Airport,  Greece ’s biggest, saw a 13
percent drop in the five months, to 804,162, and a 17 percent
decline in May. Traffic has slumped as the economic crisis hits
travel spending across  Europe  and protests dent Greece’s image
abroad, the airport said in a statement last month.  Tourism, Greece’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
