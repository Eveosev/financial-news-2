The  Bank of Japan ’s increased
purchases of government debt have eroded political incentives to
raise the nation’s sales tax, according to an academic who has
written books on the economy and fiscal policy.  “No one knows how much debt the BOJ will buy, but everyone
can see they will keep bolstering purchases should pressure
increase,” Yukio Noguchi, 71, professor emeritus at
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, said in an interview last
week. “From a political standpoint, the BOJ is providing a
sense of security that they’ll take care of everything and that
the sales tax doesn’t need to be raised.”  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  is trying to win
parliamentary backing this month to double the nation’s 5
percent  sales tax  by 2015. The BOJ, which has been buying
government debt as part of its asset-purchase program, would be
committing a “huge crime” by failing to stand up to political
calls for it to add policy stimulus, Noguchi said.  The BOJ has said its bond purchases aren’t intended to
finance the nation’s debt burden, currently the largest in the
industrialized world. It has increased the size of pledged bond
purchases twice this year and in February unveiled a 1 percent
inflation target to overcome deflation.  “They won’t be able to achieve the 1 percent consumer-
price target for a while with monetary policy, so it’s a
meaningless goal,” said Noguchi, who is also a former Finance
Ministry official. His published works include “The Structure
of Fiscal Crises.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
