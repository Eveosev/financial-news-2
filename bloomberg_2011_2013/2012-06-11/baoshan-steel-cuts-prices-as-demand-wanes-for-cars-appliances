Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, lowered prices as demand
from makers of appliances and cars slowed.  Prices were cut by as much as 400 yuan ($63) a metric ton
for July delivery, the Shanghai-based company said in a
 statement  on its trade website bsteel.com. Most hot-rolled and
cold-rolled products were reduced by 200 yuan a ton. Baoshan had
raised prices by 100 yuan in January and as much as 200 yuan in
March and kept most grades little changed in the other months
this year.  Steel prices in China, the world’s biggest producer and
consumer of the alloy, have fallen for eight straight weeks
because of waning demand from builders and automakers.  China ’s
daily steel production in May fell from the previous month,
based on monthly data collated by the National Bureau of
Statistics and the output may fall further in June.  Chinese prices  of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark product,
have fallen by an aggregate 5.1 percent to 4,170 yuan as of June
8, according to researcher Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Baoshan Steel didn’t give product prices
following the reduction, according to the statement.  Baoshan also cut zinc-galvanized grades by between 100 yuan
and 400 yuan and pickling coil prices by as much as 150 yuan, it
said in the statement. Silicon steel prices were left unchanged.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
