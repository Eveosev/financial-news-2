Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  fell for a
second day, losing 0.4 percent to 64.25 in Nairobi.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index snapped nine
days of declines, rising 1.1 percent to 21,121.86 in Lagos,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mauritius’s  SEMDEX
Index (SEMDEX)  retreated 0.1 percent to 1,792.79 by the close in Port
Louis. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  weakened 0.5 percent to
886.83 in Windhoek.  The following shares were active in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM)  , Kenya’s largest
investment company, advanced 1.4 percent to 14.75 shillings, the
biggest gain since April 23.  The company’s investment income will receive a boost from
the exposure to short term government securities at a time when
interest rates were rising, Francis Mwangi, head of research at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview from Nairobi today.  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM)  , Nigeria’s largest company
by market value and the biggest producer of the building
material in Africa, rose 3.4 percent to 105.50 naira, the most
since April 18, after the Lagos-based company said its new plant
at Obajana with capacity for 5.25 million metric tons a year,
started production.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, retreated for a fifth day, erasing 1.8 percent
to 14 shillings, the lowest since April 18, on concern full-year
profit may decline more than forecast.  “The company is trading on a profit warning; so what the
market is not sure is whether they are going to go into an
outright loss or what level of profit fall will be reported,”
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. KQ, as
the airline is known, will announce earnings June 14.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG)  , Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, gained 1.7 percent to 5.90 shillings, the highest
level since April 23, as the commodity advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
