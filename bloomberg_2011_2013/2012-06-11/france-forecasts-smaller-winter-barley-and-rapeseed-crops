French farmers will harvest less
winter barley and rapeseed this year after fields were damaged
by freezing temperatures, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Winter-barley production is forecast to slide 9.9 percent
to 5.69 million metric tons from 6.31 million tons, the
ministry’s statistics department wrote in a monthly report. The
growing area fell to 901,000 hectares (2.23 million acres) from
1.06 million hectares, while yields will rise to 6.31 tons an
acre from 5.98 tons an acre, the ministry predicted.  French crops benefited from rain in April and May, after
frost in February damaged wheat, barley and rapeseed plants.
 France  was the world’s second-largest barley exporter last year
behind  Australia , falling from the top spot after spring drought
curbed the 2011 harvest, International Trade Centre data show.  “The area seeded with winter cereals slumps following the
freezing weather,” the ministry wrote. “Re-seeding is leading
to a record level for the area of spring barley. The area of
grain corn widens.”  Spring barley was planted on a record 885,000 hectares,
jumping 81 percent from 489,000 hectares in 2011, the report
showed. Farmers will seed 1.68 million hectares of corn,
advancing from 1.59 million hectares last year.  Winter-rapeseed output is predicted to fall 9.7 percent to
4.84 million tons from 5.36 million tons, the  Agriculture
Ministry  wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
