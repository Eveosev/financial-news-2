(Corrects quote to say the brokerage doesn’t think data
will change policy makers’ intention in second paragraph.)  China ’s “surprising” trade data
doesn’t change prospects for more policy easing given signs of
easing consumer-price inflation, according to  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)   “The fact that CPI came down faster than expected allows
for more policy flexibility,” Helen Zhu, chief China equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg
television interview in  Hong Kong . “The trade data is a little
bit surprising indeed but we don’t think that will seriously
sway the policy makers’ intentions.”  Speculation that China’s stocks may rally in the short term
as recent declines made equities cheaper may be overly
optimistic, she said.  “Since the market has come down quite a bit, people are
getting increasingly interested, but to say the market is going
to be positioned for a massive run within a short period of time
is a little bit too optimistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
