Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC unit and  Dial
Global Inc. (DIAL)  are creating the NBC Sports Radio Network to
broadcast national and regional programming, challenging  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN Radio.  The radio network, starting in September, will air hourly
sports-news updates, daily features and full-length shows, New
York-based NBC and Dial Global said today in a statement.  Under Comcast, NBC has moved to challenge ESPN, the most-
watched television sports channel, with NBC Sports Network and
Golf Channel. The company has extended rights agreements to
continue airing the Olympics and National Hockey League games.
NBC Sports Radio Network will provide stations with regional and
national coverage, the companies said.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, lost 1.1 percent to $29.94
at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 26 percent this
year. Dial, a radio program distributor based in New York, fell
15 percent to $2.56.  The sports-radio accord builds on agreements between NBC
and Dial to create a 24-hour NBC News Radio network, the Weather
Channel and NBC Olympics. NBC News Radio Network will feature
live, breaking-news simulcasts from NBC and MSNBC, reports from
NBC News correspondents, and broadcasts by  Brian Williams , the
anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” and David Gregory, the anchor of
“Meet the Press.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
