Crude-oil options volatility rose to
the highest level in a week as underlying futures slid to an
eight-month low October on concern the  European debt crisis  will
spread, slowing the global recovery and fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 38.4 percent at 3:20 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, up from 35.08 yesterday. Volatility reached
40.6 on June 1, the highest level since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.40, or 1.7 percent, to
settle at $82.70 a barrel on the Nymex.  Spain  became the fourth of 17 euro-area nations to seek
emergency assistance last weekend, the most recent sign of
fiscal stress in a regional debt crisis that started in  Greece 
in 2009. Greek voters go to the polls this weekend to decide
whether to honor that countryâ€™s international bailout.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were September $65 puts, which rose 14 cents to 73 cents a
barrel at 3:26 p.m. with 3,288 lots trading. July $80 puts were
the second-most active options, with 3,059 lots changing hands
as they advanced 31 cents to 78 cents.  Puts accounted for the four most active options and 56
percent of electronic trading volume. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 53 percent of the 134,762 trades
in the previous session. July $75 puts were the most actively
traded, with 9,703 lots changing hands. They were unchanged at 6
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July $77 puts,
gained 2 cents to 15 cents on volume of 6,392.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 50,854
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 36,029 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,887.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
