Czech inflation was the slowest in
five months in May as policy makers discuss whether to cut
 interest rates  with the economy struggling to exit a recession.  The  inflation  rate dropped to 3.2 percent from 3.5 percent
in April, the Czech Statistics Office in Prague said on its
website today. The reading was higher than the 3.1 percent
median forecast of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Consumer
prices rose 0.2 percent from the previous month.  Inflation has exceeded the central bank’s 2 percent target
for eight months as the government increased the  sales tax  to
boost budget revenue. The economy’s contraction deepened in the
first quarter, with falling domestic demand outweighing rising
exports as households cut spending.  The Ceska Narodni Banka left the  benchmark  two-week
repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75 percent on May 3, keeping
borrowing costs steady since a cut in May 2010. Two rate
setters, including Governor Miroslav Singer, sought a cut in
May, while four voted for no change and one wanted to raise
borrowing costs.  The government raised the lower bracket for the value-added
levy on goods and services including food, drugs and public
transport, to 14 percent from 10 percent starting in 2012.
Inflation began to accelerate in the final quarter of last year
as businesses raised prices before the tax increase took effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
