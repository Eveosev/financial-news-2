German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  wants aid for  Spain ’s banks to come from the future
permanent backstop, the European Stability Mechanism, to avoid
greater risks for the German budget,  Handelsblatt  said.  Spain would not be able to guarantee loans from the current
backstop, the European Financial Stability Facility, if funds
for its banks came from the EFSF, the newspaper said, citing
European Union diplomats it didn’t name.  Germany ’s share of guarantees to the EFSF would rise in
such an event, the newspaper said. The ESM is financed by all 17
euro-region countries, including those that receive funds from
it, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
