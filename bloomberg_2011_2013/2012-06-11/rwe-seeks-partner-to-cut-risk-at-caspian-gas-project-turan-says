RWE AG (RWE)  is seeking a foreign partner
before signing a production-sharing deal with  Azerbaijan ’s state
energy company on the Caspian’s Nakhchivan structure, the Turan
news service reported, citing an unidentified official.  Germany’s second-biggest utility, which is responsible for
the exploration costs, will be ready to sign an agreement with
State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, after it finds a partner,
Turan cited the official as saying. While Socar and RWE signed a
memorandum of understanding on the structure in March 2010, they
haven’t yet agreed a deal on exploration and production.  Nakhchivan, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) off the Azeri
coast, was first explored by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  in 2001 and 2002
and later abandoned after no fuel was found. The structure may
hold 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 40 million
metric tons of condensate, Socar estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
