The moisture deficit in the U.S.
Midwest is 4 to 5 inches after “extremely dry weather” in the
past 30 days, agricultural-weather forecaster Martell Crop
Projections said.  Wet conditions developed in the Midwest, with a band of
thunderstorms moving from the western corn belt into  Missouri ,
northwest Illinois and  Wisconsin , Martell wrote in an e-mailed
report today. Radar images suggest locally heavy rainfall of as
much as 2 inches, Martell wrote.  The March-May spring season was the hottest in the U.S. on
record, based on figures from the National Climatic Data Center,
according to the forecaster. The lack of rain in the country’s
grain belt in combination with heat has damaged crop potential,
Martell said.  “Soaking rain would be beneficial, but not enough to erase
drought,” Martell wrote. “Extreme heat has hastened field
drying, enhancing evaporation.”  Today’s U.S. Department of Agriculture crop-progress report
is expected to show a “sharp decline” in conditions for corn
and soybeans, according to Martell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
