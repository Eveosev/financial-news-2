Former Innospec Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Paul Jennings pleaded guilty today to trying to bribe
Indonesian and Iraqi government officials to win contracts.  Dennis Kerrison, another former CEO at the company, and
Miltos Papachristos, the former regional sales director for the
Asia-Pacific region at Innospec, both pleaded not guilty to a
charge brought by the U.K.â€™s Serious Fraud Office of attempting
to bribe Indonesian officials to win contracts to supply the
fuel additive tetraethyl lead. The pleas were entered at a
hearing today at a London criminal court and Kerrison and
Papachristos will face trial next year.  Kerrison, of Surrey,  England , was CEO of the company under
its previous name, Octel Corp., according to the SFO. The
charges cover a period from 2002 until 2008.  Innospec, a producer of fuel additives and specialty
chemicals, agreed to pay more than $40 million in fines after
pleading guilty in the U.K. and U.S. in 2010 to paying bribes
overseas to secure sales contracts. The bribes were paid when
the sale of tetraethyl lead was becoming less lucrative for the
company as governments encouraged the use of unleaded gasoline,
the SFO said in court at the time.  David Turner , a former sales and marketing director for
tetraethyl lead at Innospec in the U.K., who was also charged in
the case, pleaded guilty in January to three counts of
conspiracy to corrupt. He admitted to bribing officials of
Indonesia and  Iraq , the SFO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
