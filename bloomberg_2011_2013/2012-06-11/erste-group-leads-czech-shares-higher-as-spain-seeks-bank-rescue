Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech shares
higher after Spain requested a bailout for its banks and Chinaâ€™s
exports beat estimates, boosting demand for riskier assets.  The Austrian lender climbed 2.7 percent to 375 koruna by
9:37 a.m. in  Prague , adding to a 2.6 percent rally last week.
The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, in which Erste has an 18 percent
weighting, advanced 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
