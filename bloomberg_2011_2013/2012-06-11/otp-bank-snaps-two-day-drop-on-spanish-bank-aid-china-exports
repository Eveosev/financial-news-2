OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, snapped two days of losses after  Spain  requested
European Union bailout for its banks and Chinese exports rose
more than expected in May.  The  shares  rose as much as 3.1 percent and traded 2.2
percent higher at 3,475 forint by 10:32 a.m. in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  gained 1 percent to 17,190.60.  Spain asked euro-region governments over the weekend for as
much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to help shore up its
banking system, a sign Europe is tackling a crisis that has
roiled markets around the world. Chinese data showed exports
grew last month at more than double the pace analysts estimated
and crude oil imports rose to a record.  “We expect strong optimism to dominate the market today
following favorable Chinese economic data and the Spanish
bailout,” Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, Budapest-based
analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , said in an e-
mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
