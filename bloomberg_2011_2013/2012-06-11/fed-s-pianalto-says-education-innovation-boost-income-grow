Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
President  Sandra Pianalto  said regions with the most education
and innovation have the most income growth. She didn’t speak
about monetary policy or the economy.  “The more knowledge capital, the better performance”
compared with areas with less educational attainment, Pianalto
said today in opening remarks for a panel discussion at
 Cleveland Connects : Creating the Culture of College. “Cities
with higher education levels are shown to be more productive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
