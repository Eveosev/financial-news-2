Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  will decide in coming days whether to
support legislation that would force all financial transactions
to be carried out in pesos, newspaper El Cronista reported,
citing Agustin Rossi, the leader of Fernandez’s Victory Front
alliance in the lower house of Congress.  Lawmaker Edgardo Depetri on June 7 presented a bill that
would force all contracts, including real estate transactions
that are normally done in dollars, to use the peso in future.
The legislation wouldn’t affect dollar bank deposits or existing
contracts.  While Alliance lawmakers support the bill, the
administration is still analyzing it, Rossi said. according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
