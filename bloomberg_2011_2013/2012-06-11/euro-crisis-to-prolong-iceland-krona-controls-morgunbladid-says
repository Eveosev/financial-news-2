Uncertainty about the future of the
European single currency will delay Iceland’s plans to remove
 capital controls  before the end of 2015, Morgunbladid reported,
citing Economy Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson.  “The capital controls reduce the chances of a run on our
currency and a capital flight” out of Iceland, the Reykjavik-
based newspaper  cited  Sigfusson as saying. “It’s clear that we
have to evaluate the capital controls removal plan in light of
the situation in  Europe ,” he said, according to Morgunbladid.  Iceland imposed capital controls in 2008 following the
collapse of its three largest lenders in October of that year.
The controls are stopping as much as $8 billion in kronur assets
from leaving the economy, according to an estimate by  Arion Bank
hf .  To contact the reporter on this story:
