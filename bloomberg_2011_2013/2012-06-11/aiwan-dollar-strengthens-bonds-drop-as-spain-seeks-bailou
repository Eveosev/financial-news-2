Taiwan’s dollar gained and
 government bonds  fell as optimism European policy makers are
willing to do what it takes to end the region’s debt crisis
boosted sentiment toward riskier assets.  The currency rebounded from its longest weekly losing
streak since 2008 after  Spain  asked euro-area governments over
the weekend for as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to
help shore up its banking system. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia
Dollar Index rose after official data showed China’s exports
grew 15.3 percent in May from a year earlier, more than twice
the 7.1 percent median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  “Risk-taking sentiment prevails today on Spain’s
bailout,” said Eric Hsing, a bond trader at First Securities
Inc. in Taipei. “ China ’s rise in exports means there could be a
pickup in global demand, but just a month of data doesn’t really
say anything.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$29.92 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
The currency concluded a fifth weekly drop on June 9, the
longest stretch of losses since September 2008.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little changed
at 5.4 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.19
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  slipped one basis
point to 0.51 percent, according to a weighted average compiled
by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
