Apax Partners LLP, a British private
equity firm, agreed to buy Paradigm Ltd., a maker of software
for the oil and gas industry.  Apax, based in London, is buying Paradigm with JMI Equity,
a Baltimore-based private equity fund manager focusing on
technology, in a deal valuing the company at about $1 billion,
the firm said in a statement today. Paradigm, based in the
 Cayman Islands , makes software that helps oil and gas engineers
analyze seismic and well-log data to optimize drilling.  “Our intention is to continue this innovation and gain
market share in a growing market,” Jason Wright, an Apax
partner in  New York , said in the statement. “We believe that
the intersection between energy and software is an exciting area
for investment.”  Apax is seeking 9 billion euros ($11.3 billion) for
leveraged buyouts, mainly in  Europe . It had its so-called first
close on that fundraising with 4.3 billion euros in March,
allowing it to start investing the money, a person familiar with
the matter said at the time. The firm’s previous investments in
technology companies include Sophos Plc, a British maker of
security and data protection software.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Simmons & Co. advised
Apax. UBS AG and Royal Bank of Canada provided debt financing.
Jefferies & Co. advised Paradigm.  To contact the reporters on this story:
