Spanish Economy Minister Luis De Guindos warned euro-area finance ministers during talks on June
9 that a full bailout of  Spain  would cost 500 billion euros
($632 billion) and force a bailout for  Italy ,  El Mundo  reported,
citing an unidentified person present at the talks.  “If you want to force a bailout for Spain start preparing
500 billion euros and another 700 billion euros for Italy which
will have to be bailed out after us,” De Guindos was cited as
saying to the Eurogroup during a conference call on Saturday.  A spokesman for the economy ministry wasn’t immediately
