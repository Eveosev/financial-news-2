time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 1.2
percent to 1,448.554.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose the most in more than five months in  New York  on
speculation fuel demand will increase after Spain requested a
European bailout to shore up its banks and  China ’s imports of
crude climbed to a record.  Futures advanced as much as 3 percent, the biggest gain
since Jan. 3. Spain will seek 100 billion euros ($126 billion)
from euro-area nations, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told
reporters in  Madrid  yesterday. China, the world’s second-biggest
crude consumer, increased imports of the commodity in May as
costs fell, according to customs data. OPEC may maintain output
quotas to keep prices at current levels when the oil cartel
meets this week, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July rose $3.20, or 2.9 percent,
to $114.30 a barrel, PVM data showed. The premium of gasoil to
Dubai crude fell 78 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $15.35 a barrel,
the lowest level since May 31.  Naphtha swaps for July rose $7, or 0.9 percent, to $759 a
metric ton at 10:29 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold advanced for a second day as the euro rallied against
the dollar after  Spain  asked for a bailout and on speculation
that demand from China will be sustained.  August-delivery bullion also rose for a second day on the
Comex in New York, gaining as much as 1.1 percent to $1,609.30
an ounce, and was last at $1,600.70. Holdings in the SPDR Gold
Trust, the biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion,
stood unchanged for a second day at 1,274.79 metric tons on June
8, the largest amount since May 21, its website showed.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced the most in more than four months as
imports in China, the world’s biggest consumer, surged 12
percent in May and Spain’s bailout request boosted the euro to a
two-week high against the dollar.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn climbed for a fourth day and soybeans and wheat gained
as dry, hot weather threatened to hurt crops in the U.S., the
world’s largest shipper.  July-delivery corn rose as much as 1 percent to $6.0375 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.0025 at 2:39
p.m. Singapore time. The most-active contract increased 8.4
percent last week.  Soybeans for November-delivery gained as much as 1 percent
to $13.455 a bushel, before trading at $13.4375. The most-active
contract climbed 5.9 percent last week, the biggest advance
since the five days ended Oct. 14.  Wheat for July delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.345 a bushel, extending last week’s 2.9 percent advance. It
last traded at $6.34, after declining 1.8 percent on June 8.  Rubber climbed from a 31-month low after car sales in
China, the world’s biggest consumer, expanded more than analysts
estimated in May, easing concern that demand may weaken.  November-delivery  rubber advanced as much as 3.7 percent
to 246.4 yen a kilogram ($3,096 a metric ton) and settled at
244.5 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active
contract fell to 232.2 yen in after-hours trading on June 8, the
lowest level since November 2009.  Palm oil  climbed on speculation that inventories in
 Malaysia , the second-largest producer after  Indonesia , may be
lower than expected in May, and as better-than-expected trade
data from China improved investor sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
