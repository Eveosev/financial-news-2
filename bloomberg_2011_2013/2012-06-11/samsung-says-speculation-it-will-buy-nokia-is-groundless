Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s
largest mobile-phone maker, said market speculation that it is
interested in acquiring competitor  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  is groundless.  Samsung, based in Suwon,  South Korea , made the comment
today in an e-mailed statement. Shares of Espoo, Finland-based
Nokia  fell  0.7 percent to 2.35 euros at 11:27 a.m. Helsinki
time, after jumping 6 percent on June 8 amid speculation Samsung
is preparing an offer.  Nokia, struggling to recover lost market share, has
declined 46 percent in the past year as consumers snapped up
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones and Samsung smartphones running on Google
Inc.’s Android software. Samsung overtook Nokia in the first
quarter as the world’s largest handset maker, according to
Gartner Inc.  Samsung also denied it’s interested in Nokia a year ago,
responding to reports that it was getting ready to make a bid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
