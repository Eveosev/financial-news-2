Banco Continental Paraguay plans to
hold bond investor meetings from June 13 to June 19 and may sell
a benchmark-sized dollar bond afterward, according to a person
familiar with the plan.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are
arranging the meetings, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because heâ€™s not authorized to speak publicly.
Benchmark bond offerings are typically $500 million or more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
