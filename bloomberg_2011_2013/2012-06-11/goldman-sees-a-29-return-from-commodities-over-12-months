Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  predicted a
29 percent return over the next year from the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, led by energy and industrial-
metals investments.  European policy makers will be able to contain the euro-area
debt crisis, while recovery in the U.S. and China is set to
continue,  Jeffrey Currie , head of commodities research in  New
York , said today in a report. Returns may be 41 percent in a
year for energy investments, compared with 23 percent for
industrial metals and 18 percent for precious metals, while
agriculture is forecast to lose 14 percent, the report showed.  “Although the macroeconomic backdrop still remains
uncertain, particularly in Europe, we believe that the selloff
in commodity prices is likely overdone and the price risks are
shifting more to the upside,” Currie wrote.  Commodities as measured by the S&P GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index dropped 13 percent in May and are down 9.1 percent this
year on mounting concern that  Europe ’s widening debt crisis will
derail global growth and curb demand for commodities. Coffee,
natural gas, cotton and crude oil paced declines.  Goldman Sachs cut its three-month outlook on commodities to
neutral from overweight on March 28, while sticking with an
overweight recommendation for a one-year period. Commodities may
return 13 percent in a year, the bank said in April.  Currie correctly advised investors to reduce commodity
holdings on April 15, 2011, before prices slumped 6.9 percent in
May, the first monthly drop in eight. On March 29, 2011, Currie
said commodities may rise more than estimated 14.3 percent in 12
months. Goldman in December closed its recommendations to buy
the June 2012 copper at a loss of $1,530 a metric ton and the
December 2012 zinc at $298 a ton. Only two out of seven
Goldman’s trading recommendations are currently making a profit.  Copper, Gold  Crude, gas, copper, aluminum and gold are the bank’s top
picks, according to the latest report. Copper stockpiles are
declining, especially in leading global consumer  China , and the
oil market is tightening, Currie wrote.  Still, Goldman Sachs lowered three-month price forecasts to
$8,000 a ton from $9,000 for copper and to $2,200 a ton from
$2,400 for aluminum, according to a separate report today.
Copper for three-month delivery gained 1.4 percent to $7,393.25
a ton by 3:20 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange and aluminum was
little changed at $1,974 a ton.  Speculators cut combined bullish bets across the S&P GSCI
index by 13 percent to this year’s lowest level in the week
ended June 5, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Hedge-fund bets on declines in copper futures are the highest
since March 2009, according to the CFTC.  “The financial participation in many markets is now below
what is consistent with the underlying market fundamentals,”
Currie wrote. “Physical deleveraging has been an ongoing
process, particularly in Europe since the fourth quarter of last
year, as funding costs remain high.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
