The financial crisis wiped out 18
years of gains for the median U.S. household net worth, with a
38.8 percent plunge from 2007 to 2010 that was led by the
collapse in  home prices , a Federal Reserve study showed.  Median net worth declined to $77,300 in 2010, the lowest
since 1992, from $126,400 in 2007, the Fed said in its  Survey of
Consumer Finances . Mean net worth fell 14.7 percent to a nine-
year low of $498,800 from $584,600, the central bank said
yesterday in Washington. Almost every demographic group
experienced losses, which may hurt retirement prospects for
middle-income families, Fed economists said in the report.  “The impact has been a massive destruction of wealth all
across the board,” said  Lance Roberts , who oversees $500
million as chief executive officer of Streettalk Advisors LLC in
Houston. “What you see is an economy that’s really very, very
stressed for the bottom 60 to 70 percent of the population
that’s struggling just to make ends meet.”  The declines in household wealth in the course of the
longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression have
held back the  consumer spending  that makes up about 70 percent
of the economy. Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  meet next week to consider whether the central bank
needs to add to its record stimulus after employment grew at the
slowest pace in a year in May.  Zero Rates  The Fed has already taken unprecedented steps to boost the
economy as it battled the 18-month recession that ended in June
2009, cutting its key  interest rate  almost to zero and
purchasing $2.3 trillion in debt to lower long-term borrowing
costs. Even so, the jobless rate has stayed above 8 percent
since February 2009, compared with the central bank’s long-range
goal of 4.9 percent to 6 percent.  “Although declines in the values of financial assets or
business were important factors for some families, the decreases
in median net worth appear to have been driven most strongly by
a broad collapse in  house prices ,” the Fed economists wrote.  The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. Home Price Index fell 23 percent
in the three years through December 2010. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  lost 14 percent in the same period.  The proportion of families with retirement accounts
decreased 2.6 points to 50.4 percent during the period, wiping
out much of the 3.1 percentage-point increase over the prior
three years, the report said.  Retirement Setback  “The most noticeable drops in ownership were among
families in the middle-income, middle-wealth, and middle-age
groups,” the economists said. “Retirement accounts had been
growing in importance as a supplement to Social Security and
other types of retirement income, and the decrease in ownership
in the past three years may represent a setback.”  Fed economists conduct the surveys every three years to
produce a snapshot of household balance sheets, pensions,
income, and demographics that’s more detailed than broader
reports about the economy. The surveys allow comparisons over
time, with a consistent methodology since 1989.  The U.S. added 69,000 jobs last month even as the Fed
maintained record stimulus. The economy grew more slowly in the
first quarter than previously estimated, expanding at a 1.9
percent annual rate, down from a 2.2 percent prior estimate.  Minutes of the last FOMC meeting April 24-25 showed policy
makers said a loss of momentum in growth or increased risks to
their economic outlook could warrant additional action to
preserve the recovery. Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet
June 19-20 in Washington.  Wealthiest Families  Declines in average income were greatest in the wealthiest
10 percent families and for higher education or wealth groups,
the survey showed. The housing slump and financial crisis also
boosted the dependence on wages as a percentile of net worth for
the wealthiest 10 percent.  The top 10 percent by wealth got 55.8 percent of their pre-
tax family income from wages in 2010, up from 46.2 percent in
2007, the survey found. The portion earned from  capital gains 
plunged to 2.3 percent from 14.4 percent.  Debt as a share of family assets rose to 16.4 percent from
14.8 percent as asset values declined, the Fed said. For those
households with debt in 2010, the median value of debt was
unchanged from 2007, while the share of families having debt
fell to about 75 percent from 77 percent. Debt payments more
than 60 days overdue were reported by 10.8 percent of families
in 2010, up from 7.1 percent in the prior survey.  Debt Burdens  “Measures of debt payments relative to income might have
been expected to increase,” Fed economists wrote. “In fact,
total payments relative to total income increased only slightly,
and the median of payments relative to income among families
with debt fell after having risen between 2004 and 2007. The
share of families with high payments relative to their incomes
also fell after rising substantially between 2001 and 2007.”  The survey was compiled by Fed economists Jesse Bricker,
Arthur Kennickell, Kevin Moore and John Sabelhaus in  Washington .
