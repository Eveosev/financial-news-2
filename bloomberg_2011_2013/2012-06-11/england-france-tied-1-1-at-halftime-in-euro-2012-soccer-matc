England and France are tied 1-1 at
halftime in their European Championship Group D soccer match
today in Donetsk, Ukraine.  Joleon Lescott gave England a 30th-minute lead at the
Donbass Arena, heading in from a Steven Gerrard freekick. Samir
Nasri leveled after 39 minutes, hitting a low shot past
goalkeeper  Joe Hart .   France, on a 21-match unbeaten run, is aiming for a record-
tying third European title and first since 2000. England has
never won the tournament, with its only international title
coming at the  World Cup  in 1966.  Co-host Ukraine plays Sweden in Kiev in todayâ€™s other game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
