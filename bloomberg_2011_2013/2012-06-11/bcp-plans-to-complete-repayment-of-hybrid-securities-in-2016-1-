Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  aims to
repay the Portuguese state by the end of 2016 for the 3 billion
euros ($3.8 billion) of hybrid securities it plans to buy from
the country’s second-biggest bank by market value.  It expects to start the repayment in 2014, Lisbon-based
Banco Comercial said today in a regulatory filing. The bank’s
shares gained 7 percent to 9 euro cents as of 9:41 a.m. in
Lisbon trading, paring this year’s decline to 35 percent.  The recapitalization plan and strategic program will
“reinforce its financial strength and recover profitability,
allowing the bank to repay ahead of schedule the public
investment and lay the foundation necessary to be prepared to
face future challenges,” the bank said in the statement.  Banco Comercial, which plans to continue focusing on
markets such as Poland, Mozambique and  Angola , while reducing
its exposure to  Greece , said on June 4 that the state will buy
the hybrid securities by the end of this month. The lender will
also sell 500 million euros of new shares in a third-quarter
sale underwritten by the Portuguese state at 4 cents each.  Portugal’s 78 billion-euro bailout plan earmarks as much as
12 billion euros to recapitalize its banks. Under the bailout’s
terms, Portuguese banks were required to have a 9 percent core
Tier 1 ratio at the end of last year and maintain that level
through June after government bond holdings are written down to
market prices. They must boost the ratio to 10 percent by the
end of 2012.  After the capital increase, Banco Comercial plans to reach
a core Tier 1 ratio of 9.6 percent at the end of June, following
European Banking Association rules, and 12.5 percent at the end
of December, according to Bank of  Portugal  rules. The bank had a
core Tier 1 ratio of 9.3 percent at the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
