Kuwait  Petroleum Corp. has set the
premium for a year’s supply of naphtha starting in August at $24
a metric ton to benchmark  Middle East  prices, higher than
April’s rate, according to two people with direct knowledge of
the talks with Asian buyers.  The company set the August premium for full-range naphtha
below the $28 a ton it offered last week during discussions in
 London , the people said, declining to be identified because the
talks were confidential. Nobody answered a telephone call to
KPC’s marketing department nor the general line in Kuwait.  The premium set for the August annual contract is $2 a ton
higher than the $22 a ton set for a year’s supply beginning in
April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
