The  yuan  strengthened after  China ’s
exports grew last month at more than double the pace analysts
estimated and  Spain  sought a bailout for its banks, helping
address  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Overseas sales  rose 15.3 percent from a year earlier, more
than triple April’s 4.9 percent gain and exceeding all 29
estimates in a Bloomberg survey, data showed yesterday.
Inflation eased to a two-year low of 3 percent, coming in below
the official 4 percent target for a fourth month, the government
reported June 9. Spain asked euro-region governments over the
weekend for as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to help
shore up its banking system.  “As inflation eases, China has more room to stimulate
domestic demand,” said Stella Lee, president of Success Futures
& Foreign Exchange Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “Export growth is a
positive surprise, while Spain’s bailout gives investors hope
that global governments are working together to tackle
problems.”  The yuan rose 0.02 percent to close at 6.3694 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.03 percent
stronger at 6.3169 today, 0.8 percent higher than last week’s
closing price.  Yuan Convertibility  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.05
percent to 6.3688. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed
0.16 percent to 6.4150, a 0.7 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate.  China should accelerate reforms to make the yuan
convertible under the nation’s capital account,  Shanghai 
Securities News reported today, citing Wang Xiaoyi, deputy head
of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.  The central bank lowered its one-year lending and deposit
rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.31
percent and 3.25 percent, respectively. It also allowed banks to
start offering deposit rates as much as 10 percent above the
official rate and doubled the maximum discount for loans to 20
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
