New York  Giants offensive tackle
David Diehl was arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated
after his vehicle hit two parked cars, New York City police
said.  Diehl , 31, who has played on two Super Bowl championship
teams with the Giants and won the Wellington Mara NFL Man of the
Year Award last month for his work with community youth groups,
drove his black BMW into two parked cars yesterday on 35th
Avenue near 31st Street in the Astoria section of the city’s
Queens borough, Gina Sarubbi, a police department spokeswoman,
said in a telephone interview.  The  New York Post  reported that Diehl had spent the evening
watching the European Soccer Championships at Scorpio’s, a
Queens bar. The newspaper said Diehl had a blood-alcohol level
of 0.18 on the Breathalyzer test, more than twice the .08 legal
limit. Sarubbi said she couldn’t confirm the Breathalyzer
reading.  Giants spokesman Peter John-Baptiste said the team was
still gathering the facts in the case and would have a statement
later. A call to Diehl’s Denver-based agent, Peter Schaffer,
wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
