Yemen cut the premium for its  Masila
blend crude  for delivery in August to 23 cents a barrel more
than the Dated Brent benchmark, the Arabian Peninsula state’s
oil marketing committee said.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., the
trader known as Unipec, was the highest bidder for the oil and
agreed to buy 2.95 million barrels of the 3.3 million offered,
Yemen said in an e-mailed statement today.  Yemen cut the premium used to determine the official
selling price of its crude from the level of $1.12 more than
Dated Brent set for July. It offered the remaining barrels of
Masila available for August at the price set today.  Marib Light crude  remained at parity to Dated Brent and
Yemen didn’t announce any quantities of the grade for sale. The
pipeline carrying crude from the central Marib province has
suffered several attacks and had been closed from October to May
because of sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
