Cheung Kong Center , where  Hong
Kong ’s richest man  Li Ka-shing  has his office, lifted access
restrictions after protesters left the premises.  Protesters, numbering as many as 70, strung banners and
chanted slogans demanding their money back on an investment
outside the entrances of the building in Hong Kong’s central
business district today. Some tried to enter the building
earlier. They left at about 6 p.m., according to a police
officer.  Barricades were erected outside some entrances, including
the driveway, during the day with security guards blocking
access. Police vehicles and policemen were seen patrolling the
building’s premises earlier in the day.  “We’re trying to gather here at  Cheung Kong  Center to
voice our anger” about the development of Guangzhou
International Toys & Gift Centre, said Anthony Mok, 59, one of
the protesters.  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. (1)  and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.,
controlled by Li, have a combined 60 percent stake in Guangzhou
International Toys & Gift Centre, a commercial development in
the southern Chinese province. Cheung Kong Center is owned by
Hutchison Whampoa.  Mok and other protesters said Cheung Kong and Hutchison
Whampoa have changed the development plans of the project, which
hurt their investments in it. Cheung Kong said in a statement
today that the “accusations are groundless.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
