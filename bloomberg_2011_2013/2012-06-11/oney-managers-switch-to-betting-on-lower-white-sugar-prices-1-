Money managers switched to betting
on lower prices for white sugar traded in  London  from wagering
on a gain, according to NYSE Liffe.  Net-short positions, or bets on a decline, came to 688
futures and options contracts in the week of May 5, the
Commitments of Traders report published on the exchangeâ€™s
website today showed. That compared with a net-long position of
39 lots a week earlier, according to the data. White, or
refined, sugar fell 0.5 percent in the week.  In robusta coffee, money managers lowered the net-long
position by 3.2 percent to 23,992 contracts from 24,774 futures
and options a week earlier. The beans slid 3.7 percent in the
period.  Cocoa money managers boosted their net-long position to
26,095 futures and options, an increase of 5.8 percent from the
week-earlier 24,675 contracts, the data showed. Cocoa fell 1.6
percent in the period.  Money managers were net-long in feed wheat by 103
contracts, according to the data. They held no positions a week
earlier. The grain fell 1.7 percent in the week.  NYSE Liffe is the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, the
