New York  University Professor
 Nouriel Roubini  said stopping support for Greece would cause the
euro zone to collapse,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  Pulling the plug on Greece would cause bank runs in Spain,
Portugal and Italy, the newspaper cited him as saying in a
preview of an article for tomorrowâ€™s edition.  Roubini added that keeping Greece in the common currency or
supporting its orderly exit would be cheaper for German tax
payers than letting the euro zone break down, Bild reported.  --. Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
