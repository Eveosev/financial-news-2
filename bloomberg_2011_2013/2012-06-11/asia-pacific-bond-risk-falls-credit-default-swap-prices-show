The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 10 basis points to 187 basis
points as of 8:45 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is on course for its biggest
daily decline since Nov. 30 and the lowest close since May 11,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 8 basis points to 184
basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark is poised for its largest daily decrease
since June 7 and its lowest closing level since May 3, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets in  Australia  are closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
