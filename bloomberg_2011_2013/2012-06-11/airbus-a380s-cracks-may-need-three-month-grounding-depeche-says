Airbus A380 superjumbos that suffer
from wing cracks need to be grounded for a total of two to three
months when airlines decide to fix them in several steps,  La
Depeche  reported, citing an Airbus executive it didnâ€™t name.  The repairs may last just 8 weeks when they are done if
airlines opt for a single fix, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
