What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the government said
66 percent of the crop was in good or excellent  condition  on
June 10, down from 72 percent a week earlier and the lowest
since 2008, Joe Vaclavik, the president of Standard Grain Inc.
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT after a U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed
that dry, warm weather reduced  crop  conditions by more than
expected, Vaclavik said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after spring- wheat  conditions unexpectedly fell
in the northern U.S. last week, Vaclavik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
