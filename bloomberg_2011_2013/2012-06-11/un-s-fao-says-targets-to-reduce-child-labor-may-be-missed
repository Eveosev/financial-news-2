International targets to eliminate
the worst forms of child labor will be missed unless countries
step up efforts to reduce unpaid work by children in farming,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  About 130 million child laborers between the ages of five
and 17 work in agriculture, or 60 percent of the world’s
underage workers, the Rome-based agency wrote in a  statement  on
its website today.  Governments, worker and employer organizations agreed in
2006 to get rid of the worst forms of child labor by 2016,
according to the FAO. Examples of hazardous work by children in
farming include working in fields treated with pesticides and
carrying heavy loads, it said.  “Child labor is a human-rights abuse and is an obstacle to
sustainable development of agriculture and food security,”
Jose Graziano da Silva, FAO director-general, was cited as
saying in the statement.  Action on child labor is often focused on international
markets and commodities for export such as cocoa and cotton,
while the majority of child workers in agriculture are on small-
scale family farms, the FAO wrote.  “Work that harms children’s health and development can
have long-lasting effects into adulthood, and child labor has
been repeatedly shown to have a negative effect on eduction,”
Graziano da Silva said. “It is our joint responsibility to
support poor rural families so children can go to school
instead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
