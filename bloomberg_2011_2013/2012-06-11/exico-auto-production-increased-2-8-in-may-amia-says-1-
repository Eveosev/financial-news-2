Mexico ’s production and exports of
cars and light trucks both rose to record highs for the first
five months of the year, the nation’s Automobile Industry
Association, known as AMIA, reported.  From January to May the country produced 1.15 million
units, 12.5 percent more than the year-earlier period and the
highest of any first five months, the group said in a statement
distributed in Mexico City today. Mexico exported 945,530 over
the same time, an increase of 13.7 percent over a year ago, AMIA
said. Mexico’s auto industry had broken its output record last
year.  “We are repeating once again record figures for production
and exports,” said Eduardo Solis, president of AMIA. “We’ve
been diversifying our markets.”  Mexico auto production rose 2.8 percent to 228,048 units in
May from the year-earlier period, AMIA said. Exports of vehicles
climbed 5.7 percent to 187,042 units over the same period, the
group said in a statement distributed in Mexico City today.  Domestic sales rose 17 percent after reaching 80,267 units
last month, compared with 68,634 units same month last year,
according to the nation’s car dealership association, or AMDA,
in a separate report issued at the same event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
