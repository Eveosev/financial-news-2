Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  will suspend
operations at the Marikana mine it operates with  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  at the end of this month, Business Day said,
citing a notice the company issued to workers.  It is not clear what will happen to the 1,500 workers at
the mine, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. Aquarius will
make a statement today, Business Day cited Anglo American
Platinum as saying, adding that Aquarius could not be reached
