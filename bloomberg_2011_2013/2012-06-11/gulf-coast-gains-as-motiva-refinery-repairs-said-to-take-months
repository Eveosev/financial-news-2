Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened as
Motiva Enterprises LLC was said to be shutting a new crude unit
for as long as five months at the  Port Arthur , Texas, refinery,
for repairs.  The refinery is assessing damage to the 325,000-barrel-a-
day unit, a person with knowledge of operations said. The
startup was abandoned over the weekend after the crude unit
developed leaks, cracks in pipes, and a fire in a heater,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
he’s not authorized to speak for the company.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2 cents to 10 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:53 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Motiva crude unit, shut since June 3, is part of a $10
billion expansion that pushed the Texas refinery’s capacity to
close to 600,000 barrels a day of crude, making it the largest
in the U.S.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Corpus Christi West refinery in Texas
was flaring gases because of maintenance in a hydrocracker,
according to a filing with state regulators.  The emissions at the plant occurred because of a small leak
in an LPG line to the hydrocracker,  Bill Day , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail statement. “There was no material
impact to production.”  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New York Harbor held at
a discount of 1.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
