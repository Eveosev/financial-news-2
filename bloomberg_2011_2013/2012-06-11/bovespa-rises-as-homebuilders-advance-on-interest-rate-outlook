The Bovespa index fell, snapping a
two-day advance, as lower  oil prices  pushed producer  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  down amid concern a bailout for Spain’s banks
won’t be enough to stop Europe’s crisis from worsening.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, and  OGX
Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA contributed the most to the
benchmark’s drop.  Tam SA (TAMM4) , Brazil’s biggest airline by market
value, fell to a two-week low as a deadline loomed to tender
shares for a swap that is part of its combination with Chile’s
 Lan Airlines SA. (LFL)   The Bovespa slid 0.8 percent to 54,001.44 at the close in
Sao Paulo. The gauge earlier rose as much as 1.8 percent after
Spain asked euro-region governments for as much as 100 billion
euros ($125 billion) to help shore up its banking system. Forty
stocks fell on the benchmark today while 28 advanced. The real
weakened 1.8 percent to 2.0604 per  U.S. dollar  at 5:42 p.m.
local time.  “It’s good news if  Spain  manages to avoid a banking
crisis, but the fact that the country’s banks need that much
money to keep their heads above water shows how bad things are
in the region,”  Felipe Casotti , who helps manage 800 million
reais ($390 million) at Maxima Asset Management, said by phone
from Rio de Janeiro. “Besides, avoiding a collapse in the
financial system is just one of the many challenges Europe
faces.”  Petrobras fell 2.6 percent to 18.39 reais. OGX tumbled 7.4
percent to 9.39 reais. Crude for June delivery dropped 1.7
percent in New York, reversing an earlier gain of 3 percent.  Growth Outlook  Some companies that sell in the local market declined as
economists covering Brazil lowered their growth forecasts for a
fifth week. Retailer  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  fell 1.1 percent to 41.74
reais.  Cia. de Bebidas  das Americas, Latin America’s largest
brewer, dropped 0.9 percent to 73.82 reais. Clothing retailer
Cia. Hering slid 1.1 percent to 41.74 reais.  “The outlook for growth in Brazil is not very bright,”
Roberto Sevalli, a director at JMalucelli Investimentos in
Curitiba, Brazil, said in a phone interview. “The government is
trying to boost the recovery with some tax cuts and other
stimulus measures, but I think it’s a bit too late to avoid a
steeper slowdown. Those bad signs about economic activity help
to push the Bovespa lower.”  Latin America’s largest economy will expand 2.53 percent
this year, according to the median estimate in a central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today. A week earlier,
analysts expected an expansion of 2.72 percent. Record low
interest rates, tax breaks for companies and consumers and
measures to boost credit won’t prevent growth from slowing in
2012, the survey shows. Last year,  Brazil  expanded 2.73 percent,
its second-worst performance since 2003.  Tam Drops  Tam fell 2.1 percent to 41.51 reais. Lan’s offer to swap
shares in the Brazilian carrier that will later be merged into a
company to be called Latam Airlines SA ends today. Any
acquisitions of stock today won’t settle in time to make it into
the swap, Cristian Jadue, an analyst at Banco Santander SA, said
today from Santiago, Chile.  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  on May 17 after tumbling
21 percent from this year’s high on March 13 through that day.
The gauge trades at 9.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates for
the next four quarters, which compares with the 9.9 ratio for
MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 5.5 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo 
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.2 billion reais this year through June 8,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
