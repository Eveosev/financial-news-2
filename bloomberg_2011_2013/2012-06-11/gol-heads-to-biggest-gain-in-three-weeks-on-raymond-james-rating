Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
the second-biggest Brazilian airline, headed for the steepest
gain in three weeks after analysts at Raymond James Financial
Inc. recommended buying the shares because of lower fuel prices.  Gol advanced 2.3 percent to 8.10 reais at 1:43 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, the most on a closing basis since May 18. It was the
fifth-best performer on the benchmark Bovespa index, which rose
0.3 percent.  “We are lowering our fuel price assumptions substantially,
which causes our earnings estimate to move meaningfully higher,
as fuel costs account for 38 percent of non-regional carriers’
total operating expenses on average,” Raymond James analysts
James Parker, Savanthi Syth and Krisztina Katai wrote in a note
to clients dated June 8. They raised their recommendation on the
stock to the equivalent of buy from neutral.  Gol has lost 35 percent this year, while the Bovespa
declined 3.8 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
