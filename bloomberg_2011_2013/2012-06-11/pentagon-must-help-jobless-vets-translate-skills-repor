The Pentagon and Labor Department
must become “more adept” at translating military experience
into marketable skills to help veterans find work, according to
a report by a Washington-based research group.  The Center for a New American Security said many civilian
employers continue to struggle to understand how veterans’
military experience would equip them for private-sector work.  About 12.7 percent of veterans who served in the military
since 2001 were unemployed last month, compared with a  jobless
rate  of 7.7 percent for all non-veterans. The nation’s total
unemployment rate was 8.2 percent.  In the report issued today, the center urged federal
agencies to seek public-private partnerships with U.S. companies
and nonprofit groups that specialize in veterans issues to help
smooth the transition from military service to private
employment.  It also urged the Defense Department to improve its
Transition Assistance Program, which is offered to service
members as they leave the military.  The report was based on interviews with 87 representatives
from 69 companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
