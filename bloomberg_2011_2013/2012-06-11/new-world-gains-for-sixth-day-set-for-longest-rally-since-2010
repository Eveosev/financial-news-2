New World Resources Plc (NWR)  gained for a
sixth day, headed for its longest stretch of gains in almost 18
months, after  Spain  requested a bailout for its banks and
Chinese exports beat estimates, boosting demand for commodities.  The biggest Czech coking coal producer advanced 1.7 percent
to 103.7 koruna by 9:44 a.m. in Prague. NWR had the longest
winning stretch since the six-day rally ended Dec. 22, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
