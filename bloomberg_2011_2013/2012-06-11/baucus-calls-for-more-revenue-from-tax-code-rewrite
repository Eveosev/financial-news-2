The U.S. should raise more money to
help reduce the federal  budget deficit  through an overhaul of
the tax code, said Senator  Max Baucus , chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee.  Jobs, innovation, competitiveness and opportunity should be
four principles that govern the tax code, he said today in a
speech at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.  “Our tax code is growing out of control,” said Baucus,
70, a Montana Democrat. “It’s time we had a tax code for the
21st century.”  Unless Congress acts, tax rates on wages, capital gains,
dividends and estates will increase at the end of the year as
tax cuts expire. The tax increases are part of a so-called
fiscal cliff that includes automatic spending cuts and could
push the U.S. into recession if Congress does nothing, according
to the  Congressional Budget Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
