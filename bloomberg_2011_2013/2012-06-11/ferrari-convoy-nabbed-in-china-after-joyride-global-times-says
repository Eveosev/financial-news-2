Chinese police suspended the
licenses of five Ferrari drivers who were caught speeding along
a highway together as fast as 213 kilometers (132 miles) per
hour, the state-run Global Times  reported today .  The five were all clocked going more than 150 kilometers
per hour along the highway in southern  China ’s Zhejiang
Province, the newspaper said, citing regional police it didn’t
identify. They were part of a group of at least 14 Ferrari SpA
vehicles that were traveling together to a nearby lake, the
English-language newspaper reported.  Police in the region had known for some time that there was
a group of Ferrari drivers who travel at high speeds on the
highway and decided to stop them at a toll booth after traffic
monitors detected them June 9, the newspaper said. Six got
through the toll booth before police arrived and the other eight
were caught, it said.  Three drivers were fined 200  yuan  ($31) for going above the
speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour and slower than 150
kilometers per hour. The driver who was clocked going the
fastest told police the main group of Ferraris had left him
behind and he was trying to catch up, the Global Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
