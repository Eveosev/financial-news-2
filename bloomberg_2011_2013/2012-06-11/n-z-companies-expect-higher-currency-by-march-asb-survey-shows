New Zealand  export and import
companies expect the nation’s currency will be higher by March
after a slight decline this year, according to a new survey by
ASB Bank Ltd.  New Zealand’s dollar will buy 77.1 U.S. cents in late
December then rise to about 80 U.S. cents three months later,
according to the weighted average forecasts of 350 companies
that were surveyed mid-May, Auckland-based ASB said in an e-
mailed statement. The currency bought 77.7 U.S. cents as at 5:20
p.m. in Wellington yesterday.  ASB forecasts the currency will rise to 83 cents by the end
of 2012 and hold at that level through March 31, it said in the
statement. The survey will be published quarterly, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
