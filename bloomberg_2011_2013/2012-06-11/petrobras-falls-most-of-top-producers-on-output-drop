Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, fell the most among the world’s
10 largest oil companies by market value after reporting that
output declined to a 20-month low.  The Rio de Janeiro-based producer dropped 2.6 percent to
18.39, the lowest close since May 30. Exxon Mobil Corp., the
world’s top oil producer, fell 0.7 percent, while second-largest
 Petrochina Co. (857)  climbed 2.6 percent.  Petrobras has failed to increase oil production at new
projects fast enough to compensate for declining output at older
fields, Lucas Brendler, who helps manage about 7 billion reais
($3.4 billion) of stocks at Banco Geracao Futuro de
Investimentos, said.  “The production numbers are very bad,” Brendler said by
telephone. “Petrobras is producing below the numbers the market
was expecting.”  April output fell to the lowest since October 2010, the
company said on June 8 after markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
