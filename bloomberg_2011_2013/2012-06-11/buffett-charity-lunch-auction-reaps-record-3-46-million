Warren Buffett ’s annual lunch
auction had less than a minute to go and still wasn’t halfway to
last year’s record of more than $2.6 million.  Then bidding almost tripled from $1.23 million seconds from
the end of the weeklong auction on June 8, as Buffett’s event
set a record for a third straight year with the total in seven
consecutive numbers: $3,456,789. In San Francisco, the Rev.
Cecil Williams of the Glide Foundation, the beneficiary,
rejoiced with about 500 people. Screams drowned out the clinking
of flutes filled with Champagne or cider.  “We just had a most amazing, shocking experience occur in
our great city,” Williams, 82, said later that night in a
statement. “I am extremely grateful to my friend Warren Buffett
for his exceptional commitment.”  The annual auction on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s website attracted 106
bids. The winner, who wasn’t identified, and seven companions
get to dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in
 New York .  The event has brought in more than $14.6 million in the
past 13 years for Glide, which serves meals to the needy and
runs a church in San Francisco’s  blighted  Tenderloin district.
Last year’s record take was $2.63 million.  “You change lives,” said Buffett, 81, addressing Glide
workers, volunteers and donors in a video played at the
gathering before the bidding ended. “I congratulate you.”  Buffett and Williams were introduced by the billionaire’s
late first wife, Susan. Williams had joined the Glide Memorial
Church as a minister in  1963  and along with volunteers
transformed the congregation.  A Proven Process  “They felt that every human being had a potential, no
matter what their circumstances,” Buffett said in a video
posted on the auction website. “This is a proven process, that
a combination of love and time and energy and resources can
produce a different human being.”  Glide, which is known for its music-filled Sunday service,
served about 1 million  meals  to the poor last year. It also
provides  health services .  “He has been here just once from what I know but he
digested it,” Williams said of Buffett, in an interview.  Buffett is chairman and chief executive officer of Omaha,
Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  He earned his fortune and
reputation investing in out-of-favor stocks, transforming the
firm from a failing textile mill into a $200 billion seller of
insurance, energy and freight hauling. He has pledged almost all
of his wealth to charity.  Susan Buffett , who died in 2004, was a
volunteer for Glide.  Compounding Machine  “She liked the idea of giving away, we both agreed on
giving away all the money,” Buffett said June 5 at an event in
 Washington . “She would have liked the idea of giving away more
of it earlier and I felt that I was going to be a better
compounding machine than most places and that there would be a
whole lot more to give away later on.”  Past auction winners include hedge fund managers David Einhorn and Ted Weschler, who subsequently was hired by Buffett
after his record-setting bids in 2010 and 2011.  Lunch With Warren Buffett Results:  Year  Winner                                        Winning Bid
