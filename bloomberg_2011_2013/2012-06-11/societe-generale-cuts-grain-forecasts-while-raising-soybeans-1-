Society Generale SA reduced its corn
and wheat price forecasts on speculation that a slower global
economy will curb demand for food,  animal feed  and fuel made
from the crops. The soybean outlook was raised.  Wheat prices may average $7.25 a bushel in the third
quarter, down from $7.80 a bushel forecast earlier while corn
prices may average $6.20 a bushel, down from a previous estimate
of $6.50 a bushel, the bank said in a report e-mailed today.
Soybean prices may rise to $14.85 a bushel, compared with $14.40
a bushel that was expected.  Ample inventories of ethanol may lead to moderating corn
demand, according to the report. Still, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s forecast for record yields of 166 bushels per acre
may be “too optimistic” if temperatures are above normal this
summer. The bank recommends buying December corn on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. The contract traded at $5.39 a bushel today.  Dry weather also may damage wheat crops in the U.S. and
eastern  Europe , Christopher Narayanan, the head of agricultural
research in  New York , wrote in the report. The bank recommended
investors buy September wheat futures in Chicago, which traded
at $6.5425 today.  U.S soybean exports “show continued strength,” and
inventories may remain below 200 million bushels unless farmers
stage “a significant increase in plantings,” Narayanan wrote.
November-delivery soybeans, the most-active contract, traded at
$13.30 a bushel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
