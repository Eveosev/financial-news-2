The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
rose 1 percent to 33,998 by 10 a.m. in Johannesburg, after
climbing 1.7 percent last week.  The following are among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up more than 7 percent of the index, jumped 1.9 percent to
276.05 rand. Copper advanced the most in more than four months
as  China ’s imports, the world’s biggest consumer, surged 12
percent in May and  Spain ’s bailout request boosted the euro to a
two-week high against the dollar.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest resources
company, gained 2.2 percent to 235 rand.  Ansys Ltd. (ANS)  , a designer of transport and defense-
monitoring systems, headed for its biggest decline in more than
three months, dropping 7.9 percent to 34 cents. The company said
Alan Holloway resigned as chief executive officer from June 30
to head a company that will acquire Ansys’ telecommunications
business.  First Uranium Corp. (FIU)  , a uranium and gold producer,
climbed for a third day, jumping 6.5 percent to 1.48 rand. South
African investor Mandla “Bear” Kumalo said he offered to buy a
26 percent stake to block the sale of an operation to Gold One
International Ltd.  Pallinghurst Resources Ltd. (PGL)  , declined to the
lowest in almost three weeks, dropping 2.4 percent to 2.83 rand.
The company plans to raise 800 million rand ($96 million)
through a rights offer to participate in a capital raising by
Faberge and fund a new copper investment, it said in a statement
today.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
