A record pace of coal exports is
helping U.S. producers bear the brunt of lower demand caused by
cheap natural gas and regulatory pressure,  Raymond James  &
Associates said.  Coal exports in April touched a record 12.5 million tons
and are on pace for 150 million this year, Raymond James said.
That would be about 40 percent higher than the 107 million
exported in 2011, the most since 1991, according to Energy
Department  data .  Natural gas has fallen 25 percent this year to $2.256 per
million British thermal units as of 10:21 a.m. today on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, making the fuel more attractive for
utilities to use it over coal to generate electricity. At the
same time, Environmental Protection Agency regulations have made
burning coal more challenging.  “Over the long haul, we suspect access to what should be a
growing global seaborne coal trade will undoubtedly be
beneficial to helping to offset some of the weakness in domestic
demand caused by weak natural gas and/or regulatory
challenges,”  James Rollyson  and David Feaster Jr., analysts at
Raymond James in Houston, wrote in the report.  Coal on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 8 cents to
$54.15 a ton on June 8, the lowest price since March 15, 2010.
Prices have tumbled 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
