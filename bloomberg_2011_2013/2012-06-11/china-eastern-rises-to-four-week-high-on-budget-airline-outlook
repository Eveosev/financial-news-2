China Eastern  Airlines Corp. climbed
to a four-week high in  New York  as the country’s second-largest
carrier by passengers said its budget joint-venture with  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN)  will begin flights in the first half of 2013.  American depositary shares of China Eastern gained 0.7
percent to $15.45, its highest price since May 16.  The low-cost airline, Jetstar Hong Kong, is expected to
obtain a license in late 2012 and begin operations in the first
half of next year, said China Eastern Chairman Liu Shaoyong in
Beijing. The Shanghai-based company, he added, expects to lower
its debt through measures including a capital infusion from the
government.  “This joint venture can take advantage of the increasing
demand for air transportation addressing a segment of the market
that would be attracted to a carrier offering more affordable
travel costs,” Kevin Pollack, a  fund manager  at Paragon Capital
LP in New York, said in an e-mail. “There is very limited
competition in this space and being one of the earlier entrants
could prove to be a huge advantage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
