The split-up of WestLB AG is being
jeopardized after additional risks were discovered at the
lender’s Verbundbank unit, Handelsblatt reported, citing
unidentified people in the financial industry.  Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, which plans to take over the
unit, isn’t ready to assume liability for a 4.2 billion euros
($5.3 billion) derivatives package with a negative value of 300
million euros that was discovered in Verbundbank’s portfolio,
the newspaper said.  WestLB’s owners and Helaba are scheduled to meet tomorrow
to seek a solution on the issue, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
