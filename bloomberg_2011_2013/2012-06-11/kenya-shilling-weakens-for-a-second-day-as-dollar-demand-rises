Kenya’s shilling weakened for a
second day as businesses bought dollars in anticipation of a
further depreciation in the currency of  East Africa ’s biggest
economy.  The shilling declined 0.7 percent to 85.30 per dollar by
4:20 p.m. in Nairobi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to accumulation of
dollars by businesses as they anticipate the shilling to weaken
further in the coming days,” Raphael Agung, a currency dealer
at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview. “Businesses are taking advantage of the recent
consolidation to buy dollars at favorable rates,” Agung said.  The shilling rallied for a sixth day to 84.6 on June 7,
gaining 1.1 percent, the most since December. The central bank
in Kenya retained its benchmark rate at a record-high of 18
percent in its monetary policy committee meeting June 5, holding
it for a sixth month. “The  Kenya  Shilling remains vulnerable to
external shocks due to the current-account deficit, estimated at
11.4 percent of GDP in April 2012 and the instability in the
eurozone,” the bank said in the statement on June 5.  Kenya accepted 5.4 billion shillings in seven-day
repurchase agreement at a weighted average rate of 17.3 percent,
a central bank official who declined to be named in line with
policy said by phone from the capital, Nairobi. The bank
received bids totaling 5.85 billion shillings for the
securities, the official said.  The central bank introduced “longer tenor Term Auction
Deposits as an additional instrument for liquidity management,”
it said in its monetary policy committee statement June 5. It
accepted all of 4.6 billion shillings in bids for TADs maturing
in 14, 21 and 28 days at a rate of 18 percent.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.6 percent to 1,578.07 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling weakened by less than 0.1
percent to 2,486.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
