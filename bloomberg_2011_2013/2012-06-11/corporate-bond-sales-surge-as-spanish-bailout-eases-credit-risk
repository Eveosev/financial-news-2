The short-lived rally in European
credit that followed news of the 100 billion-euro ($125 billion)
bailout for Spanish banks was enough to trigger the busiest day
for corporate bond sales since February.  General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of the U.S.
conglomerate, together with phone operators  France Telecom SA (FTE) ,
and Milan-based  Telecom Italia (TIT)  SpA were among borrowers taking
advantage of a boost in investor sentiment. Poland sold its
first euro-denominated bond in five months, while the  European
Investment Bank  and lenders in the haven countries of Sweden,
Norway and Germany also took the opportunity to raise money.  Spain  became the fourth euro member to seek a bailout since
the crisis began almost three years, spurring a rally that has
since fizzled out. Stocks in Europe erased earlier gains and the
cost of insuring against a Spanish default reversed the biggest
drop this year.  “A lot of issuers were forced onto the sidelines during
April and May as the euro crisis deepened,” said Robin Marshall, director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson
Investment Management Ltd. in  London , which manages about $18
billion. “One of the lessons of the euro debt crisis has been
that these relief rallies can turn to dust pretty quickly.”  GE Sale  GE Capital  issued 1.25 billion euros of 2.875 percent bonds
due June 2019, according to a banker involved in the deal.
 France Telecom , the country’s largest phone company, sold 1
billion euros of 10-year notes, while Telecom Italia offered 1.5
billion euros of bonds due in June 2015 and December 2018.  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish sovereign bonds fell
as much as 30 basis points, the most since Dec. 5, before
climbing seven basis points to 594 as of 4:20 p.m. in London.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments declined as much as 10.5 basis
points to 311, the lowest since May 29, before rising 2.5 basis
points to 322.5. A decline signals an improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Spanish bonds fell, pushing  10-year yields  up 30 basis
points to 6.52 percent. The government asked for 2.7 times the
funds deemed necessary by the  International Monetary Fund  to
rescue its banks amid concern about bad assets and public
finances.  Financial Yields  Yields on non-financial debt in Europe held at 2.6 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data, which
tracks rates back to 1998. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of
credit-default swaps linked to the senior debt of 25 European
banks and insurers rose seven basis points to 286, reversing an
earlier decline.  Poland raised 1.5 billion euros from its sale of securities
due in 2023, while the Luxembourg-based EIB added 350 million
euros to its existing 2.625 percent bonds due in March 2020,
bankers familiar with the transactions said.  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA)  in  Stockholm  sold 1.25 billion of
senior, unsecured bonds due in 2018. DNB Boligkreditt AS,
Norway’s biggest bank, issued 1.5 billion euros of seven-year
covered bonds, while Deutsche Hypothekenbank AG raised 500
million euros from its sale of the asset-backed notes.
Volkswagen Leasing GmbH sold 1 billion euros of bonds due
September 2015.  Junk Risk  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of default swaps on 50
companies with mostly high-yield ratings rose one basis point to
697. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed two basis points to 178.5.  Swaps on  Italy , whose bond yields were dragged higher as
the crisis spread, rose eight basis points to 551, Bloomberg
data show. The price earlier dropped to the lowest this month.  Contracts on Ireland, which requested a bailout in November
2010, declined 10 basis points to 673, while  Portugal , which
asked for a rescue in April 2011, fell the equivalent of 54
basis points to 1,055. Swaps on  Greece  were settled this year
after the government restructured its debt.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  “The half-life of bail-outs has got increasingly shorter
over the last couple of years,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a note to
investors. “That we have some action is a positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
