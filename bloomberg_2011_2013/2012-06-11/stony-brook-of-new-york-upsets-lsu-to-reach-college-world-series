     June 11 (Bloomberg) --  Stony Brook University  of  New York 
beat six-time national champion Louisiana State to reach
baseball’s College World Series for the first time in school
history.  Sophomore pitcher Frankie Vanderka allowed two runs over
nine innings yesterday as Stony Brook  won 7-2  in the decisive
third game of their best-of-three super regional in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. The victory came one day after the Seawolves beat LSU
3-1 to avenge a 5-4 Game 1 loss.  Stony Brook, which is on the north shore of Long Island
approximately 60 miles east of New York City, was the fourth
seed out of four teams in its regional and eliminated Miami,
Central  Florida  and Missouri State to earn a spot against LSU.  The Seawolves (52-13) are the second fourth seed to reach
the College World Series, joining Fresno State, which in 2008
won the National Collegiate Athletic Association title.  Leadoff hitter Travis Jankowski had four hits for  Stony
Brook , which scored six runs over the first four innings last
night in winning for the 28th time in its past 30 games. The
school competed at the Division III level before moving up to
Division I, the NCAA’s highest level, in 1999.  The University of  Arizona , UCLA, Florida and Florida State
have also advanced to the eight-team College World Series, which
is held in Omaha,  Nebraska , from June 15-26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
