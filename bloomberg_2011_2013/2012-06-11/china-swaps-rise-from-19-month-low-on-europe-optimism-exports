China’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
rebounded from their lowest levels in 19 months after Europe
made progress in tackling its debt crisis and local data showed
exports beat estimates.  Yuan-denominated  government bonds  fell after  Spain  asked
euro-region governments over the weekend for as much as 100
billion euros ($126 billion) to help shore up its banking system.
Asian stocks climbed after China’s exports grew 15.3 percent
last month, more than double the pace analysts forecast.  “Today’s slight increase in interest-rate swaps may just
be due to better  market sentiment  after Spain sought help,”
said  Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong
Kong . “The Chinese data wasn’t as bad as what had been feared.
There seems to be not much downside in the swaps in the near
term.”  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, increased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 2.46 percent in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate touched 2.30 percent on
June 8, the lowest since October 2010.  Interest-rate swaps concluded a fifth straight week of
losses on June 8 as the People’s Bank of China lowered its one-
year lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage
point to 6.31 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively. The
central bank also allowed banks to start offering deposit rates
by as much as 10 percent above the official rate and doubled the
maximum discount for loans to 20 percent.  New Lending  Local-currency loans were 793.2 billion yuan ($125 billion),
the People’s Bank of China said on its website today. That
compared with the 700 billion  yuan  median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists and 681.8 billion yuan in
April. M2 money supply grew 13.2 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with an estimate of 12.9 percent.  The monetary authority didn’t gauge demand for bill sales
this week, suggesting it won’t drain cash from the system,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, declined four basis points
to 2.42 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The yield on the government’s
3.51 percent bonds due February 2022 increased five basis points
to 3.35 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
