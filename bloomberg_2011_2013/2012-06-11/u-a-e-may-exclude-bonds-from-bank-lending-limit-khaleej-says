The United Arab Emirates’ central
bank may exclude bonds from a limit imposed on banks’ lending to
local governments and related entities,  Al Khaleej  reported,
citing people it didn’t identify.  Such lending mustn’t exceed 100 percent of banks’ capital,
the central bank said on April 4. There was no limit under
previous rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
