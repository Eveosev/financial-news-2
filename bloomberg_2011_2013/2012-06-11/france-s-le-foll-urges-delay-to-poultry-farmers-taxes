French Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll asked the budget ministry and social-security
authorities to delay taxation of poultry farmers affected by the
financial difficulties of chicken producer Doux SA.  Le Foll met with a poultry-industry  task force  today to
discuss the situation of farmers and farms, after meeting with
representatives for Doux’s 4,000 workers last week, the
 Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  Doux, Europe’s largest chicken producer, was placed under
court administration on June 1 by the court of Quimper in
Brittany, according to the ministry.  France  is the European
Union’s second-largest poultry exporter after the Netherlands,
according to International Trade Centre data.  “I’m thinking especially of the employees who are living
in an uncertain situation,” Le Foll was cited as saying.  Le Foll asked for farmers’ taxation and social-security
contributions to be deferred, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
