World hunger is expected to decline
this year as food prices fall due to good harvests and increased
stockpiles, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization
said.  The food security situation in the Sahel and Horn of Africa
regions is still critical, the Rome-based FAO said today in a
statement on its website.  The FAO’s  index  of global food prices had its biggest drop
in two years in May as the cost of dairy products slumped on
increased supply. Grain and sugar prices also declined. About
925 million people suffered from chronic hunger in 2010,
according to the FAO’s most recent estimate.  “We should expect a reduction of the number of hungry
people in the world in 2012,” FAO Director General Jose Graziano da Silva was cited as saying.  Graziano da Silva today asked the FAO’s governing council
to approve reforms at the UN agency. Proposed measures include
transferring many services and staff from the headquarters in
 Rome  to country offices to be closer to issues of
underdevelopment and hunger, the FAO wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
