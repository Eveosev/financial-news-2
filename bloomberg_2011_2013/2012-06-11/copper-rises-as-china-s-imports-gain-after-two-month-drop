Copper futures rose for the first
time in three sessions as imports increased in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.  Shipments jumped 12 percent in May from April, the first
increase in three months, Chinese government data showed
yesterday.  Spain  sought as much as 100 billion euros ($125
billion) following weeks of escalating concern that bad loans at
the country’s banks might overwhelm public finances.  “Any positive data out of China is going to help drive
metals prices higher,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “If Spain
gets help, it’s going to help put people’s minds at ease” on
the outlook for European economies, he said.  Copper futures for July delivery advanced 1.8 percent to
settle at $3.343 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The metal has fallen 13 percent this quarter on concern that
easing growth in China and faltering economies in Europe will
pinch demand.  Concern that a Greek exit from the euro will roil financial
markets may limit price gains, Zeman said.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months increased 1.7 percent to $7,420 a metric ton ($3.37 a
pound)  Zinc, nickel and lead advanced in London. Aluminum and tin
fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
