Ethanol futures fell the most in
more than a week in Chicago on concern that the  European debt
crisis  will curtail commodity demand.  Prices slumped after Spain asked euro-region governments
for as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to help support
its banking system. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is
blended with gasoline to stretch supply. The U.S.  exports  the
fuel to European nations such as the U.K.,  Finland , Germany and
the Netherlands, according to the Energy Department.  “They’re just throwing money at a dead horse,” said  Dan Flynn , an energy and grains trader at the Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “That kind of broke the back of the energies and the
grains. It’s looking negative.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.061 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest one-day decline since June 1. Prices have
fallen 6.4 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in New York slipped 2
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.08 a gallon and on the West Coast the
additive sank 2 cents to $2.17, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 1.5 cents to $2.08 a
gallon and in Chicago the biofuel decreased 2 cents to $2.01.  To contact the reporter on this story:
