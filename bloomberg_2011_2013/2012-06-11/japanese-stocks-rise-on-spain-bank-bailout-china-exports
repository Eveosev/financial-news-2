Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping the biggest gain
since April, on speculation a bailout for Spanish banks will
ease  Europe ’s debt crisis and after China’s trade grew more than
expected.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
revenue in Europe, advanced 3.5 percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a
manufacturer of robotics controls for Chinese factories, rose
2.1 percent.  Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s largest maker of liquid-
crystal displays, gained 8.2 percent after saying Foxconn
Technology Group will start buying its panels earlier than
expected as part of a revival plan.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 2 percent to 8,624.90 at
the close, the biggest increase since April 18. The gauge rose
0.2 percent last week, snapping a nine-week loss. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index gained 1.7 percent to 730.07, with all but two 33 of
its industry groups climbing.  “The bailout will keep companies that borrow from Spanish
banks from going down all together,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $70 billion. “In  China ,
overseas demand is stronger than expected, while domestic demand
continues to slow. That makes it easy to do more monetary easing
because it has a direct impact on domestic demand.”  The Topix fell 16 percent from this year’s high on March 27
amid concern the European crisis is deepening and as growth in
China slows. Shares on the measure are valued at 0.86 times book
value. A number below one means a company can be bought for less
than the value of its assets.  ‘Market Oblivious’  “The market has been oblivious to valuations because
having equities itself is considered risky amid uncertain
external factors,” said Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based
executive portfolio manager at DIAM Co., which manages about
$126 billion. “Once people step back and retain a peace of mind,
they will look for buying opportunities.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  advanced 0.8 percent on
June 8. Futures on the gauge climbed 1.4 percent today after
 Spain  over the weekend asked euro-zone governments for as much
as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) to rescue its banking system.
Spain became the fourth nation to seek a bailout after  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal . Greek voters on June 17 will decide
whether to observe requirements for another rescue.  Spain Rescue  “It’s crucial for Spain’s financial system to stabilize
because its economy is much bigger than Greece,” Takeuchi at
Diam said. “The bailout is bringing an issue to the end. It’s
positive for equities.”  Exporters to Europe and banks advanced. Canon added 3.5
percent to 3,240 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 1.2 percent to 351 yen.  Companies linked to China gained after the government
yesterday reported imports rose 12.7 percent in May and exports
advanced 15.3 percent, topping estimates.  Another report showed inflation in China rose the least in
two years last month and industrial output and retail sales
missed estimates. The data adds pressure for more stimulus after
the People’s Bank of China on June 7 reduced key  interest rates 
for the first time since 2008 to bolster slowing growth.  Fanuc gained 2.1 percent to 13,700 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a maker
of electronics components that gets 30 percent of its sales in
China, rose 4.8 percent to 3,640 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  declined 7.6 percent to
26.38, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.6 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 10
percent below the 30-day average.  Sharp, Sumco  Sharp advanced 8.2 percent to 424 yen after saying
Foxconn’s flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. will start
buying displays from its TV panel unit next quarter, three
months earlier than planned. The loss-making operation, in which
Foxconn is investing, will be taken off Sharp’s balance sheet
next month.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a maker of silicon wafers for semiconductors,
gained 14 percent to 790 yen. It reported operating profit of
2.9 billion yen ($36 million) for the three months ended April
30, beating the analysts’ estimates of 1 billion yen.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  lead declines on the Nikkei 225, dropping 4.1
percent to 1,244 yen after the optics maker said it may sell
shares to raise capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
