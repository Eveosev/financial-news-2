Iranians must reduce electricity
consumption by some five percent to prevent blackouts in summer
months,  Tehran Times  reported, citing the Iranian deputy energy
minister Mohammad Behzad.  Electricity consumption is as high as 2,500 megawatts per
day in peak hours on summer days, Behzad said.  Iran  plans to complete projects that will boost the
country’s electricity generation capacity by five gigawatts this
Iranian year ending late March 20, 2013, Behzad said in April,
according to the newspaper.  Iran has plans to boost its power generation capacity by 25
gigawatts to 73 by the end of 2015, Energy Minister Majid Namjou
said in February, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
