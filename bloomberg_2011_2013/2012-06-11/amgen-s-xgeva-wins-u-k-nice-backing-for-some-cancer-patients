Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s Xgeva won the backing
of the U.K.’s health-cost agency as a treatment for some
patients whose cancer has spread to their bones.  The drug, also called denosumab, is an option for breast-
cancer patients with bone metastases, though not for men with
prostate cancer that has spread, the  National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence  said today in a statement on its
draft recommendations. Xgeva may also be a cost-effective
treatment for patients with solid tumors other than breast or
prostate cancers if zoledronic acid or disodium pamidronate
would otherwise be prescribed for these patients, according to
the agency, known as NICE.  The drug should only be prescribed if Amgen, based in
 Thousand Oaks ,  California , provides it at a discounted rate,
NICE said, adding that the discount was confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
