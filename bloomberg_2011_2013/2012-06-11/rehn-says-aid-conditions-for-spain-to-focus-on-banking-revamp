The euro area’s conditions for
providing emergency aid to  Spain  will focus on revamping the
country’s banking industry, European Union Economy Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said.  “The policy conditionality will be concentrated on the
restructuring of the banking sector,” Rehn told a European
Parliament committee today in Strasbourg, France. He didn’t
elaborate.  Spain two days ago became the fourth euro-area nation to
seek a bailout since the start of the region’s debt crisis more
than two years ago with a request for as much as 100 billion
euros ($125 billion) to rescue its banks. Premier  Mariano Rajoy ,
who as recently as May 28 said he wouldn’t seek a bailout,
characterized the deal as a  credit line  for lenders.  The aid is due to come from either the temporary European
Financial Stability Facility, which was created in 2010 for
three years, or the planned permanent European Stability
Mechanism, due to start operating in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
