About 2,400 people with bank
accounts in Liechtenstein have agreed to disclose unpaid tax
owed to the U.K., the revenue and customs office said.  Mostly wealthy individuals with accounts in the Alpine
nation have so far paid 363 million pounds ($564 million)
following the introduction of a disclosure facility that aims to
raise as much as 3 billion pounds by 2016, the revenue office
said. Both nations will sign a double taxation agreement today.  “Until now, Liechtenstein was the only country in the
European Economic Area we had no agreement with,” Treasury
minister David Gauke said in an e-mailed statement in  London .
“This new treaty and the existing disclosure facility show that
the net is closing on those who try to evade their U.K. tax
liabilities by using offshore structures. There are fewer and
fewer places to hide.”  The clampdown comes amid a request for information from the
U.S., which is targeting lawyers, accountants, financial
advisers, asset managers and those responsible for professional
asset protection.  Under pressure from the U.S.,  Germany  and  France ,
Liechtenstein said in March 2009 that it would conform with tax
standards set out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development to avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
