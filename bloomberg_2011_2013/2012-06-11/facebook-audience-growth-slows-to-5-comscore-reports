Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s audience growth in
the U.S., along with time spent on the site, is slowing as the
world’s biggest social network saturates its home market,
according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   The number of visitors rose 5 percent in April from a year
earlier, down from a 24 percent surge in the same month of 2011,
market researcher  ComScore Inc.  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The average time spent on the site by each vistor climbed
16 percent, less than the 23 percent increase a year earlier.  Facebook, with more than 900 million members worldwide,
gets about half of its  revenue  from the U.S. and Canada. Seven
in 10 Americans using the Internet in April visited Facebook,
ComScore said. Slowing growth is to be “expected given
Facebook’s current size and market penetration,” said Andrew Lipsman, a vice president of industry analysis at ComScore, in
an e-mailed statement.  Shares of  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook fell 0.4
percent to $27.01 at the close in New York. The  stock  has
declined 29 percent since it started trading at $38 on May 18.  Ashley Zandy, a Facebook spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
