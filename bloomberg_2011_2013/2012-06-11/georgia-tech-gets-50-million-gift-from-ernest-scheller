The Georgia Institute of Technology
received a $50 million gift from Ernest Scheller Jr. and renamed
its business school in his honor.  The donation, once completed next year, will be the largest
cash gift to the university, Atlanta-based Georgia Tech said
today in a  statement  on its website. The College of Management
will now be named the Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business.  Scheller, who graduated from Georgia Tech in 1952, is
chairman emeritus of Silberline Manufacturing Co., a closely
held maker of pigments for the auto industry in Tamaqua,
Pennsylvania. The company was founded by his father in 1945.
Schellerâ€™s gift has been used to create nine faculty chairs, 37
undergraduate scholarships and six graduate fellowships,
according to the statement.  Georgia Tech, founded in 1885, is a state university with
more than 20,000 students. Former students include Michael Duke,
chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and  Jimmy Carter , the 39th president of the  United States , who attended
for a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
