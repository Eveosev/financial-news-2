AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, and  Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  led $6.9 billion of U.S. corporate
bond offerings in the strongest start to a week in more than two
months.  AT&T sold $2 billion of notes and  Mountain View ,
California-based software maker Symantec issued $1 billion of
debt, marking the best opening to a week since April 2,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales totaled $16.3
billion in the five days ended June 8, a 7 percent increase from
the prior period, while below this year’s average of $28.3
billion for the fourth straight week.  Issuance picked up after  Spain  asked euro-region
governments over the weekend for as much as 100 billion euros
($125 billion) to help shore up its banking system, as  Europe ’s
crisis threatens to infect corporate balance sheets globally.
The bailout may not be enough to stem Europe’s fiscal turmoil
with  Greece  holding elections on June 17 on austerity measures.  “There are these windows of opportunity that companies are
seizing,” Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in a telephone
interview. “Today, investor fears are lower than, say, a week
ago.”  Symantec, the world’s biggest seller of security software,
sold $600 million of 2.75 percent, five-year notes at a relative
yield of 210 basis points more than benchmarks and $400 million
of 3.95 percent, 10-year bonds at a spread of 245 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used to repay the
company’s $1 billion of 1 percent notes due June 2013, according
to a person familiar with the transaction.  CBS Sale  CBS Corp. (CBS) , the broadcaster and owner of the Showtime cable
channel, sold $900 million in a two-part offering of five- and
30-year bonds to repay debt maturing in August.  The company sold $400 million of 1.95 percent, five-year
notes to yield 150 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of 4.85 percent, 30-year debt at 230
basis points, Bloomberg data show. Both spreads are lower than
initial talk of about 175 and 240 more than Treasuries,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who asked to
not be identified because the terms are private.  AT&T sold $1.15 billion of 1.7 percent, five-year bonds to
yield 105 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and
$850 million of 3 percent, 10-year debt, a reopening, with a 135
basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.  Lowest Coupons  The wireless carrier issued $1 billion of 1.6 percent five-
year notes and an equivalent amount of 3 percent 10-year bonds
on Feb. 8, its lowest coupons for those maturities on record,
Bloomberg data show.  “We expect demand for the new bonds will be strong, as
telecom is often viewed as a relatively stable place to
invest,” Michael Hodel, a credit analyst at Chicago-based
Morningstar Inc., wrote in a research note today.  Newell Rubbermaid Inc., the maker of Sharpie pens and Graco
car strollers, sold $250 million each of 2 percent, three-year
securities at a spread of 175 basis points and 4 percent, 10-
year debentures at 245 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Other issuers in the market included NiSource Finance Corp.
which sold $750 million of bonds and  New York  Life Insurance Co
which issued $500 million of debt, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
