Canadian natural gas fell for a
fifth day to the lowest price in six weeks as cooling demand in
the U.S. dropped below normal.  July gas in  Alberta  declined 4.9 percent. Air conditioning
demand will be 13 percent below usual in the Northeast and 9
percent less across the U.S. to June 18, according to Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri. The high in  New York  June 14 is
forecast to be 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius) 3 degrees
below normal, said  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  “Weather demand in the U.S. is part of the problem,”
 Peter Linder , president of the DeltaOne Energy Fund in Calgary,
said in a telephone interview. “Traders are now looking at it
in the short term and you’re going to see wild swings in the
next few weeks, but I still believe in the second half of this
year we’ll see a nice recovery.”  Alberta gas for July delivery declined 8.25 cents to
C$1.6175 a gigajoule ($1.48 per million British thermal units),
the lowest level since April 26, as of 2:30 p.m. New York time.
Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 39 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 8.1 cents to settle at $2.218 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
1.85 cents to $2.2497 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas advanced 3.36 cents to $1.9788 per million Btu. At
Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices rose 2.93 cents to $2.0769.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.1 billion cubic
feet at 2:30 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.14 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.82 billion cubic feet.  There was a shortage of 211 million cubic feet in available
capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system at  Kingsgate .
The system was forecast to carry 1.88 billion cubic feet today,
or 13 percent above normal capacity of 1.67 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.95
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
