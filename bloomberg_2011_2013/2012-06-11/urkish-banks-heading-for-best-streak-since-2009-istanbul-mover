Turkish  banks  headed for their
longest streak of gains in almost three years after the
 International Monetary Fund  said the economy was on track for a
soft landing and a Spanish bailout buoyed stocks worldwide.  The main banking  index  added 2 percent to 113,598.9 at
12:15 p.m. in Istanbul, up for an eighth day in the biggest
stretch of advances since August 2009.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi
AS (GARAN) ,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  and  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS led the gauge’s rise.  “Turkey’s positive divergence continues,” Isik Okte,
strategist at Halk Invest in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed
report. “After recommendations to buy Turkish banks from seven
investment groups in three days, flows to Turkish banks
increased on the back of an IMF report Friday night praising the
Turkish economy.”  The IMF report issued June 8 said Turkey’s economy was
decelerating toward a soft landing, helping to improve
imbalances built over the last two years. Credit Suisse
recommended buying Turkish banks in a note dated June 8 and e-
mailed to clients today, saying their strong fundamentals
weren’t yet priced in and valuations were attractive.  Akbank jumped 2 percent to 6.10 liras, Garanti rose 1.2
percent to 6.54 liras, Isbank added 1.8 percent to 4.07 liras
and state-run  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  increased 2 percent to
13.10 liras.  Turkish lenders are trading  at par  with their book value,
compared with 1.9 times book value at the end of 2010 and 1.2
times book value at the end of last year. The banking index has
gained 15 percent this year, including 10 percent in the past
eight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
