The European Union, which tied with
the U.S. as the world’s biggest farm-product exporter in 2011,
signed a plan on cooperating in agriculture with  China , the
leading global consumer of grains and cotton.  The accord was signed today in Beijing by EU Agriculture
Commissioner Dacian Ciolos and Han Changfu, China’s minister for
agriculture, the European Commission said today on its website.
The plan is intended to address issues including food security
and the environment, with a goal of enhancing trade relations
and sustainability, it said.  Agricultural exports from the EU were a record 105 billion
euros ($132.7 billion) last year and equaled shipments from the
U.S., the commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm, said
last month. China and  Hong Kong  make up the third-biggest
agricultural import  market  for the EU, with shipments climbing
by about 2.5 billion euros in 2011.  “Agriculture is of crucial interest for both China and the
European Union,” Ciolos said in a statement on the commission’s
website. “This cooperation plan is a new step in our commitment
to work together to address common challenges -- in particular
 food security , rural development, food safety and climate
change.”  Ciolos will be in China until June 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
