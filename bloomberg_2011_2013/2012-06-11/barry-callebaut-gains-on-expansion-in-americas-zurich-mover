Barry Callebaut AG (BARN)  rose the most in
more than a month in Zurich trading after the world’s largest
maker of bulk chocolate said it will invest 26.8 million Swiss
francs ($28.2 million) to expand in  North America .  The stock rose as much as 2.3 percent to 866 francs, the
 steepest intraday advance  since May 9. The Zurich-based company
said it’s boosting chocolate molding capacity in  Vermont  and has
agreed to buy the Ontario assets of Batory Industries Co.  “The Americas is the fastest-growing region for Barry,”
Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a
note, citing a first-half volume increase of almost 20 percent
in the region. The case for investing in the shares “remains
intact with strong volume growth expected from outsourcing
contracts, and expansion in new territories.”  The two projects will increase  Barry Callebaut ’s production
capacity in the region by 60,000 tons. The facilities will help
the company supply the Midwest area, according to a company
statement. Investments in North America in 2011 and 2012 have
totaled 95.9 million francs, Barry Callebaut said.  The stock was up 1.2 percent at 863.50 francs at 2:41 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
