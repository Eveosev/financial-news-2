Germany ’s budget deficit this year
will be smaller than previously forecast because of higher tax
revenue, according to a supplementary budget to be passed this
week,  Die Welt  reported, citing coalition officials.  The federal government will have to finance a budget gap of
31 billion euros ($39 billion), compared with the 34.8 billion
euros previously forecast, the newspaper said. Germany has to
pass the supplementary budget to account for 8.7 billion euros
in paid-in capital to the European Stability Mechanism, the euro
area’s bailout fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
