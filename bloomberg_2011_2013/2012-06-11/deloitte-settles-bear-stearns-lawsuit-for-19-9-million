Deloitte & Touche agreed to pay
$19.9 million to settle claims by investors who lost money in
the stock of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) â€™s Bear Stearns unit from 2006
to 2008.  The settlement, which must be approved by a judge in
 Manhattan  federal court, resolves claims against Deloitte by a
class of shareholders claiming Bear Stearns, with the help of
Deloitte, its auditor, made misstatements about its financial
condition. Bear Stearns shares dropped after news became public
about risky  hedge funds  and negative ratings-company outlooks.  Bear Stearns, a New York-based investment bank, announced
in January 2008 that U.S. prosecutors were inquiring into the
collapse of the hedge funds. In March 2008 JPMorgan Chase
announced it was buying Bear Stearns for $2 a share.  Last week, Bear Stearns agreed to a settlement requiring it
to pay $275 million to investors to settle the litigation.  The case is In re The Bear Stearns Cos. Securities,
Derivative and ERISA Litigation, 08-mdl-1963, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
