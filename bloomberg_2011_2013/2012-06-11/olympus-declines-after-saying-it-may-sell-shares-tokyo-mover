Olympus Corp. (7733) , the Japanese camera
maker that admitted to a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, fell the
most in a month in Tokyo trading after saying it may consider
selling shares in the market to raise capital.  Olympus dropped 4.1 percent, the biggest decline since May
7, to 1,244 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent.  The company is considering fundraising measures that may
include a strategic alliance or selling shares in the market, as
it seeks to boost its capital ratio to more than 30 percent by
March 2017, President Hiroyuki Sasa said after the market closed
on June 8. Olympus needs to shore up capital after writing down
the value of assets because of a 13-year accounting fraud
exposed by former President  Michael Woodford .  “The company needs to boost capital and form an alliance
to rebuild itself,”  Makoto Sengoku , a Tokyo-based market
analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., said today by phone.
Sasa’s comment about selling shares in the market “is
triggering the drop” in trading today, he said.  Olympus, the world’s biggest maker of endoscopes, may post
 net income  of 7 billion yen ($88 million) this fiscal year, it
said in a statement on June 8. That compared with the 25 billion
yen average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Operating profit may be 50 billion yen for the year ending March
31, compared with the 63.4 billion yen average of analyst
estimates.  Job Cuts  The Tokyo-based camera maker also said it plans to
eliminate 2,700 jobs by March 2014. Olympus had 39,727
 employees , including contract workers, as of March 2011,
according to Tsuyoshi Oshima, a company spokesman.  Most of the jobs being cut are in overseas manufacturing,
Sasa said on June 8. The company will close a plant in the
Philippines this year and will reorganize others, it said in the
statement.  Olympus has said it received alliance offers from several
companies including  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Terumo Corp. (4543) 
and  Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901)   To contact the reporter on this story:
