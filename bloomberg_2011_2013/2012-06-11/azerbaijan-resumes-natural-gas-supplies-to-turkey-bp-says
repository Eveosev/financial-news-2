Azerbaijan resumed the supply of
natural-gas to neighboring  Turkey  on June 9, Tamam Bayatli, a
spokeswoman for  BP Plc (BP/) ’s office in the Azeri capital of Baku,
said by phone today.  The supply was suspended on May 29 at the request of
Turkey’s state-run Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas,
after an explosion on the Turkish section of the South Caucasus
pipeline, the London-based producer said at the time. The
pipeline is run by BP.  Azerbaijan exports 6.6 billion cubic meters of gas to
Turkey a year from the offshore Caspian field of Shah Deniz,
also operated by BP. The volumes will be increased by another 6
billion cubic meters after the second phase of the Shah Deniz
project starts production in late 2017 or early 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
