Cyprus Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said reaching out for a European bailout was one of the
options under consideration as it struggles to recapitalize its
second-biggest bank.  “The mechanism is one of our choices and we should not
demonize it,” Shiarly told reporters in Nicosia today, and
added that a loan from a third country was also among Cyprus’s
options and could help negotiate better terms.  While “time is pressing,” the government has not begun
talks for a financial lifeline that could help the east
Mediterranean island bolster Cyprus Popular Bank with at least
1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion) before June 30, and cover
“future needs” of the government. “Few days are left and the
issue is therefore included in the government’s priorities.”  Spain  became the fourth euro country to seek outside help
June 9, asking for 100 billion euros of aid from the euro area
to bolster its financial industry.  Cyprus, which is the euro area’s third-smallest economy,
has been shut out of markets since May 2011 and has 2.2 billion
euros of maturing debt next year. The government aims at cut its
deficit from 6.3 percent of the economy last year to 2.5 percent
this year.  European Central Bank  governing council member and  Central
Bank  of Cyprus governor Panicos Demetriades told lawmakers
earlier today that Cyprus’s fiscal situation is not as bad as
often presented. “We shouldn’t send the message that our
situation is tragic,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
