CAL Bank Ltd. (CAL) , a lender in the West
African nation, rose to the highest level in almost a month as
investors bet profit doubled in the first half.  The stock gained 4.6 percent to 23 pesewas as of 2:32 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, the biggest increase since May 16.  “Our expectation for the bank’s profit is a growth of at
least 100 percent in the first half,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi,
a stock trader at  Merbank Stockbrokers Ltd.  in Accra, said by
phone today. “Earnings from fees and commissions as well as
from forex trading will significantly support CAL’s
profitability in the first half.”  CAL Bank’s first-half results are due by the second week in
July, Gyamfi said. The bank’s first-quarter net income more than
doubled to 8.2 million cedis ($4.2 million) from 3.1 million
cedis a year earlier, the company said April 24. Net fees and
commissions increased 36 percent to 4.3 million cedis while net
trading income more than doubled to 4.3 million cedis.  The bank’s head of  investor relations , Dzifa Amegashie, did
not respond to a telephone call to her office and mobile phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
