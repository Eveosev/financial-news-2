Egypt  agreed to export 501.5 metric
tons of cotton in the week through June 7, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 75,772.5 tons of the fiber, valued
at $237.5 million, since the marketing year began Sept. 1. Of
last week’s agreed sales, 251.5 tons were of the Giza 88 variety
and 250 tons were of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter-staple cotton and used
in luxury clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are the
top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
