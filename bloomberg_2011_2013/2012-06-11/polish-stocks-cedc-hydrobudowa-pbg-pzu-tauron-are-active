Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 0.5
percent to 2,164.7 at the end of trading in Warsaw.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC)  , the country’s
second-largest vodka producer, jumped 6.8 percent to 10.48
zloty, the steepest gain since May 24, after Russian Standard
Corp. said it plans to boost its ownership to a controlling
stake as soon as possible.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s third-largest builder, jumped 16
percent to 6.27 zloty, the biggest jump since May 22. A Poznan,
western Poland-based court ruled to approve bankruptcy
proceedings for PBG’s  Hydrobudowa Polska SA (HBP)   unit in
line with the builder’s request. Hydrobudowa rose 20 percent to
0.18 zloty.  PZU SA (PZU)  , the nation’s biggest insurer, increased
1.9 percent to 316.9 zloty, the highest in more than a month,
after Bank of America Corp. started coverage of the company with
a buy rating. The share-estimate was set at 370 zloty apiece.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  , Poland’s second-biggest
power utility, slid 0.6 percent to 4.65 zloty, falling for the
first time in three days after a report the company expects a
delay in the completion of a new power unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
