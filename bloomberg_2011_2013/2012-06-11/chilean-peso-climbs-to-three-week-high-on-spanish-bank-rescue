Chile’s peso strengthened past 500
per dollar for the first time in three weeks after  Spain  sought
a bailout for its banks.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 501.64 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:51 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier climbed as much as 0.6
percent to 499.13 per U.S. dollar, the strongest since May 16.  Spain asked euro-region governments for as much as
100 billion euros ($126 billion) to help shore up its banking
system. The euro rallied as much as 1.2 percent against the
dollar to $1.2671 before trading little changed at $1.2528.  “There was a positive start, but as the morning has
progressed markets have started to wane,” said Eugenio Cortes,
head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA
in Santiago. “There may have been an expectation for more than
was in the actual announcement.”  The price of copper,  Chile ’s biggest export, rose as much
as 3.5 percent to $3.339 a pound on the Comex in  New York  after
 China ’s exports gained in May more than economists estimated,
bolstering the outlook for demand. China is the biggest buyer of
Chile’s copper.  International investors boosted their short peso position
in the peso forwards market to a record $10.6 billion on June 7.
At the same time local investors cut their long peso position to
$17 billion, the lowest since May 16.  The bulk of local investment in the Chilean peso forwards
market is from pension funds, which buy peso forwards to hedge
the foreign-currency exposure from investments outside Chile.  Lower bets on the peso from both international and local
investors meant that Chilean banks and brokers, which are the
counterparts for the trades, had their smallest long dollar
position in the forwards market since May 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
