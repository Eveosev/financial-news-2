Cuban outfielder Jorge Soler has
signed a nine-year contract with the Chicago Cubs worth about
$30 million,  CBS Sports  reported without saying where it
obtained the information.  Cubs spokesman Peter Chase declined in an e-mail to
comment.  A 6-foot-3, 205-pound outfielder, Soler has both speed and
home-run power, according to  Baseball America . If eligible, he
would probably have been a top-five pick in the 2010 Major
League Baseball draft, when Washington Nationals outfielder
Bryce Harper was selected first, according to the magazine.  Soler, 20, will need at least two years of minor league
experience before playing in the major leagues, CBS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
