Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , the eastern
Mediterranean islandâ€™s second biggest lender, boosted core  Tier
1 capital  by 115 million euros ($144 million) through the
buyback of securities.  Of 450 million euros of floating rate lower tier 2
securities maturing in 2016, 76 percent were tendered after the
bank offered to repurchase them, the Nicosia-based lender said
in an e-mailed statement today. The move is part of a capital
enhancing plan submitted to the Cyprus Central Bank on Jan. 20.  Cyprus Popular is preparing a 1.8 billion-euro rights
offer, fully underwritten by the Cypriot government. The lender
said its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, will reach 9.2 percent once it completes the capital
raising plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
