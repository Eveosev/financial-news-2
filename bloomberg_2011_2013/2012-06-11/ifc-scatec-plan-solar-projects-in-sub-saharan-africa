The International Financial
Corporation, the  World Bank ’s private lending arm, and Norwegian
developer Scatec Solar AS plan to build utility-scale solar
parks in west and central Africa.  IFC InfraVentures and Scatec aim to finance, build and
operate photovoltaic plants with more than 10 megawatts,
according to a statement today. The plants will be developed at
first in Benin,  Burkina Faso , Cameroon, Niger and Togo.  Many Africans rely on fuel-based generation due to limited
infrastructure and rising demand for electricity. Solar power
could be an efficient alternative, particularly in remote areas,
according to the partners.  The agreement will combine the developer’s technical know-
how with the IFC’s expertise in “financing and working with
governments in a region where limited supply of electricity is
one of the major challenges for growth”, Raymond Carlsen,
Scatec’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.
