Turkish benchmark yields retreated
for an eighth day, recording their longest falling streak in
almost three years, as the country’s current-account deficit
narrowed in April.  The yield on two-year debt declined three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 9.11 percent at the close in Istanbul,
marking eight consecutive days of losses, the biggest such
stretch since July 2009. The lira weakened for the first time in
seven days, down 0.1 percent to 1.8247 per dollar as of 6:20
p.m. in Istanbul, after having gained as much as 0.8 percent to
1.8071 per dollar.  Turkey ’s  current-account gap  retreated for a sixth month to
$5 billion in April from $7.7 billion a year earlier, the
central bank in Ankara said on its website today. Central bank
Governor Erdem Basci maintained a tighter monetary policy to
support the lira, which has appreciated 3.6 percent this year,
the most among emerging-market currencies after the Columbian
and Chilean pesos.  “The current-account deficit is on track to decline to
around 8 percent of the gross domestic product,”  Inan Demir ,
chief economist at Istanbul-based Finansbank AS, said in e-
mailed comments.  The statistics office in Ankara said May 31 Turkey’s trade
deficit narrowed more than expected to $6.6 billion in April,
contracting for a sixth month and declining from $9.1 billion a
year earlier. The median estimate of eight economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was $7.1 billion.  The country’s current-account gap stood at a record $77
billion last year, which is 10 percent of its gross domestic
product, the second-highest among all nations after the U.S. The
lira depreciated 18 percent last year, prompting the central
bank to embark on a tighter policy to arrest the currency’s
weakness and stem inflation, which until April remained at more
than twice the bank’s target for both 2011 as well as 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
