Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  rose 1.6 percent to 58,234.21 at the midday break in
Istanbul, gaining for a seventh day to the highest in a month.  The following shares are active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, Turkey’s national airline,
added 1.5 percent to 2.77 liras. The airline urgently need
bigger aircrafts to keep up with surging traffic, Chief
Executive Officer Temel Kotil said in an interview in Beijing
yesterday. The airline’s passenger traffic has jumped 28 percent
this year, more than triple the global growth rate, as it builds
a network connecting travelers in Asia, Europe and Africa. The
airline also expects to boost profit this year even as the
European debt crisis slows global economic growth, Kotil said.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  , a state-run lender,
added 2.3 percent to 13.15 liras, on course for its strongest
close since April 4. Credit Suisse Group AG said Turkish banks
looked attractive from a fundamental and valuation standpoint
and Halkbank was its top pick, according to the lender’s e-
mailed report received today.  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK)  , the lender part-owned
by Italy’s  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , also gained as Turkey’s banking index
headed for its longest streak of consecutive daily gains since
2009. The shares added 2.5 percent to 3.30 liras, poised for its
highest level since April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
