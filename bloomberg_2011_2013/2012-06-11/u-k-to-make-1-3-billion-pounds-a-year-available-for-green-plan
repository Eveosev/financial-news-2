The U.K. government plans to make
1.3 billion pounds ($2 billion) a year available for households
to install energy-saving measures to reduce bills and cut
emissions that account for nearly half of the country’s total
greenhouse gas output.  The government will make the funds available under its
“Green Deal,” The Department of Energy and Climate Change said
today in an e-mailed  statement . The program will help homeowners
and businesses to install fuel-saving technologies such as
insulation that curb heat loss and improve energy efficiency.  The U.K. is aiming to cushion consumers from energy price
rises by improving inefficient, drafty homes to reduce energy
waste. Leaky buildings account for about 43 percent of the
nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the statement.  Other measures set out under the secondary legislation
published today include standards to protect consumers and
specific support for low income and rural areas. An extra
100,000 homes in low income areas should benefit from today’s
plans, compared with the government’s original proposal, DECC
said in the statement.  The government also set out rules for its Energy Company
Obligation, a subsidy from energy suppliers, that will provide
additional support for households most in need and for
properties that are harder to treat, DECC said.  The U.K.’s 3 billion-pound Green Investment Bank will
prioritize offshore wind,  energy efficiency  and the Green Deal
program. The bank should start business from April next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
