India’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to a three-month low, as debt purchases by the
central bank and speculation borrowing costs will be cut buoyed
demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy a maximum of 120 billion
rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes at an auction tomorrow, according
to a statement from the monetary authority. The RBI has already
bought 321 billion rupees of bonds this fiscal year that began
April 1. There is room to cut  interest rates  after economic
growth slowed and oil prices dropped, RBI Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said last week.  “We think that rate-cut expectations along with debt
purchases will support  government bonds ,” analysts at Barclays
Plc’s investment banking unit including Singapore-based Kumar Rachapudi, wrote in a report today.  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 8.32 percent as of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since
March 14.  India’s economy expanded 5.3 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, compared with 6.1 percent in the preceding
three months, according to official data. The central bank is
due to review borrowing costs on June 18.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three basis
points to 7.62 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
