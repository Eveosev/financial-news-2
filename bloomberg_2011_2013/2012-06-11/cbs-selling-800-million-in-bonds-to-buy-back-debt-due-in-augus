CBS Corp. (CBS) , the broadcaster and owner
of the Showtime cable channel, raised $900 million in a two-part
offering of five- and 30-year bonds at its lowest coupons on
record to repay debt maturing in August.  The company sold $400 million of 1.95 percent five-year
notes to yield 150 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of 4.85 percent 30-year bonds with a
230 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The coupons are the company’s lowest for similar-maturity
issues, the data show.  The offering size is larger by $100 million and both
spreads are lower than initial talk at about 175 basis points
and 240 basis points more than Treasuries, according to a person
familiar with the offering who asked not to be named, citing
lack of authorization to speak publicly about the sale.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay about $152
million of 8.625 percent bonds due Aug. 1 and to redeem $338
million of 5.625 percent notes maturing two weeks later, the New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing. Remaining
proceeds will be used to repay other debt and for general
corporate purposes, the company said.  CBS last sold debt Feb. 24, when it issued $700 million of
3.375 percent debentures maturing in 2022 at 99.1 cents on the
dollar to yield 150 basis points more than similar maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was
the firm’s lowest coupon ever for 10-year debt, the data show.  The new bonds were rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
two levels above junk, and an equivalent BBB by  Standard &
Poor’s .  Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank
of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and UBS AG managed the sale, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
