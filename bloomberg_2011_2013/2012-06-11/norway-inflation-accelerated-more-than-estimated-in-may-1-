Norwegian underlying inflation
accelerated more than estimated in May, boosted by air travel
costs and rising food prices.  Annual  underlying inflation , which adjusts for taxes, fees
and energy prices, was 1.4 percent in May, compared with 0.7
percent in April, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said today. It
was estimated to be 1.1 percent in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists. Underlying consumer prices rose 0.4 percent from
April, the agency said.  Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen has lowered the bankâ€™s
benchmark deposit rate 0.75 percentage point since December to
1.5 percent, after krone gains slowed inflation and austerity
measures in  Europe  hurt export demand. The bank expects
underlying inflation to remain below its 2.5 percent target
through 2015, according to its  latest monetary policy report .  Headline inflation was 0.5 percent in the year and was
unchanged in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
