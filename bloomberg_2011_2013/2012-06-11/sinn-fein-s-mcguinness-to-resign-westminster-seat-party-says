Sinn Fein  lawmaker and Northern
Ireland’s Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness will resign
his seat in the U.K. Parliament at Westminster as part of a
policy of ending “dual mandates,” the party said today.  “Martin will resign as MP for Mid-Ulster to concentrate on
his work in the Assembly and as Deputy First Minister,” Sinn
Fein leader  Gerry Adams  said in an e-mailed statement. “This
will obviously necessitate a by-election for Westminster.”  Sinn Fein, which wants Northern Ireland to be reunited with
the Republic of Ireland, doesn’t take its seats at Westminster
in London in protest of having to swear allegiance to the
monarchy. The party is the second largest in the 108-seat
 Northern Ireland  power-sharing assembly, which was revived in
2007 as part of a peace deal.  Meeting Queen Elizabeth II when she visits Northern Ireland
later this month would be a “massive ask for Irish
republicans,” McGuinness said in today’s statement. “At this
time we do not have a doable position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
