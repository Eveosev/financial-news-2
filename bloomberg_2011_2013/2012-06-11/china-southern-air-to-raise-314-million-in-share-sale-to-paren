China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , Asia’s
biggest carrier by passengers, will raise as much as 2 billion
 yuan  ($314 million) selling new stock to its state-owned parent
to help pare debts.  China Southern Air Holding Co. will buy 465.1 million A-
shares at 4.30 yuan each, according to a  Hong Kong  exchange
filing yesterday. That’s an 8.1 percent discount to the last
closing price of 4.68 yuan. The carrier will resume trading in
Hong Kong today, ending a halt pending the announcement.  The sale “will help the company to improve its financial
condition, satisfy the capital needs of its business
development, maintain its competitive advantage and ensure its
sustainable and sound development,” China Southern said in
yesterday’s statement.  Air China Ltd. (601111)  also announced a 1 billion yuan share sale
to its state-controlled parent in April.  China Southern’s  net income  fell 74 percent in the first
quarter to 319 million yuan. The  company  has a debt-to-asset
ratio of 49 percent, compared with the 35 percent average for
carriers worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
