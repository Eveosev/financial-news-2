New York City  set a record in 2011
as 65.5 percent of its high-school students graduated in four
years, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said.  It marked the 10th-straight year of higher graduation rates
and a 19-point increase since 2005, the mayor said in an e-mail
statement today. Schools that have opened since 2006, including
those replacing institutions deemed to be failing, had double
the rates of the ones they replaced, the mayor said.  The third-term mayor, a political independent, has asked
residents to judge his administration on school performance. In
2002, his first year in office, he persuaded the Legislature and
former Governor  George Pataki  to disband the Board of Education
and give him control of the largest U.S. education system.  “When our administration began, schools hadn’t seen
significant increases in their graduation rates in more than a
decade,” said Bloomberg, 70. “Through our strategies to
improve education, we’ve steadily improved graduation rates and
student achievement.”  Next year, city officials plan to open 78 schools, bringing
the total opened under Bloomberg to 613, the mayor’s office said
in a news release.  The system, which includes 1.1 million students and about
75,000 teachers, will cost the city about $19.7 billion to
operate in fiscal 2013, about 60 percent more than it did 10
years ago.  Teacher Salaries  During that decade, teacher salaries have increased about
40 percent, Bloomberg has said. A five-year $11.2 billion
capital program with money borrowed through municipal bonds has
been planned to renovate and build schools, according to the
mayor’s 2012  spending plan .  A May 10 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute  survey  of
 New York  City voters found 60 percent disapproved of the mayor’s
handling of the schools, while 29 percent approved. Voters
preferred shared control of the schools over mayoral control by
60 percent to 17 percent, the Hamden, Connecticut-based
university said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
