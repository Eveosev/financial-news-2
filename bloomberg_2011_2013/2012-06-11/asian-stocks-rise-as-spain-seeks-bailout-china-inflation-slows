Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index on course for its biggest gain in almost five
months, as  China ’s trade data beat estimates and investors
speculated a bailout for Spain’s banks will help ease  Europe ’s
debt crisis.  China Cosco (1919)  Holdings Co. jumped 11 percent in  Hong Kong  as
China’s rising imports and exports boosted prospects for
shipping lines.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets about 31
percent of sales from Europe, rose 3.5 percent in Tokyo. Sumco
Corp. surged 14 percent after the maker of silicon wafers for
semiconductors posted operating profit that beat estimates.
Gauges of volatility fell across the region.  “The bailout will keep companies that borrow from Spanish
banks from going down all together,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $70 billion. “In China,
overseas demand is stronger than expected.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.9 percent to 113.57
at 7:57 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its biggest advance since
Jan. 17. Five stocks rose for each that fell in the measure. The
gauge rose for the first time in six weeks last week as policy
makers in the U.S., Europe and China signaled they would take
steps to stimulate growth.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  increased 2 percent and
 South Korea ’s Kospi Index rose 1.7 percent. The Nikkei
Volatility Index retreated 8.2 percent, while the Kospi 200
Volatility Index sank 4.6 percent. Australian markets were
closed for a holiday.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 1.1 percent as the
nation’s consumer prices increased the least in two years in May
and industrial output and retail sales trailed estimates, adding
pressure for more stimulus after the first interest-rate cut in
three years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.4 percent,
with the HSI Volatility Index sliding 8.9 percent, the most
since March 27.  ‘Monetary Measures’  “Growth in China has slowed from last quarter but I think
policy makers will ensure that more fiscal and monetary measures
will be available in order to lift the economy back up again,”
said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management Asia Ltd., which oversees
about $10 billion.  Chinese lenders and developers rose. Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., the world’s third-largest lender, gained 2.3 percent
to HK$3.11.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the biggest
mainland developer listed in Hong Kong, climbed 2.9 percent to
HK$16.92.  The nation’s shipping companies gained as a separate
government report showed China’s exports climbed 15.3 percent in
May to a record, exceeding all 29 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Imports rose 12.7 percent compared with expectations for
a 5.5 percent gain.  Cosco Jumps  China Cosco, the world’s largest operator of dry-bulk
ships, climbed 11 percent to HK$3.84. China Shipping Container
Lines Co., the country’s second-largest carrier of sea-cargo
boxes, jumped 11 percent to HK$1.93.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6
percent today. The gauge added 0.8 percent on June 8 on optimism
that weekend discussions among European finance officials would
result in a bailout for  Spain .  Companies linked to Europe gained after Spain requested as
much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) of bailout funds after
weeks of escalating concern that bad loans at the nation’s banks
might overwhelm public finances.  “Without a bailout, Spain would have had a serious
liquidity issue,” said Baring Asset’s Do. “In the short term,
it’s relief for Spain and for Europe but it’s not the end
solution.”  Canon, Esprit  Canon rose 3.5 percent to 3,240 yen in Tokyo.  Esprit
Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as its biggest
market, increased 6.7 percent to HK$13.46 in Hong Kong.
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., which operates ports in Spain and
 Germany , added 3.1 percent to HK$64.45.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 2.1 percent this year
through June 8, compared with a 5.4 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 1.1 percent drop by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are  valued  at 1.2 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.3 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below one means
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  Sharp Corp., Japan’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, advanced 8.2 percent to 424 yen after saying Foxconn
Technology Group’s flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. will
start buying from its TV panel unit three months earlier than
planned. Foxconn is investing in the loss-making operation,
which will be taken off Sharp’s balance sheet next month.  Sumco gained 14 percent to 790 yen. It reported operating
profit of 2.9 billion yen ($36 million) for the three months
through April 30, beating analysts’ estimates of 1 billion yen.  Olam International Ltd. jumped 8.3 percent to S$1.76 in
 Singapore , heading for its biggest advance since Oct. 27, after
the commodity supplier announced a buyback of as much as 10
percent of its outstanding shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
