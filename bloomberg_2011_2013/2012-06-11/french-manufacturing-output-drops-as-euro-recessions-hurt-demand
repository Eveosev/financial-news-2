French factory output fell for the
fourth month in five in April as recessions in at least six
European countries weighed on demand and raised the risk that
 France  will have its first quarterly contraction in three years.  Manufacturing production  declined 0.7 percent, leaving
output in the three months through April down 1.8 percent
compared with a year earlier, Paris-based national statistics
office Insee said today. The figure was in line with that
predicted by a Bloomberg News survey of seven economists.  The drop is the latest indication that  Europe ’s second-
largest economy after  Germany  is suffering from stagnant demand
in its main export markets as neighbors such as Italy and Spain
suffer recessions induced by the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.
Any gross domestic product shrinkage would pose a challenge to
President  Francois Hollande , who won office last month on a
pledge to revive growth.  “This paints a dire picture of the French economy that is
clearly linked to a renewed intensification of the euro
crisis,” said Joost Beaumont, an economist at  ABN Amro  in
Amsterdam. “Hollande is between a rock and a hard place.”  Today’s report comes after the Bank of France said last
week that sentiment among French factory executives slipped in
May, suggesting the economy will shrink 0.1 percent in the
second quarter.  The GDP drop “could be quite modest” because industrial
production, which includes electricity generation, increased 1.5
percent in April, Beaumont said. “It should still happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
