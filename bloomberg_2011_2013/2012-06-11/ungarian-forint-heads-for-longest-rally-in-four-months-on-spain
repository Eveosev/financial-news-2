The forint weakened, snapping five
days of gains against the euro, as Hungarian government bonds
fell for a second day.  The currency of the European Unionâ€™s most-indebted eastern
member depreciated 0.2 percent to 295.84 per euro by 2:43 p.m.
in Budapest. The forint gained 3.3 percent last week, the most
among major emerging-market peers tracked by Bloomberg.  Bonds fell, lifting the benchmark 10-year yield six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.54 percent. The yield
tumbled 57 basis points last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
