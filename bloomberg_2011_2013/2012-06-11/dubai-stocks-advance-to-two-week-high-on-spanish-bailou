Dubai’s shares climbed the most in
three weeks on optimism a bailout for Spain’s banks will help
ease Europe’s crisis and after the  International Monetary Fund 
said the United Arab Emirates recorded a fiscal surplus.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
tower, advanced to the highest in almost two weeks.  Deyaar
Development (DEYAAR)  PJSC jumped 3.6 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose
1.1 percent, the most since May 21, to 1,483 at the 2 p.m. close
in the emirate, bringing the gain in the past five days to 3.2
percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rallied 0.5 percent and
Saudi Arabia’s benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  jumped 0.6
percent.  Dubai, the second-largest of seven sheikhdoms that make up
the U.A.E., relies on trade, tourism and property for growth.
Spain requested as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) of
bailout funds after weeks of escalating concern that bad loans
at its banks might overwhelm public finances. Global stocks also
gained after Chinese exports topped forecasts.  There is “a knee-jerk positive reaction everywhere to the
extension of a helping hand to Spanish banks,” said  Julian Bruce , the Dubai-based director of institutional sales trading
at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, the biggest publicly traded Arab
investment bank. “On a local level, the news that the U.A.E.
swung to $11 billion fiscal surplus in 2011 will be considered
as supportive.”  Fiscal Surplus  The U.A.E. posted an estimated consolidated balance surplus
of 38.6 billion dirhams ($11 billion), or 2.9 percent of gross
domestic product, in 2011 from a deficit in the previous two
years, the IMF said in  a report  this month.  Crude for July delivery increased as much as 3 percent to
$86.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract rose 1.1 percent last week to $84.10, the
first weekly gain in six. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including the
U.A.E. and  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) , supply about a fifth of the world’s
oil.  The MSCI World Index gained 0.7 percent, the  STOXX Europe
600 Price Index (SXXP)  advanced 0.9 percent and the  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF)  climbed 1.5 percent. Chinese exports jumped 15.3
percent from a year earlier in May, exceeding all 29 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Global Exposure  Dubai’s economic growth may accelerate to between 4 percent
and 5 percent in 2012 from 3.4 percent last year, Al Ittihad
reported last week, citing the director general of the emirate’s
chamber of commerce and industry, Hamad Mubarak Buamim. Trade
accounts for 35 percent of gross domestic product in the
emirate, Ahmed Butti Ahmed, director general of Dubai Customs,
said in April.  “Although financial vulnerabilities of the U.A.E. have
decreased since the 2008 global real estate collapse, given the
U.A.E.’s interconnectedness, it remains exposed to global
financial conditions,” according to the IMF.  Dubai’s measure has retreated 15 percent from this year’s
high in March as European officials failed to control the spread
of the region’s credit crisis.  Emaar rose 0.7 percent to 2.88 dirhams, the highest close
since May 31. Deyaar, the developer controlled by  Dubai Islamic
Bank (DIB) , increased the most since April 24 to 31.3 fils.  Elsewhere in the Persian Gulf region, Abu Dhabi’s  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.4 percent and Qatar’s shares advanced 0.2
percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  retreated 0.2 percent while Kuwait’s
 gauge  fell 0.6 percent and Bahrain’s  measure  declined 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
