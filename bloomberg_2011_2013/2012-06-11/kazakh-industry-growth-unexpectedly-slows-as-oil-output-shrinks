Kazakh industry grew at a slower
pace than economists forecast in May as oil production declined.  Industrial output rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 2 percent increase the previous month, the state
statistics agency said today in an e-mailed statement. Thatâ€™s
less than the 2.4 percent median estimate of eight economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Production fell 1.5 percent from April.  While natural-gas and non-ferrous metal-ore production
advanced 9.8 percent and 6.2 percent, crude output declined 0.2
percent, the agency said.  Industrial production expanded 2.3 percent from a year
earlier in the first five months of the year, compared with 2.7
percent from January to April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
