Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  skirted default
on $358 million of convertible bonds maturing tomorrow after
investors approved a company request for a 45-day extension.  Bondholders voted to extend the maturity of the two notes
until July 27 to allow the company to finalize a refinancing
package with banks, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Suzlon has the option to advance repayment by providing
five days notice, it said.  India ’s biggest wind-turbine maker said last month it was
in advanced talks with banks including SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
for up to a $300 million  term loan  to settle debt. The extension
was sought as a cover for possible procedural delays, Vikas
Rathee, Suzlon’s head of corporate finance, said May 18.  Suzlon’s $175 million, 5 percent debt due April 2016 rose
0.1 percent today, Nomura Holdings Inc. prices show. It has
rallied 7 percent since the company announced the expected $300
million loan on May 18. Repayment of the loan will start at
least 18 months after borrowing, Chief Financial Officer Kirti Vagadia said on May 29.  Suzlon reported an unexpected fourth-quarter loss of 3
billion rupees ($54 million) on May 25 as sales declined and
finance costs increased. It faces additional obligations,
including $200 million of convertible notes maturing in October
and ongoing principal repayments and interest costs on 100
billion rupees of debt refinanced in 2010.  The Pune-based company seeks to sell as much as $500
million in new, high-yield bonds later this year and raise as
much as $200 million by divesting “non-critical assets.” It
also expects to reduce the  interest rate  on borrowings by at
least 150 basis points from about 13 percent by reorganizing
debt across the group, Vagadia told analysts on May 29.  Suzlon’s shares closed 1.1 percent higher at 18.20 rupees
today before the announcement. The stock has fallen 65 percent
over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
