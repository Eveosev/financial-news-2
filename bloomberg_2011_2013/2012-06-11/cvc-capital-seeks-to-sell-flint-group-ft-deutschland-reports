CVC Capital Partner Ltd. seeks to
sell its ink manufacturer Flint Group, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing unidentified people close to the
companies.  Flint last year had 2.2 billion euros ($2.75 billion) in
sales and 310 million euros of earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, the newspaper said in a preview
of an article for tomorrowâ€™s edition. CVC has retained  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  and Greenhill & Co. as advisers, the FTD said.  A final decision will be taken June 18, the newspaper said.
CVC no longer seeks an initial public offering of Flint shares,
FTD reported. The process is in an early stage and about a dozen
potential buyers have been contacted by CVC and the bank, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
