Cocoa futures rose to a two-week
high on speculation that rain may reduce crops in West Africa.
Cotton and orange juice fell.  Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer, and Ghana, the
second-biggest, will get rain at least through June 13, the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Prices
gained for the fifth time in six sessions.  “Showers have been reported in most parts of West Africa
in recent days, and some think the current rains will delay
harvest and could hurt quality as drying the beans becomes
harder,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group
in Chicago, said in a report.  Cocoa for September delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $2,205
a metric ton at 10:44 a.m. on ICE Futures in New York. Earlier,
the price reached $2,230, the highest for a most-active contract
since May 22.  In  London , cocoa futures gained on NYSE Liffe in London.  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 1.2 percent to
69.03 cents a pound in New York.  In the year starting Aug. 1, inventories in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter, may rise to 5.15 million bales,
compared with 4.9 million estimated last month by the
government, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will update its forecast
tomorrow. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “There’s going to be a big surplus next year,”  Andy Ryan ,
a senior risk manager at INTL FCStone in Nashville, Tennessee,
said in a telephone interview.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.1345 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
