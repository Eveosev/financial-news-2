Europe  may buy the majority of its
natural gas at free-market rates, rather than at prices linked
to the cost of oil, by about 2014,  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said.  “By 2014, oil indexation pricing should represent the
minority of European gas supply,” Thierry Bros, a Paris-based
analyst at the bank, said in an e-mailed report today.  Contract renegotiations between gas buyers and sellers mean
that 55 percent of European supply may be oil-indexed this year,
he said. Arbitrators deciding on disputed oil-linked gas-supply
contracts between OAO Gazprom and buyers EON AG, RWE AG and
Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA, may decide that
agreements signed in the 1960s should now be spot-based,
according to the report.  The increase in gas traded on exchanges and over the
counter underlines attempts by Europe’s biggest utilities to end
a pricing system that has led to losses as oil has climbed,
while benefiting suppliers such as  Russia ’s Gazprom. The Russian
company may have to refund European customers as much as $10
billion in retroactive discounts, Moscow-based Interfax reported
in April.  Higher Norwegian gas deliveries to Europe in the first
three months of the year and lower Russian gas flows may mean
the backlog of Russian gas that must be taken at a later date
will grow by 1 billion cubic meters, Bros said.  The bank repeated its recommendation to sell  summer 2013
U.K. gas , saying that the fuel was too expensive to encourage
higher demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
