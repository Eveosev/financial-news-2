Serbia  put off until Sept. 10 the
deadline for binding offers for  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , the
country’s sole steel plant, citing requests from potential
buyers.  The second extension in two months is a result of
“interest from participants in the tender who need more time”
before deciding on a bid, government spokesman Danijel
Apostolovic said in a phone interview. The previous deadline was
today for the plant that Serbia bought back from  U.S. Steel
Corp. (X)  for $1 in January.  He declined to name the possible buyers. The government
said in April these include Ukraine’s Donetskstal-Metallurgical
Plant,  Russia ’s Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company Co OJSC
and Luxembourg-based  United Group SA  comprising Pilsen Steel Sro
and Baummash OJSC.  Sale of the unprofitable plant in Smederevo is a priority
for Serbia as it faces decline in foreign direct investments and
needs to improve its finances amid a widening budget deficit and
a slowing economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
