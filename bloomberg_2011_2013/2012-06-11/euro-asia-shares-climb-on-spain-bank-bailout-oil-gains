U.S. index futures rose on
speculation policy makers will do more stimulate the economy.
Commodities dropped for a fourth day and Spanish bonds fell.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures added 0.4 percent at
8:30 a.m. in  New York , paring gains of as much as 0.7 percent.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.3 percent. The yen
weakened against all but two of its 16 major peers. Treasuries 
snapped a three-day gain. Spanish bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields toward the highest since November. The S&P GSCI gauge of
24 raw materials slipped 0.5 percent, bringing the drop to 19
percent from this year’s high. Oil in London slid 1.1 percent,
and prices for French and German electricity fell to records.  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said he would support more stimulus. Italy plans to auction at
least 9.5 billion euros ($11.9 billion) of debt this week as
yields climb for  Europe ’s most-indebted countries following
Spain’s request for a bailout. Greece holds elections June 17
that may determine the country’s future in the euro.  “There is hope,” said Jerome Forneris, who helps manage
$8.5 billion at Banque Martin Maurel in Marseille. “Until the
Fed meets, investors will speculate. It’s a very important
factor of support for U.S. and European stocks. It wouldn’t
surprise me to see a strong announcement from the Fed to boost
the  U.S. economy .”  ‘Twist Useful’  The advance in U.S. futures indicated the  S&P 500  will
rebound following yesterday’s biggest decline in more than a
week. The Fed is scheduled to meet next week and announce its
rate decision on June 20.  “I’ve been in favor of pretty much any accommodative
policy I’ve heard about,” Evans said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu airing
today. “Extending the Twist would be useful,” he said,
referring to a plan expiring this month that lengthens the
average duration of bonds in the Fed’s portfolio.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  advanced even as two shares fell for every
one that advanced.  Lafarge SA (LG)  gained 1.5 percent as the world’s
biggest cement maker said it plans to make cost savings of 1.3
billion euros by 2015.  Spain’s 10-year bond  yield  climbed for a third day, rising
15 basis points to 6.66 percent. It reached 6.7 percent on May
30, the highest since Nov. 28. The cost of insuring against a
Spanish default also rose for a third day, with credit-default
swaps on the nation increasing nine basis points to 604. The
price jumped to a record 613.5 basis points on June 1.  Italy’s 10-year yield increased 12 basis points to 6.15
percent after reaching 6.2 percent, the highest since January.
 Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed seven basis points to 1.37
percent, with France’s yield rising 10 basis points to 2.66
percent.  Ratings at Risk  Fitch Ratings  said nations face downgrades as policy makers
fail to demonstrate they can end the euro-area’s debt crisis.
Ratings in the currency bloc are under “strong downward
pressure,” Fitch Managing Director  Ed Parker  said in Oslo today.  The European Financial Stability Facility plans to raise at
least 1 billion euros through a sale of bonds due April 2037 as
banks in Norway and Germany sell relatively safe covered bonds
after yesterday’s surge in non-financial deals.  The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries climbed two basis
points to 1.61 percent.  The yen slipped less than 0.1 percent against the dollar
and 0.2 percent versus the euro after the  International Monetary
Fund  said Japan’s currency was overvalued. The euro appreciated
0.1 percent to $1.2492. The  New Zealand dollar  strengthened
against all 16 of its major peers.  Dollar Peg  The Hong Kong dollar gained as much as 0.09 percent against
the U.S. currency, the most since March 8 on a closing basis,
after  Joseph Yam , the former Hong Kong monetary chief who helped
introduce a dollar peg in 1983, said the city should review its
currency policy. The currency pared gains as Financial Secretary
 John Tsang  said there’s no need to change the peg and Chief
Executive-elect Leung Chun-ying said he has no plans to do so.  Brent oil dropped for a fourth day to $96.89 a barrel as
OPEC ministers gathered in Vienna for a meeting on June 14 to
decide on output levels for the second half of the year. The
European benchmark contract for German power slid as much as 0.4
percent to 47.75 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. French electricity for 2013 declined 0.6
percent to 48.90 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest since the
contract began trading in September 2009.  Wheat advanced 1.2 percent in Chicago, the second
consecutive gain, before today’s U.S. Department of Agriculture
crop report, the first to be published during trading hours on
the Chicago Board of Trade.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 0.5 percent, after
closing yesterday at the highest level since May 29. The
Shanghai Composite Index, South Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s Taiex
Index slid at least 0.7 percent. The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100) 
advanced 0.7 percent as  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) 
jumped 1.6 percent after the U.S. said Turkey was among nations
that would be exempt from sanctions for buying Iranian oil.
Poland’s WIG20 Index and India’s Sensex Index climbed more than
1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
