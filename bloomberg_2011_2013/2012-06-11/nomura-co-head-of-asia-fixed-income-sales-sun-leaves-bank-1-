Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s co-head of
fixed-income sales for Asia, George Sun, left the bank today,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Sun, who was based in Hong Kong, is taking a senior sales
role at another sell-side bank and will remain in Asia, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the details are

Holdings Inc. after the Japanese bank acquired Lehman’s Asian
and European assets.  Felicity Albert, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Nomura,
