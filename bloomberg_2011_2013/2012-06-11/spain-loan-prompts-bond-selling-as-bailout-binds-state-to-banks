Spanish bond yields rose to the
highest in more than a week as investors speculated the 100
billion-euro ($125 billion) bailout for lenders may fall short,
while binding the banks and sovereign more closely together.  The lifeline from the euro area, aimed at loosening the
connection between banks and the state, risks doing the opposite
as foreign investors continue to shun the nation’s bonds and
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government grows increasingly
dependent on domestic lenders.  “This 100 billion will be added to the public finances of
 Spain  so it just reinforces the link between banks and the
sovereign,” Olly Burrows, credit analyst at Rabobank
International, said in a phone interview from London. “Spain is
receiving funds to bail out its banks, which have been buying
Spanish debt while everyone else has been getting out.”  Spain agreed to take the aid in loans to be added to the
public debt burden that rose to 69 percent of gross domestic
product last year. The loans, which Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos said will carry an interest that’s more favorable than
market rates, will be channeled through the country’s bank-
rescue fund.  Bonds Drop  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose 12 basis points to
6.63 percent, approaching a euro-era record of 6.78 percent
reached on Nov. 17. The gap with equivalent German securities
was unchanged at 529 basis points.  While Spain said the loans would “not undermine the
present conditions” of outstanding Spanish debt,  Germany  said
the aid should come from the euro area’s permanent backstop,
which gives preferred status to official creditors over other
bondholders.  Foreign investors cut their share of Spain’s outstanding
debt to 37 percent in April from 50 percent at the end of last
year, Treasury data show. That left Spanish banks, helped by
emergency loans from the  European Central Bank , to make up the
difference. They increased their share to 29 percent from 17
percent over the same period.  Capital Flight  Spain saw 22.6 billion euros of foreign investment in
stocks and bonds leave the country in March, compared with 2
billion euros a year earlier, Bank of Spain data show. At a debt
auction on May 17, foreign investors accounted for just 20
percent to 30 percent of buying, a government official who
declined to be named told reporters in  Madrid .  “Non-residents are likely to continue to reduce their
exposure to the Spanish sovereign, until the fiscal situation
shows definite signs of improvement, which means that Spanish
banks will have to continue to take up the slack,” said  Gilles Moec , co-chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG in London.  Spanish banks were among the biggest beneficiaries of 1
trillion euros of three-year emergency loans from the ECB, which
were recycled into sovereign bonds in a trend Economy Minister
Luis de Guindos said in April “increased the correlation
between sovereign risk and banking risk.” The ECB may need to
offer another round of that financing to ensure local banks can
fund the sovereign, Moec said.  Downgrade Threat  A day before Spain sought the bailout, Moody’s Investors
Service said on June 8 it may review Spain’s A3 credit rating as
a rescue became more likely and estimates of the cost of shoring
up banks increased. As a bailout approached, “the increased
risk to the country’s creditors may prompt further rating
actions,” Moody’s said.  Still, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service said the bank
bailout had no immediate effect on its BBB+ rating of Spain. The
loan would have to “materially exceed” the 100 billion-euro
ceiling for the preferred creditor status of the ESM to “reduce
the likelihood of bondholders being paid in full,” the company
said in a statement.  As Spain suffers its second recession since 2009 and
unemployment exceeds 24 percent, banks’ bad loans are set to
keep rising, increasing the risk for the sovereign. The deepest
 austerity  measures on record are undermining demand as the
government tries to cut the deficit to 3 percent of GDP next
year from 8.9 percent in 2011.  “There’s a risk of bailout creep,” said Nicholas Spiro,
managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in  London .  “The
question on the lips of every investor in the coming days and
weeks will be: will the Spanish sovereign be next?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
