U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will travel to India June 27-28 for the third annual
meeting of the U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership,
the department said today.  Geithner will take part in a meeting with Indian Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  in Delhi on the first day of the
visit, the Treasury said in a statement released in Washington.
Geithner will be in Mumbai on June 28 to meet with Reserve Bank
of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao and Indian business leaders,
the Treasury said.  “The U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership has
served as a platform for greater cooperation on economic issues
of importance to both nations,” the Treasury said in a
statement. “Both countries recognize the importance of
expanding bilateral economic engagement, noting the rapid growth
of U.S.-India economic ties and the increasing range of global
macroeconomic and financial issues on which the United States
and India cooperate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
