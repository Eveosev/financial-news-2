China  may cut benchmark  interest
rates  up to two more times this year as part of “aggressive”
easing to counter the nation’s slowdown, said Ding Shuang, a
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  economist.  “ China’s economy  is still on a downward trend,” Ding, who
formerly worked for the People’s Bank of China, told Bloomberg
Television in Hong Kong today. “We do not see a clear turning
point yet, and policy support is very much needed in order to
stabilize growth.”  The expansion this quarter may be “very weak” at 7
percent to 7.5 percent, Ding said after the government announced
data for industrial production, inflation, fixed-asset
investment and  exports  over the past two days. Better-than-
forecast trade growth in May may not be sustained as a likely
recession in the European Union restrains demand, he said.  The central bank last week cut rates for the first time
since 2008 in what Ding said was a “very strong signal of more
aggressive policy easing.”  Overseas shipments climbed 15.3 percent in May from a year
earlier, the customs bureau said yesterday, exceeding all 29
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Industrial output rose by
less than 10 percent for a second month and retail sales
increased the least in almost six years excluding holiday-month
distortions, statistics bureau reports showed June 9.  “Growth seems to have stabilized but at a very low
level,” he said. “Industrial production continued to
disappoint.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
