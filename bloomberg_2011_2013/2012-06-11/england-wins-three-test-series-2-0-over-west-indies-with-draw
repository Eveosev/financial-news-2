England  won its three-Test series
with West Indies 2-0 as their final match was abandoned as a
draw this afternoon because of rain.  England had already clinched the series with victories in
the first two matches. The host team finished yesterday on 221-5
at Edgbaston in Birmingham in response to West Indies opening
innings of 426 runs.  The first two days of the final Test were washed out.
England retains its place atop the world rankings with the
series win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
