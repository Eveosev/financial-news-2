Refined-tin shipments from  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest exporter of the metal, climbed 5 percent in
May from a month earlier as the country is entering peak
production season.  Exports gained to 7,866 metric tons last month from 7,489
tons in April, according to data released today by the Trade
Ministry. Sales were 7,013 tons in May last year.  Prices have declined 22 percent from a 6-month high in
February on concern the debt crisis in  Europe  and China’s
economic slowdown may erode demand for the metal used in
soldering and packaging. Lower prices may help to ease revenue
at producers including  Malaysia Smelting Corp. (SMELT)  and  PT Timah (TINS) , the
world’s second and third-largest producers.  “We should be into the peak season for production and
exports now, although the price below $20,000 must have some
adverse impact on small-scale production,” Peter Kettle, a
research manager at  St. Albans , England-based ITRI Ltd., said by
e-mail. “Most of them should still be covering cash costs at
current prices,” he said, adding that shipments may reach 7,500
tons to 8,000 tons this month.  Indonesia represents about 40 percent of global tin exports,
according to ITRI. The ministry’s data released today was based
on reports from surveyors prior to shipments.  Global Demand  Exports in the first five-months of the year fell 4 percent
from a year earlier to 37,668 tons, according to ministry data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  “Business in most parts of the world seems to be OK,”
Kettle said. “The main relatively weak area seems to have been
the  China  solder business, especially for domestic appliances.
However, China seems to be continuing to import quite large
volumes of tin, which may reflect mine supply problems there.”  Global demand for tin is expected to climb to about 363,000
tons to 365,000 tons this year from 359,500 tons last year,
Kettle said.  Three-month delivery tin rose 0.5 percent to $19,800 a ton
