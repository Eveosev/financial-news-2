The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell after  Spain  asked
for a 100 billion euro ($126 billion) bailout for its banks.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell six basis points to 314 at
8 a.m. in London. Contracts on Spain dropped 22 basis points to
565 and Italy fell 15 to 529, signaling improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings tumbled 26 basis
points to 670. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings fell six basis points to 170.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers dropped 13 basis points to 266 and the
subordinated index declined 22 to 430.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
