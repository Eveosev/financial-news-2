First Uranium Corp. (FUM)  rose to the
highest level in more than three months after South African
investor Mandla Kumalo offered to buy a stake, blocking the sale
of the Ezulwini mine to  Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)   The stock increased 2.2 percent to 1.42 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, the strongest level on a closing basis
since Feb. 24. Kumvest (Pty) Ltd., Kumalo’s wholly-owned
investment company, offered to buy a 26 percent stake at 37
Canadian cents per share, almost double First Uranium’s closing
share price in Toronto on June 8.  The offer is conditional on a vote against the sale of the
group’s gold and uranium mine, the appointment of a new
management team and access to the company’s records to perform a
due diligence study, First Uranium said in a statement today.
New management will be given 90 days to present a turnaround
plan.  “The proposed offer looks too conditional,” Edward Sterck, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “I suspect the board of First Uranium
will not approve it.”  First Uranium has  plunged 98 percent  in the past five years
after uranium prices dropped and South African operations faced
delays. The Toronto-based company is selling assets for $405
million to help pay off debt, including about C$150 million
($146 million) due June 30.  The firm has scheduled a June 13 shareholder vote on its
asset sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
