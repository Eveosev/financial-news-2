Serbia’s foreign-currency reserves
fell 2 percent in May as the central bank continued to sell
euros to bolster the dinar.  Reserves dropped to 10.2 billion euros ($12.8 billion) from
10.4 billion euros in April, largely due to central bank actions
on the local  currency market  which cost 472.7 million euros last
month, the Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today. The
reserves were 12.1 billion euros at the end of last year.  The dinar weakened about 12 percent over the first five
months of the year before regaining some ground last week. The
central bank spent about 1.2 billion euros this year to counter
pressures on the currency, amid inconclusive elections on May 6
and efforts to form a government.  The central bank’s net reserves, excluding deposits by
commercial lenders and money from the  International Monetary
Fund , fell to 5.53 billion euros from 5.9 billion euros in
April. They equaled 453 percent of M1 money supply, up from 421
percent a month earlier, or more than seven months of the Balkan
country’s average imports.  The second-biggest drain in May was a 115.3 million-euro
installment to repay Serbia’s debt to citizens whose savings
were held in the early 1990’s and which the government
compensates through so-called old savings bonds.  Inflows included 91.4 million euros from the sale of euro-
denominated government debt, 40.5 million euros from credit
lines and donations, and 35.2 million euros from commercial
banks, which are adding funds to meet mandatory  reserve
requirements .  Interbank foreign-currency trading rose in May to 1.1
billion euros from 817 million euros in April, bringing the
five-month trading volume to 6.43 billion euros, the central
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
