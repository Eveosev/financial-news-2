Corn climbed for a fourth day and
soybeans and wheat gained as dry weather threatened to hurt
crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper.  Iowa  and  Illinois , the largest U.S. corn and soybean
growing states, may be mostly dry this week after showers in
some areas today, according to the  National Weather Service .
Conditions in the Midwest range from “abnormally dry” to
“severe” drought after months of below-normal rain, according
to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s U.S. Drought Monitor.  “The weather forecast for the U.S. gets worse and worse,”
Nick Higgins, an analyst at Rabobank International, said in an
interview in  London . “It gets dry again this week, and that
certainly creates some issues.”  Corn for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $6.0075 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:59 a.m. London time. The
most-active contract increased 8.4 percent last week. Soybeans
for November delivery gained 0.5 percent to $13.3975 a bushel,
after advancing 5.9 percent last week.  Prices gained before a report tomorrow in which the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  may cut its outlook for domestic corn
supplies. Stockpiles before the 2013 harvest may be 1.743
billion bushels, or 7.3 percent less than forecast a month ago,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  “If the hot and dry weather continues, it will be
bullish” for corn,  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for
research at IDO Securities Co. in  Tokyo , said in an e-mail.  South America Drought  China , the biggest soybean buyer, imported the most in five
months in May as processors purchased more on concern that
drought in  South America  would cut global supplies. Shipments
rose 8.2 percent to 5.28 million metric tons from 4.88 million
tons in April and compared with 4.56 million tons a year
earlier, customs said in a  statement  yesterday. Purchases will
rise to 6 million tons in June and reach a record 57 million
tons in the year ending Sept. 30, according to researcher
Grain.gov.cn.  Wheat for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to $6.35 a bushel
in Chicago, extending last week’s 2.9 percent advance. In Paris,
November-delivery milling wheat gained 0.2 percent to 210 euros
($264.15) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Global wheat stockpiles may drop to 185.06 million tons on
June 1, 2013, down 6.1 percent from a year earlier, according to
the Bloomberg survey before the USDA report tomorrow. Dry
weather has threatened output from the U.S. to  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
