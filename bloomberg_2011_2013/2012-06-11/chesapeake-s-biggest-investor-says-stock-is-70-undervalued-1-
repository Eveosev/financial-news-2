Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) ’s largest
investor said shares of the U.S. natural-gas producer facing a
$22 billion cash-flow shortfall are 70 percent undervalued.  Southeastern Asset Management, which holds a 13.9 percent
stake in Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake, said the share price
implies a gas price below that of benchmark futures contracts
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Memphis, Tennessee-
based Southeastern commented in a U.S. Securities & Exchange
Commission filing today.  The stock price also doesn’t reflect any value for
Chesapeake’s portfolio of unproven reserves, Southeastern said.  Southeastern CEO O. Mason Hawkins urged Chesapeake’s board
to “be open to any offers to acquire the whole company” in a
May 7 letter to directors. He also said any offer would have to
recognize “the longer-term value of the company.”  Chesapeake fell 4.1 percent to $17.61 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 21 percent this year amid growing
investor mistrust of Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon’s
use of personal stakes in company-operated wells to obtain
private loans.  McClendon is being forced to step down from the chairman’s
role and half the non-executive directors will be replaced later
this month by nominees of Southeastern and billionaire investor
 Carl Icahn .  To contact the reporter on this story:
