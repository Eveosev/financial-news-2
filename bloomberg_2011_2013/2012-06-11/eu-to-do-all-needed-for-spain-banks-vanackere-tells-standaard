The European Union will do
everything needed to save the Spanish banking industry, Belgian
Finance Minister Steven Vanackere told  De Standaard  in an
interview.  “Precisely how much will be necessary isn’t yet clear,”
as the country awaits reports on its banks by independent
auditors later this month, the newspaper quoted Vanackere as
saying after euro-area finance ministers on June 9 agreed to
provide  Spain  as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to
rescue its banking system.  “With this we give the signal that we will do everything
to rescue the Spanish banking sector,” Vanackere was quoted as
saying. “ Europe  has taken a swift and strong decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
