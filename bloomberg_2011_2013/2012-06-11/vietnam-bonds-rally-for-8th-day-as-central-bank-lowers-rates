Vietnamese  government bonds  rallied
for an eighth day as the central bank cut benchmark  interest
rates  for a fourth month. The dong was little changed.  The five-year yield dropped to the lowest level in almost
three years as the  State Bank of Vietnam  cut its repurchase rate
for daily open-market operations to 10 percent from 11 percent
today, according to an e-mailed statement. Last week, it
announced cuts of one percentage point to its refinancing,
discount and dong-deposit rates, effective today, according to
its website.  “With inflationary pressures expected to ease further and
lower  oil prices , we expect the  State Bank  of Vietnam to cut
rates by a further 200 basis points in the coming months,”
Trinh D. Nguyen, a Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings
Plc, wrote in a research note released today.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.45 percent, the
lowest level since June 30, 2009, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,990 per dollar as of 3:59 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,998 on June 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
