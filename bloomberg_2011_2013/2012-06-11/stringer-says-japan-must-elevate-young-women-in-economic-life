Japanese companies need to elevate
young people and women and promote risk-taking to boost the
nation’s economy, Sony Corp. Chairman  Howard Stringer  said.  Companies in the nation, including electronics makers,
suffer from a lack of flexibility and need to make it easier for
young people and women to contribute and be promoted, the
executive said in a speech at an economic conference in Tokyo
today.  “Lose them, and you lose the future,” Stringer said.
“People’s attitudes have to shift.”  Entrepreneurs such as Facebook Inc. founder  Mark Zuckerberg ,
28, and  Akio Morita , who was 25 when he co-founded Sony,
demonstrate how young people can drive innovation when they are
encouraged to take risks, Stringer said.  Sony took “small” steps to elevate women while Stringer
was chief executive officer, he said. The company named Nicole Seligman president of  Sony Corp. (6758)  of America in March, giving her
oversight of areas including legal affairs and communications.  Stringer stepped down as CEO of Tokyo-based Sony in April,
making way for Kazuo Hirai to lead Japan’s largest exporter of
consumer electronics. The company aims to return to profit this
fiscal year for the first time since 2008, after posting a
record  loss  of 457 billion yen ($5.7 billion) in the year ended
March 31 amid falling prices and the strong yen.  Stringer, who holds master’s and bachelor’s degrees in
history from Oxford University, joined Sony in 1997 after a
career spanning two decades at U.S. television company CBS Corp.
