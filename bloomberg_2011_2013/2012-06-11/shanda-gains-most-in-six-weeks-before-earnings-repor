Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  gained the most in
New York in six weeks as investors bought shares of the Chinese
online games operator which is set to report earnings tomorrow.  The Shanghai-based company climbed 3.2 percent to $4.17 as
of 1:21 p.m. New York time, poised for its biggest gain since
April 27. Shanda, which had fallen 22 percent this quarter
through June 8, may  report  adjusted earnings per American
depositary shares of 23 cents on sales of $220 million,
according to a Bloomberg survey of two analysts.  “Expectations are low and valuations are modest, so if
they can beat forecasts by a couple of cents and give better-
than-expected guidance, the stock may pop,”  Adam Krejcik , an
analyst at  Roth Capital  in  Newport Beach , California, said in a
phone interview. “Like a lot of their peers, Shanda has found
it difficult to produce new games that are incremental and
popular.”  Shanda trades at 5.9 times reported earnings, near its
lowest level since March 5. Krejcik has a neutral rating on
Shanda with a 12-month price target of $4.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
