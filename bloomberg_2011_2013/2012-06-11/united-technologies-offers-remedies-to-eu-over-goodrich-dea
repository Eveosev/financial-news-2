United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , which
makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines,
offered concessions to European Union regulators in their review
of its $16.5 billion bid for  Goodrich Corp. (GR)   The European Commission  said  the companies offered remedies
to soothe possible antitrust concerns over the deal, according
to a filing on its website today. It didn’t give details of the
offer and didn’t change an Aug. 31 deadline to rule on the deal.  United Technologies  agreed to buy Goodrich in September,
adding a maker of aircraft landing gear and jet-turbine casings
to take advantage of a record surge in commercial plane orders.  “All regulatory filings are on track and we continue to
anticipate timing of close in line with what we have previously
commented,”  John Moran , a spokesman for Hartford, Connecticut-
based United Technologies, said in an e-mail. He declined to
comment on what the companies had offered regulators to
alleviate any antitrust concerns.  Goodrich didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
antitrust remedies outside of normal business hours.  Louis Chenevert , the company’s chief executive officer,
said last month that United Technologies plans to close the deal
as soon as mid-July.  The purchase has an enterprise value of $18.4 billion,
including $1.9 billion in net debt, the companies said in a
statement when they announced the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
