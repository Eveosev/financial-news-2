(Corrects month to July in the second paragraph.)  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest state-owned crude exporter, will provide full contracted
supplies to Asian customers in July, according to buyers at five
regional refiners who received notification from the producer.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will supply 100
percent of volumes agreed under long-term contracts, said the
people at refining companies in  Japan , Thailand and  South Korea ,
declining to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media. July will be the 32nd month in a row that
 Saudi Arabia  has not trimmed exports.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
supplies 40 percent of the world’s crude, will keep its official
daily production ceiling at 30 million barrels when its 12
members meet in Vienna on June 14, all 20 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News said. The group has agreed to cuts at
every meeting in the past 10 years that coincided with a price
drop of more than 10 percent in the preceding three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg News show.  Brent oil has fallen 21 percent since March 13 to $99.47 a
barrel in  London  as of June 8, the latest closing price, on
mounting concern that Europe’s debt crisis will derail global
growth and curb demand for energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
