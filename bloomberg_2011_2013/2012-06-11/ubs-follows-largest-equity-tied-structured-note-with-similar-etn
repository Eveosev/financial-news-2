UBS AG (UBS)  is coming to market with an
exchange-traded note tied to the performance of large U.S.
growth stocks less than a month after selling a similar security
in the largest equity-linked sale in more than two years.  The FI Enhanced Big Cap Growth ETN, which started trading
today under the ticker FBG, tracks twice the gains and losses of
the Russell 1000 Growth Index, according to a  prospectus  filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank sold
$946.2 million of structured notes tied to the measure to Fisher
Asset Management LLC on May 16, the largest such deal since at
least the beginning of January 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Russell 1000 gauge, which follows companies with the
fastest earnings growth, has climbed 6.4 percent this year,
compared with a 4.6 percent rise for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, Bloomberg data show.  UBS has 46 ETNs in the U.S. with about $1 billion of
assets, Bloomberg data show. The U.S. industry has a market
capitalization of about $15.5 billion, less than 2 percent of
the $1.2 trillion of exchange-traded funds.  ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer’s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn’t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
