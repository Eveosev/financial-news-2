Mexico ’s peso fell from its
strongest level in almost three weeks as  Spain ’s request for
assistance to shore up its banks failed to quell concern that
Europe’s debt crisis is getting worse.  The peso weakened 1.2 percent to 14.0940 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City after earlier climbing 0.8 percent to
13.8108, the strongest intraday level since May 22. The currency
is down 1.1 percent this year.  “The market is just skeptical,” said Flavia Cattan- Naslausky, a Latin America strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Without any certainty or
consensus on these measures, nothing really is going to happen
before the Greek elections anyway.”  The peso strengthened earlier after a report showed
Mexico’s industrial output increased 3.6 percent in April from a
year earlier. The economy may expand as much as 4.25 percent
this year, compared with 3.9 percent in 2011, the central bank
said May 16.  Speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis would weigh on global
growth and the market for Mexican exports helped make the peso
Latin America’s worst-performing major currency in 2011.  Italy’s 10-year bonds reversed early gains in the first
trading after the Spanish bailout and fell for a fourth day.
Italy has 2 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion) of debt, more as a
share of its economy than any developed nation except Greece and
 Japan .  Aid for Spain  Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on June 9
that he would request as much as 100 billion euros in emergency
loans from the euro area to shore up a banking system hobbled by
more than 180 billion euros of bad assets.  The Greek party Syriza, one of the two parties leading
polls before an election on June 17, has said it won’t adhere to
terms agreed to in the nation’s European Union and International
Monetary Fund bailouts, a move that may drive the country to
abandon the euro.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.07 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.52
centavo to 134.39 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
