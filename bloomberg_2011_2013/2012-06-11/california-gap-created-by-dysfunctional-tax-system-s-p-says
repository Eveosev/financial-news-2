California’s $15.7 billion deficit
is the result of a “dysfunctional” tax structure that hasn’t
kept up with changes in the state’s economy, according to
 Standard & Poor’s .  The state’s spending as a share of personal income is at
its lowest since 1973, S&P said in a report today.  Personal-income-tax collections account for a larger
portion of the budget than  sales tax , the ratings company said.
The former makes up 63 percent of general-fund revenue in
Governor Jerry Brown’s fiscal 2013 budget proposal, compared
with 51.5 percent in 2010, Gabriel Petek, an S&P analyst, said
in the report. Meanwhile, the state’s sales tax applies only to
 consumer goods  and not services.  During the past several decades, “California’s economy
evolved to one more heavily based on services rather than retail
sales,” Petek said in the report. “But the overall system of
taxation has remained largely unchanged.”  Growth in California’s tax revenue has also slowed, S&P
said. The collections grew at a 1.2 percent average rate since
2000, compared with 8.24 percent yearly when expanding the
horizon to 1950.  To contact the reporters on this story:
