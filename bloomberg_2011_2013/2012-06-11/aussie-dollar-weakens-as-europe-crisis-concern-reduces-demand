Australia ’s dollar weakened against
its U.S. counterpart as stocks and commodity prices dropped amid
increased concern that Europe’s debt crisis is spreading.  New Zealand’s dollar also fell, reversing earlier gains, as
concern that Spain’s bailout package signals a worsening of the
debt crisis damped demand for higher-yielding assets. Spain
asked for as much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) to save
its banking system, making it the fourth member of the currency
bloc to seek a rescue.  The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to 98.64 U.S. cents
yesterday in New York after earlier gaining as much as 0.9
percent. The Aussie dropped 0.6 percent to 78.36 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar declined 0.2 percent to 77.06 U.S.
cents after appreciating as much as 1.1 percent. The kiwi, as
the currency is nicknamed, lost 0.2 percent to 61.10 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities slumped 0.4 percent and
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials fell
0.8 percent.  Seven months after winning a landslide victory, Spanish
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  was forced to abandon his bid to
recapitalize banks without external help. The bailout loan will
be channeled through the state’s bank-rescue fund and extended
to lenders that need it, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos Jurado
said in  Madrid  on June 9.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds fell for a fourth day,
reversing earlier gains. The Spanish yield rose 31 basis points
to 6.52 percent, while the rate on the Italian securities
climbed 27 basis points to 6.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
