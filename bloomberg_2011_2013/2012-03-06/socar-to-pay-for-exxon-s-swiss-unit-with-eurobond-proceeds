State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar, will pay for  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Swiss unit with $200
million out of the $500 million raised in Eurobonds last month.  Socar will use the assets of Esso Schweiz to help pay off
debt, Vice President for Economic Affairs Suleyman Qasimov said
by e-mail today. He gave no further details.  Of the $500 million received from the Eurobond sale, $133
million will be used to buy a 10 percent share in  Turkey ’s
 Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) , private Azeri news agency Trend
said yesterday, citing an unnamed Socar official.  The remaining $166 million will be used to repay some of
Socar’s foreign debts, including $133 million to BNP Paribas and
$33 million to Yapi Kredi Bank, the official said, according to
