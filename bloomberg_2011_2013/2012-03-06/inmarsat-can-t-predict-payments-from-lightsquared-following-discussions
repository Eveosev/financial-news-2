Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , the biggest provider
of satellite services to the maritime industry, said it’s in
talks with customer  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT)  and can’t predict whether
it will receive outstanding payments.  While the companies are talking, “investors should take a
very conservative stance on payments being received,” Chief
Executive Officer Rupert Pearce said on a conference call today.
LightSquared’s business model faces “significant uncertainty”
because of U.S. regulatory developments, London-based Inmarsat
said in a statement.  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared, the U.S. company struggling
to gain approval for a wireless service, failed to pay Inmarsat
$56.3 million last month after making payments to the British
company in line with contractual milestones. Inmarsat said today
it “cannot provide any assurance that the outstanding payment
or further payments” in relation to a spectrum-cooperation
agreement with LightSquared will be received.  Inmarsat issued a notice of default, giving LightSquared 60
days to remedy the issue, it said Feb. 20. LightSquared said in
a statement at the time that Inmarsat must fulfil certain
obligations tied to the deployment of its terrestrial and
satellite network and that “several matters” need to be
resolved. It didn’t give more details.  Revenue from LightSquared was “the primary driver” of
overall sales growth for 2011, Inmarsat said today. Full-year
sales at the satellite operator jumped 20 percent to $1.41
billion. Revenue from other income, which includes LightSquared,
soared to $238.1 million from $37.1 million.  Outlook for 2012  The LightSquared payment “is certainly owed,” Pearce said
today. He added that the “current headwinds will not prevent
underlying growth.”  Inmarsat shares fell 0.9 percent to 464.1 pence as of
11:41 a.m. in  London . The stock has risen about 15 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 2.08 billion pounds
($3.28 billion).  Revenue from Inmarsat’s core mobile satellite services, or
MSS, and Inmarsat Solutions businesses is “unaffected” by the
LightSquared developments, the company said today. “We expect
our 2012 revenue growth trends in our core MSS business to
improve on 2011,” the CEO said.  U.S. Regulator  Average annual MSS revenue growth for 2012 and 2013 will be
between flat and 2 percent, Inmarsat said in the statement. It
predicted an increase of 8 percent to 12 percent in the 2014 to
2016 period, helped by revenue from its Global Xpress service.  Inmarsat said it’s “confident” in the growth prospects of
new services including XpressLink and FleetBroadband. In the
near term, it projected that “overall revenue growth will be
constrained by reducing revenue from  Afghanistan  and service
migration factors.”  Inmarsat is giving LightSquared access to part of its
spectrum. LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, wants to offer high-speed  Internet service 
to as many as 260 million people using airwaves previously
reserved mainly for satellites.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said last month
that it would block LightSquared after finding that the wireless
venture would disrupt navigation gear.  “There is no doubt that the spectrum is an important
asset,” Pearce said. “We will continue to look for
opportunities to leverage our spectrum.”  Inmarsat’s 2011 net income dropped 4.4 percent from a year
earlier to $249.3 million as income tax expenses rose to $117.4
million from $72.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
