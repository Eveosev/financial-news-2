OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest
producer of coal for steelmakers, slid the most in three months
in U.S. trading on concern demand for the commodity will decline
as Chinese economic growth slows.  Mechel (MTLR) ’s  American depositary receipts  tumbled 8.1 percent
to settle at $9.70 in New York, the biggest one-day drop since
Dec. 19. The ADRs are trading at a 2.1 percent discount to the
company’s Moscow-listed shares. Mechel is the biggest decliner
on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index  of Russian companies traded
in the U.S. today.  China  cut its economic growth forecast to the lowest since
2004 yesterday as the European debt crisis and sluggish U.S.
recovery dim the outlook for the world’s biggest exporter.
Moscow-based  Renaissance Capital  expects coking coal prices to
average $219 a metric ton in 2012, compared with $289 last year,
according to equity analyst Vasiliy Kuligin.  “Mechel makes most of its revenue from selling coking
coal,” Kuligin said by phone from Moscow. “China won’t need as
much coking coal as was previously thought and the coking coal
price will continue to weaken, hurting Mechel further.”  While Renaissance has a “quite bearish view” on Mechel,
it is retaining a “hold” recommendation on the stock.  Mechel’s ADRs, which lost 71 percent last year, have gained
14 percent in 2012. The company’s  stock  listed on Moscow’s Micex
Index lost 10 percent to 293.70 rubles yesterday, or the
equivalent of $9.91. One ADR represents one ordinary share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
