Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  agreed with Tennet
Holding BV to buy shares in two German offshore cable projects
connecting wind farms to the onshore electricity grid as the
Japanese trading company seeks to expand in  Europe .  Tennet would retain a majority, the Dutch company said in a
statement on its website today. Helwin2 and Dolwin2 have 1.59
gigawatts of capacity and need 1.7 billion euros ($2.2 billion)
of investment, with “an expected third-party equity stake
around 340 million euros.” The projects, due to be completed by
2015, will carry enough energy to supply 1.5 million homes.  Europe’s wind market is luring Asian companies as countries
including the U.K. and Germany seek to curb greenhouse-gas
emissions and increase energy security.  Germany , Europe’s
biggest economy, plans to install 10 gigawatts of offshore
turbines by 2020 as it abandons nuclear power. Tennet is working
on nine connection projects in the German  North Sea , it said.  The letter of intent announced today expands on an accord
in February under which Mitsubishi agreed to purchase 49 percent
in two other German cable projects from Tennet called Borwin1
and Borwin2 for a total of 240 million euros.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
