Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia ’s
second-biggest lender, will eliminate 119 information technology
jobs to cut costs as demand for mortgages has slowed to the
weakest level in more than three decades.  Most of the positions are Sydney-based and are in addition
to the as many as 400 reductions announced by Westpac last month,
spokesman Paul Marriage said in a telephone interview. Today’s
cuts were first announced by the Finance Sector Union, which
represents bank workers.  Australia’s four largest banks may eliminate 7,000 jobs in
the next two years, seeking to reduce labor costs that account
for 58 percent of expenses, UBS AG said in January. Home-loan
growth has slowed to the lowest level since 1977, after the
country’s central bank raised  interest rates  seven times from
October 2009 to November 2010.  “We’re committed to retaining our core, high-skill
technology  workforce  in Westpac, but some roles can be more
efficiently provided by external specialists,” Marriage said.
“We’re doing this to improve  customer service  and remain
competitive. They are difficult decisions and we’re aware of the
impact on our people.”  Westpac, which employed 37,712 people as of Sept. 30, fell
1.1 percent to A$20.53 at the close in Sydney. The shares have
fallen 13 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
