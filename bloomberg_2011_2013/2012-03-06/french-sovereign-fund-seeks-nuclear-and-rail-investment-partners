France ’s sovereign wealth fund is
working this year with leaders of the country’s aerospace,
nuclear and rail industries to create funds that will invest as
much as 530 million euros ($697 million) in their suppliers.  The aeronautical fund, designed to help suppliers meet
rising demand from companies such as Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA) ,
may initially amount to about 150 million euros and eventually
reach 300 million euros, Jean-Yves Gilet, chief executive
officer of France’s Strategic Investment Fund, or FSI, said at a
press conference in Paris today.  A separate fund of about 150 million euros will aim to
structure the supply chain of French nuclear companies such as
 Areva SA (AREVA) , and another fund of as much as 80 million euros may
help consolidate suppliers of the country’s rail industry, Gilet
said. The FSI typically provides 30 percent to 40 percent of
such funds, he said.  The French sovereign fund had 14.5 billion euros in stakes
of French companies at the end of 2011, down from 16.2 billion
euros a year earlier, as the decline in stock markets and asset
sales more than offset new investments, according to the FSI’s
annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
