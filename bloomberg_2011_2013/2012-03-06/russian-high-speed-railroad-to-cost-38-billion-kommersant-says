Russia’s first high-speed railroad
between Moscow and St. Petersburg may cost as much as 1.12
trillion rubles ($38 billion), Kommersant reported, citing
estimates by the country’s Transportation Ministry.  The state budget should finance at least half of the
construction and provide a 25-year subsidy to a private investor
who may be selected by year-end, the Moscow-based daily said,
citing the ministry’s proposal to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
