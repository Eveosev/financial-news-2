Banks should contact customers who
were wrongly sold loan coverage known as payment protection
insurance and explain how to apply for compensation, the U.K.’s
Financial Services Authority said today.  Banks that mis-sold insurance on credit-card and mortgage
payments should write to customers to warn them of the deadline
for making claims, the London-based FSA said in a statement on
its website.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s largest mortgage
lender, posted a wider-than-estimated full-year loss last month
due to reimbursing customers for improperly-sold payment
protection insurance, or PPI. The British Bankers’ Association,
an industry group, lost a court challenge last year to stop the
regulator from ordering them to pay compensation.  “This is important guidance and marks a key moment in the
story of PPI,” Martin Wheatley, the FSA’s managing director for
conduct, said in an e-mailed statement. “We are now beginning
to see firms considering how to treat customers who were mis-
sold but have not complained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
