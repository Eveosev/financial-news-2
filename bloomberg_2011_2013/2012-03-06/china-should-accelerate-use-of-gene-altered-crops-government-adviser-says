China , the world’s biggest grain
producer, should speed up the sale of genetically modified crops
to boost output and food security, said a state researcher and
political adviser.  The Ministry of Agriculture should simplify the rules on
biotechnology because it slows effective use of research results,
Huang Dafang, director of Biotechnology Research, said at the
 Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference  in Beijing.  While China approved strains of gene-modified rice and corn
in 2009, it said mass production would be allowed only after
trial planting and public acceptance. China has made advancing
agricultural technology a top priority this year in its so-
called No. 1 policy paper.  “We are advocating” a faster approach, Huang said. For
the government to amend the approval process may take one to
three years, he said.  The ministry in  2009  said the so-called phytase corn,
which allows animals to better process phosphate, and a variety
of insect-resistant rice meet safety standards.  The corn seed will reduce the phosphate waste from
livestock animals by 40 percent, reducing their environmental
impact, said Huang, whose center developed the variety.  --William Bi, Feiwen Rong. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
