Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after Citgo Petroleum Corp. said it shut an alkylation unit at
the Corpus Christi, Texas, plant after a possible flange leak.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  narrowed 2.13 cents to 25 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
2:17 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 0.59 cent to $2.9927 a gallon.  Water cannons automatically activated at 7:15 p.m. local
time yesterday around the perimeter of the unit at the Citgo
refinery after sensors detected a leak, according to a company
statement. No one was injured and the incident was confined to
the refinery, Citgo said.  Investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board are en
route to  Corpus Christi  to look into the leak, Daniel Horowitz,
a director of affairs with the Washington-based board, said in a
telephone interview.  Reformulated 87-octane gasoline in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  weakened
2.62 cents to a discount of 28.75 cents a gallon.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
widened 1 cent to 23 cents a gallon versus futures.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  plans to return crude oil Line 14 to service
early today and Line 64 after a fire in Illinois on March 8,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  The company halted crude deliveries on the lines on March 3
after two vehicles collided, starting a fire at the pumping
station near New Lenox,  Illinois , 36 miles (58 kilometers)
southwest of Chicago. Two people were killed and several others
injured in the crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
