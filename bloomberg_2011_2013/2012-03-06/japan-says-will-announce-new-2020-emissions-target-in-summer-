Japan  said it will decide on a new
emissions reduction target for 2020 this summer after a revision
of its energy and environment goals prompted by the nuclear
power accident at Fukushima.  Japan is developing “new energy policies from scratch,”
the country said in a submission posted today on the website of
the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change , which
stewards climate treaty talks. The country’s existing pledge is
to cut emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels in 2020. It will
propose a new target “this spring” and set policy in the
summer, after “public consideration,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
