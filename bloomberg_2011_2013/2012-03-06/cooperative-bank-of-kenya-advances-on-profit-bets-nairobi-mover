Cooperative Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
East African nation’s fifth-biggest lender by market value,
jumped the most in two and a half years on speculation full-year
earnings will grow.  The stock surged 7.9 percent to 12.95 shillings at the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest gain since June
2009.  “I would expect it to rise on expectations of earnings; I
expect at least 30 percent growth in earnings after tax,”
Renaldo d’Souza, a research analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd.,
said by phone from Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
