Nigeria ’s naira declined against the
dollar for a second day, reversing an earlier advance, after
demand for the U.S. currency increased.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fell less
than 0.1 percent to 157.8 per dollar as of 2:36 p.m. on the
 interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It appreciated as much as 0.4
percent.  Nigeria  sold  $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, with lenders buying the entire amount on offer, the
Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-mailed
statement. The marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate depreciated 0.1 percent to 156.01
naira, compared with 155.90 at the previous sale on Feb. 29.  “The naira will remain under pressure from a structural
imbalance between local dollar supply and demand,” Ecobank
Transnational Inc. analysts, led by Paul-Harry Aithnard, wrote
in a note to clients today.  The central bank sells U.S. dollars at twice-weekly
auctions and through interbank trading to maintain exchange-rate
stability. Fuel imports have been a source of pressure on
Nigeria’s foreign-currency market, central bank Deputy Governor
Tunde Lemo told a committee at a public hearing on Feb. 7.  The West African country imports 70 percent of its oil
products due to a lack of adequate refining capacity, according
to the Petroleum Ministry  Ghana ’s cedi snapped four days of declines, advancing 0.3
percent to 1.709 per dollar in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
