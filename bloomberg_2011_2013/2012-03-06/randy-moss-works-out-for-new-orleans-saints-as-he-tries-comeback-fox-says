Former All-Pro wide receiver  Randy Moss  will work out today for the  New Orleans Saints  as he tries
to return to football, according to Fox Sports.  Moss, who retired in August after playing for three teams
during the 2010 National Football League season, will join
former NFL quarterback Brian Brohm for the workout,  Fox Sports
said  on its website, citing unidentified people. It didn’t say
where the workout would take place.  Moss, 35, played for the New England Patriots, Tennessee
Titans and Minnesota Vikings in 2010 before announcing his
retirement after a 13-year career that also included a two-year
stint with the Oakland Raiders. He is fifth on the league’s
reception-yardage list with 14,858 and ninth with 954 catches.
His 153 receiving touchdowns are tied for second with  Terrell
Owens , trailing leader Jerry Rice, who had 197. Moss was named a
first-team All-Pro for the 1998, 2000, 2003 and 2007 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
