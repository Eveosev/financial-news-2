Energia Leon SA, a Chilean energy
company, is seeking permits to install a $15 million biomass
cogeneration plant that will produce power and steam in the
central region of Biobio.  The Coelemu project will sell electricity to the grid from
7 megawatts of power capacity and furnish steam to an adjacent
sawmill owned by Forestal Leon Ltda., the Concepcion-based
company said in a filing today with environmental licensing
agency Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente.  To contact the reporter on this story:
