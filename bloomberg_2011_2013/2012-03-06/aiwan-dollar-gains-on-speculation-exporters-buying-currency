Taiwan’s dollar fell, reversing
earlier gains, as global funds cut holdings of the island’s
shares on concern a recovery in  Asia  is slowing.  Government
bonds  rose.  The Taiex index of shares declined 0.8 percent as
international investors sold $44.8 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they bought, a second day of net sales, according to
exchange data. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell for
a third consecutive day after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said
his government will aim for economic growth of 7.5 percent,
compared with a goal of 8 percent in place since 2005.  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.538 against
its U.S. counterpart, the weakest level since Feb. 29, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It rose as much as 0.1 percent earlier.  “Taiwan stocks’ performance is dragging down the local
dollar,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader
at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The Taiwan dollar should
remain between NT$29.45 and NT$29.55 while the  Taiex (TWSE) 
consolidates.”  Taiwan’s  consumer prices  rose 0.25 percent last month from
a year earlier, compared with a 2.37 percent increase in
January, the statistics bureau said yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent notes due March
2022 fell one basis point to 1.252 percent, the lowest close for
 benchmark  10-year rates since Dec. 16, prices from Gretai
Securities Market showed.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.397 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
