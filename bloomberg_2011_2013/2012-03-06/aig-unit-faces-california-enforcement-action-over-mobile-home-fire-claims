American International Group Inc. (AIG)  is
facing an enforcement action from a California regulator over
the insurer’s claims-handling tied to a 2008 fire that destroyed
more than 400 mobile homes.  The California Department of Insurance found 125 violations
after policyholder complaints tied to New York-based AIG’s New
Hampshire Insurance Co. and its agent for claims processing,
York Risk Services Group Inc., according to an e-mailed
 statement  today from the regulator. Violations can carry civil
penalties of as much as $10,000 each if the act was willful.  The Sayre Fire in November 2008 destroyed more than 600
structures and burned 11,000 acres in  Los Angeles , leading the
mayor of Los Angeles and then-California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  to declare a state of emergency, according to the
statement. New Hampshire Insurance issued policies to about 370
customers whose mobile homes were fully lost in the firestorm.  “The allegations in this case reflect a troubling lack of
attention to consumer needs by New Hampshire Insurance
Company,” Adam M. Cole, the regulator’s general counsel, said
in the statement. “We expect insurers and their agents to be
thoroughly diligent in handling claims, especially at times of
devastation such as the Sayre fire.”  Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
