U.K.  government bonds  advanced after
retail sales fell for a second month in February, stoking
concern that Britain’s economic recovery is faltering.  The pound weakened against the dollar after a report showed
U.K. house prices slid for the third time in four months. Gross
domestic product in the euro region declined 0.3 percent from
the third quarter, the European Union’s statistics office said
today, confirming an initial estimate published on Feb. 15.
Britain sold 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of 0.75 percent
inflation-linked gilts due in March 2034.  “The softer tone to the economic data over the past few
days has taken a bit of the wind out of the sails of the risk
market,” said  Brian Barry , a strategist at Investec Bank Plc in
 London . “That has given investors plenty of reason to pause for
thought. Continued periphery concerns should prove supportive
for gilts.”  The 10-year  gilt yield  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.15 percent at 10:35 a.m. London time. The
4 percent security due March 2022 rose 0.325, or 3.25 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 116.535. Two-year yields were little
changed at 0.43 percent.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
fell 0.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the  British
Retail Consortium .  The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.5778. Sterling was little
changed at 83.29 pence per euro.  House Prices  U.K. house prices fell 0.5 percent in February, Halifax
said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12
analysts called for a 0.3 percent increase.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep
its bond-buying target at 325 billion pounds when it meets on
March 8, according to all the 45 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Gilts have handed investors a 1.2 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries have
dropped 0.4 percent and German government bonds are little
changed, the indexes show.  Sterling has declined 0.6 percent in 2012, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar weakened 2.3 percent and
the euro fell 0.6 percent.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
