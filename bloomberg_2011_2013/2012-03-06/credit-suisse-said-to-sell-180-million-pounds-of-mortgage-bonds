Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is selling
180 million pounds ($283 million) of U.K. non-conforming
residential mortgage-backed securities in the first transaction
of its kind in  Europe  this year, according to three people with
knowledge of the deal.  The notes issued through ALBA 2012-1 Plc will have an
average life of 3.7 years, said the people, who declined to be
identified before the transaction is completed. The notes will
have a top credit grade from  Fitch Ratings , the people said.  It’s the first deal to be priced in Europe since Credit
Suisse issued 202 million pounds of notes in May, according to
Barclays Capital data. Investors demand 320 basis points more
than interbank rates to hold a three-year senior bond backed by
U.K. non-conforming residential mortgages, the lowest spread
since June, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data show.  The transaction will include another 60 million pounds of
mezzanine and junior notes that won’t be publicly offered, said
the people. The deal is backed by 340 million pounds of
mortgages initially originated by GMAC-RFC, the people said.  Banks create residential mortgage-backed bonds by packaging
home loans into securities of varying risk and return that are
sold to investors. Subprime mortgages, known in the U.K. as non-
conforming, are loans that don’t meet standard bank lending
criteria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
