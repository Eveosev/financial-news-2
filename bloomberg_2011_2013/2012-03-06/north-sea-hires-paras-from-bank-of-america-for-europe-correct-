North Sea Partners , a private
investment bank, hired Steve Paras as head of European  capital
markets  in London.  Paras was previously head of Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s leveraged capital markets in London, New York-based
North Sea Partners said today in an e-mailed statement.  “There’s a huge wall of debt maturing in the next five
years from European LBOs, on top of increased  capital
requirements  for banks and continued weak economies throughout
Europe,” Mickey Brennan, co-chief executive officer of North
Sea Partners, said in an e-mailed me message. “That is a pretty
serious situation for many corporates who will need help with
their balance sheets and will need access to capital other than
from the banks.”  Before coming to London, Paras was with Merrill Lynch & Co.
in  New York  for 14 years, most recently as head of U.S.
leveraged loan capital markets.  North Sea Partners has a “compelling opportunity to not
only expand the European footprint but also the firm’s global
footprint through cross-border financing activity,” Paras said
in the statement.  North Sea Partners has advised on more than $35 billion of
deals for clients including  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Ineos Group
Holdings Ltd., and Independent News and Media Ltd., according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
