Oaktree Capital Management LP, a Los
Angeles-based investor that oversees $75 billion, raised a 3
billion-euro ($3.9 billion) fund focusing on taking control of
distressed European companies through their debt or equity,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  The European Principal Fund III raised 20 percent more than
its initial target of 2.5 billion euros and 76 percent more than
 Oaktree ’s previous fund using the same strategy in 2008, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the matter
isn’t public.  An Oaktree official, who declined to be identified citing
company policy, wouldn’t comment.  Distressed asset-investment funds worldwide recorded a 3.2
percent return in January, compared with 2.1 percent a year
earlier, according to an index compiled by New York-based
adviser  Hennessee Group LLC .  To contact the reporter on this story:
