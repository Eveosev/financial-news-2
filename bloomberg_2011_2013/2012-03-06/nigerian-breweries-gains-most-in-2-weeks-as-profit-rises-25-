Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the
country’s biggest beer-maker by market value, rose the most in
more than two weeks after full-year profit advanced 25 percent.  The stock gained 1.5 percent, the most since Feb. 17, to
close at 94.90 naira, the highest since Feb. 27.  Net income for the 12 months through December rose to 38
billion naira ($241 million) from 30.3 billion naira a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement published on the
website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Sales climbed 24 percent
to 230.1 billion naira from 185.9 billion naira.  The  Heineken NV (HEIN)  unit last year acquired Sona Systems
Associates Business Management Ltd. and Life Breweries Co., to
expand its capacity and extend its brands. The company expected
the “overall impact of the consolidation” to be reflected in
its 2011 full-year result, it said in a statement published on
the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  on Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
