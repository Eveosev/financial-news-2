Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) ,
 China ’s largest maker of rice cakes, posted a 17 percent
increase in 2011 profit, beating analyst estimates, as the
growing economy boosted demand for its snacks and drinks.  Net income  rose to $419.5 million, or 3.17 cents per share,
from $358.4 million, or 2.71 cents, a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to  Hong Kong ’s stock exchange today. That
compares with the $386.8 million average of 10 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 31 percent to $2.95  billion .  Want Want, controlled by Taiwanese billionaire Tsai Eng- meng, said gross profit margin declined by 2.8 percentage points
to 34.8 percent because of higher labor costs and
“substantial” increase in the price of most of the ingredients
it used such as sugar,  palm oil , starch, milk powder, rice and
plastic packaging materials. The margin for rice crackers fell
to 37.6 percent from 40.8 percent.  Want Want, which was added to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
in November, rose 4 percent to HK$7.82 today, the highest close
since Dec. 29 2011. The  stock  has gained 0.9 percent this year,
compared with the 12.9 percent advance in the benchmark index.  Revenue from rice crackers climbed 30 percent from a year
earlier to $817 million in 2011. Sales of dairy products and
beverages increased 31 percent from a year earlier to $1.4
billion while that of snack foods rose 36 percent, the company
said in the statement.  The company said today it re-appointed Chu Chi-Wen as chief
financial officer after he resigned from the position in July
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
