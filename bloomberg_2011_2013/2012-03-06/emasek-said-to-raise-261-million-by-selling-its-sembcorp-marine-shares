Temasek Holdings Pte (TMSK) , Singapore’s
state-owned  investment company , raised S$327.6 million ($261
million) by selling shares in  Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , a person
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Temasek sold 62.4 million shares in Sembcorp Marine, or
less than 1 percent of the world’s second-biggest oil-rig maker,
at S$5.25 each, said the person, who declined to be identified
as the sale hasn’t been publicly announced. The shares were sold
at the lower end of the S$5.25 to S$5.30 price range within two
hours after the close yesterday, the person said.  Stephen Forshaw , a spokesman for Temasek, declined to comment.  The investment company sold the  shares  after they reached
their highest in more than seven months on March 2, a week after
the rig maker reported profit that surpassed analysts’ estimates.
Last month, Sembcorp Marine won its first drill ship order from
Sete Brasil Participacoes SA for $793 million and is building
new yards in  Singapore  and Brazil to capture demand for offshore
products, including drilling rigs and floating production units.  The stock slumped as much as 5.2 percent to S$5.12 and
traded at S$5.19 as of 9:24 a.m., set for its biggest decline
since Nov. 1 and the most among the 30-member Singapore
benchmark  Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)  The shares were sold at a 2.8
percent discount to yesterday’s close.  Temasek has a 3.2 percent direct stake in Sembcorp Marine,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also the
controlling shareholder of Sembcorp Industries Ltd., which in
turn owns 61 percent of the oil-rig builder, the data showed.  Sembcorp Marine may have its biggest order book since 2008
as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  invest more
on exploration and drilling to increase output.  UBS AG managed the sale of the stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
