Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a fourth
day and bonds dropped on speculation global investors will
repatriate funds as government notes mature this week.  The zero-coupon government bills worth 15 trillion rupiah
($1.6 billion) will fall due on March 8. Global funds reduced
their  holdings  of sovereign debt by 5.7 trillion rupiah last
week, the biggest weekly outflow since September, according to
finance ministry data.  “We expect the rupiah to weaken because of the sovereign
bond maturing soon,” said Yura Pradipta, a Jakarta-based
foreign-exchange trader at PT Bank Internasional Indonesia.
“Offshore funds may step out of the Indonesian market first. It
usually takes them one or two days to re-enter as they take
advantage of a weaker rupiah.”  The rupiah lost 0.1 percent to 9,153 per dollar as of 3:43
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 9,200 per dollar earlier, the
weakest level since Feb. 27.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.67
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. That was the highest yield in a week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
