Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, plans to invest 1.2 billion euros ($1.6
billion) a year from 2013 to 2016 as it expands exploration.  It will invest 1 billion euros to 1.2 billion euros this
year, with exploration and production representing about 60
percent, the Lisbon-based company said in a statement today.  “Galp will intensify exploration activities, de-risking
its portfolio, and will keep developing high-rewarding
projects,” the company said.  It’s expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where its Lula project is located, and
Angola to improve access to crude supplies and curb dependence
on refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  Galp forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 900 million euros to 1.1 billion euros for
2012. It estimates Ebitda will rise at a compound annual growth
rate of about 25 percent from 2011 to 2016 as it develops the
Lula and Cernambi fields in  Brazil . The company’s reserves
increased 24 percent to 709 million barrels of oil equivalent
last year, including appraisal activities in Brazil.  Galp on July 29 raised its 2020 output target in light of
“exceptional” progress in Brazil and expects working interest
production of more than 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
by the end of the decade. It reaffirmed that target today. It
sees 20 percent average dividend growth a year for 2012 to 2016.  The shares gained 11 percent this year, valuing the company
at 10.5 billion euros.  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s biggest oil company, and
Portuguese holding company Amorim Energia BV each control a
third of Galp. Eni is ready to sell its 33 percent holding in
Galp, Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  said Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
