Japanese  stocks  declined for a
second day after the yen strengthened and a shift in  China ’s
growth strategy away from investment and exports weighed on
shipping companies and machinery makers.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales overseas, slumped 1.3 percent.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) ,
Japan’s top shipping line by sales, lost 2.5 percent. Fanuc
Corp., which makes robotics for mainland factories run by
companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., declined 2.5
percent.  “Stock markets are following currency movements because
there are no big catalysts to be found,” said  Yoshinori Nagano ,
a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $104 billion. “I don’t think the cut in
China’s target is bothering people in the market, but it’s
relatively negative for stocks related to public infrastructure
as the nation is shifting away from investment toward
consumption.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.6 percent to 9,637.63
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index lost 0.7
percent to 827.35, with trading volume 5.4 percent higher than
the 30-day average.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.3 percent
today. The gauge fell 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday after
U.S. factory orders cooled in January.  Exporters Retreat  Exporters slumped after the Japanese currency rose. Canon,
the world’s biggest camera maker, slumped 1.3 percent to 3,675
yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its revenue overseas, lost 1.4 percent to 799 yen.  The yen strengthened as high as 81.34 against the dollar in
 Tokyo , compared with 81.53 when the stock market opened today.
Japan’s currency also appreciated against the euro, climbing to
107.33 from 107.82. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Shippers and infrastructure-related stocks fell after the
Chinese government pared the nation’s economic growth target to
7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005, a signal
that leaders aim to cut reliance on investment and exports in
favor of domestic consumption.  Shippers, Machinery Makers  Shippers, steelmakers and machinery makers were  the biggest 
decliners in the Topix’s 33 industry groups. Nippon Yusen lost
2.5 percent to 233 yen, while Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., which
gets almost 30 percent of its sales in  Asia , slid 2.8 percent to
352 yen.  Fanuc (6954)  fell 2.5 percent to 14,330 yen. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co., an excavator maker that gets more than half of
its sales in Asia, slumped 2.8 percent to 1,659 yen. JFE
Holdings Inc., a steel producer that gets almost 30 percent of
its sales in Asia outside Japan, fell 3.1 percent to 1,592 yen.  The Topix has risen 14 percent this year on signs of U.S.
economic recovery and European moves to contain the debt crisis.
The gain has boosted the value of stocks listed on the Topix to
1.01 times book value, up from 0.88 in December, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A number below 1 means companies can
be bought for less than value of their assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
