Junie Hoang is  suing  the Internet Movie Database for damaging her career by printing accurate information about her. It's the sort of action that sounds frivolous by virtually any standard -- except perhaps that of Hollywood. Specifically, Hoang sued  IMDb  for revealing her age, 40. About 45 percent of females in the U.S. are over the age of 40. But women over 40 accounted for only 8 percent of television characters in 2010-2011 and in part of the 2011-2012 TV seasons, according to a Backstage  article  that cited internal data from AFTRA, the actors' union. At some point in their 30s, job opportunities for many actresses fall off a cliff. It's not uncommon for people to consider their age a private matter. For some women in Hollywood, it's a vital trade secret. (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
