Bulgaria ’s economic recovery slowed
in the fourth quarter as factory orders and exports to the
European Union declined because of the euro-area’s debt crisis.  Gross domestic product expanded 1.6 percent, compared with
a 1.5 percent estimate on Feb. 15, the Sofia-based Statistics
Institute said today on its website. Seasonally adjusted GDP was
0.3 percent from the previous quarter, after a 0.4 percent
growth estimate. Bulgaria’s economy grew 1.7 percent last year,
after a revised 0.4 percent in 2010, according to the institute.  The sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, which buys 60
percent of Bulgaria’s exports, is curbing economic growth in the
EU’s poorest country by per-capita GDP as it emerges from its
first recession in more than a decade through exports of its
metals, machinery, textiles and furniture.  The EU estimated Bulgaria’s economy to grow 1.8 percent in
2011 and 1.4 percent this year in a Feb. 23 estimate, citing
stagnant domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
