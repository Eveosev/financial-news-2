The U.S. Midwest and Northeast will
have a brief round of lower temperatures this weekend before
warming up through mid-March.  Even with the cold snap, average temperatures in the
regions may reach at least 8 Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) degrees
above normal from March 11 to March 15, according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  “This event should not be as strong as the one that is
just ending, but it could rival it in the Northeast per the
latest model trends,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  The high temperature in  New York  yesterday was 44 degrees
Fahrenheit (7 Celsius), 2 below normal, according to the
National Weather Service. The high March 10 may be 47, 1 below
normal, said AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  By mid-March, temperatures in the upper Great Plains,
Midwest and Northeast may be at least 15 degrees higher than
normal, Rogers said in his 11- to 15-day forecast. Only the U.S.
and Canadian west coasts are expected to be cooler than normal
in that March 16 to March 20 time frame, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
