Russia will probably export 1.5
million metric tons to 2 million tons of grain a month until the
end of this marketing year,  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Russia’s grain exports rose to 20.6 million tons as of
yesterday from the start of the season on July 1 last year,
Sergei Sukhov, head of the ministry’s market regulation
department, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Total grain exports are seen at a record 27 million tons to
28 million tons this season, according to ministry forecasts.
The 2012-13 estimate of 25 million tons “will be corrected
later, taking into account all factors,” he said.  Sukhov declined to estimate winter crop losses, saying that
before the winter season started in December, 94 percent of
grains were in “good and satisfactory” condition. “We will be
able to make conclusions about winter grains after the snow
melts,” he said.  The thaw comes in March and early April in  Russia ’s
southern and central regions, according to Federal
Hydrometeorological Center data.  Farmers are likely to harvest at least 90 million tons next
season, including 55 million tons to 57 million tons of wheat,
Sukhov said. The ministry will prepare a more precise forecast
after reviewing the condition of winter grain, he said.  In the 2011-12 season, Russia harvested 93.9 million tons
of grain, including 56.2 million tons of wheat, according to
state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
