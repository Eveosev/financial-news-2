Merck & Co., the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, forecast first-quarter profit that falls below
analysts’ estimates.  First quarter adjusted profit will be 95 cents to 98 cents
a share, the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company said
today in a statement. That compares with analysts’ estimates of
$1.01 a share. The company reaffirmed its 2012 full year
adjusted profit of $3.75 to $3.85 a share.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
