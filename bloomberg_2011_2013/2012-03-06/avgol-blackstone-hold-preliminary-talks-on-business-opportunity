Blackstone Group LP (BX)  is in
preliminary talks with  Avgol Industries 1953 Ltd. (AVGL) , an Israeli
manufacturer of nonwoven fabrics, for a possible acquisition.  “As part of ongoing considerations of mergers,
acquisitions or other types of cooperation with different
parties, Avgol is in initial negotiations with Blackstone,” the
Tel Aviv-based company said in a filing to the  Tel-Aviv  Stock
Exchange today. Calcalist earlier reported that Blackstone was
looking to buy Avgol from  Israel Petrochemical Enterprises Ltd. (PTCH)   “This is definitely the first icebreaker in the potential
for significant acquisitions in the local market by private
equity and international investors,” said Zach Herzog, equity
sales trader at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  In January, the New York-based private equity company and
DDR Corp. agreed to purchase 46 U.S. shopping centers from a
unit of Israeli real estate investment company Elbit Imaging
Ltd. for $1.43 billion. Blackstone has expressed an interest in
acquiring a stake in  Partner Communication Co. (PTNR) , the nation’s
second-largest mobile phone company, Calcalist reported in
January.  Avgol rose 0.9 percent to 2.896 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv today, the highest level since Feb. 22. Israel
Petrochemical, a maker of raw materials for plastic, holds a
23.7 percent stake in Avgol, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
