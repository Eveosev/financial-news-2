Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR) , the
budget carrier backed by  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , will establish
a second Australian base in Sydney from July.  Three Airbus SAS A320 aircraft will be based in Sydney,
creating more than 150 jobs and providing as many as 10
additional daily return services through the airport, Tiger
Airways  Australia  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Three aircraft operating from our second Australian base
will provide up to 3,600 extra seats a day through  Sydney
Airport (SYD) ,” Andrew David, head of the Australia unit, said in the
statement.  Tiger Australia is rebuilding services as it works to
reassure regulators following safety violations that caused a
six-week suspension of flights last year. The curtailment of
Australian services has prompted Singapore-based Tiger Air to
forecast a “significant net loss” in the year ending March.  The airline is allowed to operate a maximum of 64 services
a day from October, up from 38 currently, after gaining approval
from Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority, it said
yesterday.  The Australia unit won permission to resume flights in
August, after agreeing to steps including improvements to pilot
training, crew scheduling and fatigue management. The carrier
was initially limited to 18 flights a day.  Tiger Australia was grounded after one of its planes came
into land too low in  Melbourne  on July 1. The airline was
already under a safety review. The order didn’t affect the
carrier’s main unit in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
