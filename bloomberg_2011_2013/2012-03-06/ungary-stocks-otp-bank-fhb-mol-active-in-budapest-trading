Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
declined 2.1 percent to 18,615.52 at the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell the
most in two months on concern the escalation of the government’s
disputes with the European Union will delay a bailout for the
country. The shares fell 3.9 percent to 3,787 forint.  Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt.  (FHB HB), a Hungarian
mortgage lender known as FHB, retreated 4.1 percent to 538
forint, the biggest one-day slump in more than three months.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s biggest refiner, dropped 1.4
percent to 18,490 forint. Global stocks and commodities declined
as a report confirmed an economic contraction in the euro area,
Hungary’s main trading partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
