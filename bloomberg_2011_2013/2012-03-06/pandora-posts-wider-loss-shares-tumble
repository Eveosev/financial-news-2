Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio pioneer, forecast fiscal first-quarter results that missed
analysts’ projections because of a seasonal lull in advertising
sales. The stock fell.  Sales this quarter will be $72 million to $75 million,
Oakland, California-based Pandora said today in a  statement .
That’s short of the $86.4 million  analysts  projected. The
company sees a loss, excluding items, of 18 cents to 21 cents a
share, larger than the 2-cent loss estimated by analysts.  Consumer advertising sales in the first quarter will be the
lowest of the year, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joe Kennedy said today in an interview. The company also experienced
lower-than-expected sales in the quarter ended Jan. 31. Active
listeners rose 62 percent to 47 million in 2011.  “We were a touch light of the high end of our guidance in
terms of holiday ad spending,” Kennedy said.  Pandora fell as much as 16 percent to $12.04 in extended
 trading . The stock lost 2.7 percent to $14.27 at the close in
 New York  and has climbed 43 percent this year.  The company reported a wider fourth-quarter net loss as
sales missed analysts’ estimates. The loss in the period ended
Jan. 31 increased to $8.17 million, or 5 cents a share, from a
loss of $3.91 million, or 31 cents a year earlier, before the
company went public, Pandora said.  Excluding items, Pandora lost 3 cents a share, more than
the 2-cent average loss seen by 16 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Fourth-quarter sales rose 71 percent to $81.3 million,
less than the $83 million average of 14 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
