Yemen’s government plans to spend
2,111 billion rials ($9.8 billion) this year, according to draft
budget plans reported by state-run news agency Saba.  The draft expenditure, which requires the approval of
parliament in Sana’a, represents a 17 percent increase over the
2011 budget that was approved Dec. 5, 2010.  Yemen has been using last year’s budget for the first
quarter of this year as unrest forced President Ali Abdullah
Saleh from office last month and repeated clashes undermined
business activity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
