Rovi Corp. (ROVI) , a provider of digital
entertainment guides and licensing, is seeking as much as $800
million in loans to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the transaction and will
host a lender call at 2 p.m. on March 8 in New York, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the deal is
private.  Rovi, based in  Santa Clara , California, is seeking a $200
million to $250 million term loan A that will be an add-on to an
existing loan and a new $500 million to $550 million term loan
B, the person said.  Roviâ€™s $300 million term loan B matures in February 2018
and its $450 million term loan A comes due in February 2016,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank-loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . A term loan A is sold mainly to banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
