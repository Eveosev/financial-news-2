U.K.  retail sales  fell for a second
month in February as a drop in purchases of clothing countered
gains at food stores, the  British Retail Consortium  said.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
fell 0.3 percent from a year earlier, the London-based trade
group said in an e-mailed report today. That followed a 0.3
percent decline in January, the second worst for that month
since the survey began in 1995.  The  Bank of England  is counting on  slowing inflation  to
ease the squeeze on consumers and help generate a pickup in
 consumer spending  later this year. Any recovery in demand may be
curbed by rising unemployment and an increase in  oil prices  that
is increasing the cost of gasoline.  “The reality of weak sales shows that a convincing revival
remains illusory,” BRC Director General Stephen Robertson said
in a statement. “Unemployment is expected to rise further,
causing increased nervousness about  job security , which is
keeping confidence fragile. Any sense of improving optimism is
not yet translating into more spending.”  Including stores open less than 12 months, the value of
retail sales rose 2.3 percent in February from a year earlier,
according to the BRC report. In the three months through
February, food sales increased 1.9 percent on the year, while
non-food sales fell 0.3 percent.  The BRC said food sales were boosted by households
“stocking up” during cold weather in February, while clothing
sales weakened due to “consumer caution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
