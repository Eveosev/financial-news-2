U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
suggested that the government should use part of state-
controlled  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  to create a business
lender to support exports and industrial projects, the  BBC 
reported.  “My suggestion is that we recognize that RBS will not
return to the market in its current shape and use its time as
ward of state to carve out of it a British Business Bank with a
clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly to
sound business,” Cable wrote to Prime Minister  David Cameron  on
Feb. 8, the BBC said, citing a  letter published on its website .  “We should be willing to use such an institution to
support our other industrial objectives, such as supporting
exports and sectors identified as of strategic importance,”
Cable wrote, noting that “this will take time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
