A Kuwaiti lawmaker sought to
question Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah on
alleged government “negligence” and financial violations.  Saleh Ashour also plans to ask Sheikh Jaber about
accusations that the government failed to deal with a corruption
scandal last year, involving the alleged transfer of millions of
dollars into the bank accounts of lawmakers in the previous
parliament, according to a copy of the request distributed to
reporters today in  Kuwait City .  Sheikh Jaber was appointed prime minister in November to
replace Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah, who resigned
following months of protests. Sheikh Nasser’s government denied
the corruption allegations. His departure prompted his uncle and
the country’s ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-
Sabah, to dissolve parliament and call elections for Feb. 2, in
which opposition candidates won most seats.  Ashour also wants to question the premier about the
government’s failure to resolve the issue of about 100,000
stateless residents known as bedoun, according to the request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
