Vitol Group’s Asian unit approached
banks seeking to refinance debt due in June, according to three
people familiar with the matter.  The Geneva-based energy trader has a one-year, $1.585
billion revolving credit facility which matures in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That facility pays a
margin of 90 basis points more than the London interbank offered
rate, the data show. About 27 lenders participated in the
facility, which was established in 2011.  London-based Elizabeth Adams at Brunswick Group LLP, the
public relations agency handling media inquiries for Vitol,
declined to comment on the company’s financing plans when
contacted by phone.  The talks with banks are at an early stage and the cost for
Vitol to refinance the facility is expected to increase, the
people said, declining to elaborate and asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  The banks originally hired to arrange the 2011 facility
were  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of China
Ltd.,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , DBS Group Holdings Ltd.,
HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV, National Australia Bank Ltd.,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Plc, Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank Ltd. and Westpac
Banking Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
