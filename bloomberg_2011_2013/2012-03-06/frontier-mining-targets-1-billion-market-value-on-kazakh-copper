Frontier Mining Ltd. (FML)  is targeting an
eight-fold increase in its market capitalization to $1 billion
by 2014 after the U.K. explorer starts copper production in
 Kazakhstan  later this year.  Frontier is seeking to become the second-biggest copper
producer in Kazakhstan after  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , Chief Executive
Officer Erlan Sagadiev said yesterday in an interview in London.
Production is slated to begin by June and reach as much as 5,000
metric tons of copper this year before ramping up to 20,000 tons
in 2014, he said.  “We’ll then generate about $160 million of turnover and
should be valued at north of $1 billion,” Sagadiev said. The
company is currently valued at 84 million pounds ($133 million).  Copper prices have climbed 11 percent this year to $8,437 a
ton on the London Metal Exchange on increased demand from  Asia .
At the same time, strikes and slower-than-expected projects have
curtailed supply growth.  Barclays Capital  predicts a third
consecutive copper shortage in 2012 and another one next year.  The cash cost of producing copper at Frontier’s Benkala
project in northwest Kazakhstan will be about $2,300 a ton, the
CEO said. That rises to about $3,800 a ton when taxes are
included, he said.  The mining company has funding of $54 million in place to
start operations and will need a further $35 million to meet its
2014 production target, Sagadiev said.  “We will fund this through cash flow and debt,” he said.
Management would only consider selling the company once output
starts and it can “realize the potential of its assets,” he
said in the interview.  Frontier has already become an acquisition target for
Russian, Chinese and Korean companies seeking to gain a foothold
in Kazakhstan, Sagadiev said, without elaborating.  Kazakhmys, which has an annual output capacity of about
300,000 tons, is Kazakhstan’s biggest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
