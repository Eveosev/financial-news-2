Ecuacorrientes SA, an Ecuadorean
miner owned by  Corriente Resources Inc. (CTQ) , plans to invest $1.72
billion in its Mirador copper project in the South American
country to achieve full production.  Mirador will have an ore-processing capacity of 60,000 tons
per day by the end of 2016 and produce about 354,000 tons of
copper concentrate annually, Corriente’s parent company,  China
Railway Construction Corp. (601186) , said in a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday.  Ecuador’s Non-Renewable Natural Resources Minister Wilson Pastor said last week the company would need $1.4 billion to
produce about 60,000 metric tons per year.  Vancouver-based Corriente is 50-50 venture of  China  Railway
and  Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Holdings Co. (000630) , China’s
second-biggest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
