Three Russian ministries oppose a
cut in the export duty on diesel and fuel oil as compensation
for crude producers and refiners that held down fuel prices
before the March 4 presidential election, RBC Daily  said .  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin â€™s deputy for the  energy
industry ,  Igor Sechin , ordered the Energy, Finance and Economic
Development ministries to devise a method for paying back the
companies, which held fuel prices little changed even as
international crude prices have climbed, the Moscow newspaper
said today, citing unidentified people in the ministries.  Changing the export tax would undermine the 60-66 system,
introduced in October, which lowered the crude duty using a
coefficient of 60 percent instead of 65 percent and unified the
duty on most refined products at 66 percent of that levy, the
people said, according to RBC Daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
