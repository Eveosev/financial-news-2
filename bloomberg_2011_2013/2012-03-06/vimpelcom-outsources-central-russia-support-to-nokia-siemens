VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  awarded a five-year
contract for maintenance and support of fixed, mobile and fiber
networks in central  Russia  to Nokia Siemens Networks.  VimpelCom, Russia’s third largest operator by subscribers,
is also conducting a tender for  network management  in the Volga
and Far East regions, Elena Prokhorova, a spokeswoman, said by
e-mail.  Nokia Siemens signed a five-year  contract  in 2010 to
service the central Russia mobile grid belonging to OAO Mobile
TeleSystems, Russia’s largest operator by subscribers. The
Finnish-German joint venture opened a  global network operations
center  outside Moscow last year.  “We selected NSN as our partner as we see them as strong
professionals with global expertise and local implementation
facilities, and due to the good track record with MTS,”
Prokhorova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
