Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated  Vladimir Putin  on his “decisive”
victory in  Russia ’s presidential election, the Persian Gulf
state’s embassy in Moscow said.  Ahmadinejad said in a letter that he hoped Putin’s election
to a new six-year term would promote bilateral ties and help end
“discrimination and unilateral approaches” to international
affairs, the embassy said by e-mail today.  Putin, 59, obtained about 64 percent of the vote in the
March 4 election, which international observers said was marred
by abuses and didn’t meet “important democratic standards.”
Police detained about 250 people who took part in a protest
rally in Moscow last night, including several opposition
leaders.  The Russian leader warned the U.S. and its allies against a
military strike on  Iran  last week, signaling that the
consequences would be “catastrophic.” Russia is pressing for a
resumption of international talks on Iran’s disputed nuclear
program and for an easing of sanctions against the country in
return for its cooperation with United Nations atomic
inspectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
