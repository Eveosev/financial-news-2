The U.S. Energy Department raised
its forecast for prices at the pump for all of 2012 and during
the peak driving season from April through September.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.79 a gallon this
year, the highest level in data going back to 1976, and $3.72 in
2013, the department’s Energy Information Administration said
today in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . The EIA said
last month that prices would average $3.55 in 2012 and $3.59
next year.  Prices during the April-through-September peak driving
season will average $3.925 a gallon, 5.7 percent higher than a
year ago, the department estimated.  “There are a lot of forces pushing up gasoline, including
strong crude prices and logistical constraints,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and principal with
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “It
wouldn’t be unexpected to see gasoline prices over $4.”  The Energy Department lowered its forecast for U.S.
gasoline demand for 2012 and 2013.  Gasoline consumption will average 8.67 million barrels a
day, down from 8.74 million in 2011, That’s 0.5 percent below
last month’s projection of 8.71 million.  The department forecast that in 2013 consumption of the
motor fuel will decline to 8.66 million barrels a day, lower
than the 8.69 million barrels estimated in the February report.  “When you start seeing prices above $4, drivers tend to
curtail demand,” Cohan said.  The U.S. will export 530,000 barrels a day more petroleum
products that it imports in 2012 and 370,000 barrels next year.
That’s an increase from the previous projection of 350,000
barrels a day this year and 320,000 barrels in 2013.  The U.S. was a net exporter of petroleum products last year
for the first time since 1949, as shipments abroad exceeded
imports by 439,000 barrels a day, the department said Feb. 29 in
its Petroleum Supply Monthly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
