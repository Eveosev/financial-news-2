(Corrects percentage of respondents asking for a suspension
in second paragraph.)  Hong Kong Chief Executive  Donald
Tsang  should be suspended while the anti-corruption bureau
conducts an investigation into his trips with tycoons, the  South
China Morning Post  said, citing a poll it commissioned.  About 43 percent of the 523 respondents said he should be
suspended, the paper said, citing a poll conducted by the
University of Hong Kong. Only 9 percent said he should resign
immediately, the paper said.  The respondents were equally spilt on whether impeachment
proceedings should start against Tsang, the paper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
