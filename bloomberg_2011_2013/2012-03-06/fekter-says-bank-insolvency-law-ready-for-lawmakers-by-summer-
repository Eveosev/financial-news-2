Austria’s government will present
rules for banks going insolvent to lawmakers by “summer,”
according to Finance Minister Maria Fekter.  “We’ve agreed that the insolvency law for banks will be in
parliament by summer,” Fekter told reporters in Vienna later
yesterday. This includes the enforcement directive for
“financial police,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
