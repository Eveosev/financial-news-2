Italian banks may omit or cut their
dividends on 2011 earnings after the  Bank of Italy  urged the
nation’s lenders to be prudent about their payout policies in
order to protect capital.  “Italian banks must adopt dividend policies that allow
them to keep an adequate capital level,” the Italian central
bank wrote in a letter to banks March 2. Banks will announce
their dividend policies in the next three weeks.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s second biggest bank, may cut
its dividend by 1.4 cents to 6.6 cents per share, according to
the average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , the country’s biggest lender, has already
announced that it will not pay a dividend, after raising 7.5
billion euros ($10 billion) in a rights offer earlier this year.  “We have a bearish stance on dividends of Italian banks,”
Fabrizio Bernardi, a Milan-based analyst at Fidentiis Equities
wrote in a note yesterday. “Banks might easily avoid any
internal debate about their dividends, simply reckoning that
there is a huge pot of goodwill to be written down, which would
hardly leave room for any dividend,” he said.  Following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and the
year-earlier dividends. The figures are in euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
