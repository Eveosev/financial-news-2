Estonia’s government is considering
increasing the  minimum wage  for teachers to 700 euros ($920) a
month starting 2013,  Baltic News Service  reported, citing
Education and Science Minister Jaak Aaviksoo.  The ministry has no funds to raise salaries this year, BNS
cited Aaviksoo as telling a news conference today in the
capital, Tallinn.  The Education Personnel Union will start a nationwide
strike tomorrow, demanding a 20 percent increase in teachers’
wages this year and 15 percent each in 2013 and 2014. That would
mean the minimum salary for junior teachers would rise to 730
euros by next year from 608 euros now, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
