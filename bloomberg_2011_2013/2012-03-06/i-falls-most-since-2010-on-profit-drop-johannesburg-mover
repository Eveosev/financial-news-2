MMI Holdings Ltd. (MMI)  fell the most
since it was created from the merger of two South African
insurance companies in 2010, after posting a decline in first-
half profit.  The stock retreated 4.8 percent, its biggest one-day drop
since November 2010, to 18.30 rand in Johannesburg trading.
MMI’s net income for the six months ended Dec. 31 declined 25
percent to 805 million rand ($106 million) from a year earlier,
the Cape Town-based insurance company said in a statement today.  “Relative to its peers MMI hasn’t performed as well as the
market would have liked and Liberty Holding’s results looked
much better last week,” Martin Strauss, an equity trader at PSG
Konsult, said by telephone from  Pretoria  today. MMI looks
expensive on a price-to-earnings basis, Strauss said.  MMI Holdings, which has operations in 12 countries outside
of  South Africa , was created out of a merger of  FirstRand Ltd.’s (FSR) 
Momentum Group Ltd. and Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. If conditions
remain stable, MMI should be able to complete the merger and
achieve double-digit earnings growth by 2014 or 2015, Nicolaas Kruger, chief executive officer of MMI, said in a telephone
interview from Johannesburg today.  It is the second-worst performing stock on the  FTSE/JSE
Africa Life Assurance Index (JLFEA)  this year after  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , having
risen 7 percent compared with the average increase of 8.4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
