Kenya ’s currency swung between gains
and losses in a narrow range as investors awaited the decision
of a central bank policy meeting on interest rates.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy strengthened
by less than 0.1 percent to 83.30 per dollar as of 2:55 p.m. in
Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. The currency depreciated as much as
0.1 percent earlier.  “It is trading in range as the market takes a wait-and-see
approach,” Peter Mutuku, a currency dealer with Bank of Africa
Kenya Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi today. “No one wants to
be caught with huge positions, short or long, either way.”  Kenya’s central has left its  key lending rate  at a record
18 percent this year, after raising it six times last year to
help stem the shilling’s depreciation and curb inflation. Higher
 interest rates  have helped the shilling strengthen 28 percent
against the dollar, from a record low of 106.75 on Oct. 11.  Six out of nine economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted
the key lending rate will remain unchanged at today’s meeting,
while the rest forecast a one percentage point reduction. The
rate decision is expected at around 5 p.m.  The Tanzanian currency remained unchanged for an eighth day
at 1,600 per dollar.  Uganda ’s shilling strengthened for the
first time in five days, appreciating 0.7 percent to 2,537.5 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
