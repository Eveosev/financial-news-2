Six of October Development &
Investment Co.  jumped to the highest level in almost seven
months after the Egyptian luxury real-estate developer sold all
residential units offered at one of its projects.  Shares (OCDI)  of the Cairo-based company climbed as much as 8.1
percent to 19.25 Egyptian pounds before trading at 18.77 pounds
at 11:48 a.m. in Cairo, the highest intraday level since Aug. 8.
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  increased 1.6 percent.  The company, also known as Sodic, said it sold all 160
homes it offered as it started the second and third phases of
the Westown Residence project on the outskirts of Cairo. It
signed contracts were valued at 193 million Egyptian pounds ($32
million), bringing its total for the year to about 420 million
pounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
