Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , a
Serbian  oil company  controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , expects to
double foreign sales of jet fuel by 2020, following upgrades at
its main refinery.  The exports are seen rising to more than 20,000 tons,
mainly to neighboring Romania and Hungary, with the possible
addition of Bulgaria as a new market, Aleksandar Medvedev, a NIS
director of foreign sales, said in Belgrade today. NIS already
covers more than 90 percent of the Serbian market of more than
70,000 of jet fuel a year, he said.  “We don’t expect a strong growth of the Serbian market,
but there will be solid demand in the region,” said Milan
Nikic, NIS’s chief for jet fuel sales.  Belgrade-based NIS, the only refiner in  Serbia , produced
74,500 tons of aircraft fuel last year and plans to increase the
output after completing an upgrade of its Pancevo refinery in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
