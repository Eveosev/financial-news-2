Tornadoes that slammed five states
in the U.S. Midwest and South last week may generate as much as
$2 billion in claims costs for insurers, risk-modeling firm
Eqecat Inc. said.  Tornadoes have killed 49 people in the U.S. this year,
according to a statement issued yesterday by Oakland,
California-based  Eqecat . The tornadoes will probably bring
claims of $1 billion to $2 billion, the firm said.  More than 150 tornadoes touched down from Feb. 28 through
March 3, most of them in  Tennessee ,  Kentucky ,  Indiana ,  Illinois 
and Alabama, Eqecat said. The U.S. has experienced 272 tornadoes
this year through March 4, more than twice the seven-year
average for the period, according to the statement.  “With basically a month’s worth of tornadoes last week,
that doesn’t necessarily say that the rest of the year will be
as bad as it has been so far,” said Jose Miranda, Eqecat’s
director of client advocacy. Referring to conditions that
increase the likelihood of tornadoes, he said, “You have to
have all the ingredients come together.”  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the biggest
U.S. home and car insurer, is among the top two providers of
homeowners’ coverage by market share in  Alabama , Kentucky and
Indiana, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The insurer
received about 3,600 claims from the tornadoes for that line as
of March 3, Holly Anderson, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “These are early numbers and we expect to know more early
this week as our customers assess damage,” said Anderson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
