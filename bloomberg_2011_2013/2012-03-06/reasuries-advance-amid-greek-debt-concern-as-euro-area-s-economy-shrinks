U.S.  10-year note  yields fell the
most in more than three weeks as  Europe ’s economy shrank and
investors weighed  Greece ’s chances of persuading creditors to
agree to a bond swap under its private-sector-involvement plan.  Treasuries (YCGT0025)  rallied as investors sought to minimize risk as
the debt-swap deadline loomed and before a report that may show
the  U.S. economy  added more than 200,000 jobs for the third
straight month. Stocks tumbled.  “They’re trying to discount the uncertainty,” said  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve . “The market’s already anticipating
participation in PSI may fall short of what Greece may need.”  Yields on 10-year notes decreased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 5:20 p.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They fell as
much as eight basis points, the biggest intraday drop since Feb.
10, and reached 1.93 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 29.
The price of the 2 percent securities maturing in February 2022
gained 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/2.  U.S. 10-year yields have traded between 1.89 percent and
2.08 percent over the past three weeks.  Yields on  30-year bonds  dropped eight basis points to 3.07
percent and touched 3.06 percent, also the lowest since Feb. 29.
 Two-year note  yields declined two basis points to 0.28 percent.  Volume Rises  Treasury market volume increased for a second day. About
$236 billion of Treasuries  changed hands  as of 5:01 p.m. through
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker, compared with
$194 billion on March 2 and a one-year average of $271 billion.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.5 percent, its
biggest drop since December, after climbing last week to the
highest level since 2008. The MSCI World Index tumbled 2.1
percent, its largest decline since November.  U.S. 10-year note yields are about 30 basis points from a
 record low  1.67 percent reached on Sept. 23 as European
officials struggle to put an end to the debt crisis that has
roiled financial markets for more than two years.  Treasuries gained as the European Union’s statistics office
said the 17-nation euro-area economy shrank 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, matching the forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The Greek government, which set a 75 percent participation
rate as a threshold for proceeding with the debt deal with
private-sector investors, said it will use collective action
clauses to compel holders of Greek-law bonds to accept the swap
if it receives sufficient consents from investors. The goal of
the exchange, which runs through March 8, is to reduce by 53.5
percent the total of privately held Greek debt, helping avert an
uncontrolled default.  ‘Focused on Greece’  “Everyone’s still focused on Greece,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. “It’s a reflection of the ongoing uncertainty
related to the process.”  U.S. payrolls increased by 210,000 last month after rising
by 243,000 in January, the most in nine months, and 203,000 in
December, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before the Labor Department’s report on March 9.  Economic growth in the nation will quicken to 2.2 percent
in 2012 from 1.7 percent in 2011, Bloomberg News surveys showed.
The euro-area economy will shrink 0.4 percent, they showed.  The U.S. economy grew at an annualized 3 percent rate in
the last three months of 2011, the fastest since the second
quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department reported on Feb. 29.  “Growth expectations are coming back down, even though the
U.S. put in a fairly good performance last quarter,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York.  Operation Twist  The Fed bought $4.03 billion of Treasuries today due from
May 2018 to November 2019, according to the Fed Bank of New York
website. The central bank is in the process of swapping $400
billion of shorter-maturity Treasuries in its holdings with
longer-term bonds to cap borrowing costs. The program is known
by traders as Operation Twist after a similar plan in the 1960s.  The outstanding amount of  zero-coupon  U.S. Treasury notes
and bonds fell for a seventh straight month in February, the
longest stretch of declines since 2009, as Operation Twist
soaked up securities.  Zero-coupon debt, or strips, short for separate trading of
registered interest and principal securities, is created by Wall
Street firms that split bonds into their face amount and
individual coupon payments. The amount of strips fell by $65.5
million to $195.1 billion last month, Treasury data show. Strips
reached a more-than 10-year high of $207.5 billion in July.  Fed ‘Driving Action’  “Customer activity level has ground to a halt as the Fed
has really been driving action in the market because of
Operation Twist,” said Charles Parkhurst, a strips trader and
managing director on the government-bond trading desk in New
York at the primary dealer Barclays Plc.  The Fed seeks out the cheapest securities for purchase,
which also happen to be the securities that most often get
stripped, Parkhurst said.  The yield gap between two- and 30-year U.S. securities,
called the yield curve, was 2.80 percentage points, compared
with a one-year average of 3.28 percentage points. A flatter
curve generally signals a more bearish outlook on the economy.  Yields indicate investors cut bets on inflation over the
past week. The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt, narrowed to
2.18 percentage points, from 2.27 percentage points on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
