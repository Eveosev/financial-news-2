Coal-seam gas producers planning
projects near prime farmland and wineries in New South Wales,
 Australia ’s most populous state, will face stricter regulation
under government proposals to protect the environment.  Developments within 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of “strategic
agricultural land” must gain approval from an independent
scientific panel before they can advance, Brad Hazzard, the New
South Wales planning and infrastructure minister, said today in
an e-mailed statement.  “We are delivering the best protection for agricultural
land in Australia and extremely tough controls on coal-seam
gas,” Hazzard said. The government’s plan will “ensure prime
agricultural land,” and the state’s wine and horse-breeding
industries are safeguarded, he said.  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  and  Santos Ltd. (STO)  are among Australian
companies with coal-seam gas projects in the state. Companies
exploring for the fuel in New South Wales and Queensland face
the risk of higher costs and delays because of tighter
regulation, Deutsche Bank said in a report yesterday.  Some environmental groups and politicians are concerned
drilling will damage aquifers, contaminate and deplete water
supplies, and diminish the capacity of food-producing land. The
state identified 1.35 million hectares of “high-quality
agricultural land” that will be subject to the tougher review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
