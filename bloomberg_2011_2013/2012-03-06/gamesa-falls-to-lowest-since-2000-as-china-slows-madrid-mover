Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA fell to
the lowest price since its initial public offering in 2000 after
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  forecast the world’s No. 2 economy
will grow at the slowest pace since 2008.  Gamesa dropped 6.5 percent to 2.20 euros by the close of
trading in Madrid, capping a two-day decline that wiped off 10
percent of its value. The stock has fallen 65 percent in the
past year as competition in developing markets squeezed its
margins and developers in the U.S. and  Europe  struggled to
finance projects.  The Zamudio, northern Spain-based wind turbine maker has
focussed on boosting sales in Brazil,  India  and China after
recession and spending cuts damped the growth prospects of the
wind power industry in the U.S. and Europe. The company last
month cut its sales forecast for this year to about 3,000
megawatts of turbines from about 3,250 megawatts, with Chairman
Jorge Calvet citing price pressure in  China .  “You cannot make the same margins in China as you can do
in France or Germany,” Julien Desmaretz, a renewable energy
analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co. Ltd. in Paris, said in a
telephone interview today. “That is eating Gamesa’s profit.”  Gamesa’s profit margin was 1.7 percent last year compared
with 3.6 percent in 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company saw net income increase to 51.1 million
euros in 2011 from 50.2 million euros the previous year.  Wen said yesterday the Chinese economy will likely expand
by 7.5 percent this year as the government seeks to rein in
inflation.  The average price of  wind turbines  fell 4 percent in the
second half of 2011 from the previous six months as Chinese
manufacturers undercut European rivals like Gamesa and
Copenhagen-based Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the biggest turbine
maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
