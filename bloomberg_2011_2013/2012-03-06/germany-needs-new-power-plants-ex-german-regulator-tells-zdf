Germany ’s power supply may face
risks unless new plants are constructed fast, Matthias Kurth,
the former head of the country’s Federal Network Agency, told
television station ZDF in an interview posted on the station’s
 website .  New gas power plants could substitute for nuclear stations
that will be disconnected over the next ten years, Kurth said.
Construction can take up to six years and no new projects have
yet been decided on, he said. Decisions must be taken within two
years to be able to maintain supply, Kurth added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
