The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment increased in the Asia-Pacific
region outside of  Japan , according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 2.3 basis points
to 145.3 basis points as of 11:17 a.m. in Sydney, Deutsche Bank
AG prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close since
Feb. 17, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 162 as of 8:46
a.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The index is
headed for its highest close since Feb. 27, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was little changed at 142.5
basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
