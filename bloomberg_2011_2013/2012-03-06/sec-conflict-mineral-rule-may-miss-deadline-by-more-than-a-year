The U.S.  Securities and Exchange
Commission ’s rules for companies to disclose the use of so-
called conflict minerals may not be finished until the middle of
the year, according to SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro .  The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 set an April 2011 deadline for
the rule, which requires public companies to disclose whether
any of four metals in their manufacturing or products came from
central  Africa , where mining revenue has funded violent militia
groups. Schapiro told House lawmakers in a Washington hearing
today the SEC will need at least “the next couple of months”
to finish.  “It is so complex and so out of the ordinary for the
SEC,” Schapiro said of the rule, which focuses on the origins
of gold, tantalum, tungsten and tin -- all common to the
manufacturing of electronics. She said the final rule will
include a phase-in period, and she wasn’t certain how long that
will be. The rule may emerge in “the middle of the year,” she
said.  When asked whether the agency will allow companies to use
smaller amounts of the metal without disclosure, Schapiro said
the statute doesn’t allow that and the rule “will try to give
latitude and flexibility in some areas.”  Less than halfway through the process of implementing the
2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the pace of rule-writing by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission has slowed by about half
since the first months after its enactment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
