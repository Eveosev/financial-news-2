MMI Holdings Ltd. (MMI) , which was born
out of the combination of two South African insurance companies
in 2010, said profit fell 25 percent after the merger proved to
be “ very challenging and complex.”  Net income for the six months ended Dec. 31 declined to 805
million rand ($106 million) from 1.1 billion rand a year
earlier, the Cape Town-based insurance company said in a
statement today. MMI,  South Africa ’s third-largest insurer,
increased its first-half dividend 5 percent to 44 cents while
so-called diluted core earnings per share excluding one-time
items, a measure that MMI uses to exclude “volatile items,”
rose 5 percent to 81 cents.  MMI Holdings, which has operations in 12 countries outside
of South Africa, was created out of a merger of  FirstRand Ltd.’s (FSR) 
Momentum Group Ltd. and Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. Like other
local insurance companies, including  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM)  and  Liberty
Holdings Ltd. (LBH) , MMI invests some of the insurance premiums it
receives in equities. In the six months ended December the
 FTSE/JSE All Share Index (JALSH)  was little changed, gaining 0.4 percent
during MMI’s reporting period.  “Ongoing uncertainties from the eurozone crisis could
continue to have a negative impact on business confidence in the
markets where we operate,” MMI said in the statement. Growth in
new business volumes will remain dependent on the economic
environment, including a recovery in employment and stronger
disposable income levels, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
