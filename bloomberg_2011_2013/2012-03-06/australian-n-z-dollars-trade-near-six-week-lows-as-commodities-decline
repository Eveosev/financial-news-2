New Zealand’s dollar rose from a
six-week low against its U.S. counterpart as stocks and
commodities advanced amid optimism private bondholders will
participate in  Greece ’s bailout.  The Australian dollar erased earlier losses against the
greenback after a private report showed U.S. companies added
more workers in February than the previous month. The Aussie’s
gains were limited as a report showed the country’s economy grew
slower than economists estimated. The kiwi’s rally from a six-
week low comes before the central bank meets.  “I think the conditions are firmly in place for commodity
currencies to outperform,” said  Neil Mellor , a currency
strategist in  London  at  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  “You have
to just put the euro-zone situation aside because that of course
has the potential to derail risk appetite generally.”  New Zealand’s dollar rallied 0.8 percent to 81.90 U.S.
cents at 2:37 p.m. in New York. Yesterday it slid to as low as
81.01, a level not seen since Jan. 25. The so-called kiwi added
1.1 percent to 65.46 yen. It fell to 65.31 yesterday, the least
since Feb. 16.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0572. The Aussie
climbed 0.5 percent to 85.79 yen. It earlier touched 84.81, the
lowest since Feb. 22.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose for the first time in
four days, rallying 0.6 percent and the MSCI World Index of
stocks gained 0.4 percent. The  S&P 500  had fallen for three
straight days in the biggest decline in 2012. The S&P GSCI  Index (SPGSCITR) 
of 24 raw materials gained 0.7 percent.  Australian Unemployment  Australia’s fourth-quarter GDP increased 0.4 percent in the
final quarter of 2011. It was forecast to gain 0.8 percent,
according to the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. The economy expanded a revised 0.8 percent in the
previous quarter, which was weaker than previously reported, a
Bureau of Statistics figures showed today.  The Australian dollar may weaken against its  New Zealand 
counterpart as the currency has become overvalued and foreign
purchases of government debt diminish, according to Nomura
Securities Inc.  Investors with holdings of at least 120 billion euros ($158
billion), or 58 percent, of the Greek bonds eligible for the
nation’s debt swap have agreed to sign on, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from company reports and government
statements. The Greek government has set a 75 percent
participation rate as a threshold for proceeding with the
transaction.  U.S. companies added 216,000 jobs in February, and a
revised 173,000 payrolls the previous month, according to ADP
Employer Services. That compares to an estimated 215,000
additional jobs, according to a Bloomberg News survey and a
previous reading of 170,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
