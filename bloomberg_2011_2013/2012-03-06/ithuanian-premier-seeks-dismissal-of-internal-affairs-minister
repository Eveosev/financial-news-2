Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius called for the dismissal of Internal Affairs Minister
Raimundas Palaitis, citing his “hasty actions” in firing
officials from the financial crime investigation service.  Kubilius’s move requires the approval of President Dalia Grybauskaite, the prime minister’s press office said in an e-
mailed statement today. Grybauskaite has previously backed
Palaitis’ actions at the financial crime investigation service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
