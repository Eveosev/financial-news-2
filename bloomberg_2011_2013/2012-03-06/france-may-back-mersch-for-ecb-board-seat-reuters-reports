France  may back Luxembourg central
bank governor Yves Mersch for a seat on the  European Central
Bank â€™s executive board, reversing an original preference for
 Spain  to retain the position, Reuters reported.  The French support for Mersch may be conditional on a deal
that would see one of their nationals take over as head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Reuters
reported, citing unidentified French diplomatic sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
