Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , the carrier
known as Turkish Airlines, began twice-weekly flights to the
Somali capital, Mogadishu.  A plane carrying officials including Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Bekir Bozdag touched down in the city today and was met
by a delegation led by Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.  Turkey’s show of support for Somalia by introducing the
route marks an “historic day” for the Somali people, Abdisalam
Mohamud, the minister of state for the interior, told reporters
at the airport.  Somalia descended into chaos after the ouster of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant
group with links to al-Qaeda, has been battling Somalia’s United
Nations-backed transitional federal government since 2007. The
 African Union  has 12,000 peacekeepers in the country supporting
Sheikh Sharif’s administration, while Kenyan and Ethiopian
forces entered the country last year to fight the militants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
