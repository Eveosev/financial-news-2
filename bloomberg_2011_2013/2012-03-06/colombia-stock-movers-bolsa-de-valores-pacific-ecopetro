The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  plunged 2.3 percent to 14,800.17, while the
Colcap Index dropped 1.6 percent to 1,707.85.  Oil producers dropped as crude fell after the European
Union offered to restart negotiations with  Iran  over its nuclear
program.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , plunged 5
percent, the most since Dec. 13, to 51,380 pesos.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
fell 1 percent to 5,180 pesos. Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage, cut its recommendation on Ecopetrol today to “sell”
from “buy,” saying the stock’s rally this year “has run ahead
of the company’s fundamentals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
