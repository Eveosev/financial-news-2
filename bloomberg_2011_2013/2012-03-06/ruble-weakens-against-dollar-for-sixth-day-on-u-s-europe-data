The ruble weakened for a sixth day
amid speculation the central bank was buying foreign currency to
stem its appreciation and after European data signaled slowing
growth, curbing appetite for riskier assets.  The Russian currency lost 1 percent to 29.635 per dollar at
the close in Moscow, the biggest daily drop since Feb. 10, and
extended the longest streak of declines since December. The
ruble slipped 0.2 percent to 38.87 per euro and retreated 0.6
percent to 33.7907 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area dropped
0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, European Union
figures showed today. Bank Rossii may be buying as much as $250
million a day to slow the ruble’s 7.9 percent appreciation
against the basket in 2012, according to Andrey Volkov, head of
foreign exchange and money markets at ZAO Natixis Bank in
Moscow.  “With the elections behind us, people are taking profits
before the long weekend in  Russia  this week,” he said by e-
mail. “We’ve come dangerously close to the lower boundary of
the basket where players expect more active participation of the
central bank buying the basket and increasing the size of its
interventions.”  Russia’s markets will be closed March 8 and 9 for a public
holiday. Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  won his bid to return to
the Kremlin in the presidential election March 4.  Floating Corridor  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. A level of 33.50 to 33.70
against the basket indicated the bank may be buying $200 million
to $250 million per day in other currencies against the ruble,
Volkov said.  Russia’s $2 billion of bonds due 2015 rose for the first
time in three days, pushing the yield down three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.301 percent. The yield on dollar-
denominated debt due the same year issued by OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s biggest lender, jumped 11 basis points to 3.563
percent, while the yield on similar-maturity notes from state
gas monopoly OAO Gazprom fell three basis points to 3.363
percent.  “In credit, we recently increased our overweight on Russia
due to elevated  oil prices ,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by
 James Lord  in  London  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated
yesterday. “We tend to favour Gazprom’s bonds to implement our
bullish strategy in credit, in particular Gazprom 2019.”  Real, Rupee, Yuan  Investors increased bets on the ruble depreciating, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 29.9877 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 29.6838
per dollar yesterday. The Russian currency has appreciated 8.5
percent against the dollar in 2012, while  Brazil ’s real rose 5.9
percent,  India ’s rupee strengthened 5.3 percent and  China ’s yuan
lost 0.2 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps rose nine basis points to
192 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct. 4,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.

negotiated market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
