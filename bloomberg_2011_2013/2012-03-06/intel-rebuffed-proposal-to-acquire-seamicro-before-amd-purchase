Intel Corp. (INTC) , inflaming a long-
running feud with  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , said it turned
down a chance to buy SeaMicro Inc. before AMD agreed to acquire
the startup last week.  Intel decided against an acquisition because it “wasn’t
impressed” with SeaMicro’s technology, Diane Bryant, who runs
the data-center chip business at the  Santa Clara , California-
based semiconductor maker, said today.  The startup offered itself to multiple possible acquirers,
according to Bryant, who made the comments at a  San Francisco 
event marking the introduction of a new line of server chips.
Intel dominates the market for processors that power machines in
corporate networks and data centers -- an area where SeaMicro
has made inroads.  “There’s very few people that they didn’t shop their
solution to,” she said. “We were not impressed and declined.”  When AMD announced the acquisition last week, SeaMicro
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman said he had multiple
offers before deciding to sell the company to AMD. He declined
to identify other parties interested in a deal. SeaMicro, which
currently uses Intel chips, makes so-called micro servers --
machines that handle tasks such as opening Web pages and logging
on customers to their online accounts.  The SeaMicro purchase will bring valuable intellectual
property, said  Phil Hughes , a spokesman for Sunnyvale,
California-based AMD.  “With the acquisition of SeaMicro, we believe we will have
the best server IP portfolio in the marketplace,” he said.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker,  rose  less than 1
percent to $26.61 at the close in New York. AMD dropped 2.4
percent to $6.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
