Germany ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields dropping to a seven-week low, after a European report
showed the region’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter as the
debt crisis undermined confidence.  Italian  government securities  fell for a second day as
 Greece  struggled to meet a deadline to conclude a deal with
creditors on a bond exchange required before it can access a 130
billion-euro ($171 billion) bailout. Portugal’s  notes  dropped
even after the  International Monetary Fund  said the nation
should be able to return to bond markets next year. Austria and
the Netherlands sold bonds today, while Greece and the European
Financial Stability Facility auctioned bills.  “The  euro zone  has a two-speed recovery with Germany and
other core countries doing relatively well, while you have
austerity” and recession in some of the high-debt nations, said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. The Greece talks “will continue to weigh
on sentiment and support bunds.”  The 10-year bund yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 4:31 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.77 percent yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 18.
The 2 percent bond due January 2022 gained 0.38, or 3.80 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.925. Two-year  yields  dropped
two basis points to 0.17 percent.  German bonds have returned 12 percent over the past year as
the region’s debt crisis worsened, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Greek bonds slumped 67 percent and Portuguese debt
fell 20 percent, the indexes show.  ‘Widespread Weakness’  The 17-nation euro-area economy shrank 0.3 percent in the
last three months of 2011, the European Union said today,
confirming an initial estimate published on Feb. 15. Exports
fell 0.4 percent, and household spending declined 0.4 percent.  “The breakdown of the report shows widespread weakness,”
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
 London , wrote in an e-mailed note. “Activity is very weak.”  Italy’s two-year yield climbed nine basis points to 1.9
percent. The 10-year yield increased 13 basis points to 5.06
percent, widening the spread over similar-maturity bunds by 18
basis points to 3.28 percentage points.  Spain ’s notes dropped for a third day, with the yield
rising 14 basis points to 2.45 percent.  Greek Swap  Investors are seeking safety in German bunds as Greece
seeks to conclude a deal with creditors before a bond repayment
due March 20.  Investors have until March 8 to agree on a debt-swap plan
that seeks to reduce their holdings of the nation’s bonds by
53.5 percent, helping the country avert an uncontrolled default.  “The Greek debt exchange is an important factor supporting
bunds,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “The market is nervous after the
rumors of a low participation rate reached so far. If the rate
is less than 75 percent of eligible bonds, there is an elevated
risk” the bond swap will fail.  The yield on the Greek bond due in 2022 was little changed
at 36.54 percent with the price at 19 percent of face value.  Portuguese  10-year bonds  declined for a third day, with the
yield rising six basis points to 13.91 percent.  “Our baseline expectation remains that  Portugal  will be
able to access markets,” Abebe Aemro Selassie, who is taking
over supervision of the IMF portion of the international bailout
plan for Portugal, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “This will not be easy.”  Bailout  The nation has been unable to sell debt due in more than a
year since it was given a 78 billion-euro bailout in May 2011,
following similar rescue deals in Greece and Ireland.  Volatility in Spanish government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by  France , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  French bonds  dropped for a third day, with the 10-year
yield rising four basis points to 2.87 percent.  Austria ’s 10-year securities fell as the nation sold 1.1
billion euros of 3.4 percent bonds maturing in November 2022,
attracting bids equivalent to twice the amount on offer. The 10-
year yield rose one basis point to 2.86 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
