Bank of Queensland Ltd . will
increase its standard variable home loan rate by 10 basis points
to 7.46 percent in response to “fierce” competition for
deposits and higher funding costs.  “BOQ has covered the higher cost of funding for a number
of months to provide our lending customers with certainty, and
it is disappointing that we’re unable to continue on that
course,” Stuart Grimshaw, chief executive officer of the
Brisbane-based bank, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The move came hours after  Australia ’s central bank left the
overnight cash-rate target at 4.25 percent, the second pause
after two reductions late last year. Larger Australian lenders
including  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  increased variable  interest rates  for mortgages
last month, weakening the link to central bank moves.  Bank of Queensland declined 0.1 percent to A$7.45. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.4 percent.  The new rate will take effect March 16, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
