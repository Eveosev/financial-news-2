Tanzania may receive “normal to
above normal” rainfall in the March to May period in the
northern parts of the country where coffee, cotton and tea are
grown, the country’s weather office said.  “Rains are expected to start in the first week of March in
Kagera and Mara regions and gradually spread over the rest of
the basin during the second week,” the Tanzania Meteorological
Agency said in a statement posted on its website today. “Most
parts of Lake Victoria Basin (Kagera, Mwanza and Mara) are
likely to experience normal to above normal rainfall, while
Shinyanga region is expected to receive normal rains.”  Coffee in Tanzania is grown in the northern region of Mt.
Kilimanjaro, and the Kagera and Tarime areas near the southern
shores of Lake Victoria, according to the coffee board. Cotton
is planted in Mwanza and Shinyanga, while tea is cultivated in
Bukoba, both near  Africa ’s biggest fresh-water lake. Tea is also
grown in Lushoto and Korogwe in the northeastern region of
Tanga, and the southern regions of Mbeya and Iringa.  Tanzania vies with  Kenya  to be Africa’s fourth-biggest
coffee producer, according to data on the International Coffee
Organization’s website. Ethiopia, Uganda and Ivory Coast are the
largest growers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
