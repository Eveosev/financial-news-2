Slovak economic  growth  accelerated
to 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier driven
by exports.  The result matches the preliminary figure released Feb. 15
and compares with a 3 percent expansion in the previous three-
month period, the Slovak Statistical Office in Bratislava said
today in a final report. On a quarterly basis, the gross
domestic product rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent. The
economy grew 3.3 percent for the whole of 2011.  Exports were the main driver of growth as domestic demand
declined mainly because of falling inventories, the office said.
Household spending fell 0.4 percent from year ago, while
 government spending  dropped 3.7 percent on the austerity
measures.  The data shows the economy of the east European country has
so far remained resilient to the slowdown in the euro region,
its main export market. Still, growth is set to slow this year
with the  Finance Ministry  expecting a 1.1 percent increase in
GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
