Kenya  is set to see “near-normal”
rain with a tendency toward “below-normal” in the long rainy
season from March to May, the Meteorological Department said.  “The March-to-May long rains are likely to exhibit poor
distribution both in time and space over most parts of the
country and more so in arid and semi-arid lands,” said Joseph
Mukabana, director of the Nairobi-based Meteorological office.  The department expects Western Kenya, the Nyanza region and
Central and South Rift Valley regions, the main food producing
areas, to receive “slightly enhanced” rainfall, he said. Kenya
is the largest tea exporter. Most of the crop is produced around
the Rift Valley, according to the Tea Board of Kenya.  Central Kenya, and the Eastern and coastal regions are set
for “slightly depressed” rainfall and northern Kenya will
probably be “highly depressed,” Mukabana said.  “Normal to below normal rainfall expected in the Tana
River catchment areas is likely to lead to low water inflows
into the Seven Forks hydroelectric power generators,” he said.  Kenya Power Ltd. planned to cut electricity tariffs should
the hydropower dams fill up during the long rainy season,
Managing Director Joseph Njoroge said on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
