Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  had the
biggest secondary-market share among primary dealers in
Hungarian government debt last year, the Debt Management Agency
said today.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  held the biggest share of
the primary market in bonds and  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s unit took the
most in treasury bill sales, the agency, known as AKK, said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  was the primary
dealer that increased its market share the most dynamically, the
agency said, without giving a breakdown of market share.  Primary dealers have the exclusive right to take part in
government debt auctions. The agency sold 6.477 trillion forint
($29 billion) in debt last year, according to the statement.  Hungary, the most indebted eastern European member of the
European Union, plans to finance itself “completely” from the
market this year, the AKK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
