Germany ’s Free  Democratic Party 
wants to push through limitations on high-frequency trading and
to regulate hedge funds and private-equity companies more
strictly,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing a plan by
Economy Minister Philipp Roesler.  Roesler wants price volatility caused by computer trading
to trigger trading interruptions at all European exchanges; he
also wants a financial markets tax on the lines of U.K. stamp
duty, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
