Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing their yield to the lowest level in more than a year, on
speculation  interest rates  will be cut. The dong advanced.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam instructed lenders to “reduce
interest rates to levels that are suitable to the macroeconomic
situation,” according to a statement posted on its website on
Feb. 13.  Consumer prices  rose 16.44 percent in February from a
year earlier after increasing 17.27 percent in January,
according to government data.  “Yields dropped probably because investors expect the
central bank will soon reduce interest rates,” said Cao Tan
Phat, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities Inc.
“Some commercial banks have already cut deposit rates.”  The  yield  on five-year notes fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.53 percent as of 3:57 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the lowest level since Feb. 21 last year.  The dong gained 0.3 percent to 20,830 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  unchanged at 20,828, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
