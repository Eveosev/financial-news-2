Russia’s grain exports for the
marketing season started July 1 are seen at “far below 25
million tons” by the end of March, signaling the government
won’t need to tax shipments,  SovEcon  said on its website.  Russia  exported  about 20.6 million metric tons of grains so
far, according to Agriculture Ministry data.  Russia exported fewer grains in February compared with the
rest of the season because the Sea of Azov was covered with ice,
the Moscow-based agricultural researcher SovEcon said today,
without providing monthly shipment figures.  Viktor Zubkov , first deputy prime minister, said in October
that Russia might tax grain exports to control inflation once
shipments reached 23 million to 24 million tons.  The country now expects to export 27 million to 28 million
tons in the 2011-12 season and no restrictions will be applied
at least until May, according to government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
