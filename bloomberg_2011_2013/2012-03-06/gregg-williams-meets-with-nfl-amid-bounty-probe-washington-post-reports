The coach at the center of a program
that paid bounties for injuring opponents met with National
Football League officials yesterday, the  Washington Post said ,
citing a person familiar with the case who requested anonymity.  Brian McCarthy , a spokesman for the NFL, declined to
confirm the meeting in an e-mail last night.  The league last week said that about two dozen  New Orleans
Saints  players were paid to injure rivals during Gregg Williams’s 2009-11 stint as defensive coordinator.  Players received $1,500 for a “knockout,” in which an
opponent was unable to return to the game, and $1,000 for a
“cart-off,” in which rivals were carried off the field.
Payments doubled or tripled during the playoffs.  “It was a terrible mistake, and we knew it was wrong while
we were doing it,” Williams said last week in an e-mailed
statement. “Instead of getting caught up in it, I should have
stopped it. I take full responsibility for my role.”  Williams, currently defensive coordinator for the St. Louis
Rams, was head coach of the  Buffalo Bills  in 2001-03 and
defensive coordinator for the  Washington Redskins  in 2004-07,
the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2008 and Tennessee from 1997-2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
