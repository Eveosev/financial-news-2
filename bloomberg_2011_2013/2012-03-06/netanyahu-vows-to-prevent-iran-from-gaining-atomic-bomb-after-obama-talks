Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , capping a day he started in White House talks with
President  Barack Obama , told Jewish leaders he won’t allow his
nation to be threatened by an Iranian nuclear bomb.  Iran would be more reckless and dangerous with a nuclear
weapon, Netanyahu said tonight in a speech in  Washington  to the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He said he wouldn’t
let Israel live in the “shadow of annihilation.”  While Netanyahu praised Obama for leading a campaign to
toughen economic sanctions on Iran, he said such actions haven’t
led Iran to curtail its nuclear program and Israel must be able
to defend itself against a threat to its existence.  “None of us can afford to wait much longer,” Netanyahu
said.  In the meeting with Netanyahu, Obama said “there is still
a window” for a diplomatic solution to the confrontation with
Iran. He said the U.S. has a “rock solid” commitment to
Israel’s security and that “all options” are available to
prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.  Speaking to Aipac yesterday, Obama said sanctions need more
time to work. He said “loose talk of war” is driving up the
price of Iranian oil and jeopardizing U.S. and Israeli security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
