(Correct company name on headline.)  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  headed for the
biggest advance in a week after Aabar Investments PJSC, an Abu
Dhabi government-controlled company, raised its stake in the
United Arab Emirates builder to 5.28 percent.  The shares gained as much as 5.1 percent, poised for the
biggest gain since Feb. 28, to 3.68 dirhams before trading at
3.56 dirhams at 10:04 a.m. in Dubai.  Data posted on Dubaiâ€™s stock exchange show the shareholding
is listed under Aabar Petroleum Investments Co., which in 2008
sold its energy assets to Mubadala Development    Co., an
 investment company  owned by the Abu Dhabi government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
