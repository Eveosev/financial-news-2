Harris County  Texas , which includes
the city of Houston, won a bid to join a group lawsuit seeking
damages from the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc.,
 Bank of America Corp . and Stewart Title Co.  U.S. District Judge Reed C. O’Connor allowed Harris and
nearby  Brazoria County (66583MF)  to enter the case that could result in
payouts of a much as $10 billion for all Texas counties,
according to court papers filed by the plaintiffs.  The counties accuse MERS, which runs an electronic registry
of mortgages, and members of the mortgage banking industry
including Bank of America of filing false lien claims in the
real property records of Texas counties. The suit also alleges
the defendants failed “to record subsequent assignments of
 mortgage loans  and pay the attendant filing fees.”  MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., has
said it complies with Texas’s recording statutes and
regulations.  Dallas  sued in state court in September and the defendants
won a change of the case to federal court in October. The U.S.
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in February denied an
attempt by the defendants to join the case with a lawsuit
brought against Merscorp by homeowners in  Arizona .  The case is Dallas County, Texas v. Merscorp Inc., 3:11-cv-
02733-O,  U.S. District Court (1100L) , Northern District of Texas
(Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
