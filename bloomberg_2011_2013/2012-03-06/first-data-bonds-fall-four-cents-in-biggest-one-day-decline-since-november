Bonds of  First Data Corp. (FDC) , the
credit-card processor acquired by KKR & Co. in 2007, are poised
for their biggest one-day drop since November, after reporting
yesterday that its lenders agreed to extend loan maturities.  First Data’s $2.4 billion of 11.25 percent senior
subordinated debt due March 2016 fell 4 cents on the dollar to
89.25 cents at 12:29 p.m. New York time, according to Trace, the
bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The company’s two largest bonds have lost $241
million in value since yesterday.  Because exchange-traded funds hold such a large portion of
the company’s debt, prices are susceptible to heightened
volatility when there are large flows into or out of these
portfolios.  Exchange-traded funds own more than 9 percent of  First
Data ’s $3 billion of 12.625 percent notes due 2021, with a State
Street Corp. fund holding 5.4 percent and a fund affiliated with
BlackRock Inc. 3.8 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  First Data had received approvals from lenders holding
more than 50.1 percent of loan commitments to extend $6.6
billion of first-lien term loans by 2.5 years to March 2017, the
Atlanta-based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing.  The amended credit facility will also allow First Data to
issue new senior secured notes to prepay a portion of the 2017
term loan, according to the filing.  ‘Ton of Debt’  “They have a ton of debt outstanding and that is
problematic,” Scott Dinsdale, a bond analyst at Montpelier,
Vermont-based KDP Investment Advisors Inc., said in a telephone
interview. “There hasn’t been any debt reduction or reduced
leverage.”  The company had $22.7 billion of total borrowings as of
Dec. 11, according to the filing. Leverage, or total debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
is 10.8 times, according to a Feb. 6 report by KDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
