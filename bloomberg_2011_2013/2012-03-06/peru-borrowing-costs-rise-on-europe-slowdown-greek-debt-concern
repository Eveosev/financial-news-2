Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose the most in three weeks as a report confirmed a
contraction in European economies and as investors weighed the
success of  Greece ’s debt swap, curbing demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 194 at 11:34 a.m. Lima time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the steepest rise since Feb. 10.  The euro area’s fourth-quarter gross domestic product fell
0.3 percent from the third quarter, the European Union’s
statistics office said today, confirming an initial estimate
published on Feb. 15. Bondholders owning a fifth of Greece’s
debt agreed to an exchange, even as the government has set 75
percent participation as the threshold for proceeding with the
plan.  “A complete demise of this Greek package would lead to a
very harrowing overall circumstance in Europe,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IdeaGlobal in  New York . “The peripheral recession is starting
to look quite dreary. Credits such as Portugal and Spain are
starting to show the wear that austerity measures can take on an
economy.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6740 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6750 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point to 5.46
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
security’s price gained 0.07 centimo to 115.86 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
