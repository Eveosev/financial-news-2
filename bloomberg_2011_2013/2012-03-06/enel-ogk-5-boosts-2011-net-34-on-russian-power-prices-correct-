OAO Enel OGK-5, the Russian utility
controlled by Italyâ€™s  Enel SpA (ENEL) , boosted profit 34 percent last
year, missing analyst estimates, after expanding plants and
benefiting from an increase in free-market power prices.  Net income climbed to 4.96 billion rubles ($168 million)
from about 3.7 billion a year earlier, according to an e-mailed
statement from Enel OGK-5. That missed an average estimated of
7.1 billion rubles from 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Operating revenue rose 14 percent to 60.1 billion rubles,
Enel OGK-5 said. Market prices increased by 11 percent in
European  Russia  compared with 2010, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
