Cypriot finance minister Kikis Kazamias asked the  European Central Bank  to buy the country’s
bonds on the secondary market,  Alithia  reported today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Kazamias’s request, included in a letter to the ECB, will
be supported by Athanasios Orphanides, governor of the  Central
Bank of Cyprus  who is also member of the ECB’s governing
council, when the body meets this week, the Nicosia-based
newspaper reported.  An unidentified  finance ministry  spokesman said Kazamias
had written to ECB President  Mario Draghi , with an analysis of
the fundamentals of the euro area’s third-smallest economy,
which was shut out of markets in May.  The bid yield to maturity of Cyprus’s 10-year bond that
expires in February 2020 was 14.21 percent today after it fell
from 14.24 yesterday, compared to 5.95 on March 7, last year.
Cyprus aims at slashing its fiscal deficit this year to 2.5
percent of gross domestic product from around 6 percent in 2011.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
