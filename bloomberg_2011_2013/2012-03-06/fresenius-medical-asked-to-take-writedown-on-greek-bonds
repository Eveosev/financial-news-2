(Corrects name of company in headline and first
paragraph.)  Fresenius SE (FME) , the German operator of
the Helios hospital chain and the Fresenius Kabi infusion-
therapy distributor, was asked to take writedowns on Greek
 government bonds  it received in lieu of unpaid hospital bills.  Fresenius accepted in 2010 an amount of bonds in the
double-digit millions of euros, a spokesman for the Bad Homburg,
Germany-based company said by phone today. Fresenius has already
sold the most of the bonds, which were included in the company’s
profit and loss statement with no significant or material
effect, the spokesman said. He declined to be more specific
about the original amount or the remainder.  In terms of the company’s overall sales, the amount is very
small and will have no effect on Fresenius’s finances, the
spokesman said.  Fresenius SE (FRE)  owns about 30 percent of Fresenius Medical
Care AG, the  Bad Homburg , Germany-based provider of kidney
dialysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
