Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
consolidated their control of the U.S. smartphone market in the
three months ended January, with three out of four devices using
their software,  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  said today.  Apple software was found in 29.5 percent of U.S.
smartphones, on average, in the period, up from 28.1 percent in
the prior three months, Reston, Virginia-based researcher
ComScore said in a statement today. Smartphones using Google’s
Android had 48.6 percent market share, up 2.3 percent from the
prior three months.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  saw its share drop
to 15.2 percent from 17.2 percent.  Google and Apple, with 78.1 percent of the market, are
gaining share as more consumers switch to smartphones and
devices running their software become more widely available.
More handsets have come out featuring Google’s Android operating
system and Apple continues to add new carriers, including  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)  which began offering the iPhone in October.  “We now have effectively a duopoly in the U.S. Market,”
 Charlie Wolf , an analyst at Needham & Co. Inc., said in an
telephone interview. “And it’s unlikely to change any time
soon.”  Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Cupertino,
California-based Apple had 74.4 percent of the smartphone market
at the end of October, according to ComScore.  U.S. smartphone users now exceed 100 million, ComScore
said. The researcher surveyed 30,000 U.S. mobile subscribers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
