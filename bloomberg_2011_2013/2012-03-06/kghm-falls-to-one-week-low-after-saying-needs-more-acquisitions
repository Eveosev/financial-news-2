KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  fell to the
lowest level in more than a week after Poland’s sole copper
producer said it needs to make at least one acquisition to
achieve its 2018 production target.  The shares dropped as much as 3.8 percent, the most since
Feb. 10, and traded 3.2 percent down at 141.90 zloty as of 11:43
a.m. in Warsaw, the weakest since Feb. 27.  The copper miner, which has Europe’s biggest output,
yesterday completed a purchase of Canada’s Quadra FNX Mining
Ltd. for C$2.87 billion ($2.87 billion). KGHM needs “at least
one more” acquisition to increase production of the metal to
its target of 700,000 a year by 2018 from 509,000 tons a year in
2011, Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Wirth  said at a conference
in Warsaw today.  Copper fell for a third day in  London  as a report confirmed
a contraction in the euro-area economy and as China lowered
growth targets yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
