Accuride Corp. (ACW) , a maker of wheels
for trucks and trailers, fell the most in more than three months
after the company said its chairman won’t seek re-election to
the board.  Accuride slid as much as 8.1 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since Nov. 21. The shares declined 6.3 percent to $7.50 at
12:53 p.m. New York time, after reaching $7.35. The shares have
risen 12 percent this year before today, after plunging 55
percent in 2011.  William Lasky, chairman of the Evansville, Indiana-based
company, won’t stand for re-election to the board at the April
24 annual meeting, Accuride said in a statement yesterday. Lasky
will remain chairman until his current term expires at that
time.  Lasky led the company through a 2009 bankruptcy
restructuring and was its interim chief executive officer for
more than two years until Rick Dauch took over in February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
