The U.S. Energy Department  increased
its crude-oil price projection for 2012 as  Iran  tensions climb,
supplies are disrupted elsewhere and world demand grows.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average  $105.71 a barrel 
this year, up 5.3 percent from the February projection of
$100.40, the department’s Energy Information Administration said
today in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The U.S.
benchmark grade will average $105.75 in 2013, up $2 from the
prior month’s estimate.  The average cost of domestic and imported grades used by
U.S. refiners will be $114.58 a barrel in 2012, up 8.9 percent
from last month’s projection of $105.23.  “We think there’s more than just Iran is behind the rise
in prices,” said Eric Kreil, an EIA international oil market
analyst in  Washington  who helped write the report. “This is a
tight market. We’ve had a number of outages in non-OPEC
countries and are looking for demand to rise.”  Futures have advanced 6 percent in New York this year amid
tension over Iran’s nuclear program and speculation that the
U.S. or Israel may attack Iran.  Outside of OPEC  Oil production outside of OPEC will rise 1.3 percent from
2011 to 52.46 million barrels a day in 2012, led by increases in
the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Kazakhstan. The previous estimate
was 52.54 million. Output declines are expected in  Russia ,
Mexico and the  North Sea .  Conflict in Sudan,  South Sudan , Yemen and  Syria  has
crippled production in the countries this year. Technical issues
trimmed U.K. and Canadian output. Total production outside of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was down about
1 million barrels a day last month because of the issues, Kreil
said.  The EIA  lowered its forecast  for global oil consumption
this year to 88.96 million barrels a day from 89.25 million last
month. Demand will be 1.2 percent higher than last year’s
average of 87.9 million. The 2011 consumption total was revised
up from 87.43 million in the February report.  U.S. oil consumption  will average 18.77 million barrels a
day in 2012, down from last month’s forecast of 18.87 million.
Next year demand is projected to climb to 18.88 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
