New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, dropped for a fourth day after
reports from the U.S. and  Europe  signalled economic growth is
slowing.  The stock slumped 2.5 percent to 150 koruna by 9:48 a.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would mark NWR’s longest stretch
of declines in more than three months. The  PX (PX)  gauge of companies
retreated 0.5 percent.  Global stocks and metals fell as U.K. retail sales shrank
before a report today that may show the European economy
contracted in the fourth quarter. A report yesterday showed U.S.
factory orders fell while  China  announced the lowest economic
growth target since 2004. Europe’s benchmark  coal  derivatives
slid 0.4 percent to $112.6 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
