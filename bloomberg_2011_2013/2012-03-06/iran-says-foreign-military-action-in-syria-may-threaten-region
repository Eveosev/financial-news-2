Iran  believes foreign intervention
in  Syria  may threaten the entire region, the country’s state-run

African Affairs Hossein Amir Abdollahian.  “Any military action in Syria could put the whole region

telling reporters today in Moscow. “Iran believes that a
political solution is the only option for solving Syria’s
current political issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
