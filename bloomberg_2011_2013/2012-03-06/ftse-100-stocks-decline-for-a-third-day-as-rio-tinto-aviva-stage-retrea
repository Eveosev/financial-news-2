U.K. stocks  retreated, sending the
FTSE 100 Index down the most this year, as investors weighed the
private-creditor support for a deal that  Greece  needs to
restructure its debt.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  led a  gauge  of mining shares to a two-month low
as metals prices declined.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  lost 4.7 percent after
analysts downgraded the insurer.  Meggitt Plc (MGGT)  slid 4.9 percent
after the company reported earnings.  The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 1.9 percent to 5,765.8 at
the close in  London , its largest selloff since Dec. 14. The  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  also tumbled 1.9 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index sank 2.5 percent.  “Investors have had their fingers on the sell button when
it became apparent that less than half of Greece’s creditors
have agreed to participate in the critical bond swap,” said
 Angus Campbell , head of sales at Capital Spreads in London. They
“have fled stocks and piled into safe-haven assets like the
dollar.”  Greece has set a 75 percent participation rate as the
threshold for proceeding with the debt swap which is required
for an international bailout. So far, investors holding about 20
percent of Greek bonds have said they will support the
restructuring.  The country’s private creditors have until March 8 to
participate in the transaction. If the proposal wins their
support, Greece will reduce its borrowings by 106 billion euros
($139 billion), lowering its debt to 120.5 percent of gross
domestic product by 2020.  Today’s selloff has trimmed this year rally in the  FTSE 100 (UKX) 
to  3.5 percent . The gauge has advanced for three straight months
amid better-than-estimated U.S. economic reports and speculation
that the euro area would contain its debt crisis.  Mining Companies Decline  The  FTSE 350 Mining Index (F3MNG)  dropped 2.2 percent to its lowest
level since Jan. 9 as a stronger dollar curbed demand for gold
as an alternative investment and base metals fell amid concern
demand may weaken as the euro area’s economies shrink.  A report today showed  gross domestic product  in the 17-
nation euro area dropped 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from
the third. A separate release showed  retail sales  in the U.K.
slid for a second month.  Lonmin decreased 4.7 percent to 1,018 pence,  Antofagasta
Plc (ANTO)  slid 4.3 percent to 1,237 pence and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  fell
2.6 percent to 2,502 pence.  Aviva lost 4.7 percent to 350.2 pence as Exane BNP Paribas
lowered its recommendation for the  U.K.’s second-biggest insurer 
by market value to “underperform” from “neutral,” saying the
company’s earnings will be lower and cash flows under pressure
in the “current low-yield, low-growth environment.” The
insurer is scheduled to report its  financial results  on March 8.  Meggitt, Wood Group  Meggitt sank 4.9 percent to 380.5 pence, trimming its
advance so far this year to 7.9 percent. The company today
reported full-year adjusted pretax profit of 323 million pounds
($508 million), in line with analyst estimates.  Chief Executive Officer, Terry Twigger, said the company,
which makes aircraft-engine sensors, wheels and brakes, may make
further acquisitions after spending $685 million to buy Pacific
Scientific Aerospace last year.  Elsewhere,  John Wood Group Plc (WG/)  plunged 7.6 percent to 705.5
pence, trimming its climb so far  this year to 10 percent . The
U.K. oil-services provider today reported a 16 percent increase
in earnings before interest, taxes and amortization to $398.7
million in 2011.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  lost 6.7 percent to 31.21
pence after surging 23 percent over the previous four days. The
Telegraph reported speculation that Vodafone Group Plc may not
make an offer by the Takeover Panel’s March 12 deadline.  Tata Communications Ltd. said it may make a cash offer for
 Cable & Wireless , setting up a potential rivalry with Vodafone
to win control of the owner of the U.K.’s largest business fiber
network.  Misys Plc (MSY)  climbed 1 percent to 338.5 pence after the
Financial Times reported that Temenos Group AG may sweeten its
planned $2 billion merger with the U.K. company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
