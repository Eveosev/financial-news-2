Wheat crops worldwide will probably
decline 2 percent in the year starting July 1 as yields return
to average after record production, said  Australia ’s government
commodity forecaster.  Harvests may drop to 682 million metric tons from 693
million tons as consumption gains 0.3 percent to 681 million
tons, the Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences said today. The world wheat
indicator price will drop 7 percent to average about $275 a ton.  Wheat futures have tumbled 17 percent in the past year as
global production and inventories headed for all-time highs and
world trade surged to the second-highest level in at least in
five decades. Global stockpiles may reach 220 million tons in
2012-2013 from 213 million tons a year earlier, Mike O’Dea, a
senior risk manager at INTL FCStone Inc., said Feb. 22.  “If we see supply increasing more strongly than what it
has and stocks continue to rise, that will put pressure on
prices,” said  Paul Morris , bureau executive director, in an
interview yesterday.  Abares joins the International Grains Council in predicting
a decline in harvests in the coming year because of lower yields.
The council expects global production to drop by 15 million tons
to 680 million tons, it said Feb. 23.  Wheat  output  in the U.S., the biggest exporter, may gain 6
percent to about 58 million tons as yields recover, while
 China ’s production may gain 2 percent to 120 million tons, the
bureau said in a report. The Russian Federation may produce 5
percent more wheat at 59 million tons as output in  Kazakhstan ,
the second-largest shipper in the former  Soviet Union , slumps 31
percent on a return to average yields, it said.  Canada, EU   The crop in  Canada (WHETCA00)  may be 2 percent higher at 26 million
tons, while production in the European Union may gain about 2
percent to 140 million tons, according to the bureau.  “It is unlikely that the supply-side growth will be able
match the demand increases” in the short-term, said Jammie Penm,
chief commodity analyst at the bureau. “We don’t think that
demand will come very quickly or very sharply. It’s a gradual
process,” Penm said in Canberra today.  Global demand for grains may climb 50 percent over the next
40 years, faster than forecast population growth of 40 percent,
Alison Watkins, chief executive officer of GrainCorp Ltd.,
eastern Australia’s largest handler, said today.  The area planted to  wheat  in Australia, the second-biggest
shipper, may decline 2.5 percent to 13.7 million hectares (33.9
million acres) in 2012-2013 as farmers switch to barley and
canola on better returns, according to Abares.  Australian Crops  Output may drop 13 percent to 25.7 million metric tons in
the year from July 1, from a record 29.5 million tons a year
earlier, the bureau said. Canola plantings may rise 4.8 percent
and barley sowings may gain 2.9 percent, it said.  “Things are looking a little better for barley and canola
than wheat,” said Morris. “Because of the nature of Australian
agriculture, where there’s a lot of mixed-enterprise farms and
the farmers are quite savvy to changes in prices, they’ll move
to some extent between activities depending on price.”  Australia’s canola production may increase 5.4 percent to a
record 2.9 million tons and barley output gain 5.1 percent to 9
million tons, Abares said. Wheat  exports  may total 21 million
tons in the year from July, from a record 21.2 million tons a
year earlier, it said. Australia is set to be the second-biggest
wheat exporter in 2011-2012 after the U.S., according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture .  Black Sea  The area sown to wheat, coarse grains and oilseeds in
Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine may increase by an average of 2
percent a year to about 90 million hectares “over the medium
term,” the bureau said. Between 11 million hectares and 13
million hectares of idle land suitable for cropping is available
for expansion, it said.  The so-called free-on-board Gulf price of U.S. hard-red
winter wheat may fall 7 percent in 2012-2013, reflecting record
world opening stockpiles and expected high global production,
the bureau said. Global wheat  stockpiles  may total about 210
million tons in 2012-2013 as production exceeds consumption and
as inventories in the U.S. rise about 10 percent to 28 million
tons, it said.  “Globally, we’ve seen prices for crops come down a bit
over the last few months and we’re expecting, in real terms,
that prices will ease over the next few years,” Morris said.
“In terms of returns, they’ll be a little less favorable than
in the last 12 months or so but, in historical terms, remaining
reasonably high.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
