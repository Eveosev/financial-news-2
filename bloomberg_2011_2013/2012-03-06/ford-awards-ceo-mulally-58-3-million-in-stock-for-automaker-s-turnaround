Ford Motor Co. (F)  awarded Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally $58.3 million in stock as a
reward for the automaker’s turnaround.  Ford paid the stock to its top executive as part of an
incentive plan for 2009, according to  filings  yesterday with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ford earned $29.5
billion in the last three years after $30.1 billion in  losses 
from 2006 through 2008. The shares, which traded as low as $1.01
on Nov. 20, 2008, closed yesterday in  New York  at $12.09.  Mulally will receive other compensation for 2011, including
salary and benefits, which will be revealed in a proxy report in
the coming weeks. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford withheld some of
the stock award to cover Mulally’s income taxes. After taxes,
Mulally received $34.5 million in stock. Ford has awarded him
stock worth more than $100 million the past two years.  “Our compensation philosophy is to align the interests of
our leadership with those of our shareholders,” Todd Nissen, a
spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. “Ford’s stock was $1.96
a share at the time of the 2009 awards, and is over $12 a share
today. That is a more than a 500 percent increase, which
benefits all stakeholders in the Ford turnaround.”  Last July, United Auto Workers President  Bob King  assailed
Mulally’s compensation as “outrageous” and “excessive.” Last
year, Ford rewarded Mulally with $56.6 million in stock. The
executive’s 2010 compensation rose 48 percent to $26.5 million.  Options, Restricted Stock  In his new awards, Mulally, 66, also received 1.28 million
 stock options  with a strike price of $12.46, which he can begin
to exercise next year, and he was awarded 376,016 restricted
stock units that can be converted into shares in 2014.  Executive Chairman  Bill Ford , 54, received 595,238 stock
options with a strike price of $12.46, the first of which he can
exercise next year, and he was awarded 175,473 restricted stock
units that can be converted into shares in 2014, according to a
separate filing with the SEC.  General Motors Co. CEO Dan Akerson, whose pay must be
approved by the Obama administration’s special pay master, said
Jan. 10 that he won’t get a cash bonus for 2011, the year the
Detroit-based automaker earned a record profit and again became
the world’s largest.  Akerson, who served as CEO for four months in 2010,
received $2.53 million in total compensation for that year,
including a $566,667 salary and $1.96 million in stock awards
and other pay, GM said in a proxy statement last year. His
annual salary was $1.7 million, the filing said.  Other Auto CEOs  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler
Group LLC, didn’t receive a cash salary or shares from the
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker, according to a company
filing yesterday. Marchionne is also CEO of  Fiat SpA (F) , which owns
58.5 percent of Chrysler.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  was
the highest paid CEO in Germany in 2010, with total compensation
of 9.3 million euros ($12.2 million), a study from the DSW
association for private investors showed.  Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn
received 982 million yen ($12.2 million) in total compensation
for the 2010 fiscal year, including salary and stock options,
making him the highest-paid leader among Japanese companies.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  President  Akio Toyoda  was paid 136
million yen in the year ended March 31, 2011, including a 24
million yen bonus, according to a filing last year to  Japan ’s
finance ministry.  Ghosn’s pay was lower than the 2010 average for global
automotive companies, estimated at about $15.3 million by Towers
Watson & Co., a U.S. benefits consultant. Mulally’s 2010
compensation was the highest in the  auto industry , the
consultant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
