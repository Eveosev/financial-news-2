RWE AG (RWE) , the second-largest utility
in  Germany , said full-year profit fell 34 percent on the cost of
phasing out nuclear power and losses from supplying natural gas.  Recurrent net income, the measure used to calculate the
dividend, fell to 2.48 billion euros ($3.25 billion) from 3.75
billion euros a year earlier, the Essen-based company said
today. The result beat the 2.4 billion-euro median estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Germany’s biggest utilities are overhauling operations as
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the permanent closing of all
nuclear plants by 2022 after  Japan ’s Fukushima disaster. Costs
associated with nuclear shut-downs trimmed earnings by more than
1 billion euros, RWE said today. The company plans to divest 7
billion euros in assets between 2012 and 2013 and start cost-
cutting measures totaling about 1 billion euros through 2014.  “We have introduced the necessary measures to get us
through the trough quickly,” Chief Executive Officer Juergen Grossman said in a statement. Grossman will be succeeded by
Peter Terium in July. “I am optimistic that the program can be
implemented in agreement with the workforce.”  RWE is selling assets such as its Czech NET4GAS gas-grid
unit and a stake in local utility VSE. The company may also
divest its interest in Berlinwasser Holding AG, part-owner of
the German capital’s water utility. The 7 billion-euro disposal
program, down from 11 billion euros in assets sales proposed
last year, will be completed by the end of 2013, RWE said.  Growth Beyond 2013  “Although the shift in RWE’s disposal program underlines
our concerns over RWE’s growth beyond 2013, we believe RWE’s
share price will react well to 2013 guidance at the upper end of
expectations,” Bank of America Corp.’s Christopher Kuplent said
in a note to investors.  Recurrent net income in 2012 and 2013 will be similar to
2011 earnings, helped by increased oil and gas production at the
company’s RWE Dea unit, RWE said. The division contributed 558
million euros to the 2011 operating result. Nuclear taxes and
oil price-linked gas contracts will weigh on earnings.  RWE  closed  down 0.1 percent at 34.445 euros in Frankfurt
trading, valuing the company at 21 billion euros.  Cost Savings  Improved operating procedures and cuts in administration
spending will save the company 750 million euros in 2013 and 250
million euros in 2014, RWE said. It’s committed to a payout
ratio of 50 percent to 60 percent of recurrent net income and
proposed a dividend of 2 euros a share, down from 3.50 euros.  RWE’s cost-cutting program will “raise efficiency, which
means to reach more with the same,” Terium said. “It’s about
reducing costs, and that can affect procurement or taking less
capacity from third parties. It may also affect jobs.”  Losses from the company’s mid-stream gas business widened
to 800 million euros in 2011 from 21 million euros a year
before. The unit is unlikely to recover before 2014, and will
probably report a loss of about 500 million euros in 2012,
according to Credit Suisse.  RWE is among European utilities fighting above-market gas-
supply rates charged by  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia ’s gas-export
monopoly, and is in arbitration with the Moscow-based company.
Gazprom Deputy Chairman  Alexander Medvedev  said in February he
was “optimistic” about settling pricing disputes.  Total Generation  The utility will spend 16 billion euros on property, plant
and equipment through 2014. Around 4 billion euros will go
toward boosting RWE’s renewable energy generation to at least 20
percent of the utility’s total generation mix by the end of the
decade from 8 percent last year. Renewable energy division RWE
Innogy will contribute as much as 500 million euros to 2014
operating profits, Terium said.  More than 60 percent of the company’s capital expenditure
will come from outside its home market in coming years. RWE said
it plans to “achieve organic growth primarily in Central and
Eastern  Europe , where the energy consumption trend is dynamic
compared to our markets in the northwest of Europe and which
still have some ground to make up in terms of infrastructure.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
