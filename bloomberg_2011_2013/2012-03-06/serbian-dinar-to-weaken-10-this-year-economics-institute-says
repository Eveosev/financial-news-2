Serbia ’s dinar will weaken at least
10 percent this year as capital inflows dry, the Belgrade-based
Economics Institute said.  The dinar will likely drop by “only” 10 percent this year
to 116 per euro if Serbia attracts around 1.5 billion euros ($2
billion) in foreign direct investment or close to five percent
of its economic output and lowers the goods and services trade
gap to 16 percent of GDP from 16.5 percent in 2011, Stojan Stamenkovic, the institute’s chief macro economist, told a news
conference.  The forecast assumes the central bank selling around “one
billion euros” from its foreign exchange reserves to curb more
excessive dinar weakening, Stamenkovic said in Belgrade.  Pressure mounted on the dinar as Serbia’s external debt
servicing costs hit 39 percent of its export revenues this year,
compared with 25 percent that would have been a “tolerance
limit” for a country like Serbia, he said.  The dinar is the fifth-worst performer among 176 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, with a 4.85 percent depreciation since
February. It traded at 110.6777 as of 3:54 p.m. in Belgrade.  The dinar weakness was triggered by the government’s
decision to freeze its $1.3 billion precautionary loan program
with the  International Monetary Fund  as Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic’s cabinet no longer commands the majority in
parliament needed to revise the 2012 budget and adjust the
spending plan to lower growth forecasts and targets agreed with
the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
