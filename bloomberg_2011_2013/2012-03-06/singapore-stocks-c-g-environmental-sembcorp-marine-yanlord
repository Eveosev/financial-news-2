Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI)

since Nov. 10. Six shares fell for each that rose in the 30-
member gauge.  The following were among the most active shares in the

Hong Kong-based operator of power plants that generate
electricity using municipal waste, jumped 7.1 percent to 15
Singapore cents as it resumed trading following a halt
yesterday. The company said it will raise about $5 million by
selling 34 million warrants at an exercise price of 18.5

builder of oil rigs, declined 6.3 percent to S$5.06. Temasek

62.4 million Sembcorp Marine shares at S$5.25 each, a person
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Stephen Forshaw , a
spokesman for Temasek, declined to comment.  Yanlord Land Group Ltd. (YLLG)   dropped 2.7 percent to
S$1.25 after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services cut the Chinese
property developer’s long-term credit rating to BB- from BB,
with a negative outlook. “The contracted sales of Yanlord were
weaker than we expected in 2011 and we don’t see signs of
improvement in 2012,” S&P said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
