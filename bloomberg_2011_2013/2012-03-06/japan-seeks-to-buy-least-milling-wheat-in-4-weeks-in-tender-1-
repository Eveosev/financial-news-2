Japan  is seeking to buy 117,000
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on March 8, the smallest volume in four
weeks, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipments are from April 21 to May 20 for the Canadian
wheat, and from May 1 to May 30 for the Australian grain,
Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s grain-trade division said today
by phone. The U.S. supply is for arrival in Japan by June 30, he
said. The volume sought is the smallest since Feb. 9, when the
government bought 98,552 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 4.29 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31. Details of this week’s
tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
