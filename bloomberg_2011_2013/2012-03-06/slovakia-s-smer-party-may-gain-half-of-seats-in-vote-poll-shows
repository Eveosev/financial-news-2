Support for Slovakia’s main
opposition party, Smer, rose before this weekend’s early
elections as current governing-coalition parties lose ground
because of public discontent over corruption allegations.  Smer, led by former Premier  Robert Fico , would receive 39.7
percent in the March 10 vote, giving it 75 seats in the 150-seat
assembly, according to a poll conducted Feb. 21-27 by Focus, a
private company. The four parties in Iveta Radicova’s Cabinet
would get a combined 27.6 percent, the Bratislava, Slovakia-
based Focus said today.  A leaked suspected intelligence file suggesting ties
between politicians and local businessmen during the 2002-2006
rule of Foreign Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, another former
premier, have sparked rallies and weakened support for his SDKU
party to 5.1 percent from 6.1 percent three weeks earlier.  The public discontent over corruption is helping bolster
the chances for new parties to clear the 5 percent threshold
needed to gain entrance to Parliament, according to the poll.  Ordinary People and 99 Percent, both established last year,
would gain 6.7 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, according
to the poll conducted on a sample of 1,036 respondents. No
margin of error was given.  The following is a table of preferences for parties, which
would be represented in parliament, according to the Focus poll:  Party              February 21-27, %         February 1-7, %  Source: Focus. * - member of the current ruling coalition  To contact the reporter on this story:
