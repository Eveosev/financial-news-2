Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief
executive officer of casino operator  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , lost
$680 million after China announced its lowest economic growth
target since 2004 and shares of the company fell.  The stock declined 2.8 percent yesterday, cutting Adelson’s
fortune to $25 billion and making the casino mogul the world’s
13th richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires
Index, a daily ranking of the world’s wealthiest people. His net
worth is up 27 percent this year, the index shows.  Las Vegas Sands owns casinos in China, Singapore and the
U.S. China pared the nation’s economic growth target to 7.5
percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005, a signal
that leaders are determined to cut reliance on exports and
 capital spending  in favor of consumption.  Adelson, 78, and his wife, Miriam, will exercise a warrant
to buy 87.5 million common shares at $6 apiece, Las Vegas Sands
said in a regulatory filing after U.S. markets closed yesterday.  Las Vegas Sands fell $1.58 to $54.80 in New York. The
shares have climbed 28 percent this year. Ron Reese, a spokesman
for the Las Vegas-based firm, didn’t immediately return a phone
call seeking comment.  Warren Buffett , chairman and CEO of  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , was the biggest gainer on the list yesterday. His fortune
climbed $533.1 million as shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based
investment-holding company advanced 1.2 percent. Buffett, 81, is
currently the world’s third-wealthiest person after  Carlos Slim 
and Bill Gates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
