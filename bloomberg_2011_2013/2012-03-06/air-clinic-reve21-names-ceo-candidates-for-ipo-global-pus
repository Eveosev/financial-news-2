Reve21 Co. , the Japanese hair clinic
operator, shortlisted four candidates to replace Chief Executive
Officer Katsumasa Okamura and prepare the company for an initial
public offering and expansion abroad.  The four, including former  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  employee Jun
Iwata, have already been hired from 500 applicants outside of
the company, founder and CEO Okamura said in an interview in
Tokyo on March 5. Osaka-based Reve21 plans to open its first
overseas business in Shanghai by Dec. 31 and list on exchanges
in Tokyo and  Hong Kong  as early as 2015, he said.  Reve21 is among Japanese companies that are looking abroad
as a declining  population  hinders growth opportunities at home.
The hair clinic, which doubled customers to 145,000 in six
years, will start business in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea
as well as  China , Okamura, 67, said.  “We can’t hope for much from the Japanese economy, so the
rest of  Asia  will be a driver for growth,” said Okamura, who
plans to retire after choosing his successor late next year. He
expects the candidates “to push our global expansion and beef
up management to prepare for the listings.”  Iwata, 42, spent more than a decade at Toyota, where he was
involved in international product planning and marketing. He has
a Master of Business Administration degree from the  University
of Michigan .  ‘Excellent Insight’  “Iwata has excellent insight and footwork,” Okamura said.
“He actually flew to Shanghai last weekend and interviewed a
candidate to manage the new business.”  The other candidates are Makoto Nomura, 52, who had a stint
at cosmetics maker  Kao Corp. (4452) , Hiroto Muramatsu, 48, who worked
at  East Japan Railway Co. (9020)  and Masaki Yamamoto, 50, a former
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  employee. The CEO will be
paid at least 30 million yen ($369,000) a year, Okamura said.  Reve21 will brief the press on its hiring and overseas
expansion plans today at around 1 p.m. in Tokyo.  The hair clinic aims to open about 100 outlets in China,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan in five years, compared with
the 96 currently operating in  Japan , Okamura said. A total of 50
shops will open in China alone within three years, he said.  Okamura founded Reve21 in 1976 after inventing a hair
tonic. Unlike domestic competitors  Aderans Co. (8170)  or  Artnature
Inc. (7823) , Reve21 doesn’t offer hair transplants or wigs. The
company, which employs about 800 people in Japan, provides
counseling to find causes of hair loss and treats roots with
techniques such as laser beams and herbal blended shampoos.  Hair Loss  About 42 million Japanese men and women suffer from hair
loss, a third of the  population , Reve21 estimates. Japanese
spend about 430 billion yen on hair care each year and the
market is growing as the population  ages , according to a study
conducted by Yano Research Institute Ltd. from January to March
in 2010.  A two-year course of treatment costs about 1.6 million yen,
according to Reve21’s consulting center, which also advises
members on how to improve eating habits and lifestyles to reduce
stress that might contribute to hair loss.  Reve21 will start looking for the lead manager of its IPO
in the “near future,” Okamura said. The firm had a profit in
each of the past four years, and revenue totaled about 13
billion yen in the year ended September, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
