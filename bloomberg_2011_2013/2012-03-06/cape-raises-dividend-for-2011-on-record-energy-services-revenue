Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of scaffolding,
fire protection and cleaners to energy companies, increased its
dividend for 2011 after posting record sales.  The payout of 14 pence a share, is up 17 percent from 2010,
the Uxbridge, England-based company said in a statement. Sales
rose 11 percent to 722.5 million pounds ($1.1 billion), while
profit after tax slid 5.5 percent to 49.7 million pounds.  The company, which counts the biggest energy companies as
clients, is working on liquefied natural gas plants in
 Australia , and said  Asia  is its strongest growth market.  It rose 3.6 percent to 445 pence by 9:37 a.m. in London,
giving the company a market value of 528 million pounds.  “We’ve always said we’d be progressive about dividends,”
Chief Executive Officer Martin May said by phone. “We’ve got
more than 60 percent of our 2012 consensus earnings already in
the order book.” The dividend “indicates our confidence.”  Consensus analyst estimates for revenue this year are
currently about 760 million pounds. The company has said it
expects sales to reach about 785 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
