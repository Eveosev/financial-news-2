Brazil ’s economy last year  posted 
its second-weakest performance in eight years on higher
borrowing costs and a currency that rallied to a 12-year high in
July.  Gross domestic product grew 2.7 percent in 2011, the
national statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro. The
forecast was for 2.8 percent growth, according to the median
estimate from 32 economists in a Bloomberg survey. In the fourth
quarter, the second-largest emerging market after  China  grew 0.3
percent from the previous three months.  The GDP figure underscores central bank President Alexandre Tombini’s view that the economy has grown “below capacity”
over the last three quarters, creating room for further cuts in
 interest rates . Growth will pick up speed and reach an
annualized pace of more than 5 percent in the second half of the
year, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said last month.  Economic expansion last year slowed as the central bank
increased rates through July to combat inflation. Since August,
the bank has reduced the overnight rate by 200 basis points to
10.50 percent, cut taxes on consumer goods and pledged to boost
public works. Traders are wagering that policy makers will cut
the benchmark Selic rate to 9 percent by July.  Manufacturers from steel to textiles were hit last year as
the real rallied to a 12-year high of 1.54 to the U.S. dollar in
July, reducing the cost of imports.  Brazil’s inflation, as measured by the IPCA-15  price index ,
slowed to 5.98 percent in the 12 months through mid-February,
its slowest pace since December 2010.  The yield on interest rate future contracts maturing
January 2014 declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 9.55 percent at 9:17 a.m. in Brasilia. The real
weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7464 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
