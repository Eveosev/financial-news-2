Indian  bonds  gained after the
central bank said it will extend debt purchases to ease a cash
squeeze in the banking system  Yields fell after Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said in an interview with CNBC TV-18 yesterday that
reducing the cash-reserve  ratio  for banks was an option. The
monetary authority will buy as much as 150 billion rupees ($3
billion) of notes on March 9, according to an RBI statement. The
central bank has bought 1.1 trillion rupees of fixed-income
securities since November.  “The open-market auction announcement to buy bonds has
enthused the market,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income
trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “This will help
reduce liquidity pressure to some extent.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due in November 2021
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.22 percent
as of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate is the lowest since Feb. 29.  Lenders  borrowed  an average 1.5 trillion rupees a day from
the  Reserve Bank  in March, according to central bank data, more
than double the maximum of 600 billion rupees favored by the
monetary authority.  Policy makers cut the amount of deposits lenders must set
aside as reserves to 5.5 percent from 6 percent on Jan. 24, the
first time since 2009. The next policy review is due on March 15.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 8.14 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
