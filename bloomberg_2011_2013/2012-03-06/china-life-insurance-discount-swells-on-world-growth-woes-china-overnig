China Life Insurance Co. (LFC)  tumbled in
New York to trade at the biggest discount to Hong Kong in seven
months, leading a slump in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks amid signs
of a looming global slowdown.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 index  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. slid 2.3 percent to 104.10 yesterday in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Dec. 12. American
depositary receipts of China Life sank the most since August
after the nation’s largest insurer said 2011 profit may have
fallen as much as 50 percent. Macau casino operator  Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  dropped the most in a month on a slower
growth outlook for the city’s gambling revenue.  China cut its 2012 economic growth target to 7.5 percent on
March 5, down from 8 percent over the past seven years, as the
European debt crisis and sluggish U.S. recovery crimp demand for
goods from the world’s largest exporter. The economy of  Europe ,
China’s biggest trading partner, shrunk 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, data released yesterday showed.  “The Chinese have to change their target because clearly
they won’t meet the last target,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of
New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which manages $1.5
billion of assets including Chinese stocks, said by phone
yesterday. “I don’t think the big risk rally in  emerging
markets  is justified given the fundamentals.”  ADRs of China Life slid 8.5 percent to $40.27, the biggest
decline since Aug. 8. The drop boosted the ADRs’  discount  to
China Life’s Hong Kong-traded shares to 5.9 percent, also the
most since Aug. 8. Each ADR represents 15 common shares.  ‘Impairment Losses’  China Life’s  Hong Kong  stock fell 3.7 percent to HK$22.15
yesterday, or $2.85 per share, and  shares  traded in  Shanghai 
slipped 3.5 percent to 17.69 yuan, the equivalent of $2.80 and
the lowest level since Jan. 9.  China Life’s net income for 2011 may have dropped by 40
percent to 50 percent from a year earlier based on Chinese
accounting standards, the Beijing-based company in a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. The decrease was due
to “the decline in investment yield and the increase in
impairment losses caused by the fluctuation in the  capital
market ,” according to the statement.  Eight out of 34 analysts have a “sell” rating on China
Life’s Hong Kong stock while 21 rate it as a “hold,” according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit of China Life fell 46 percent in the third quarter,
while Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Pacific Insurance
Group Co., the nation’s second- and third-biggest insurers, also
reported net income drops for the three months to Sept. 30.  China ETF Slides  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., sank 3.6 percent to $37.75,
the biggest slump since Dec. 12. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
lost 1.5 percent, the most this year, to 1,343.36.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 8.9
percent in the last three months of 2011, the least in 10
quarters. Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in January and 5.4
percent in 2011, while the government maintained a goal of 4
percent for this year.  “Equities have underperformed in recent years and
investors were very worried about the current slowdown,”
 Frederic Neumann , Hong Kong-based co-head of Asian economic
research at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a Bloomberg TV interview
yesterday.  Melco Crown’s ADRs tumbled 7.1 percent to $12.06, the
biggest daily drop since Jan. 30, to trade 6.1 percent  below  its
Hong Kong-listed stock, the most since Dec. 8. Shares on the
Hang Seng index fell 2.4 percent to HK$33.25, the equivalent of
$4.28. Each ADR represents three common shares.  Youku Versus Tudou  Gambling revenue in Macau, the only Chinese city where
casinos are legal, is expected to grow in the low double-digits
or high single-digits this year, Macao Daily News reported
yesterday, citing Francis Tam, the city’s secretary for economy
and finance. Revenue at Macau’s casinos jumped 42 percent to 268
billion patacas ($33.5 billion) in 2011, according to data from
Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.  Youku Inc., which runs the largest video-sharing website in
China, declined 6.7 percent to $23.96 in  New York , the biggest
daily loss in three weeks. Youku has surged 53 percent this
year, the second-biggest gainer on the Bloomberg China-US 55
index. Competitor Tudou Holdings Ltd. slid 1.6 percent to $12,
cutting its gain this year to 9.3 percent.  Tudou is narrowing the gap with Youku in terms of market
share of video views after adding content and expanding ties
with so-called microblogs, Chief Executive Officer Gary Wang
said in an interview yesterday.  Aluminum Corp. Falls  Shanghai-based Tudou’s share of video views rose to 13.8
percent in January, from 11.9 percent in December, according to
data from ComScore Inc. supplied by Tudou’s Wang. Youku’s
viewership dipped to 21.8 percent from 22 percent in the same
period.  Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer
of the metal, sank 7.1 percent to $12.14 in New York yesterday,
the most since Jan. 30. Prices of nonferrous metals may decline
about 20 percent on average this year, Zhou Zhongshu --
president of China Minmetals Corp., the nation’s biggest metals
trader -- said yesterday.  Three-month aluminum dropped a second day on the London
Metal Exchange, to trade down 2.3 percent at $2,235.50 a metric
ton, the lowest since Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
