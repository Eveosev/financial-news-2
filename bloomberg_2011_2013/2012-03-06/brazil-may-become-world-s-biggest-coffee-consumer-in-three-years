Brazil , the world’s largest coffee
producer, may become the biggest consumer in two to three years,
according to Marcos Pinta Gama, the country’s permanent
representative to international organizations in  London .  Brazil consumed 18.9 million bags of coffee in 2010, up 4
percent from a year earlier, according to the London-based
 International Coffee Organization . That compares with 21.8
million bags used in the U.S., the biggest consumer and an
increase of 1.6 percent, ICO data show.  “The perspective for coffee demand is to keep increasing,
especially in emerging markets,” Gama said in an interview at
the ICO yesterday. “There are also perspectives for
demand to rise in producing countries like Brazil.”  Coffee consumption has started to rise in some areas of
 Africa , where tea dominates, according to Gama. Consumption in
 China  is also on the rise, he said. “The new middle class in
China has started to drink coffee as it adopts some western
habits,” Gama said. “The country is not yet part of ICO, but
we see the private sector moving there.”  Brazil welcomes increasing sustainability actions in
coffee markets, Gama said. “Producers need to get adequate
returns to fight poverty and increase productivity in the
context of rising demand and limited stocks,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
