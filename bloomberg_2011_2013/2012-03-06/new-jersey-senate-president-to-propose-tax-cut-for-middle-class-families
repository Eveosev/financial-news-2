New Jersey (STONJ1)  Senate President  Stephen Sweeney , the state’s highest-ranking Democratic lawmaker, will
unveil a tax-reduction plan for middle-class residents as
Republican Governor  Chris Christie  pushes a 10 percent across-
the-board cut in income-tax rates.  Sweeney scheduled a news conference at the Statehouse in
Trenton at 3 p.m., the same time Christie plans to hold a town-
hall meeting in Ocean Township on his proposal. The West
Deptford Democrat, in a press advisory, said his plan would
“provide middle-class families up to 11 times more tax relief
than the scheme proposed by the governor.”  Christie, 49, began a series of public meetings in January
to press his case for hastening what he calls “the Jersey
comeback.” Democrats, who control both houses of the
Legislature, have said Christie’s proposal favors the wealthy,
and that he should focus on easing the property-tax burden.  New Jersey residents pay the highest property taxes in the
U.S. Their bills averaged $7,759 in 2011, up 2.4 percent from
2010, according to the state Department of Community Affairs.  Under Christie’s tax-cut plan, someone earning $50,000
would pay $80 less while a person making $1 million would save
$7,200, according to calculations distributed by Democrats.  Telephone calls to Sweeney, Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver,
Assembly Majority Leader  Louis Greenwald  and Senate Budget
Committee member Jeff Van Drew, all Democrats, weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
