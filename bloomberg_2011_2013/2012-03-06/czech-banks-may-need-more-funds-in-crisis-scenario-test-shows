Several Czech lenders would need a
capital injection if the euro area’s debt crisis worsened
significantly, while the banking industry as a whole would
remain stable, results of central bank stress tests showed.  The Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said it tested banks
under two outlooks, including economic developments according to
the bank’s own forecast and a stress scenario assuming an
“extreme decline in economic activity stemming from a
significant deepening of the debt crisis in the euro area.” The
stress scenario, covering the next three years, implied rising
risk aversion and a decline in Czech government bond prices.  “Capital adequacy of the entire industry would remain
above the 8 percent regulatory minimum even in the very
unfavorable stress scenario, which combines negative
developments in the domestic and foreign economies and a renewed
uncertainty on financial markets,” the central bank said in a
report published today on its  website .  The  Czech Republic  didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as the amount of toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets and deposits
exceeded loans, according to central bank data. The economy
depends on demand from the euro area, which takes about 70
percent of all Czech exports.  “Several banks” would need a capital injection totaling
about 19 billion koruna ($1 billion), or 0.5 percent of gross
domestic product, in the debt-crisis scenario that assumed a GDP
fall of more than 6 percent in the third and fourth quarters of
this year, the central bank said in the regular quarterly report
on the health of financial institutions.  The bank also forecast the share of non-performing
corporate loans held by Czech banks to rise to “nearly” 9
percent from the second half of 2012 in the basic economic
scenario based on its forecast. The overall capital-adequacy
ratio of Czech banks was 15.2 percent at the end of last year  To contact the reporter on this story:
