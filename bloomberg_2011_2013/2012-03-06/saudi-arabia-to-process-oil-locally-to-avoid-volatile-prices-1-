Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
oil exporter, plans to process more crude into fuels and
petrochemicals in the coming years, its oil minister said.  Refining more crude domestically will help diversify the
kingdom’s income away from volatile prices, Ali al-Naimi said in
a speech in the Persian Gulf coastal city of Jubail.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is expanding its refining capacity to
meet domestic demand and increase exports of oil products that
fetch higher prices than crude. Refining capacity will rise to
3.46 million barrels a day in 2016 from 2.26 million barrels,
according to a company presentation in October.  Brent crude  rose to $128.40 a barrel on March 1 and traded
at as little as $98.74 on Aug. 9. Futures were at $123.93 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  at 8:37 a.m.
local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
