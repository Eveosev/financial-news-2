Mexico ’s peso fell the most in
twelve weeks as mounting concern that global growth is faltering
damped demand for the Latin American country’s higher-yielding
assets.  The peso weakened 1.3 percent to 13.0011 per  U.S. dollar  at
4 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.8354 yesterday. The decline was
the biggest since it fell 1.8 percent on Dec. 12. The drop pared
gains for the year to 7.2 percent.  Europe ’s economy contracted in the fourth quarter as
investment fell by the most since 2009 and exports and consumer
spending dropped. Data yesterday showed U.S. factory orders
declined and  China  announced the lowest growth target since
2004. Twenty-three of 25 major emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg weakened against the dollar today.  “This is a heavy week in terms of data and events,”
Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a currency strategist at RBS Securities
Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said by phone. “I don’t think
these recent numbers have reversed the sentiment on growth yet,
but we’ve come actually from a very strong period of economic
indicators. So it’s almost like the market was used to getting
upside surprises in the indicators and then we get some sort of
disappointment here and that’s that first reaction.”  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos of 27-day Cetes and 8
billion pesos of the 91-day securities it offered today, the
central bank said on its website. The government also sold all
8.5 billion pesos in 182-day bills it auctioned and 9.5 billion
pesos of the 336-day bills it offered, the bank said.  The yield on the country’s peso-denominated debt due in
2024 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.50
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.76 centavo to 130.24 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
