Brazil , the world’s largest coffee
producer, plans to double financing available for coffee storage
this year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.  Investment for storage would rise to 1.5 billion
reais ($857 million), Edilson Martins de Alcantara, director of
the coffee department at the country’s Ministry of Agriculture,
said in an interview in  London  today. The proposal may be
approved as early as this month, he added.  “The aim is to enable the producer to store coffee and to
sell it at the best opportunity,” he said at a meeting of the
 International Coffee Organization .  Coffee output in Brazil will likely rise to a record in the
2012-13 season starting in July as trees enter the higher-
yielding half of a two-year cycle, the government estimates.
Production will be 49 million to 52.3 million bags, exceeding
the all-time high of 48.5 million bags in 2002, according to a
Jan. 10 report from Conab, the government’s forecasting agency.  “It has been raining normally and the tendency is for a
large harvest to be confirmed,” de Alcantara said. “There are
no indications that there will be a problem.”  Dry weather last year raised speculation that the next
crop in Brazil would be smaller than the previous high-yielding
season in 2010-11. Arabica coffee futures traded in  New York 
rose to the highest price since May 1997 last year. Prices have
since dropped 36 percent.  Agriculture producers in Brazil have had to sell most of
their output at the same time due to the lack of storage
facilities, de Alcantara said.  “This harvest is turning out to be big and it is up to us
to manage this big harvest so that we can have  price
stability ,” he said. “That would be our great challenge.”  A bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
