Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined for a
second day, leading Czech stocks down before a report that may
confirm a contraction in the euro-area economy and as investors
weighed  Greece â€™s chances of avoiding default.  The Austrian lender dropped 2.2 percent to 462 koruna by
10:30 a.m. in Prague. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where Erste
has a 22 percent weighting, retreated 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
