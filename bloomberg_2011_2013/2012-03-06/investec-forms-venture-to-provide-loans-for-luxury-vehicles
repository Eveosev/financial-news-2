Investec Bank Plc’s asset finance
unit formed a venture to provide financing to businesses and
individuals for the purchases of sports and luxury cars as banks
cut lending.  The agreement with London Asset Finance will provide loans
of between 25,000 pounds ($39,501) and 200,000 pounds with 15
percent deposits, according to a statement today.  “Following a dramatic contraction of the number of lenders
and available funds in the high-value vehicles market we see a
real opportunity to fill a gap that has developed over the last
two to three years,” Mike Francis, managing director of
Investec Asset Finance said in the statement.  The venture came after Investec bought the contract hire
business of Birmingham-based vehicle-leasing company Masterlease
UK in December 2010, Investec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
