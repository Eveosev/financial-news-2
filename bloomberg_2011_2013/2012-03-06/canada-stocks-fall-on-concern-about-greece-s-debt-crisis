Canadian stocks  fell the most this
year as the  U.S. dollar  gained and fuels and metals dropped on
concern a second bailout of  Greece  won’t stop the country from
defaulting or the global economy from slowing.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
declined 4.3 percent as crude futures retreated. First Quantum
Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest publicly traded
copper producer, plunged 6.2 percent as the metal lost the most
in 12 weeks.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-biggest
lender by assets, decreased 1.6 percent as financial companies
dropped.  The  S&P/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 225.32 points, or 1.8
percent, to 12,298.63 after company reports showed the investors
that have committed to Greece’s debt swap represent about 20
percent of privately held Greek bonds. The country has set a 75
percent participation rate as a threshold for proceeding with
the transaction, which runs through March 8.  “As the markets rallied for 10 weeks, we’ve had lots of
snippets of less-than-expected numbers, and the markets have
gone up in the face of it,” Jeff Burchell, a  money manager  at
 Aston Hill Financial Inc. (AHF)  in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees about C$5.5 billion ($5.5 billion).
“If you look behind it, it seems like an excuse to take some
profits.”  After its biggest two-month gain to start a year since
2004, the index has decreased 3.3 percent to a seven-week low
over the past three days. Raw-materials and energy companies
retreated after  Germany  reported a decline in retail sales and
 China  reduced its annual economic-growth goal. The S&P/TSX
hadn’t slipped three days in a row since Dec. 15.  European Contraction  The U.S. dollar increased against 15 of 16 other major
currencies today. The currency extended its advance after the
European Union’s statistics office said its economy contracted
0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, confirming an earlier
estimate.  The  S&P/TSX Energy Index (STENRS)  decreased the most since Nov. 23
as crude oil fell to a two-week low on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Suncor dropped 4.3 percent to C$33.32.  Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-biggest company in the industry by revenue,
lost 4.3 percent to C$35.84.  Crew Energy Inc. (CR) , a western Canadian oil and gas producer,
fell 8.3 percent to C$11.45 after recording a C$181.9 million
writedown due mostly to the impact of lower natural gas prices
on asset values.  Precious Metals  Gold stocks  in the S&P/TSX extended their three-day slump
to 5 percent as the metal dropped to the lowest since Jan. 24.
 Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest producer of the metal,
lost 1.6 percent to C$46.89.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest company in the industry, decreased 1.4 percent to
C$45.72.  Colossus Minerals Inc. (CSI) , which is developing a gold
project in  Brazil , tumbled 12 percent, the most since February
2009, to C$5.75.  Base-metals and coal producers retreated, extending a  2012
low (STDIVM) .  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest company in the
industry, fell 2.3 percent to C$35.48.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) ,
which operates in  Europe , slumped 6.6 percent to C$4.51.  First Quantum tumbled 6.2 percent to C$20.60 after dropping
5.4 percent yesterday. The company, which is facing a strike at
its Kansanshi mine in Zambia, is to report quarterly financial
results today.  Major Drilling Group International (MDI)  Inc., which provides
services to mining companies, sank 5.1 percent to C$17.26 after
its quarterly  earnings  trailed the average estimate of analysts
in a Bloomberg survey by 16 percent, excluding certain items.  Ample Supplies  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, retreated 3.2 percent to
C$43.28 as corn futures declined after settling at the highest
since September yesterday. China won’t need large imports of
corn this year as it has ample supplies, Nie Zhenbang, the head
of the country’s grain administration, told reporters in Beijing
today.  The  six largest S&P/TSX banks  and all eight insurers fell.
TD dropped 1.6 percent to C$80.55.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , its
bigger domestic rival, lost 1.1 percent to C$56.15.  Manulife
Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s third-largest insurer,
retreated 4.1 percent to C$11.81.  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , the country’s second-largest
railroad, declined 3.4 percent to C$72.25. North American
railroads slipped after Consol Energy Inc., the third-largest
U.S. coal producer, said it will cut output at its Buchanan mine
in Virginia due to lower demand from foreign steelmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
