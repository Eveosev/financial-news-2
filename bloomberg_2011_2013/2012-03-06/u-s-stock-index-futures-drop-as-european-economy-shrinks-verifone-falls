U.S. stocks slumped, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest decline this year, as
concern grew about the success of a Greece debt-swap deal and
after a report showed that the European economy contracted.  All 10  groups  in the  S&P 500  fell as financial, industrial
and commodity shares had the biggest losses.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,
Caterpillar Inc. and Bank of America Corp. decreased more than
3.2 percent. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index of companies
most-dependent on economic growth slumped 2.7 percent as 29 of
its  30 stocks  retreated.  Merck & Co. (MRK)  dropped 2.6 percent as the
drugmaker’s profit forecast trailed analysts’ projections.  The S&P 500 decreased 1.5 percent to 1,343.36 at 4 p.m. New
York time, falling the most since Dec. 8. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slid 203.66 points, or 1.6 percent, to
12,759.15. About 7.5 billion shares  changed hands  on U.S.
exchanges, or 12 percent above the three-month average.  “Investors typically dislike uncertainty more than they
dislike bad news,” Michael Koskuba, who helps oversee $28
billion at Victory Capital Management Inc. in New York, said in
a telephone interview. “There’s concern about whether or not
there will be enough participants in the Greek debt swap. The
fear is that if it doesn’t happen the way most want it to
happen, there’s potential for a greater recession in  Europe .”  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  lost 2.1 percent for its
biggest drop since November. Private investors that so far
declared their participation in  Greece ’s debt restructuring hold
about one-fifth of the bonds involved in a swap, which ends
March 8, required for a bailout.  Economic Concern  Concern about a global slowdown increased a day after  China 
cut its economic growth target. Data today showed that Europe’s
economy shrank 0.3 percent last quarter and  Brazil (BZGDGDP4) ’s growth last
year had its second-worst performance since 2003. The reports
intensified bets that a rally that took the S&P 500 to an almost
four year-high last week has outpaced economic prospects.  “I’m watching this market suffer,” said  Alan Gayle , a
senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion. “The market has
more questions than answers. That makes investors nervous at
these relatively lofty index levels.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, advanced 16 percent to 20.87.  Twenty-nine out of the Dow’s 30 stocks retreated today, led
by companies whose earnings are most-tied to economic growth.
Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, dropped 4.1 percent
to $9.47.  Caterpillar (CAT) , the world’s biggest maker of construction
and mining-equipment, lost 3.8 percent to $105.93.  Banks Tumble  Financial companies had the biggest decline in the S&P 500
among 10 groups today, falling 2.5 percent. Bank of America
retreated 3.3 percent to $7.71.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  dropped 4.6
percent to $32.12. Morgan Stanley tumbled 5.3 percent to $17.32.  Merck & Co. fell 2.6 percent to $37.44. Earnings excluding
one-time items will be 95 cents to 98 cents a share in the first
quarter, Merck said. That was  less  than the $1.01 average of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Based on an exchange
rate of $1.31 per euro, revenue will take a 1 percent to 2
percent hit from currency, the company said today.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost 0.5 percent to $530.26, extending its two-
day decline to 2.7 percent. The company, which topped $500
billion in market capitalization for the first time last week,
will hold a product event tomorrow in  San Francisco , where it’s
said to be releasing the third generation of its best-selling
iPad tablet computer.  Weight Loss  Nutrisystem Inc. (NTRI)  tumbled 11 percent to $10.58. The provider
of prepared meals to help clients lose weight forecast annual
earnings per share of no more than 55 cents, falling short of
the average analyst projection of 92 cents a share, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  added 11 percent to $8.32. The
online recruiting service hired Stone Key Partners LLC and  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch to help it review strategic
alternatives.  OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI)  rose 8.4 percent to $17.16.
The primary supplier of camera sensors for Apple’s iPhone 4S was
upgraded to outperform from neutral at Robert W. Baird & Co.,
which cited research showing the company may be a supplier of
sensors for Apple’s iPad3.  Hedge funds gained 0.8 percent in February, underperforming
equities around the world, which climbed on expectations Europe
would tame its debt crisis.  The Bloomberg aggregate hedge fund index increased to
117.16 from 116.25 in January as long-short equity,
multistrategy and global macro funds climbed.  Protection Concern  “In February they did well but not as well as you would
have expected them to do based on the capital markets,” said
Don Steinbrugge, managing partner of Agecroft Partners LLC, a
Richmond, Virginia-based firm that advises hedge funds and
investors. “That’s attributable to the fact that the average
hedge fund manager was more concerned with protecting downside
than capturing upside.”  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  rose 5.1 percent including
dividends in February amid better-than-estimated economic
reports, including one that showed employment in the U.S., the
world’s largest economy, topped forecasts, and optimism that
Greece would receive a second bailout. Hedge funds fell 5.2
percent last year as concerns grew that Europe’s debt crisis
couldn’t be contained and stocks experienced sharp price swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
