A 16-story hotel will be built on
the site of a  Barclays Plc (BARC)  branch in the City of  London ,
according to  planning documents  lodged with the borough of that
name.  Endurance Land, a closely held property developer, plans to
construct a hotel with 9,990 square meters (107,500 square feet)
of space near Aldgate underground station, the documents showed.
The hotel will have 291 beds.  Endurance and Scottish Widows Investment Partnership
Property Trust, part of Lloyds Banking Group,  bought  the land in
June 2010, a statement on Enduranceâ€™s website said. Endurance
won planning permission for a  258-room  hotel at the site in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
