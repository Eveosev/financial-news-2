Investors are keen to return to
earthquake-damaged Christchurch as rebuilding in  New Zealand ’s
second-largest city begins, according to the  Canterbury
Earthquake Recovery Authority .  “Investors are turning up at our office wanting to talk
about opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer Roger Sutton told
parliament’s finance and expenditure select committee in
Wellington today.  About 20 central-city building projects are under way even
as demolition on some of the tallest office towers begins and
will take another year, Sutton said. More than a year after a
temblor that killed 185 people and closed the business district,
the city is becoming attractive to companies and investors from
New Zealand and overseas, he said.  Christchurch was “well insured” and that money “will
flow back into the city,” Sutton said. “There will be some
investors who take their money elsewhere but we will see
different investors going forward.”  The authority has more than 1,000 commercial buildings to
demolish and will also manage 6,000 home demolitions in coming
years, he said. It is investing about NZ$40 million ($32
million) a month on power, water and road repairs that will take
more than four years to complete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
