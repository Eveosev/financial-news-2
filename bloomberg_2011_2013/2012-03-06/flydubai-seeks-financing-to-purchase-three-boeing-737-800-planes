Flydubai, Dubai’s low cost carrier,
is seeking to finance three Boeing 737-800 planes due for
delivery in the fourth-quarter of this year.  Financing the purchase through the U.S. Export-Import Bank
is one of the options, the carrier said in an e-mailed statement
today. The planes are worth $253.2 million at list prices.  “While we have traditionally sought sale and leaseback
options, as we develop and mature we are seeking to diversify
our options and as a result have received a number of favorable
responses,” the company said. “We are currently assessing
these offers and will announce contract signings in due
course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
