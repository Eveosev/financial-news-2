The Indianapolis Colts will cut
quarterback  Peyton Manning  rather than pay the four-time
National Football League Most Valuable Player a $28 million
contract option as he tries to return from a neck injury that
cost him the entire 2011 season,  ESPN reported .  The network, quoting people close to the team who requested
anonymity, said the announcement will come tomorrow at a news
conference in Indianapolis with Manning and team owner  Jim Irsay 
in attendance.  Colts spokesman Avis Roper said in an e-mail that he could
not confirm the ESPN report because Irsay was at an NFL finance
committee meeting.  The Colts, who finished 2-14 last season, have the first
pick in April’s NFL draft and Irsay has said the club will
select Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck .  The Colts have a March 8 deadline to decide whether to pay
Manning the $28 million option. He had neck surgery in September
and didn’t play last season as Indianapolis had its worst record
since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
