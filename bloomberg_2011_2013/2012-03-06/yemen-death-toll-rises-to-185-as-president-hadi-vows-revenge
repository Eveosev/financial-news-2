Yemeni President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi vowed to confront terrorism “by all means” as the death
toll rose to 185 in an attack by suspected al-Qaeda militants
against an army base.  “The confrontation will continue until we are rid of the
last terrorist,” Hadi said, according to the state-run Saba
news agency.  Some of the 185 soldiers who were killed were beheaded, a
Yemeni military official said today, speaking on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  Islamic militants overwhelmed an army outpost in the south
earlier this week, killing soldiers and looting the base of its
heavy weaponry and armored vehicles  To contact the reporters on this story:
