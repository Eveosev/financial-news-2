Defending national champion the
 University of Connecticut , the  University of Pittsburgh ,  Seton
Hall University  and Villanova University advanced to the second
round of the  Big East Conference  men’s basketball tournament.  Connecticut beat  DePaul University  81-67, Pittsburgh won
73-59 against  St. John’s , Seton Hall beat Providence 79-47 and
Villanova topped Rutgers 70-49 yesterday at Madison Square
Garden in New York.  Jeremy Lamb had 25 points and Ryan Boatright had 19 points,
seven assists and six rebounds for the Huskies (19-12) who are
seeking an invitation to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament, where they won the title last year.  “I think today we moved the ball well,” Lamb said.
“Early I had a couple open shots. I tried to set my man up and
our big men had great screens so I was able to knock a couple
down.”  Connecticut  took a 46-33 lead into halftime and extended
the advantage to 24 points before DePaul closed within nine with
about seven minutes remaining.  The Huskies, 9-10 in the conference, take on eighth-seeded
West Virginia today in the second round.  Connecticut is seeded ninth in the tournament, the same
position the Storrs, Connecticut, school found itself in last
year before winning five straight games to take the conference
championship. The Huskies went on to win the national title with
a 53-41 win against Butler.  DePaul (12-19), seeded 16th, was led in scoring by
Cleveland Melvin and Moses Morgan, with 19 points each.  Pitt Faces Georgetown  Ashton Gibbs scored 20 points for the Pittsburgh Panthers,
and  Seton Hall  got 16 points each from Herb Pope and Brandon
Mobley.  Pittsburgh (17-15), the No. 13 seed, will face fifth-seeded
Georgetown in the second round. With a 6-13 record in the  Big
East , the Panthers will need to win the tournament to qualify
for an 11th straight NCAA tournament.  “I think we’ve gotten better the last couple of weeks and
it’s a good sign as we go forward here,” Pitt coach Jamie Dixon
said. “We’ve got to defend and I think we did that today and
we’ll continue to do that as we go forward tomorrow.”  St. John’s, paced by 25 points from Moe Harkless, finished
its season with a 13-19 record.  Seton Hall (20-11), the No. 10 seed, next will face
seventh-seeded Louisville after its win against No. 15
Providence (15-17), which got 14 points from LaDontae Henton.  Maalik Wayns had 28 points for Villanova (13-18), which
overcame a 34-30 halftime deficit to advance to today’s game
against South Florida. Eli Carter had 23 points for Rutgers
(14-18).  The tournament final is March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
