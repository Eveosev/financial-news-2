MAN SE (MAN) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest
commercial vehicle maker, raised 750 million euros ($984
million) from its first bond sale since 2009 as car and truck
company note yields fall to the lowest in at least 16 years.  The five-year securities were priced to yield 68 basis
points more than benchmark swap rate, or about 2.2 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 65
basis-point spread on Munich-based MAN’s 7.25 percent securities
due 2016, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show.  European car and truck maker bond yields plunged 0.83 basis
points this year to 2 percent, the lowest since Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s Euro Automotive index started in 1996. Corporate
bond yields are falling across the board as the  European Central
Bank ’s program of providing cheap loans to banks bolsters
investor confidence in the region’s credit markets.  “Obviously lower yields are an attraction, but it’s a
receptive market and has been since January,” said  Suki Mann , a
credit strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London . The ECB’s
longer-term refinancing operation has been the driver for the
rally, he said.  MAN is taking advantage of “favorable” market conditions
to sell the bonds, which will be used for general corporate
purposes, said spokesman Stefan Straub in Munich. Banca IMI SpA,
BayernLB, Commerzbank AG and Banco Santander SA managed the sale
of the new bonds, he said.  The truckmaker, controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) , has a further
1.5 billion euros of bonds outstanding, including 1 billion
euros  maturing  in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
MAN is ranked at  A3 (MAN)  by Moody’s Investors Service and an
equivalent A- at  Standard & Poor’s .  MAN’s sales and earnings will fall this year amid a
stagnant commercial-vehicle market in Europe, it forecast on
Feb. 14. Net debt rose to  2.2 billion euros  last year from 1.8
billion euros in 2010, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
