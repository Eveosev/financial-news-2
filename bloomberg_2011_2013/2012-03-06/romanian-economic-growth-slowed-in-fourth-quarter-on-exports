Romania ’s  economic growth  slowed in
the fourth quarter for the first time since June, as European
austerity measures hindered export demand, final figures show.  Gross domestic product  grew a seasonally unadjusted 1.9
percent from a year earlier, matching a preliminary report on
Feb. 15 and compared with 4.4 percent in the third quarter, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said today.  GDP
shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent from the previous
quarter for the first time in five quarters.  Romania’s output growth will probably slow this year, after
exiting its worst recession on record last year, as the European
sovereign-debt crisis cuts demand for eastern European industry
exports. The economy will probably grow as slow as 1.5 percent
this year, less than an initial forecast of 1.8 percent,
according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.  The economy grew 2.5 percent in 2011 from a year earlier,
after contracting 1.3 percent in 2010, the statistics office
said, confirming the Feb. 15 release.  Agriculture and industrial output, the main growth drivers
in 2011, rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 2 percent,
while final household consumption grew 1.4 percent, the second
consecutive quarter of growth since 2008, according to the
institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
