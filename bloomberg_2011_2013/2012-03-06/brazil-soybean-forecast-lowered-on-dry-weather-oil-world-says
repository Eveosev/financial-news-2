Brazilian soybean farmers will
collect 68 million metric tons of the oilseed in 2011-12, down
0.7 percent from a forecast last week, as dry weather during
growing and disease cut yields, Oil World said.  A fungal disease that’s the worst in four years will curb
production after the dryness slashed yields, the Hamburg-based
researcher said today in a report. Output forecasts were cut in
the states of Parana and  Rio Grande  do Sul as rain was too late
to save plants, the researcher said. Output will fall 9.7
percent from last year.  “Crop reports from Brazil and Paraguay are alarming, with
yields obtained smaller than expected,” Oil World said. “In
Mato Grosso too much rainfall, lack of sunshine and widespread
infestation with the Asian rust fungus will sizably reduce
yields below last year’s.”  Soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade have gained
10 percent this year as the dry weather cut yield projections.
The price gained 10 straight sessions through March 2, the
longest winning streak since July 15.  Output in  South America ’s four main producers will fall to
120.9 million tons this year, Oil World said. That’s down from
124.2 million tons forecast on Jan. 27.  Farmers in  Paraguay  will collect 4.2 million tons, about
half what they harvested in 2010-11, according to the report.
Oil World raised its outlook for the Argentine crop 1.1 percent
to 47 million tons from the Jan. 27 outlook.  “Despite the improved outlook for  Argentina , soybean
production will decline steeply in South America,” the
researcher said. “The supply tightness of the current season
will spill over into the first half of the 2012-13 season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
