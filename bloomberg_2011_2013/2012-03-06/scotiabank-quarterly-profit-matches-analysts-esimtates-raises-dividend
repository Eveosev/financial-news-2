Bank of Nova Scotia ,  Canada ’s third-
largest bank, said gains in  consumer lending  and wealth
management lifted profit to a 10th quarterly gain, matching
analysts’ estimates. The bank increased its quarterly dividend.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 climbed 15 percent
to C$1.44 billion ($1.44 billion), or C$1.20 a share, from
C$1.25 billion, or C$1.08, a year earlier, the Toronto-based
bank said today in a statement.  Profit from consumer banking climbed 5.3 percent to C$475
million amid higher transaction volumes and card businesses, as
spending remained strong in the Canadian economy. The lender
also posted gains in its international and asset-management
units.  “Scotia is the first bank to not exceed consensus
expectations, with its peers reporting to date all coming in
well above forecasts,” Barclays Capital analyst  John Aiken 
wrote today in a note.  Earnings excluding an 8-cent per share gain from a real
estate sale and other one-time items were C$1.15 a share,
matching the average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The bank had topped estimates in seven of the prior
eight quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Boosted Dividend  Scotiabank’s profit increase “looks more like what I had
expected from the Canadian banks” in this quarter, said  John Kinsey , who helps manage about C$1 billion at Caldwell
Securities Ltd. “I’ve been expecting high single-digit growth
for the year.”  Scotiabank fell 1.4 percent to C$52.94 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto, its biggest one-day decline since Jan. 26..  The bank boosted its  dividend  to 55 cents a share, the
third increase in its payout since May 2008. Royal Bank of
Canada and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  also announced dividend
increases this month.  International banking profit climbed 8.9 percent to C$391
million as earnings in  Latin America  and  Asia  offset a lower
contribution in  Thailand  after recent flooding. Scotiabank has
 spent  more than C$3.5 billion over the past five years on
acquisitions outside Canada and has operations in about 50
countries.  Wealth management profit surged 21 percent to C$288 million
on an increase in revenue, while investment-bank earnings
dropped 7.2 percent to C$311 million. The bank set aside C$265
million for soured loans in the quarter, down from a year-
earlier C$275 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
