Enough disappointments are coming
out of economic reports to signal that share prices are poised
to fall, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief
U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index, based on comparisons between the past three
months of data and economists’ average estimates in Bloomberg
surveys. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is also included.  In the past two months, the surprise index fell 48 percent
from its highest level since March 2011. The decline would have
been steeper except that two indicators released yesterday, the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s services gauge for February
and factory orders for January, exceeded most projections.  “Good news will not look as positive,” Levkovich wrote in
a March 2 report, as economists raise estimates in anticipation
of faster U.S. expansion. The shift in perception points to a
“growing likelihood” that stocks will drop, he wrote.  Any slump may hit technology companies the hardest, the
report said. They have been this year’s best performers among
the 10 main industry groups in the  S&P 500 , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Retailers, automakers and providers of consumer services
are also vulnerable to losses, Levkovich added. The industries
are part of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index, which has
the third-biggest gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
