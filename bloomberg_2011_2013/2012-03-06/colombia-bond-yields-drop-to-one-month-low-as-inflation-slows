Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a one-month low, on
speculation policy makers may leave  interest rates  unchanged the
rest of this year after inflation unexpectedly slowed.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due in May
2014 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.14
percent, according to the stock exchange. That’s the lowest
closing level since Feb. 7. The price jumped 0.078 centavo to
106.142 centavos.  Consumer prices rose 0.61 percent in February compared to a
0.73 percent increase in January, the national statistics agency
said in a  report  late yesterday. Inflation was forecast to
quicken to 0.79 percent, according to the median estimate of 27
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation was pretty low and the whole bond curve is
reacting,” said William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s
brokerage unit in Bogota. “Should inflation continue with this
positive trend, the central bank will leave rates unchanged
through the remainder of the year.”  Banco de la Republica increased the overnight lending rate
25 basis points to 5.25 percent on Feb. 24 in a decision that
wasn’t unanimous. Florez said he now expects policy makers to
leave the key rate unchanged through year-end after previously
forecasting an additional increase to 5.5 percent.  Annual inflation was 3.55 percent last month, compared to
3.54 percent in January and within the central bank’s 2 percent
to 4 percent target.  The Colombian peso slid 0.5 percent to 1,780.68 per  U.S.
dollar  from 1,772.20 yesterday. The currency has advanced 8.6
percent in the past three months, the best performance among
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
