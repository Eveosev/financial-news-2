(Corrects to say bonds were repaid not sold.)  Calik Holding AS, a Turkish group
with interests in energy and media, repaid $200 million of bonds
that came due yesterday, Sabah reported.  Calik may consider another sale of debt at a later date,
the Istanbul-based newspaper said citing chief executive Berat
Albayrak.  The five-year bonds paid a coupon of 8.5 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fitch Ratings Ltd. cut the
outlook on Calik’s B- rating to “negative” on Jan. 17 citing
concern that it would need to get extra bank lines to meet the
repayment.  Calik sold the bonds in 2007 after meeting with about 100
foreign investors during a roadshow in  London  and financial
centers in  Europe  lasting a week, Sabah reported.  The company has put Sabah and its television channel ATV up
for sale. Albayrak is Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s son-
in-law.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
