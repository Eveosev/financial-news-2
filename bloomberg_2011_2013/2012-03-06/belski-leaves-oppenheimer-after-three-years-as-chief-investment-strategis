Brian Belski  is no longer the chief
investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. after three years at
the firm, according to John Parks, director for research.  Belski, who joined Oppenheimer in March 2009 from  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , left the firm on Feb. 17, New York-based Parks
said. The firm is currently interviewing for a replacement,
Parks said. Belski, 45, could not be reached for comment by
phone or e-mail.  While Belski’s forecast last year that the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index would rise to 1,325 was 5.4 percent too high,
his estimate was closer to the year-end close than the 1,379-
average projection made by 11 strategists tracked by Bloomberg
at the time of his call in December 2010. He estimated the
benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks would climb to 1,400 in 2012 as
profits by companies in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose to $101 a share.  “2010 and 2011 will both go down as being difficult years
to navigate,” said Rod Smyth, the Richmond, Virginia-based
chief investment strategist of Riverfront Investment Group,
which manages $3 billion. He held the same role at Wachovia
Corp. from 2001 to 2008. “In the last two years, our value work
has been persistently optimistic about stocks, but our momentum
work has shown that when people get worried what is cheap can
get cheaper.”  2011 Returns  Belski predicted equity market returns in 2011 would be
lower than in the prior two years, saying in a report last March
historical data showed stocks’ performance tends to decline in
the third year of a  bull market . The  S&P 500  ended last year
unchanged at 1,257.60 after rallying 13 percent and 23 percent
in 2009 and 2010 respectively.  “We are concerned that too many investors are just now
becoming increasingly optimistic regarding market prospects,”
he wrote in the March 14, 2011, report. “True, corporate
earnings and economic growth have continued to follow favorable
trends, but we believe that much of this is reflected in current
market prices.”  As stocks sold off in August after the U.S. lost its AAA
rating, Belski maintained his estimate the S&P 500 would climb
to 1,325, saying on Aug. 8 the world’s largest economy was in
better shape compared with the rest of the world. While the S&P
500 remained even for 2011, the MSCI All-Country World Index
dropped 9.4 percent.  Belski had been the U.S. sector strategist at Merrill Lynch
& Co. from September 2006 before  Bank of America Corp.  agreed to
buy the firm in 2008. He also previously worked in Merrill’s
wealth-management business and was a strategist at Piper Jaffray
Cos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
