The forint weakened for a third day
against the euro, reaching the lowest in five weeks, on concern
an escalation of  Hungary ’s disputes with the European Commission
will delay a bailout for the country.  The Hungarian currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 294.5 per
euro by 4:14 p.m. in Budapest, the weakest on a closing basis
since Jan. 31.  Disputes with the European Union over the independence of
the central bank, the judiciary and the data protection
authority have prevented Hungary from starting talks on a
bailout from the bloc and the  International Monetary Fund  that
the government requested in November. Hungary will take a
“determined” stand against the Commission and some matters
will end up in court, Janos Lazar, head of the ruling Fidesz
party’s parliamentary group, told M1 television today.  “The market may now be slowly pricing out the possibility
of a quick deal with the international organizations,” Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG (RBI)  in Budapest, wrote in a research report today on the forint.  European stocks fell today as a report confirmed a
contraction in the euro-area economy, Hungary’s main trading
partner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
