Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , the British
inter-dealer broker run by  Terry Smith , said it will cut 80 jobs
as it reported an 18 percent decline in full-year profit.  Net income dropped to 89.4 million pounds ($142 million)
from 108.5 million pounds in the year-earlier period as
compensation costs for brokers ate up a bigger share of revenue,
the London-based company said in a statement today. Revenue
increased 0.2 percent to 910 million pounds.  Average revenue per broker fell 3 percent to 524,000
pounds, while the number of brokers working for Tullett Prebon
increased 4 percent to 1,667 last year, the company said. Broker
employment costs made up 59.6 percent of the operation’s
revenue, a 1.1 percentage point increase from the year-earlier
period. The number of employees who support the firm’s brokers
increased 10 percent to 750.  “Actions have been taken to reduce costs and to maintain
flexibility in the cost base, although the business does face
increased costs relating to electronic platform developments and
impending regulatory changes,” Smith said in the statement.  The stock fell 3.7 percent to 317.6 pence in London trading
for a market value of about 691 million pounds. The shares have
dropped about 25 percent in the past 12 months.  Tullett will eliminate some front-office and support
employees in the first half of 2012 at a cost of about 7 million
pounds, the broker said.  Underlying pretax profit slipped to 136.1 million pounds
from 149 million pounds a year earlier, the inter-dealer broker
said. Revenue in the first two months of 2012, at constant
exchange rates and excluding the acquisitions of Convencao and
Chapdelaine, was 1 percent down on the same period last year,
the firm said today.  “Market and competitive conditions are expected to
continue to be challenging,” Smith said. “The business has
made a reasonable start to the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
