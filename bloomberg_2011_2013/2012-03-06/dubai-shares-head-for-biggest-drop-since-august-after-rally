biggest drop in almost seven months on bets this year’s rally
was overdone and as investors awaited a report that may confirm

skyscraper, dropped to the lowest intraday level in two weeks.

stock market, declined 4.8 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell
2.6 percent, set for the biggest decrease since Aug. 7, to
