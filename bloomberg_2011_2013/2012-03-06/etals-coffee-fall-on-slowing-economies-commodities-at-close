The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell by the most this year, dropping
1.5 percent to 692.61 on signs that slowing global economies
will erode demand for raw materials. Coffee, lead and zinc led
the decline.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices slumped 1.6
percent to 1,611.433.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures in New York tumbled to a 16-month low on
signs that sales by Brazilian producers increased amid a
commodity slump triggered by a contraction in  Europe ’s economy.  Prices fell as a report showed Europe’s economy shrank 0.3
percent last quarter. The dollar rose against the real, spurring
coffee sales by growers in Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter,
said Hernando de la Roche of INTL FCStone in Miami. Inventories
of the commodity monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have climbed 24
percent since the end of the third quarter.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery tumbled 4.3 percent

concern that stockpiles will outpace demand amid faltering
global economies. Cocoa was unchanged.  Sugar supplies will exceed demand by 7.7 million metric
tons in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, up 1.6 million tons from
a November forecast, according to London-based Czarnikow Group
Ltd., which traded the sweetener in more than 90 countries last
year.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery slid 2.6 percent to
settle at 24.05 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in

metric ton.  In London futures trading, refined sugar sank, while cocoa
was higher on NYSE Liffe.  BASE METALS  Copper posted the biggest drop in almost 12 weeks as a

that raw-material demand will ebb.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area dropped
0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, European Union
data showed. U.K. retail sales slid for the second straight
month in February. China, the world’s biggest metal consumer,
yesterday cut its economic-growth target.  Copper futures for May delivery declined 3.2 percent to

dollar’s rally eroded demand for precious metals as alternative
investments. Palladium and platinum dropped the most since
December.  The greenback rose to a two-week high against a basket of
currencies. Europe’s economy contracted in the fourth quarter,
and  Richard Fisher , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of

28.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn fell the most in two weeks on speculation that  China 
won’t boost imports from the U.S. after the country harvested a
record crop last year. Soybeans rose.  China, the world’s second-biggest corn user, won’t require
“large imports” this year as the country has ample supplies,
the State Administration of Grain said. Prices touched the
highest in almost four months yesterday after the nation’s top
maker of livestock feed said China should reform its corn-import
system by dropping quotas.  Today’s decline goes “back to the Chinese comments that
they’re not going to need corn this year,” Brian Grete, the
senior market analyst for Professional Farmers of America
newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 1 percent to settle at
$6.54 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest drop since Feb. 21. Yesterday, the price climbed to
$6.6525, the highest since Nov. 9.  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 0.8 percent to

showers brought as much as 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) of rain
to parts of  Argentina  in the past 24 hours and more moisture may

beneficial rains in the U.S. Great Plains boost prospects for
winter crops emerging from dormancy.  Wheat for May delivery dropped 2.1 percent to settle at
$6.5775 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline for a most-active contract since Feb. 10.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped to a two-week low in New York as the European
Union offered to restart negotiations with  Iran  over its nuclear
program, reducing the specter of war in the  Middle East , source
of 30 percent of the world’s crude.  Futures fell 1.9 percent after  Catherine Ashton , the EU’s
foreign-policy chief, issued a statement on behalf of China,
 France ,  Germany ,  Russia , the U.K. and the U.S. urging Iran’s
nuclear envoy to meet to seek an accord. Commodities also
declined as the euro-area economy contracted and on concern that
a Greek swap deal will fail.  Crude for April delivery fell $2.02 to $104.70 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
Feb. 17. Futures are up 5.9 percent this year.  Brent oil for April settlement declined $1.82, or 1.5
percent, to end the session at $121.98 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid for a third consecutive day on concern that
global growth is slowing after a report that Europe’s economy
contracted in the fourth quarter.  Futures fell as Europe’s gross domestic product shrank 0.3
percent from the third quarter, the European Union’s statistics

Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials.  April-delivery heating oil fell 2.92 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $3.1882 a gallon on the exchange. Prices are up 8.6
percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures were steady near a six-week low in New
York as forecasts for warmer-than-usual weather across most of
the U.S. over the next two weeks signaled reduced demand for the
heating and power-plant fuel.  Gas has dropped 21 percent this year, making it the worst
performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index.
Temperatures in most of the lower 48 states will be above normal
from March 10 through March 15, according to the  National
Weather Service . Mild weather this winter and higher gas
production have contributed to a growing gas surplus.  Natural gas for April delivery rose 0.1 cent to settle at
$2.356 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices settled at a six-week low yesterday.
