Serbia will restart Zelezara
Smederevo, the countryâ€™s sole steelworks and top exporter, after
restoring supplies of raw material disrupted by extreme weather.  One of the two furnaces will be fired up tomorrow, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. Supplies of  iron ore  and
coke fell below critical levels earlier this month when ice on
the Danube river blocked the barges bringing the raw materials.  The government bought back the unprofitable plant in
January from  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  for $1. It was already working at
less than half of its annual capacity of 2.2 million tons of
steel.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
