Ukraine’s  inflation  rate fell to its
lowest level in nine years in February as food prices continued
to decline after a good harvest last year.  Consumer prices rose 3 percent from a year earlier compared
with 3.7 percent in January, the statistics office in the
capital, Kiev, said today on its website. The median estimate of
seven economists in a  Bloomberg (UACPTYOY)  survey was for a 3.2 percent
advance. Prices increased 0.2 percent from the previous month.  The government is targeting 2012 inflation of less than 7.9
percent as economic growth in the former Soviet nation slows to
3.9 percent from 5.2 percent last year. Ukraine “has all
economic grounds” to keep price growth beneath the official
goal, Ihor Shumylo, who heads the central bank’s economic
department, said March 2. The bank has lowered  interest rates  on
some refinancing operations twice this year.  The result means inflation may slow to 1 percent by May,
Alexander Valchyshen, head of research at Investment Capital
Ukraine in Kiev, said by phone. “There are conditions for that
as the authorities are trying to control consumer prices.”  Factory-gate prices rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier in
February and 0.8 percent from the previous month, the statistics
office said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
