Sectra AB (SECTB) , a Swedish maker of
medical imaging technology, fell the most in six months in
Stockholm trading after the company said clients are postponing
purchases because of difficult budgets.  The share fell as much as 8.3 percent, the biggest drop
since Aug. 19. Sectra declined 7.3 percent to 44.50 kronor as of
12:31 p.m. local time.  Orders declined 39 percent to 131.5 million kronor ($19.5
million) in the three months through January as the economic
slowdown and budget austerity make transactions slower in many
countries, the Linkoping, Sweden-based company said today in a
statement.  “The transactions that take place are increasingly linked
to the replacement of existing hardware, which has an adverse
impact on our operating margin since these transactions have
lower margins than new sales of IT systems,” Chief Executive
Officer Jan-Olof Bruer said in the statement.  Operating profit declined to 5.4 million kronor from 15.7
million kronor in the third quarter. Sales declined 2.3 percent
to 196.1 million kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
