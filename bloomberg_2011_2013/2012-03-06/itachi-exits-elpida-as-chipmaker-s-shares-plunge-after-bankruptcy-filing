Hitachi (6501)  Ltd.,  Japan ’s second-largest
manufacturer, sold its entire 4.7 percent stake in Elpida Memory
Inc. whose stock will be delisted in less than a month after
filing for bankruptcy.  Hitachi sold all 12.8 million shares of Tokyo-based Elpida
by yesterday, spokesman Yuichi Izumisawa said by phone today,
confirming an earlier Nikkei report. Hitachi, which was the
largest shareholder in the chipmaker according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, held the stake for its retirement benefits trust,
the company said in a regulatory filing.  Elpida, which lost money for five straight quarters, sought
protection from creditors at the  Tokyo  District Court on Feb. 27
with liabilities of 448 billion yen ($5.5 billion). Troubles at
the chipmaker, formed through the 1999 merger of Hitachi and  NEC
Corp. (6701) ’s memory businesses, were exacerbated by an 85 percent
slump in the price of dynamic random access memory chips and a
stronger yen that cut the value of overseas sales. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange will  delist  Elpida on March 28.  Hitachi transferred its Elpida stake to its pension trust
in March 2008. Izumisawa declined to provide details such as
price at which Elpida shares were sold as the company doesn’t
comment on the trading of individual stocks in the trust.  Prices of  DRAM (DRAM84) , the most common chip in desktop computers,
plunged last year after PC shipments missed analyst forecasts
and sales of mobile devices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad surged.
The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM declined to a
record low of 71 cents in November, compared with $4.85 on Sept.
1, 2010, amid slowing PC sales, according to Taipei-based
DRAMeXchange,  Asia ’s biggest spot market for the chips.  Samsung, Hynix  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  controlled 38 percent of the DRAM
market by revenue last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  held a 25 percent
share and Elpida had 18 percent.  Elpida was unchanged at 3 yen at the close of trading in
Tokyo after losing 99 percent of its market value since its
bankruptcy filing. Hitachi declined 1.9 percent today to 461
yen, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
