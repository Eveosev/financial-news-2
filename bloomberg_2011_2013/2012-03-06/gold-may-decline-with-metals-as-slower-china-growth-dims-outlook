Gold may decline for a third day
alongside equities and other metals after  China  said it’s
targeting slower growth this year, even as holdings in exchange-
traded products backed expanded to a record.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,704.70 an ounce at 11:21
a.m. in Singapore, swinging between gains and losses. It fell
0.7 percent in the past two days as the dollar climbed 0.6
percent against a six-currency basket including the euro.
Bullion assets in  ETPs (.GLDTONS)  advanced for a fourth day to 2,405.903
metric tons yesterday, data tracked by Bloomberg show.  Cash gold reached $1,790.75 on Feb. 29, the highest level
since Nov. 14, before tumbling below $1,700 for the first time
in more than a month the same day. It’s up 9 percent this year,
extending an 11-year bull run. April-delivery gold was also
little changed at $1,705.20 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  “Bullion fell after China, viewed by many as the engine of
the global economy, cut its 2012 growth target to an eight-year
low,” said Lynette Tan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures
Ltd. “The precious metal could pull back further.”  China yesterday trimmed its growth forecast to 7.5 percent
from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005. The Dollar Index was
little changed today before a report forecast to show that’s
 Europe ’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter, adding to signs
that the debt crisis is slowing growth in the region.  “Sentiment in the market has been dented after gold tested
and failed to reclaim the $1,800 level,” said Wang Honggang, a
metals analyst at CIFCO Research Institute. “While the  dollar’s
recent strength  is bearish for gold, the performance of the ETPs
has been very encouraging.”  Hong Kong Shipments  Spot gold of 99.99 percent purity fell as much as 0.7
percent to 345.50 yuan a gram ($1,707.79 an ounce) on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, declining for a second day. Volumes for
the benchmark contract were 5,071.60 kilograms (154,362 ounces)
yesterday, up from 4,801.2 kilograms on March 2.  Buyers in mainland China purchased 32,948 kilograms of gold,
excluding articles of goldsmiths’ wares, from  Hong Kong  in
January, down from 38,650 kilograms in December, according to
the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong government
yesterday. China doesn’t publish gold-trade data.  Silver, this year’s best-performing metal was little
changed at $33.935 an ounce, after dropping to $33.535 yesterday,
the lowest price since Feb. 21, Still, options traders are the
most bullish in 16 months on an exchange-traded fund tracking
the metal, betting it will rally as the global economy recovers.  Spot platinum dropped 0.4 percent to $1,655.75 an ounce,
and palladium was unchanged at $705 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
