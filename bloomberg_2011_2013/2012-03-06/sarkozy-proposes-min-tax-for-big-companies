said he’ll create a new tax that would force large French
companies to pay a minimum amount of tax.  “I’ve discovered that there are large French groups that
don’t pay any tax in France,” Sarkozy said on a France2
television talkshow. He said the details of the tax would be
worked out should be win re-election in France’s two-rounds of

“It’s aimed at groups like  Total (FP) , but not just Total.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
