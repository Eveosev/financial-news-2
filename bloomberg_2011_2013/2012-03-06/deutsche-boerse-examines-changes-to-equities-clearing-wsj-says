Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  is examining
introducing changes to clearing on its cash equities platform,
the Wall Street Journal reported.  The exchange council of Boerse Frankfurt established a
working group at the end of last year to explore so-called
interoperability, which offers traders a choice of who processes
their transactions, the newspaper said, citing two people
familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
