News Corp. (NWSA) ’s defunct tabloid, News
of the World, paid a former London police chief as much as 7,000
pounds ($11,000) for writing articles on policing for the paper
in a deal linked to the publication of his autobiography.  John Stevens, who served as commissioner of the London
police service from 2000 to 2005, was offered the deal to write
articles in 2006 and 2007, Stevens told a judge-led  inquiry 
into media ethics today.  Stevens said he was initially paid 5,000 pounds each for
six or seven articles that ran in the News of the World.
His contract was renewed for an additional nine articles for
7,000 pounds each the following year. Stevens cut his
relationship with the paper shortly after royal reporter  Clive Goodman  was convicted of hacking into subjects’ phones, he said.  “Knowing what I do now, I certainly wouldn’t have entered
into” the agreement, he said. “When I terminated the contract
with five more articles to write, I was throwing money away, but
it didn’t worry me.”  The panel, led by Justice Brian Leveson, was commissioned
by Prime Minister  David Cameron  after the News of the World was
shut last year amid allegations that reporters hacked into the
voicemail of a murdered teenager.  To contact the reporters on this story:
