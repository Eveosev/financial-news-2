Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA) , the
Argentine unit of  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil company, fell
the most in five months amid speculation that a dispute with the
government will force  oil companies  to boost investments.  The stock retreated 6.4 percent, the biggest decline since
Oct. 3, to 6.45 pesos.  “The government’s offensive against YPF is spreading to
the provinces and there are bets it will affect other oil
companies,” said Adrian Mayoral, an analyst and trader at
Buenos Aires-based brokerage Mayoral Bursatil.  YPF SA, Argentina’s largest energy company, has been under
pressure by the government to increase production after it said
oil companies doubled fuel imports in 2011. The Argentine
province of Chubut has threatened to withdraw YPF licenses,
saying it hasn’t done enough to boost production.  YPF fell 15 percent Feb. 29 after Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Ambito Financiero said that President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  could announce an intervention in the
company the next day. It jumped 17 percent the next day after
the president didn’t announce a nationalization.  Argentina is unlikely to adopt “extreme nationalist”
measures against YPF while the oil producer may reduce dividends
and increase investments, Banco Itau BBA SA analysts said March
