News Corp. (NWSA)  Chief Executive  Rupert Murdoch  held talks with Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  in
Turkey’s capital Ankara.  Murdoch met with Erdogan at his office at 5 p.m. today for
about an hour. Turkey is an important market for News Corp. and
it wants to expand its investments in the country, Murdoch told
Erdogan, said a government official, who declined to be
identified because the talks were private.  Murdoch didn’t answer reporters’ questions when exiting the
building. News Corp. spokesman Jack Horner declined to comment
on the content of the meeting in a phone interview earlier.  News Corp. bought Turkey’s TGRT television channel for $151
million in 2006 and re-named it Fox TV. Today’s talks come amid
efforts by Calik Holding AS to sell a national newspaper and
television channel that Murdoch failed to buy in 2008. Calik,
run by Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, hired  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to find a buyer for Sabah and ATV in January.  Murdoch may be interested in Sabah and ATV, the Financial
Times reported on Jan. 22 without citing anyone.  News Corp. was among initial bidders for the two assets
when they were put up for sale four years ago then later
withdrew. Calik paid $1.25 billion after winning loans from
state-run banks and its Qatari partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
