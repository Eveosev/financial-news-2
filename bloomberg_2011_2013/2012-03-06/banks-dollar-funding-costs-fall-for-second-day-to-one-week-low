The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for the second day to the lowest in a
week, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 68 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m. in
London, from minus 71 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the lowest cost since Feb. 27.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 55 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another held near the lowest level in seven months. The Euribor-
OIS spread, the difference between the borrowing benchmark and
overnight indexed swaps, was 59 basis points, down from 95 basis
points at the start of the year.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing a record 828 billion
euros ($1.1 trillion) with the ECB, up from 821 billion euros on
March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
