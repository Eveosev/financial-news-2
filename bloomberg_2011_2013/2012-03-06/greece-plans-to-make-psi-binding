Greece will use collective action
clauses to bind holders of Greek-law bonds to accept a debt swap
if it receives sufficient consents, according to an e-mailed
 statement  from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  today.  Petros Christodoulou, the director general of the Public
Debt Management Agency, outlined the country’s ongoing debt swap
at a meeting in  Frankfurt  yesterday, according to the e-mail.
The nation’s “economic program” doesn’t include any provisions
for investors unwilling to take part in the private-sector
involvement of its debt-reduction plan, it said.  “The Republic confirmed that if it receives sufficient
consents to the proposed amendments of the Greek-law governed
bonds identified in the invitations for the amendments to become
effective, it intends, in consultation with its official-sector
creditors, to declare the proposed amendments effective and
binding on all holders of these bonds,” the statement said.  “The Republic’s representative noted that  Greece ’s
economic program does not contemplate the availability of funds
to make payments to private-sector creditors that decline to
participate in PSI,” according to the statement.  The price of the 4.3 percent notes maturing on March 20
rose from a record low today, climbing to 22 percent of face
amount at 4:24 p.m. London time, from 20.5 yesterday.  Greece said that if the debt swap wasn’t successful, “the
official sector will not finance Greece’s economic program and
Greece will need to restructure its debt” on different terms to
those set out in the current invitation.  The deadline for bondholders to accept the invitation is
March 8, while those with foreign-law  government bonds  have
until April 11, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
