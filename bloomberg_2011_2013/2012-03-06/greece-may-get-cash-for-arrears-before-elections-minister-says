Greece  is in talks with the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  on disbursement of a
tranche of the country’s bailout funds to repay some overdue
debts to suppliers before elections are held in the coming
months.  “From what I know there is a discussion happening so that,
possibly before the elections, there will be a tranche which
will allow us to repay some, not all of the arrears,” Alternate
Finance Minister Filippos Sachinidis said in an interview on
Mega TV, according to an e-mailed transcript from the Athens-
based ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
