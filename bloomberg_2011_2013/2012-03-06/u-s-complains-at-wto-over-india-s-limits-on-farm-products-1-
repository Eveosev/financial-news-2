The U.S. complained at the  World
Trade Organization  about Indian curbs on its farm products,
saying limits on imports such as poultry and eggs are
discriminatory.  India  says the ban is aimed at preventing bird flu, “but
it has not provided scientific evidence in line with
international standards on avian-influenza control,” the U.S.
Trade Representative’s Office said today in an e-mailed
statement from  Washington . While the U.S. has asked India to
justify the need for the ban, “India has not provided valid,
scientifically based justification for the import
restrictions.”  Global trade rules permit members of the Geneva-based WTO
to adopt regulations to protect human, animal or plant life or
health. However, such measures can’t be imposed to safeguard
domestic industry.  “India’s ban on U.S. poultry is clearly a case of
disguising trade restrictions by invoking unjustified animal
health concerns,” U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk  said in
the statement.  The request for consultations is the first step in the case
and means the two countries must now hold talks for at least two
months in a bid to resolve the dispute. If the talks fail, the
U.S. can ask WTO judges to rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
