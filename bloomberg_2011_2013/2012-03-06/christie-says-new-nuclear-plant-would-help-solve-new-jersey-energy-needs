New Jersey (STONJ1)  Governor  Chris Christie 
said a new nuclear plant would help solve the state’s energy
needs.  “We have to look at building another nuclear plant,”
Christie, a first-term Republican, said at a town hall in Ocean
Township. “Fifty-three percent of our electricity comes from
nuclear power.”  New Jersey  has four reactors at three nuclear power
stations.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  began the federal
paperwork in May 2010 for new nuclear development near its plant
outside Salem, New Jersey. PSEG delivers power to about three-
quarters of New Jersey’s residents.  Construction wouldn’t begin any time soon, Joe Delmar,
spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, a unit of the Newark-based power
company, said in a phone interview.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission isn’t slated to
decide whether the proposed location is suitable for nuclear
construction before late 2014, Delmar said.  Once the federal atomic agency grants the permit that
Public Service seeks, the company would have 20 years to seek
construction and operating licenses from the NRC. Public Service
hasn’t decided how many reactors it would construct or what
design it would employ, Delmar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
