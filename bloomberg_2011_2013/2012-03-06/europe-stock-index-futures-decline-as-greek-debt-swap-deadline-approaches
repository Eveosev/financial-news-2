European (SXXP)  stock futures fell as
investors awaited details of private-creditor participation in
 Greece ’s debt restructuring and a report that may confirm a
contraction in the region’s growth. U.S. index futures and Asian
shares fell.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro region, dropped 0.3 percent to 2,525 at 7:03 a.m. in
 London . The contract on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 0.2
percent. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  expiring
this month retreated 0.3 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
slid 1.1 percent.  “Uncertainty over the Greek private-sector debt swap is
likely to weigh on markets today as traders remain cautious
ahead of the announcement,” Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at
Capital Spreads, wrote in a note.  The investors that so far declared their participation in
the restructuring hold about 20 percent of Greek bonds. The 12
members of the creditors’ steering committee that said they
would join in the exchange have debt with a face value of at
least 40 billion euros ($53 billion), compared with the 206
billion euros of bonds in private hands, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The goal of the swap, which runs until March 8, is to
reduce by 53.5 percent the total of privately held Greek
sovereign debt, helping the country avert an uncontrolled
default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
