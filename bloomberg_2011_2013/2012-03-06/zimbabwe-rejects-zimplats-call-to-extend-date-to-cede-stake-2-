Zimbabwe rejected a request by
Zimplats, a unit of  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , to extend a
deadline to hand over a 29.5 percent stake to the country.  “You are advised that your request for a 30-day extension
has been rejected by the honorable minister and your company is
expected to comply with the law as stated in our Feb. 22 letter
to you,” Indigenization Secretary George Magosvongwe said in a
letter obtained by Bloomberg News today that was addressed to
Chief Executive Officer Alex Mhembere and dated March 2.  Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  told Impala, the
world’s second-biggest platinum producer, on Feb. 22 it had 14
days to hand the stake to the National Indigenization and
Economic Empowerment Fund or face “enforcement mechanisms.”
Two years ago,  Zimbabwe  published new rules demanding foreign
companies transfer 51 percent of domestic operations to locals.  Senior government officials are set to meet to discuss
Zimplats today, the Harare-based Herald newspaper reported.  “Impala haven’t as far as I know approached us, the
Department of Trade and Industry, for any advice,” South
African Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said in an
interview in  Cape Town . “We could discuss with them the terms”
of an investment protection agreement  South Africa  has with
Zimbabwe “and what it covers and what it doesn’t. There are a
number of mechanisms and remedies available in terms of that.”  Impala retreated for a fourth day, declining 3 percent to
158.30 rand by 4:16 p.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
