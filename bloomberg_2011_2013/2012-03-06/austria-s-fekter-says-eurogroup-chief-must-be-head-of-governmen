Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the next leader of the group of euro-area finance
ministers has to be a head of his or her government in order to
have the necessary authority.  “The suitable successor for Juncker ought to be head of
government, so he can be the first among equals and not a
finance minister, who then gets vetoed by his head of
government,” Fekter told reporters in Vienna late yesterday.  The person also should have financial expertise, she said,
adding that “he should be from a country that isn’t currently
in a program, but which is stable and in good condition so his
chairmanship has an enormous credibility.”  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said earlier
this month that he doesn’t want to continue to lead the group of
euro-area finance ministers after his term ends this summer.  When asked whether she’d consider the position herself,
Fekter pointed out that in addition to not leading her
government, “there were AAA countries that haven’t been
downgraded.”  Austria, together with France, lost its AAA rating at
 Standard & Poor’s  in January. The two countries’ outlooks on
their top ratings were also put on “negative” at Moody’s
Investor Service in February.  Germany , Finland, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands still hold AAA ratings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
