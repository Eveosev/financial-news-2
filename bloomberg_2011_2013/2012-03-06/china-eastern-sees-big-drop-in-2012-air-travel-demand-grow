China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the
nation’s second-biggest carrier, expects a “big” drop in
 travel-demand  growth this year because of an economic slowdown
and the European debt crisis.  Demand for international passenger and cargo flights is
“clearly falling,” predominately because European consumers
are cutting spending, Liu Shaoyong, the carrier’s chairman, told
reporters in Beijing yesterday, where he was attending the
National People’s Congress. There will also be a “big
difference” in full-year travel growth in 2012 from the
previous year, he said.  The slowdown in overseas travel has prompted China Eastern
to abandon an international expansion drive to instead focus on
challenging  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and  Air China Ltd. (601111)  on
domestic routes. The Shanghai-based carrier is creating more
competition even as China’s economy cools, threatening to damp
growth in these markets as well.  “We are also seeing China’s economic growth under
pressure,” Liu said. Traffic demand in the second half will
probably be better than first half, he said.  China Eastern fell as much as 3.8 percent in  Hong Kong 
trading, the biggest intraday decline since Feb. 24. The stock
was down 1 percent at HK$2.85 as of 11:19 a.m. China Eastern has
climbed 3.3 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent
decline for China Southern and a 12 percent increase for the
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Li Jiaxiang , director of the country’s civil aviation
regulator, also said on March 3 that passenger growth will slow
this year. He didn’t elaborate. The government has pared its
economic growth target to 7.5 percent this year from an 8
percent goal in place since 2005 in a bid to create more
sustainable growth.  China Eastern last year dropped an order for  Boeing Co. (BA)  787
Dreamliners in favor of 45 smaller 737s because of delivery
delays and slowing demand for long-haul international travel.  --Liza Lin and Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow, Vipin
