The so-called BRIC group of Brazil,
China, India and Russia have the four most active central banks
among Group of 20 nations.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that each of the countries has
made more than 20 changes to benchmark interest rates or reserve
requirements over the past four years.  No other central bank in the G-20 has implemented more than
19 changes, with policy makers in emerging-market peers Mexico
and  South Korea  matching the European Central Bank’s 12. The
BRICs have had to cope with “much more volatile” inflation
than other nations, causing the frequent rate changes and
heightening the chance for policy error, said  Nick Chamie , head
of emerging markets at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto.  “To a varying degree, the more volatile the interest-rate
and economic cycle, the more possibilities of making some policy
mistakes,” Chamie said in a telephone interview. “So far they
have managed their cycle pretty well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
