The ringgit fell to the lowest level
in almost two weeks, reversing earlier gains, as renewed concern
about Greece and  China ’s lower economic-growth target dimmed the
outlook for Malaysia’s exports.  Government bonds  declined.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares weakened on doubts
Greece can secure the majority needed to push through its swap
with private creditors this week. China, Malaysia’s top export
market, yesterday pared its economic expansion target to 7.5
percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005. Malaysian
exports rose 2 percent in January from a year earlier, the least
since October 2010, according to the median estimate of 19
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before data due tomorrow.  “After China lowered its GDP target, there is some concern
about the Malaysian growth trajectory,” said Syhiful Zamri
Abdul Azid, director of investment, research and advisory at
Kenanga Investors Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The Greek debt deal is
another timeline we’re looking at.”  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.0233 per dollar as of
1:42 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0285 earlier, the lowest level since
February 23.  Five-year government bonds fell. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 3.27 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
