Russian  stock futures  tumbled and
U.S.-traded shares slid the most in three months as falling oil
prices and shrinking European growth dimmed the outlook for the
world’s largest energy exporter.  Futures expiring in March on Moscow’s  RTS (RTSI$)  Index dropped 1.1
percent in U.S. trading to 164,560, while the  Bloomberg Russia-
U.S. 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies traded in New York slipped
4.4 percent to 109.40, the biggest one-day drop since Dec. 6,
led by  OAO Mechel (MTL)  and OAO RusHydro.  The prospect supplies from the  Middle East  won’t be
interrupted by a conflict with  Iran  sent crude, Russia’s biggest
export earner, to a two-week low as the European Union offered
to restart negotiations over the nation’s disputed nuclear
program.  Gross domestic product  in the euro region shrank 0.3
percent in the fourth quarter, the first contraction since mid-
2009, boosting concern Russia’s biggest trading partner is
showing the strain of the regional debt crisis.  “A slowdown in  Europe  will damp the outlook for commodity
prices and that’s the main driver for the Russian market,”
Marco Casas, vice-president of equity sales at Otkritie
Financial Corp. in New York, said by phone yesterday. “Oil
being down has a clearly negative effect.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, tumbled 5.8 percent to $31.20, the biggest
slide since Dec. 6, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  RTS
Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the index
futures, climbed 8 percent to 37.89 points, the highest level
since Jan. 19.  Coal Demand  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer of coal for steelmakers,
slid the most in more than two months in U.S. trading on concern
demand for coking coal will decline as Chinese economic growth
slows. Mechel’s  American depositary receipts  sank 8.1 percent to
$9.70 in New York. The ADRs are trading at a 2.1 percent
discount to the company’s Moscow-listed shares.  Mechel was the biggest decliner on the Bloomberg Russia-
U.S. 14 measure. The company’s  stock  listed on Moscow’s Micex
Index lost 10 percent to 293.70 rubles yesterday, or the
equivalent of $9.91. One ADR represents one ordinary share.  Moscow-based  Renaissance Capital  expects coking coal prices
to average $219 a metric ton in 2012, compared with $289 last
year, according to equity analyst Vasiliy Kuligin.  “Mechel makes most of its revenue from selling coking
coal,” Kuligin said by phone from Moscow. “ China  won’t need as
much coking coal as was previously thought and the coking coal
price will continue to weaken, hurting Mechel further.”  Commodities Slump  ADRs of  RusHydro (RSHYY) , Russia’s largest hydropower producer,
declined 6.7 percent to $3.91, the biggest drop since Dec. 19.
The company’s Moscow-traded stocks snapped a four-day advance,
slipping 2.4 percent to 1.1795 rubles, or the equivalent of 4
cents.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials
dropped 1.5 percent to 692.61 yesterday, the biggest loss since
Dec. 14, as aluminum, copper and nickel retreated. Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  reduced China’s economic growth goal for 2012
to 7.5 percent on March 5, from 8 percent over the past seven
years, as the European crisis and sluggish U.S. recovery curb
global demand.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , Russia’s biggest mining company,
fell 6 percent to $18.84 in  New York , a 1.2 percent  discount  to
its shares in Moscow, the most since Dec. 19. One ADR is equal
to one-tenth of an ordinary share. Norilsk fell 4.8 percent to
5,656 rubles, or the equivalent of $190.90, on the Micex
yesterday.  Yandex Search Share  The 30-stock Micex slumped 3.9 percent to 1,562.19
yesterday, the biggest drop since Dec. 9. The  RTS (RTSI$)  decreased 4.3
percent to 1,676.48. Police detained more than 200 demonstrators
on March 5 after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  won six years as
president in a March 4 election international observers
criticized as unfair.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s most popular Internet search engine,
slipped as data showed the company failed to increase its share
of the Russian online search market above a four-week average in
the week to March 4, while Google Inc.’s portion grew. Yandex
dropped 0.3 percent to $23.13 in New York.  “Audience size is a money question for Yandex,” as the
company gets most of its revenue from advertising, Iouli Matevossov, a senior analyst at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow who rates
the stock “equal-weight,” said by phone yesterday. “It’s a
question of Yandex’s ability to prevent Google from winning an
even bigger share of the market.”  Crude Tumbles  The Hague, Netherlands-based Yandex’s share of Russian
Internet searches was 59.3 percent in the week to March 4,
matching the average share level over the past four weeks,
according to  Liveintenet.ru , an Internet-service provider and
researcher. Google’s share rose to 25.7 percent in the week to
March 4, compared with a four-week average of 25.5 percent, the
data showed.  Crude for April delivery fell 1.9 percent to $104.70 on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the lowest settlement
since Feb. 17. Futures are up 5.9 percent this year. Brent oil
tumbled 1.5 percent to $121.98 on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, while Urals crude,  Russia ’s chief export blend,
fell 1.4 percent to $121.12 yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 28.  Russia’s central bank is scheduled to publish monthly
foreign-currency reserves and weekly money supply data today.
