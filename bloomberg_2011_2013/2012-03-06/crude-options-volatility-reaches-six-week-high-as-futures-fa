Crude oil options volatility rose to
the highest level in six weeks as underlying futures sank to a
two-week low after the European Union offered to resume
negotiations with  Iran  over its nuclear program.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30.9 as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up from 30
yesterday.  “There was a little bit more excitement in the market
today, and as we come off again volatility is going to
increase,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in New York.  Crude for April delivery fell $2.02, or 1.9 percent, to
settle at $104.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Preliminary volume in electronic trading for crude oil was
627,715 contracts as of 2:40 p.m. in New York, 1.4 percent above
the three-month average through yesterday.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 puts, with 3,906 lots changing hands at 4:22 p.m.
They rose 19 cents to 55 cents a barrel. April $105 puts, the
second-most active options, increased 75 cents to $2.12 with
2,251 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  On the trading floor, Rigolini said, there was selling of
May $128 calls and of April $95 puts and $98 puts. Puts
accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish options accounted for 53 percent of the 61,092
