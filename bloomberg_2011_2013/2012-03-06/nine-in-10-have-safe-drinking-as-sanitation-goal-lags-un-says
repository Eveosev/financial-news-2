The world has met a target of
halving the number of people without clean water earlier than a
2015 deadline, as almost nine in 10 people worldwide have access
to safe drinking water, the  United Nations  said.  About 6.1 billion people had access to safe drinking water
at the end of 2010, meeting one of the UN’s Millennium
Development Goals set in 2000, Unicef and the  World Health
Organization  said in a report today. The number increased by 2
billion people between 1990 and 2010.  “Providing sustainable access to improved drinking water
sources is one of the most important things we can to do reduce
disease,” Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, said in
the statement. More than 3,000 children die each day from
diarrhea-related diseases, Unicef said.  Still, the world will probably miss a goal of halving the
number of people without basic sanitation as 2.5 billion people
still lack such access, the two agencies said. Only 67 percent
of the world’s population will probably have improved sanitation
facilities by 2015, compared with a target of 75 percent, they
said in the report.  Global measurements of water quality aren’t possible and
the report is based on improvements in drinking water sources,
Unicef and the WHO said.  More than 40 percent of those without access to drinking
water live in sub-Saharan  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
