The U.S. is offering as much as $1
million for information about a former  Federal Bureau of
Investigation  agent who disappeared in Iran five years ago.  FBI Director  Robert Mueller  announced the reward today at a
Washington news conference on the latest effort to find Robert
Levinson, the former agent missing since March 2007.  “We in the FBI will continue to do all we can to ensure
Bob’s safe return,” Mueller said, standing in front of dozens
of current and former agents outside the FBI’s Washington field
office.  Levinson, who will turn 64 on March 10, is believed to be
alive but “we are concerned about his health” because he has a
history of diabetes and hypertension, said James W. McJunkin,
the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field
office.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  last year asked  Iran  for
assistance after receiving “recent indications” that Levinson,
who went missing during a business trip to the Persian Gulf
nation, was being held somewhere in southwest  Asia .  No group has made any demands and the FBI doesn’t know who
might be holding Levinson or where he is, McJunkin said. “We’re
hoping for a break here,” McJunkin said.  Billboards, handbills at border crossings and radio
messages in Afghanistan and Pakistan will publicize the reward
and ask anyone with information about Levinson to call a
telephone tip line, McJunkin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
