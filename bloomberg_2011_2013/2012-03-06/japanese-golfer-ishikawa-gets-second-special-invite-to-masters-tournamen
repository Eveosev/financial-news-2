Japanese golfer Ryo Ishikawa
accepted a special invitation to play in golf’s  Masters
Tournament  next month for the second time in his career.  Ishikawa, 20, is No. 53 in the Official World Golf Ranking,
putting him three spots outside of an automatic berth in the
field for the first major tournament of the season.  The special invitation, which is extended by Augusta
National Golf Club Chairman Billy Payne, is reserved for
foreign-born players.  “Historically, the Masters has invited international
players not otherwise qualified to expand the tournament’s
global reach,” Payne said in an e-mailed news release.
“Ishikawa is an accomplished player on the  Japan  Golf Tour, and
we believe his presence will help increase interest not only in
his home country, but also throughout  Asia .”  Ishikawa has competed in the Masters three times, with his
best finish coming in 2011 when he tied for 12th. He has nine
career victories outside of the U.S.  PGA Tour , including a win
as a 15-year-old in Japan in 2007. His best PGA Tour finish was
a fourth at last year’s Bridgestone Invitational.  A total of 95 players have already received invitations to
this year’s Masters, including seven from Asia. Golfers can
still qualify by winning a PGA Tour event or by being among the
top 50 in the world rankings the week before play begins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
