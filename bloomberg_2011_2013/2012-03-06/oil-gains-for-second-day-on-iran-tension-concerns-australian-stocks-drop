Stocks fell a third day, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posting its  worst drop  of the year,
and commodities slid after a report showed  Europe ’s economy
contracted and as investors watched developments in a Greece
debt-swap deal. U.S. Treasuries and the yen gained.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  slid 1.5 percent, the most since Dec. 8, to
1,343.36 at 4 p.m. in  New York , while the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  tumbled 203.66 points to 12,759.15. Gold, silver and
copper futures lost at least 1.9 percent. The yen gained versus
all 16 major peers and 10-year Treasury note yields fell six
basis points to 1.95 percent.  Europe’s economy shrank 0.3 percent last quarter, the
European Union’s statistics office said, and the central bank’s
balance sheet surged to a  record  3.02 trillion euros ($3.96
trillion) last week amid crisis-fighting efforts. The Greek
government said it will use collective action clauses to compel
bondholders to accept its debt restructuring if it receives
sufficient consents from investors.  “I’m watching this market suffer,”  Alan Gayle , a senior
strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,
 Virginia , which oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “The market has more questions than answers right
now. The attention is turning internationally as investors focus
on economic concerns and the possibilities of success or failure
of the Greek bond swap. That makes investors nervous at these
relatively lofty index levels.”  Highest Since 2008  Financial (S5FINL) , industrial and commodity companies helped lead
declines in  all 10  of the main industries in the  S&P 500 ,
retreating more than 1.6 percent. Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley paced losses among financial companies, falling at least
4.6 percent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
retreated as the S&P GSCI gauge of commodities slid as much as
1.6 percent, with 22 of 24 materials declining.  The S&P 500 slipped for a third day after last week closing
at its highest level since 2008. At the start of today’s
session, the index was up 24 percent from last year’s low in
October and 8.5 percent higher in 2012.  Before today, the S&P 500 hadn’t retreated at least 1
percent and the Dow hadn’t fallen 100 points or more for 45
days, the longest streaks since 2006, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “You’ve got to believe stocks are not going straight to
the skies,”  Philip Orlando , chief equity market strategist at
Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about $370 billion,
told Bloomberg Television. “We’re not going to have a year with
no pullback in the middle of the year. So it’s perfectly
reasonable that we could have a moderate correction, let’s call
it 5 percent.”  European Markets  The  Stoxx 600 Europe Index (SXXP)  slid 2.7 percent today, its
biggest loss since November, as all of its 19 industry groups
declined. PSA Peugeot Citroen dropped 3.5 percent as Europe’s
second-biggest carmaker announced plans to sell 1 billion euros
of shares. Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc slid 6.7 percent as
the Telegraph in  London  said  Vodafone Group Plc (VODE)  may not make a
takeover offer.  The yield on the 10-year German bund fell five basis points
to 1.78 percent, leaving the difference in yield between
Europe’s benchmark government securities and Spanish debt 22
basis points wider at 3.37 percentage points as the spread
increased for the third straight day. Italy’s 10-year yield rose
14 basis points to 5.07 percent.  Greece Swap  Societe Generale SA, France’s second-biggest bank,
Assicurazioni Generali SpA and UniCredit SpA joined firms saying
they would participate in Greece’s debt  swap as the country
threatened to compel holdouts to take part.  They join more than a dozen banks, insurers and  hedge funds 
that said they plan to accept the deal, accounting for at least
45 billion euros ($59 billion) of bonds, based on data compiled
by Bloomberg from the companies and their reports. About 206
billion euros of Greek bonds are eligible for the swap.  The Greek set a 75 percent participation rate as a
threshold for proceeding with the transaction. The goal of the
exchange, which runs through March 8, is to reduce by 53.5
percent the total of privately held Greek debt, helping avert an
uncontrolled default that could roil markets and fuel contagion.  Greece  sold 1.137 billion euros of 26-week Treasury bills
today with a uniform yield of 4.8 percent with investors bidding
for 2.63 times the securities offered, the debt management
agency said. The European Financial Stability Facility sold 3.44
billion euros of three-month debt at an average yield of 0.0516
percent.  Default Swaps  The cost of insuring European sovereign bonds rose for a
third day, with the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
credit-default swaps on 15 governments climbing 9.7 basis points
to 356, the highest since Jan. 18.  The yen climbed 1.8 percent against the euro and advanced 1
percent versus the dollar. The euro depreciated 0.8 percent to
$1.3114. Australia’s dollar dropped 1.2 percent versus the
greenback after the nation’s central bank kept  interest rates 
unchanged and said it has scope to ease policy if needed.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 2.3 percent, taking
its two-day drop to 3.6 percent. Russia’s  Micex Index (MICEX)  slid 3.9
percent, the most this year, after more than 200 people were
detained in protests against Vladimir Putin’s presidential
election victory yesterday. The ruble declined versus 10 of 16
major peers, tumbling 1 percent against the dollar.  “We do not expect today’s outsized declines in Russian
assets to be the start of a trend,” Ilan Solot, London-based
emerging markets currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman,
wrote in a note to clients. Higher  oil prices  should help
Russian assets, he wrote, and the ruble should benefit  “in the
short term from the gradual pricing out of the political risk
premium and maybe even a reversal of some outflows as the
country gets back to business as usual.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in  Hong Kong  sank 3.1 percent, the most in almost three
months. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  slipped 1.1 percent and
the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index fell 1.9 percent in
Johannesburg as industrial metals prices declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
