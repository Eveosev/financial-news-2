John Paulson  lost 1.5 percent in
February in one of his largest  hedge funds , according to an
investor update, paring this year’s gain and setting back
efforts by the New York-based manager to recoup record losses in
2011.  Paulson’s Advantage Plus Fund, which seeks to profit from
corporate events such as takeovers and bankruptcies and uses
leverage to amplify returns, gained 3.5 percent in the first two
months of 2012, according to the update, a copy of which was
obtained yesterday by Bloomberg News.  Paulson, 56, is seeking to reverse losses from an ill-timed
bet on an economic recovery. The declines, including a 51
percent drop in the Advantage Plus fund in 2011, prompted the
manager to reduce risk just as markets seem to stabilize. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.1 percent last month amid
optimism that  Greece  would receive a second bailout and climbed
8.6 percent this year through Feb. 29.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson & Co., which manages
about $23 billion, declined to comment on the firm’s returns.  The gold share class of the Advantage Plus Fund decreased 2
percent in February and climbed 4.9 percent this year. Paulson
investors can choose between dollar-and gold-denominated
versions for most of the firm’s funds.  Paulson’s Gold Fund, which can buy derivatives and other
gold-related investments, slumped 4.8 percent last month and
climbed 8 percent this year. Paulson told investors in February
that his Gold Fund will outperform his other strategies over
five years.  Recovery Fund  Gold fell 1.7 percent last month, largely due to a one-day
drop of as much as $100 to below $1,700 an ounce on Feb. 29
after the  Federal Reserve  gave no indication it will offer more
monetary stimulus to bolster the  U.S. economy .  The Recovery Fund, which invests in assets Paulson believes
will benefit from a long-term economic rebound, such as
financial services, insurance, hotels and real estate companies,
climbed 3.2 percent last month and 6.5 percent this year. Its
gold shares gained 0.6 percent in February and 10 percent in
2012.  The Paulson Partners Enhanced Fund, which invests in the
shares of merging companies, jumped 6.5 percent in February and
11 percent this year. Its gold share class gained 2.8 percent
last month and 14 percent in the first two months of the year.
Paulson’s Credit Opportunities Fund returned 0.2 percent last
month and 3.8 percent in 2012. Its gold shares fell 1.1 percent
in February and increased 7.7 percent this year.  Paulson’s Advantage Fund, which employs a similar strategy
to Advantage Plus, decreased 0.8 percent in February and climbed
3 percent this year. Its gold share class slumped 2.3 percent
last month and gained 6.8 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
