Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBLB) , the
investment firm controlled by billionaires Albert Frere and  Paul Desmarais , increased its distribution of cash earnings to the
highest level in 10 years after a 50 percent reduction in
dividend income from  Lafarge (LG)  SA and higher debt-servicing costs.  GBL proposed raising its  dividend  2.4 percent to 2.60 euros
a share, the Brussels-based company said today in a statement.
That’s the smallest increase since 1997 and missed the 2.67
euros  projected  by Bloomberg research and analysis. GBL’s
planned distribution of cash earnings, which declined 7.6
percent to 522.3 million euros ($685 million) last year, equals
80 percent, the most in 10 years.  The investment firm spent more than 1.2 billion euros last
year, turning its cash surplus into net debt of 694 million
euros by the end of last year. GBL’s biggest transaction was
with  Pargesa Holding SA (PARG) , taking over the  Imerys SA (NK)  holding from
its Swiss  parent  for 1.09 billion euros in cash. The additional
dividend income GBL got from didn’t offset the 50 percent cut in
Lafarge’s distribution and the increase in interest expenses GBL
faced last year.  “GBL anticipates dividend earnings in 2012 that will cover
its own dividend,” the investment firm said in the statement.
“GBL has a solid financial structure and significant liquidity
and is therefore well positioned to take advantage of rebound
opportunities.”  Frere’s sole publicly traded Belgian investment firm said
it has 850 million euros of undrawn credit facilities available
for at least another four years, as well as 790 million euros of
cash and own shares at hand.  GBL made a 11 million-euro profit from selling most of its
shares in  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  shares and used the proceeds of more than
90 million euros to increase its stake in  Arkema SA (AKE)  to 10
percent, the company said.  Its Iberdrola holding fell to 0.2 percent at the end of
December from 0.6 percent a year earlier. GBL spent a further 95
million euros on private-equity investments last year and bought
back 92 million euros of its convertible notes maturing at the
end of next month, the company added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
