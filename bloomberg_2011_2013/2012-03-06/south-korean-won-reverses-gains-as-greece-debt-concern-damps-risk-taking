South  Korea ’s won reversed earlier
gains on concern Greece will fail to convince enough investors
to sign up to a debt swap that will help the country stave off a
default.  Government bonds  rose.  The currency fell for a second day before the restructuring
deal closes on March 8, with the aim to reduce the amount of
privately held Greek securities by 53.3 percent. South Korea’s
economic outlook has deteriorated due to rising oil prices and
Europe’s debt crisis, the  finance ministry  said today. The
Australian dollar declined after the nation’s central bank left
borrowing costs unchanged.  “Greek concerns and stock markets declining affected
 market sentiment ,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at Daegu Bank. “Asian currencies move in line with the
Australian dollar, and the Aussie falling after the  Reserve Bank 
of Australia’s rate decision affected the won.”  The currency slipped 0.4 percent to 1,122.64 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, after gaining as much as 0.2 percent earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of
shares fell for a second day as overseas funds sold more of the
nation’s stocks than they bought.  The Bank of Korea will probably leave  borrowing costs 
unchanged at 3.25 percent for a ninth month when it meets on
March 8, according to all 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.50 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures climbed 0.04 percent to 104.08 and the one-year
interest-rate swap fell one basis point to 3.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
