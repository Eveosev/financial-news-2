OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY)  plunged the
most in two months in U.S. trading as prices for the metal
slumped on concern slowing growth in  China  and Europe’s
contracting economy will stem demand.  Norilsk’s American depositary receipts declined 6 percent
to close at $18.84 in  New York , the biggest one-day drop since
Dec. 12.  Nickel slid 2 percent to $18,685 a metric ton on the  London 
Metal Exchange after China, the world’s biggest consumer of
industrial metals, pared its economic-growth target yesterday
and data showed Europe’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter.
Russia’s Micex Index slid the most in three months as police
detained hundreds of people protesting Vladimir Putin’s
presidential election win.  “The decline in nickel prices on top of the uncertainty
caused by yesterday’s protests is the main driver behind the
drop,” Andy Jones, a metals and mining analyst at  Renaissance
Capital  in London, said by phone. “Chinese industrial growth is
a driver for a lot of commodities. For any mining company it’s a
big deal.”  Norilsk got 22 percent of revenue from Asian sales in 2010,
up from 17 percent in 2006,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.
Europe is the Moscow-based company’s biggest market by revenue,
with a 56 percent share.  Norilsk (GMKN)  lost 4.8 percent to 5,656 rubles, or the equivalent
of $190.91, on the Micex. The ADRs traded at a discount to the
Moscow-traded shares for a second day, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
