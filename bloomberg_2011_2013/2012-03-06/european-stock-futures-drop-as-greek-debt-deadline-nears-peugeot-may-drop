European (SXXP)  stocks declined, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropping the most since November, as a
report confirmed a contraction in the euro-area economy and
investors weighed  Greece ’s chances of getting bondholders to
accept a debt swap.  Commerzbank AG and Societe Generale SA led a slump in bank
shares.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CW/)  Plc retreated 6.7 percent
after a newspaper report speculating that a potential bidder
won’t make an offer for the company. Nyrstar NV, the largest
producer of refined zinc, paced commodity shares lower.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  declined 2.7 percent to 258.46 at the close
in  London , for the biggest drop since Nov. 21, as bondholders
owning a fifth of Greece’s debt agreed for the exchange, even as
the government has set 75 percent participation as the threshold
for proceeding with the plan. The benchmark measure has advanced
5.7 percent so far in 2012.  “With the debt-swap deadline approaching and only 20
percent acceptance so far by private investors, it’s easy to
understand why market participants are nervous,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief  European (SXXP)  strategist at Market Securities in London.
“We’re realizing once again that we are far from over with the
problems.”  The euro area’s fourth-quarter  gross domestic product 
declined 0.3 percent from the third quarter, the European
Union’s statistics office said today, confirming an initial
estimate published on Feb. 15.  Low Expectations  “A lot of the good news is behind us,” said Pierre Mouton, a  fund manager  who helps oversee $7.5 billion at Notz
Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “The economy in  Europe  can be a bit of
a worry, but expectations aren’t too high. Everyone is expecting
bad numbers.”  The 12 members of the creditors’ steering committee that
said they would join in the exchange of Greek debt have debt
with a face value of at least 40 billion euros, compared with
the 206 billion euros of bonds in private hands, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The goal of the swap, which runs until March 8, is to
reduce by 53.5 percent the total of privately held Greek
sovereign debt, helping the country avert an uncontrolled
default.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European market except Greece. The Mediterranean country’s  ASE
Index (ASE)  rose 2.8 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 1.9 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 dropped 3.6 percent and  Germany ’s DAX slid 3.4
percent.  Implied Volatility  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, jumped 20 percent
to 28.56, the biggest increase since Nov. 1.  A gauge of banks accounted for the largest decline on the
Stoxx 600, losing 4.2 percent. Commerzbank AG lost 6.7 percent
to 1.77 euros. Societe Generale SA declined 7.8 percent to 23
euros.  Cable & Wireless  Worldwide dropped 6.7 percent to 31.21
pence. Vodafone Group Plc may not make an offer for the company
by a March 12 deadline, the Telegraph reported, citing market
speculation.  Vodafone, the world’s largest mobile-phone company, said
last month it is in the early stages of evaluating a bid for
Cable & Wireless.  A gauge of mining-company shares slid 2.6 percent as metal
prices fell in London.  Nyrstar (NYR)  lost 4.6 percent to 6.39 euros.
Eramet SA, a refined nickel producer, tumbled 6.6 percent to
106.60 euros. Kazakhmys Plc, Kazakhstan’s biggest copper
producer, retreated 2.9 percent to 924 pence.  Michael Page, Q-Cells  Michael Page  International Plc, a recruitment services
company, tumbled 7.5 percent to 443 pence. The stock was cut to
 “neutral” (MPI)  from “buy” at Citigroup Inc.  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , a solar-cell maker, plunged 12 percent to 24.9
euro cents, its lowest on record, after losses exceeded sales in
the fourth quarter and the company forecast further losses in
2012. Q-Cells posted a loss of 393 million euros in the last
three months of 2011 on sales of 353 million euros in a
preliminary report today.  PSA Peugeot Citroen slid 3.5 percent to 13.71 euros after
announcing plans to raise 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in a
rights offer and saying it won’t pay a dividend for 2011.
Europe’s second-biggest carmaker said it is seeking to raise
about 1 billion euros in a rights offer and proceeds will be
used for projects with General Motors Co. The company won’t pay
a dividend for 2011.  Shareholders, who will have the right to buy 16 shares for
every 31 they already own, will pay 8.27 euros per share. That
is a 42 percent discount to yesterday’s closing price.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  climbed 7.8 percent to 2.49
euros and Alpha Bank SA jumped 19 percent to 1.55 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
