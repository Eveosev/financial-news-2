OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell the most in two months as the government’s disputes
with the European Union threatened to delay rescue funding for
the bloc’s most-indebted eastern country.  The shares declined 3.9 percent to 3,787 forint by the
close in Budapest, the biggest one-day retreat since Jan. 4. The
11-member BUX stock index, where OTP has a 28 percent weighting,
dropped 2.1 percent to the lowest in almost seven weeks.  Disputes with the EU’s executive arm over the independence
of the central bank, the judiciary and the data-protection
authority have prevented talks on a bailout, which the country
requested in November. Hungary will take a “determined” stand
against the European Commission and some matters will end up in
court, Janos Lazar, who heads the ruling Fidesz party’s
parliamentary group, told M1 television today.  “Hungarian assets will remain underperformers across
 emerging markets  and central  Europe ,”  Akos Kuti , head of
research at Budapest-based broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., and
colleagues wrote in an e-mailed report today, citing the
“substantial” slowing down of Hungary’s move toward a bailout
deal.  European stocks fell as a report confirmed a contraction in
the euro-area economy, Hungary’s biggest trade partner, and as
investors weighed Greece’s chances of avoiding a default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
