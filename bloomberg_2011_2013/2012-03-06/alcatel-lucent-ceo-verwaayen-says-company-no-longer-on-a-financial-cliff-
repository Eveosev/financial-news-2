Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) , the Paris-based
networking-equipment maker, is focusing on innovation and is no
longer on a financial precipice, Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen said.  The company, entering its fourth year under Verwaayen, has
struggled with spending pullbacks by large telephone companies
and increased competition from China-based rivals Huawei
Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)   Last year,  Alcatel-Lucent (ALU)  posted a profit for the first
time since it was formed in 2006 by the merger of Alcatel SA and
Lucent Technologies. One target Verwaayen missed last year was
the amount of cash held by the company.  “Our balance sheet wasn’t strong enough,” Verwaayen said
yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New
York. “We were a company on a cliff. We don’t want to be a
company on a cliff,” he said, adding that “we expect at the
end of 2012” to have bolstered the cash position.  Alcatel-Lucent rose as much as 2 percent to 1.81 euros in
Paris trading today and was up 1.6 percent as of 9:20 a.m. while
 France ’s benchmark CAC-40 index dropped 0.7 percent.  Last month, the company reported negative free cash flow of
458 million euros ($606 million) for 2011 and pushed back its
goal of turning that metric positive until 2012. Last year’s
sales declined 1.9 percent to 15.7 billion euros.  The company’s performance has been hard on investors, with
the stock falling 54 percent over the past year before today. It
also has affected Verwaayen, a former  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  CEO who took
over in 2008. He waived his 2012 stock bonus for missing the
target.  European Cuts  Alcatel-Lucent also said last month that it will expand
profit margins, eliminate $660.9 million in costs this year and
cut 1,800 positions in  Europe . Verwaayen says he plans to
reassign a large number of those workers somewhere else in the
company and build on the company’s history of innovation and its
worldwide customer base.  Alcatel-Lucent ended 2011 with an adjusted operating profit
as a percentage of sales of about 3.9 percent, and Verwaayen
expects to improve that in 2012.  “For our shareholders, we need to have a return,”
Verwaayen said. He said the goal he’s working toward, though
it’s not a forecast, is a 10 percent operating profit margin.
“To dance with the best in the class, it has to be around 10
percent,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
