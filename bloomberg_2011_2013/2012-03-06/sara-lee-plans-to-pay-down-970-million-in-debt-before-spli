Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  said it intends to
pay off as much as $970 million in debt as it prepares to spin
off its coffee and tea company.  The remaining U.S. meat business, maker of Jimmy Dean
sausage, Hillshire Farm lunch meat and Ball Park franks, would
be left with about $942 million in debt after the split, the
 Downers Grove , Illinois-based company said today in a regulatory
filing.  Sara Lee is separating the coffee company, which sells
Douwe Egberts, Senseo and Moccona brands, in order to focus it
on growth while the meat unit works on upgrading products in its
home market. The spinoff is expected to be complete by the end
of June, Sara Lee has said.  The companyâ€™s North America-based pension plans will remain
with the meat unit while the non-North American pensions will be
assumed by the coffee business, according to the filing.  Sara Lee fell 2.2 percent to $20.77 at the close in  New
York  today. The  shares  have gained 9.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
