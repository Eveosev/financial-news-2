Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
on concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is slowing the global
economy and as the European Union offered to restart discussions
with  Iran  about that country’s nuclear program.  Prices slumped after an EU report showed the continent’s
gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter
and after the organization said it’s open to a “full
settlement” of the clash with Iran.  “Basically everything was down, commodities, equities, the
whole complex,” said Ian Jackson, a trader at SCB & Associates
LLC in Chicago. “You take a little bit of risk premium out of
the market.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.291 a gallon in Chicago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased
2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.335 and on the West Coast the
biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.385, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago gained 0.5 cent to $2.25 a gallon and in
 New York  the additive fell 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.295.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply, as
part of U.S. energy plans to reduce dependence on foreign
sources of crude oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
