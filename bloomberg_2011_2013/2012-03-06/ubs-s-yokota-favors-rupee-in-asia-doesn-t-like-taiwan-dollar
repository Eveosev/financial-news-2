Sean Yokota, an emerging-markets
strategist at UBS AG in  Singapore , commented on the outlook for
Asian currencies at a media briefing in Jakarta today.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
10 most-traded currencies in the region excluding the yen, has
advanced 1.7 percent this year.  India ’s rupee strengthened 6.3
percent during the period, while Taiwan’s dollar gained 2.8
percent.  “In Asia, I like the rupee the most. They’ve had a high
current-account deficit for quite a while. Equity inflows are
outweighing” the current-account issue, he said. “I like
Taiwan’s dollar the least. The central bank is very conservative
there. Taiwan tends to move its currency at the very end of the
business cycle.”  “Looking at high-yielding countries, I don’t expect much
more appreciation in their currencies this year. For Asian
emerging-market currencies, most of the rebound has happened and
things will be fairly stable from now on. More intervention will
be the theme for this year.”  “The biggest risk is  oil prices , which affects current-
account deficits. India is the most vulnerable. The story right
now is on the supply side. On the demand side, global growth is
still relatively weak.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
