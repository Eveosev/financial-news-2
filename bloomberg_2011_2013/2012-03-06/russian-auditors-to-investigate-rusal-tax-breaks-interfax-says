Russia’s Audit Chamber, which checks
on state spending, will investigate United Co. Rusal tax breaks,
Interfax said, citing the authority’s head, Sergei Stepashin.  Stepashin commented after Andrei Krutov, a lawmaker for
Irkutsk region, said Rusal gets breaks for processing foreign
alumina at Siberian smelters, the Moscow-based newswire said.  Rusal complies fully with Russian tax laws, the world’s
largest aluminum producer said in an e-mailed statement.
Krutov’s recent comments on Rusal are incorrect, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
