Bank of America  Merrill Lynch will
fund the restoration of five Tel Aviv Museum of Art paintings by
 Marc Chagall , who was deeply involved in the Israeli
institution’s establishment.  The paintings are “Musician with the Red Beard” (1919);
“Jew with Torah” (1925); “Lovers” (1929); “The Wailing Wall”
(1932); and “Solitude” (1993), three of which were donated by
Chagall to the museum.  “We believe that understanding cultures through the arts
is an important foundation for promoting innovation and
tolerance in an increasingly integrated world,” Rena DeSisto,
global arts and culture executive at Bank of America, said in a
statement e-mailed today.  The  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank’s restoration
project provides grants to museums around the world to conserve
significant works of art that are in danger of degeneration, the
lender’s website said.  “In these economically challenged times, and as art
conservation consumes ever greater portions of tightened museum
budgets, the need for private arts funding has become even more
critical,” Yoram Inbar, country executive at Merrill Lynch
Israel, said in the release. The statement did not specify how
much money was donated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
