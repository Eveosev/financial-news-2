The Greek  navy  withdrew its frigate
“Hydra” from the European Union’s “ Atalanta ” mission against
Somalian pirates, to cut military spending,  Naftemporiki 
reported, without citing anyone.  The decision will save Greece 7.5 million euros
($10 million) this year, as the ship costs the country 2.5
million euros for every month it participates in the mission,
the Athens-based newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
