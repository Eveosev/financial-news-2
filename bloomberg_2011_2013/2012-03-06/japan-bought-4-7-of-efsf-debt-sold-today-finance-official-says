Japan  purchased 4.7 percent of the
debt issued by the European Financial Stability Facility
yesterday, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.  The government bought 160 million euros ($210 million) of
the 3.44 billion euros of bills, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because of the ministry’s policy. The
EFSF had planned to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros.  Japan has purchased about 14 percent of the EFSF bonds sold
since January last year to help  Europe  through the region’s
sovereign debt crisis, according to the Japanese government. At
a Group of 20 nations meeting in Mexico last month, Finance
Minister  Jun Azumi  said the nation “would like to continue with
that cooperation.”  Greece  needs private investors to agree by March 8 to write
down debt so the nation can receive a 130 billion-euro bailout.
The nation expects bondholders to accept the offer and is ready
to force them to participate if necessary, Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said in a Bloomberg Television interview in
Athens this week.  The EFSF, designed to finance rescue packages for Greece,
Ireland and Portugal, was downgraded by  Standard & Poor’s  in
January to AA+ from AAA after the ratings company cut its
assessments of France and Austria, two of the guarantor nations.  In an EFSF sale on Feb. 21, Japan bought 100 million euros
of 1.99 billion euros of bonds, or 5 percent of the total, the
Japanese official said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
