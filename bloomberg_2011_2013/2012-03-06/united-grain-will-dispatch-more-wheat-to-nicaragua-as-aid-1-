United Grain Co., a state-owned
Russian grain trader, will send a second shipment of wheat to
 Nicaragua  as humanitarian aid.  The cargo of 24,800 metric tons of the grain is expected to
arrive in the Latin American country in April, the Moscow-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. An initial shipment
of 25,600 tons arrived in November.  United Grain said it plans to ship as much as 100,000 tons
of wheat to Nicaragua in total by the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
