Israel ’s short-term government bonds
declined, pushing yields to the highest level in more than two
months, on speculation the central bank will leave borrowing
costs on hold for a second month as energy costs spur inflation.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due September 2013
climbed seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.72
percent at 2:50 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest since Dec. 29.
Shorter-term notes are typically more sensitive to rate
fluctuations.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, increased four
basis points to 2.57 percent, matching the level on Dec. 7.  The  Bank of Israel  will keep the benchmark  interest rate 
this month at 2.5 percent, according to all but one of 17
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey.  Israel raised the price of
gasoline for March by 5.1 percent, following a 3.2 percent gain
last month, the government said on Feb. 29. The risk that  Iran 
may disrupt oil supplies pushed crude up as much as 0.6 percent
today in  New York  to $107.34.  “Inflation expectations have increased over the past weeks
amid rising oil prices which will make it hard for the central
bank to lower borrowing costs,” Ori Greenfeld, head of the
macroeconomic research department at Psagot Investment House
Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone. “The market is pricing in
that the central bank will pause on rates at the end of the
month.”  Yields Rise  The central bank’s monetary committee, led by Governor
 Stanley Fischer , held rates in February, after cutting it three
times in the past five months. The  employment  rate among ultra-
Orthodox Jewish men rose to 45.6 percent in 2011 from 38.7
percent in 2009, the central bank said in an excerpt from its
annual report sent by e-mail today. The government has set a
target of 63 percent employment for this population in 2020.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January
2022 gained one basis point to 4.7 percent. The one-year break-
even rate, the yield difference between the inflation-linked
bond and fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity,
advanced two basis points to 281, the highest since July 31.
That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.81 percent.  The  Tel-Bond 40 (TEL-B40)  index of corporate bonds declined 0.3
percent to 262.92. The shekel weakened 0.5 percent to 3.8121 a
dollar, bringing the past month’s decline to 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
