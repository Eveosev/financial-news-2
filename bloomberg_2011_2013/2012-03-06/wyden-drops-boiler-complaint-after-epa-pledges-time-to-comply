Oregon Senator  Ron Wyden  dropped his
effort to delay pollution controls for boilers after receiving a
pledge by the Environmental Protection Agency to allow
flexibility for owners to comply.  Companies will have three years to clean up pollution from
their boilers,  Lisa Jackson , the administrator of the EPA, wrote
Wyden today. They can appeal to state regulators for a fourth
year, and seek a fifth year from the EPA if they can’t meet the
earlier deadline, she wrote. The standards will also be based on
data from the “real world,” she said.  The EPA’s efforts to cut pollution from boilers have been
opposed by paper processors such as  International Paper Co. (IP)  and
 Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) , as well as refiners, manufacturers and some
universities and hospitals. The rule, which may be finalized in
the coming months, will cost $1.5 billion a year, making it one
of the most expensive rules proposed by the EPA.  Wyden, a Democrat who had been working with Maine
Republican Susan Collins on legislation to force a delay in the
regulations, now believes that EPA dealt with his worries, his
spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer said in an e-mail.  Republicans are pushing to have a vote on the boiler
measure as part of a transportation bill, which is set for
consideration this week. Without Wyden’s support, Republicans
face a high hurdle to round up enough Democrats to pass the
amendment. The Republican-led  House of Representatives  has
approved a similar measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
