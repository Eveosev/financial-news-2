ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPG) , one of the
first oil explorers to resume drilling in the  Gulf of Mexico 
after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, increased the size of a
loan it’s seeking for general corporate purposes to $155 million
from $140 million, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The debt, due in January 2015, will pay interest at 7.25
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
down from 7.5 percentage points, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private. The minimum on
the benchmark will remain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Libor, the
rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, serves as a reference for about $360 trillion of
financial instruments worldwide.  ATP is proposing to sell the debt at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
Houston-based company and commitments were due today at 3 p.m.
in  New York , the person said.  The company is also converting its existing $208 million
fixed-rate  term loan  into floating-rate with the same conditions
as the new loan, the person said.  Albert Reese, chief financial officer of ATP, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
