Monitronics International Inc., the
alarm-monitoring company owned by  Ascent Capital Group Inc. (ASCMA)  will
hold a lender meeting March 8 at 2:30 p.m. in  New York  to
discuss $650 million of loans the company is seeking to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The financing will include a $500 million term loan B due
in six years and a $150 million revolving line of credit
maturing in five years, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse
Group AG are arranging the financing for the Dallas-based
company, the person said.  Ascent Capital acquired Monitronics for $1.2 billion in
December 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Erica Bartsch, an outside spokeswoman for Ascent Capital,
declined to comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
