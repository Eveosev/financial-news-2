U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as
inventories in the area advanced to the highest level since
February 2011.  Stockpiles of  gasoline  on the Gulf gained 763,000 barrels
to 81.3 million in the week ended Dec. 21, the highest since
Feb. 4, 2011, according to Energy Department data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s also the highest seasonal level since at least
1990, when the Energy Department started tracking data.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf widened 4.13 cents to 15.5 cents below futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:55 a.m.  Reformulated gasoline  to
be blended with ethanol on the Gulf dropped 3.13 cents to 10.5
cents below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  was unchanged in the region at a
discount of 4.25 cents. Supplies of  distillates  including
heating oil and diesel added 1.3 million barrels to 35.3 million
during that same time period.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s new 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker
at the  Port Arthur, Texas, refinery  has reached planned rates
after starting up early this month, said  Bill Day , a San
Antonio-based company spokesman, in an e-mail today.  Valero plans to bring a similar unit online early next year
at its St. Charles, Louisiana plant. The two will add more than
80,000 barrel a day of diesel and jet fuel output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
