Temperatures are expected to rise
above normal in the eastern U.S. by the middle of January while
plunging to frigid levels across the western part of the U.S.
and into  Canada .  The eastern U.S. may be 5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 to
4.4 Celsius) above normal from eastern Texas to New England and
southern Quebec from Jan. 10 to 14, according to  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  At the same time, temperatures may reach 5 to 8 degrees
below normal from Alberta, Canada, to Arizona and  New Mexico .  “The East is mostly warm-dominated, while impressive cold
could target western Canada and the interior U.S. West,” Rogers
wrote today in a note to clients.  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Above-normal temperatures in the large
cities of the Midwest and Northeast may decrease demand for
energy to warm homes and businesses, suppressing natural gas and
heating oil prices.  Temperatures across most of the U.S. will be below normal
for the remainder of this week, Rogers said. They are expected
to become more seasonal from Jan. 5 to Jan. 9. The upper Great
Plains and parts of the Midwest may have temperatures 5 to 8
degrees above normal, he said.  In  New York , the normal average temperature for Jan. 9 is
about 33 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 29 in Boston; 24 in Chicago; 32 in
St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary, Alberta; 42 in Seattle;
and 55 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
