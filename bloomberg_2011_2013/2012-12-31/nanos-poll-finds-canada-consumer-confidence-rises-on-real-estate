Canadian  consumer confidence  rose
for the first time in three months in December as homeowners
became more certain about the value of their properties,
according to a  Nanos Research  poll.  The Nanos Economic Mood Index -- an aggregate of survey
responses on the outlook for the economy,  job security , personal
finances and real estate -- rose to 101.9 in December from 101.0
a month earlier. The index averaged 101.7 over the past six
months, compared with 105.8 in the first half of 2012, as the
country’s economy stalled.  Data released this month suggest tepid growth for the
world’s 11th largest economy in the fourth-quarter. Canada
recorded  inflation  of 0.8 percent in November, the slowest in
more than three years, while gross domestic product rose 0.1
percent in October after stalling a month earlier.  Measures calculating optimism about housing prices rose to
the highest since June, according to today’s Nanos poll. The
balance of opinion between those who say they expect real estate
values to increase in their neighborhood and those who believe
they won’t rose to 20.6 in December from 17.1 in November.  The balance of opinion between those who say the economy
will be stronger in the next six months relative to those who
believe it will be weaker fell to 2.1 in December from 2.8.  Measures calculating personal finances and employment
showed little change from levels that are the worst since the
first half of the year. The balance of opinion between those who
say their jobs are secure and those who believe they are not
rose to 30.6 in December from 29.7 in November, while net
perceptions on personal finances fell to -16.3 from -16.1.  The Nanos poll of 1,000 Canadians was taken between Dec. 19
and Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
