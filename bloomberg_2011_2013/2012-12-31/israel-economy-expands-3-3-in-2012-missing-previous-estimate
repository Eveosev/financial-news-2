Israel’s economy expanded slower
than previously estimated this year, as growth of exports and
fixed investment moderated.  Gross domestic product increased 3.3 percent from a year
ago, the Central  Bureau of Statistics  said at a Jerusalem press
conference today, based on partial data for the year. The figure
compares with a previous forecast of 3.5 percent by the bureau.
In the third quarter, the economy expanded an annualized 2.8
percent, the slowest in three years, it said.  “Growth is high compared to OECD countries, but lower than
countries like India and  China ,” said Oz Shimony, head of the
statistics bureau’s macroeconomic division. “Export growth was
much lower and investment in fixed assets, which was very high
last year, has declined.”  The Bank of Israel monetary policy committee, led by
Governor Stanley Fischer, last week reduced the benchmark
interest rate to its lowest in more than two years. It cited
weakness in economic indicators and a high level of economic
risk around the world.  In 2011, the economy grew by 4.6 percent and in 2010 by 5
percent. In 2009, the growth rate was 1.1 percent.  Exports of goods and services grew 1 percent in 2012,
compared with 5.5 percent last year, the bureau said. Exports
not including diamonds rose 4.2 percent, compared with 4.1
percent last year. Investment in fixed capital rose 3.7 percent,
against 16 percent in 2011. Consumer spending rose 2.8 percent,
compared with 3.8 percent last year.  GDP per capita rose 1.5 percent in 2012, to 117,600 shekels
($30,500), the bureau said. Last year, GDP per capita increased
2.7 percent.  Israel  posted a current account deficit of $900 million in
2012, or 0.4 percent of GDP, compared with a surplus of $1.9
billion, or 0.8 percent, the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
