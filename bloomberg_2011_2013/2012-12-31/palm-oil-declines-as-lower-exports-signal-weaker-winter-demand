Palm oil  dropped, extending a second
annual loss and snapping a five-day rising streak, as declining
exports from Malaysia signaled weaker demand.  The contract for March delivery lost 2.3 percent to close
at 2,440 ringgit ($798) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures have lost 23 percent this year as stockpiles
in Malaysia climbed to an all-time high.  Exports fell 5.7 percent to 1.57 million tons in December
from 1.66 million tons a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said
today. Shipments dropped 7.9 percent to 1.52 million tons in the
same period, estimated Societe Generale de Surveillance. Exports
are generally lower during the winter months as the tropical oil
clouds in cooler temperatures. Malaysia is the largest producer
after  Indonesia .  “This signals weak demand” from the Northern Hemisphere,
Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd.,
said by phone in Kuala Lumpur, referring to the export figure.  Soybeans for March delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $14.0225
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March fell 1.1 percent to 48.91 cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery retreated 0.6 percent to close at
6,922  yuan  ($1,111) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for May lost 0.4 percent to end at 8,612 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
