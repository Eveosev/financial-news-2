The  Washington Redskins  defeated the
Dallas Cowboys 28-18 to win the National Football Conference’s
East division title and the last of the National Football
League’s 12 playoff berths.   Rookie running back Alfred Morris rushed for 200 yards and
three touchdowns at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, as the
Redskins (10-6) claimed their first division title since 1999.
The Cowboys (8-8) had their season end with the loss.   The Redskins will play the  Seattle Seahawks  on Jan. 6 in
the first round of the NFL playoffs.   The Minnesota Vikings claimed the NFC’s final wild card
playoff berth with a 37-34 victory over Green Bay earlier today
and face the Packers again to open the postseason on Jan. 5.   The Houston Texans host the Cincinnati Bengals the same day
in the American Football Conference, while the Indianapolis
Colts visit the Baltimore Ravens the following day.  The Atlanta Falcons and San Francisco 49ers earned the top
two seeds in the NFC and get a week of rest during the first
round of the playoffs, while the  Denver Broncos  and New England
Patriots got first-round byes in the AFC.   The  New York Giants  and  Chicago Bears  were eliminated from
postseason contention on the last day of the regular season even
though they won their regular-season finales. The Giants routed
the Philadelphia Eagles 42-7, yet had their season end when the
Bears held on for a 26-24 win over the Detroit Lions. Chicago’s
playoff chances ended with the Vikings’ win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
