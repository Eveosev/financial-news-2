Treasuries fell for the first time
in four days as speculation congressional negotiators will
resolve a budget-deficit showdown by the midnight deadline
damped demand for the safety of  U.S. government debt .  Bonds remained lower after President  Barack Obama  said
Congress is “close” to a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal
cliff of more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and
tax increases set to start taking effect tomorrow. Those changes
would cause a recession in the first half of 2013, according to
the  Congressional Budget Office . The yield on the 10-year note
still had its lowest year-end close on record.  “Though time is running out, the market is holding on to
the eternal hope there will be some kind of deal, and that
optimism is pushing yields higher,” said Aaron Kohli, an
interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “If
something doesn’t happen, that optimism will quickly
dissipate.”  The 10-year  yield  increased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield exceeded
its 200-day moving average of 1.74 percent. It fell earlier to
1.69 percent, reaching for a second day its 100- and 50-day
moving averages. Yields declined six basis points  last week .  The price of the 1.625 percent note due in November 2022
slid 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 26/32.  Thirty-year bond yields climbed eight basis points to 2.95
percent.  Early Closing  Treasury trading in the U.S. stopped at 2 p.m.  New York 
time today and will be closed tomorrow for New Year’s Day,
according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association website.  Obama said an agreement by lawmakers to avert the fiscal
cliff is “not done.” He said he’s “hopeful” Congress will reach
a deal to prevent tax increases, while the deficit can be
tackled in stages.  The 10-year note yield dropped from 1.88 percent at the end
of 2011. Economists had forecast it would end 2012 at 2.5
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey published on Jan. 12. The yield touched a record daily
low of 1.379 percent on July 25.  The yield’s close today was the lowest on a year-end basis
since at least 1962, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The current year-end record low is last year’s 1.88 percent.  The 10-year  yield  reached a historic year-end high of 13.98
percent in 1981 in part because then Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  had raised  interest rates  in 1980 to 20 percent to
battle inflation. The yield is forecast to end 2013 at 2.17
percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Gross Outlook  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , manager of
the world’s biggest bond fund, expects Treasury five-year notes
to yield 0.7 percent at the end of 2013, he wrote today in a
Twitter post. The note yielded 0.72 percent today.  Newport Beach , California-based Gross also said he expects
the dollar to decline and oil to climb above $100 next year. Oil
traded today at $91.54 a barrel, and the greenback gained 0.2
percent to $1.3191 per euro. Gross wrote in a post yesterday he
expects stocks and bonds to return less than 5 percent next year
as unemployment persists at 7.5 percent or higher.  Treasuries due in 10 years and longer returned 4.9 percent
in 2012, the 113th best performer of 144 debt indexes tracked by
Bloomberg and the Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Last year, the securities surged 29 percent to rank No. 1.  Annual Returns  U.S. government securities returned 2.3 percent this year
through Dec. 28, the lowest since losing 3.7 percent in 2009,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Gains were
tempered as safety demand declined on bets  Europe  was handling
its debt crisis and as U.S. economic data improved.  U.S. investment-grade corporate debt has returned 11
percent this year and high-yield debt has gained 16 percent,
Merrill Lynch indexes show, as companies took advantage of
borrowing costs that fell as the Fed kept interest rates near
zero for a fourth year to prop up the economy.  “We’ve been through 30 years of a  bull market  in fixed-
income,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The type of
returns the  bond market  has provided over the last 30 years is
not going to be seen. Mathematically it just can’t happen.”  U.S. mortgage-backed securities have gained 2.6 percent in
2012, another Merrill Lynch index showed, as returns were
limited by higher refinancings.  Treasuries fluctuated earlier amid uncertainty on
lawmakers’ ability to reach a budget agreement.  Talks ‘Progressing’  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said negotiators could
reach a U.S. budget deal today.  “They’re progressing,” Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said of
the talks in an interview as he entered the Capitol this
morning. Asked if he thought a deal could be reached today, Reid
said, “I really hope so. We’re not there yet, though.”  Talks between Reid and Senate Minority Leader  Mitch
McConnell  stalled yesterday because of disputes over income tax
rates, the estate tax and other issues.  To contact the reporters on this story:
