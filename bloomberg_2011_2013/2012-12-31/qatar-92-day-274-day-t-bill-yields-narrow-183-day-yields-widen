Qatar treasury bill yields on
today’s 92-day and 274-day issuances narrowed as yields for the
183 day bills widened, according to releases posted on the
 central bank Website .  Qatari T-bills maturing April 2 yielded 0.87 percent, down
from 0.9 percent for 92-day bills in the last issuance on Dec.
4, according to the releases. T-bills maturing Oct. 1 yielded
1.14 percent, down from 1.15 percent. Bills maturing July 2
yielded 1.06 percent, up from 1.03 percent.  Qatar issued 4 billion riyals worth of treasury bills
today, according to an earlier release. The world’s biggest
producer of liquefied natural gas began issuing treasury bills
in May 2011 to soak up funds and build a yield curve for
borrowers. The country started listing them on the Qatar
Exchange in December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
