South Africa’s former leader  Nelson Mandela  continues to receive medical care at his home in
Johannesburg almost a week after being discharged from a
hospital where he was treated for a lung infection and
gallstones.  “He is still under medical attention at his house in
Houghton,”  Mac Maharaj , spokesman for President  Jacob Zuma ,
said in a phone interview today. “There is no further update on
his health at the moment.”  Mandela, 94, was hospitalized for 19 days before being
discharged on Dec. 26 to receive treatment at his home. He spent
two days in a hospital in February undergoing minor surgery
related to an abdominal complaint.  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the  African National Congress  won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. The Nobel Peace Prize-winner spent 27
years in prison before that for his opposition to white-minority
rule.  “He remains an important symbol of our struggle for
liberation and of the successful transition from apartheid
colonialism to a non-racial and democratic society,” Zuma said
in an end-of-year statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
