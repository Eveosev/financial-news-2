manufacturing expanded at a faster pace and regulators said they
planned to allow more companies to set up mutual funds.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) ,  China ’s largest carmaker, led industrial
companies higher after the Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose in December to the

the China Business News said property transactions in  Shanghai 
rose to a 23-month high in December.  “The PMI figure further indicates a strong footing of the

when infrastructure construction runs into full speed and
property market conditions stabilize,”  Qu Hongbin , chief China
economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, said in a statement.  A separate, government-backed PMI probably rose to 51 in
December from 50.6 the previous month, according to the median

square meters in the first 30 days of December, the most in 23

maintained its restrictions to curb excessive price gains.  Citic Securities Co., China’s biggest listed brokerage,
added 1.5 percent to 13.36 yuan. China Life, the nation’s
biggest insurer, surged 5.8 percent to 21.40 yuan, its highest

under management and demonstrate they have been profitable for
the past three years.  A gauge of financial companies in the CSI 300 including
