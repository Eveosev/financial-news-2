Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU)  surged in
 New York , driving the benchmark index of Chinese U.S.-listed
stocks to seven-month high, on prospects a partnership with
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  will bolster revenue this year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York jumped 2.4 percent to 99.17
yesterday, bringing its 2012 advance to 10 percent. Qihoo, a
Beijing-based company that started its Internet search engine in
August, closed at the highest level since April 27, while web
data-center operator  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET)  climbed the most in
four months.  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC)  traded at a premium to its
Hong Kong stock for the first time in six days after the
regulator said insurers can set up  mutual funds .  Qihoo, which offers anti-virus programs as well as the
most-used web browser in China, jumped 89 percent in 2012, the
 biggest gainer  of the China-US gauge’s 55 stocks. The company’s
tie-up with Google will start soon and contribute $140 million
of revenue this year, Juan Lin, an analyst at  Wedge Partners 
Corp. wrote in a report. Data showing Chinese factory output
grew at the fastest pace in 19 months in December also boosted
stocks traded in the U.S.  “There will be more growth in Qihoo and now with this
cooperation with Google revenues and earnings need to go up a
bit in 2013,” Kirk Adams, a director of research at Wedge
Partners, said by phone yesterday from  Greenwood Village ,
Colorado. “As its cooperation with Google will add cash to
Qihoo, the market will continue to price in the revenue growth
in 2013.”  ETF Climbs  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 2.3 percent to $40.45,
extending its 2012 climb to 16 percent. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose for the first time in six days, gaining 1.7
percent to 1,426.20 as U.S. Senate Minority Leader  Mitch
McConnell  said lawmakers were “very, very close” to a deal to
avert the $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to
start coming into force at midnight.  Qihoo’s American depositary receipts surged 8.6 percent to
$29.69. Chief Financial Officer Alex Xu didn’t respond to an e-
mail seeking confirmation on the impact of cooperation with
Google on revenue.  The company is considering partnering with Google’s
advertising system, Chief Executive Officer Zhou Hongyi said,
according to a Sept. 11  report  on Sina News.  Qihoo’s tie-up with Google’s China unit will probably start
at the beginning of 2013, Wedge Partners’ Lin wrote in the note
yesterday. The company will continue to build its own
advertising system to profit from online search queries, she
wrote.  Qihoo versus Baidu  The ADR’s advance sent valuations to 34 times estimated
earnings, up from a multiple of 17 on Aug. 15, the day before
Qihoo started its search service, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Qihoo’s valuation compares with a ratio of 17 times
expected earnings for Baidu Inc., its bigger competitor.  Baidu, owner of China’s most-used search engine, added 1.3
percent to $100.29 in New York yesterday, halting a two-day
slump and trimming its 2012 slide to 14 percent.  Wallace Cheung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG, cut his price estimate yesterday for Bejing-based
Baidu to $80 from $82, maintaining a rating equivalent to sell
on the stock.  21Vianet, also based in Beijing, jumped 8.5 percent to
$9.61 in U.S. trading to gain 5 percent in the year. Trading
volumes were almost triple the daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Mutual Funds  China’s Industry and Information Technology Ministry will
introduce policies this year to boost the information industry,
Shanghai Securities News reported Dec. 28, citing Minister Miao Wei. The measures will focus on the development of mobile
Internet, mobile television, and Internet shopping and payment,
according to the report.  China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, advanced 5.4
percent to $49.69 in New York, the highest close since Aug. 1.
The ADRs, each representing 15 underlying shares in the Beijing-
based company, traded 1.5 percent  above  its Hong Kong stock, the
first day posting a premium since Dec. 20. The ADRs surged 34
percent last year after a 40 percent loss in 2011.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission posted draft
rules on its website Dec. 30 allowing insurers’ asset management
units and securities brokerages to set up mutual funds, a move
the regulator said seeks to “attract various funds into the
 capital market .”  Ambow Tumbles  Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO) , which provides private
tutoring services, tumbled 11 percent to $2.25 in New York, the
biggest decliner on the China-US index yesterday. The slump
extended last year’s tumble to 68 percent, also the biggest
slide on the gauge in 2012.  Ambow  said  Sept. 6 an internal probe found its tutoring
centers are legally registered. The investigation was sparked by
reports on Chinese state television that an Ambow unit
exaggerated training results and that school registrations were
incomplete. The company, based in Beijing, reported in July a
net loss for the three months through March 2012 of $12.7
million, compared with net income of $2 million a year earlier.
It hasn’t published updated financial results since then.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s second-largest maker of solar
wafers, based in Xinyu, China, slid 66 percent last year to
$1.44, the biggest decliner among Chinese solar stocks traded in
New York.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  slumped 38 percent in
2012 and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  lost 35 percent.  Suntech Power Holding
Co. (STP) , the world’s biggest solar-panel manufacturer, retreated 31
percent.  A global solar-panel supply glut and reductions to European
subsidies for the sector have spurred losses for Chinese solar
companies as prices declined.  Expanding PMI  The final reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index released
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics yesterday was 51.5 in
December, up from a preliminary level of 50.9 issued Dec. 14 and
a final reading of 50.5 for November. The government’s official
PMI, scheduled to be released today, will probably show an
increase to 51 from 50.6 in November, according to the median
estimate of 27 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic shares jumped 1.6
percent yesterday to 2,269.13 for an annual gain of 3.2 percent,
the first increase in three years. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.5 percent yesterday to 11,436.16,
to close 15 percent higher in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
