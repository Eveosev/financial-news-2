Oil headed for its first annual
decline since 2008 in New York as U.S. lawmakers sought an
agreement on averting automatic tax increases and spending cuts
that threaten the economy of the world’s largest crude consumer.  West Texas Intermediate fell as much as 0.9 percent,
dropping for a third day. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
said there are “still significant differences” between
Democrats and Republicans with one day remaining to avoid the
budget measures known as the fiscal cliff. The volume for WTI
contracts was down 56 percent on the 100-day average.  “Prices may have been influenced by the lack of agreement
on the U.S. budget crisis, with weakness in thin volumes
today,”  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache
Ltd. in London, said today by e-mail. “They are still in the
broad range that has prevailed for the last three months.”  Crude for February delivery was at $90.09 a barrel, down 71
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 12:51 p.m. London time. Prices gained 2.4 percent last week,
trimming this year’s decline to 8.8 percent.  Brent for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange declined $1.07 to $109.55 a barrel. The
contract climbed 1.5 percent last week, extending its advance
this year to 2.1 percent, a fourth annual gain. The European
benchmark’s premium to WTI narrowed for a fifth day to $19.46.  WTI has declined in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a
glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest storage hub and the
delivery point for the New York contract. That has left it at an
average $17.44 a barrel below Brent this year, compared with a
premium of about 95 cents in the 10 years through 2010.  Rising Output  U.S. crude production rose to 6.984 million barrels a day,
the highest since 1993, in the week ended Dec. 21, the Energy
Department reported Dec. 28.  The House and Senate met yesterday after President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 28 asked Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
to try to find a solution to the fiscal cliff. Both houses
adjourned by mid-evening and will resume today. The Senate will
resume its session at 11 a.m. Washington time and “perhaps”
have further announcements then, Reid said yesterday.  China ’s manufacturing unexpectedly expanded at the fastest
pace in 19 months in December, boosting optimism that a recovery
in the world’s second-largest oil consumer is gaining traction.
The PMI reading of 51.5 was higher than the 50.9 preliminary
reading on Dec. 14 and a final 50.5 in November. A reading above
50 indicates an expansion.  Chinese Consumption  “The latest China PMI shows continuing expansion in
manufacturing activity which is supportive of oil,” said Victor Shum, a managing director at IHS Consulting in  Singapore .  China will consume 9.9 million barrels a day of oil,
115,000 more than previously projected, in the last three months
of this year, the International Energy Agency said in its
monthly report on Dec. 12. The country’s apparent oil demand
climbed 9.9 percent in November from a year earlier to 10.5
million barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil in New York may extend its decline in 2013 as futures
are poised to end this year with a bearish technical formation,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 2012 candlestick
overshadows last year’s, based on the opening and closing
prices, creating a bearish engulfing pattern on the annual
chart. Investors sold contracts to start the year after similar
candles formed in 2008 and 1997. A settlement today at or above
the 2011 open of $91.31 a barrel will cancel this chart pattern.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
increased by 13,783 futures and options combined, or 11 percent,
to 134,834 in the week ended Dec. 24, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly report on Dec. 28.  In  London , funds and other money managers raised bullish
bets on Brent by the most in a month, according to data from ICE
Futures Europe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
