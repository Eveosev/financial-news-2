Steel reinforcement-bar futures
gained in China, heading for the biggest monthly advance in
almost three and a half years, after data showed that the
country’s manufacturing expanded in December.  Rebar for delivery in May rose as much as 1.4 percent to
3,969  yuan  ($637) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest most-active price since July 10, and was at 3,963
yuan at 11:30 a.m. local time. Prices have gained 13 percent in
December, the most since July 2009, paring a second annual drop.  China’s economy may have rebounded in the final three
months of the year after a seven-quarter slowdown as the
government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
investment-project approvals. A purchasing Managers’ Index was
at 51.5 in December, according to the final reading from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. That’s the highest
level since May 2011, and compares with a preliminary figure of
50.9 on Dec. 14. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.  “Confidence over an economic recovery is driving up prices
of steel and iron ore,” said Xia Junyan, a Shanghai-based
analyst at Wanda Futures Co. Steelmakers are poised to replenish
their inventories of iron ore to feed production, underpinning
prices, Xia said.  Stockpiles of ore at  China ’s major ports, owned mostly by
mills and traders, fell 3.3 percent to 71.32 million metric tons
as of Dec. 21, the lowest since Sept. 10, 2010, according to
data from researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Ore with 62 percent iron content  delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was unchanged at $139.40 a dry ton Dec. 28,
after reaching the highest level since May 9 the day before,
according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
