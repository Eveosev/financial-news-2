The  Chicago Bears  fired coach Lovie
Smith after nine seasons as the National Football League team
failed to make the playoffs with a 10-6 record, according to
NFL.com, which cited a person it didn’t identify.  While Smith, 54, took the Bears to the playoffs three times
during his tenure, the team has failed to qualify for the
postseason five of the past six years after losing to the
Indianapolis Colts in the  Super Bowl  following the 2006 season.  Smith had an 81-63 record with the Bears, who hired Phil Emery as the team’s new general manager in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
