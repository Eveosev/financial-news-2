(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show corn rose,
not fell.)  Wheat futures fell on speculation
that farmers increased sales amid concern the U.S. budget
dispute will damp the economy and erode commodity demand in
2013. Soybeans dropped, while corn rose.  Congressional Democrats and Republicans haven’t reached an
accord to avert $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
set to start tomorrow. This year, wheat in Chicago gained 19
percent, the most among 24  raw materials  in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, after adverse weather eroded global
inventory.  “There’s been more grain movement than usual this time of
year” because of the so-called fiscal cliff, Jason Britt, the
president of Central States Commodities Inc., a brokerage in
Kansas City,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “As far
as the tax consequences, if they took the money this year, that
might be better than if they wait.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.1 percent to settle
at $7.78 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. This
month, the price tumbled 9.9 percent, the most since September
2011.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$14.095 a bushel. This year, the price climbed 17 percent, the
second-biggest gain among GSCI components. The oilseed reached a
record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$6.9825 a bushel. The grain advanced 8 percent this year,
reaching a record $8.49 on Aug. 10, as drought scorched the U.S.
Midwest.  The GSCI index rose 0.3 percent in 2012.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
