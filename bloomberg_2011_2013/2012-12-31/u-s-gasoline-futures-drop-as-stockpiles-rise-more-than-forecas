Gasoline fell after a report that
U.S. inventories of the fuel increased last week and amid
concern lawmakers will fail to avert automatic tax increases and
spending cuts scheduled to take effect tomorrow.  Futures declined for second day as the Energy Department
reported that gasoline supplies rose 3.78 million barrels to
223.1 million, the highest level since March. U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid said “there’s still significant
differences” as Democrats and Republicans work to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in tax gains and
federal spending reductions.  “Over the last five weeks, the U.S. has built 22.7 million
barrels of gasoline and is now for the season at a multiyear
high in stocks of not only crude but also of gasoline,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director of Zug, Switzerland-based consultants
Petromatrix GmbH, said today in a report.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.85 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $2.7914 a gallon as of 5:09 a.m. local time on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange. The more actively traded February
futures slipped 0.95 cents to $2.749. January gasoline and
heating oil will expire at the close of floor trading today.  Supplies in the Padd 1 region, which covers the U.S.
northeast, rose 1.98 million barrels to 51.1 million, the
highest level since Aug. 3. The area includes New York Harbor,
the delivery point for Nymex futures.  Seasonal High  Total U.S.  inventories  have climbed 22.7 million barrels,
or 11 percent, in five straight weeks of increases. Supplies are
at the highest seasonal level since 1993.  Gasoline  demand  fell 0.1 percent to 8.61 million barrels a
day. Consumption over the past four weeks is down 2.8 percent
from the same period a year earlier.  Distillate stockpiles  in the week ended Dec. 21 increased
2.42 million barrels to 119.4 million. Supplies of  ultra-low
sulfur diesel  rose 2.01 million barrels to 87.1 million, the
highest level in 11 weeks.  “It’s a bearish report, product builds in gasoline and
distillates, including a 2 million-barrel build in road
diesel,” David Pursell, a managing director at Tudor Pickering
Holt & Co. LLC in Houston, said on Dec. 28. “Gasoline demand is
down on the four-week trailing average.”  Demand for distillate fuels sank 12 percent to 3.71 million
barrels a day last week, after jumping 20 percent the previous
week. Over the past four weeks, consumption was 6.9 percent
below a year earlier.  Heating oil for January delivery was little changed at
$3.0455 a gallon.  The more actively traded February contract
slipped 65 cents to $3.0148.  Largest Backwardation  January heating oil’s premium to the February contract
increased to 3.04 cents a gallon, the largest premium for the
front-month contract since Feb. 7. The premium, or
backwardation, signals tighter inventories or increased demand.
When supplies are ample, commodities for near-term delivery
typically trade at a discount to later months, or contango.  “With the cold shifting from  Europe  to the U.S., the Nymex
Heating Oil front spreads have continued to tighten and returned
to a backwardated structure,” Petromatrix’s Jakob said.  Stockpiles of heating oil in Padd 1 fell 471,000 barrels to
17.8 million, the lowest level since the week ended June 29.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
was little changed at $3.292 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
