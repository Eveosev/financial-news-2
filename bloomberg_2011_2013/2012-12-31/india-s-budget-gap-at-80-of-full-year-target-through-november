India’s budget gap in the eight
months through November reached 80.4 percent of the full-year
target as Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram tries to
reduce the shortfall.  The gap was 4.13 trillion rupees ($75 billion), the
Controller General of Accounts said on its  website  today, better
than the 85.6 percent figure in the same period a year earlier.
The  budget-deficit  target for the year through March 2013 is
5.14 trillion rupees.  India’s efforts to rival China as the fastest-growing major
emerging nation have been hurt by budget and trade deficits and
supply bottlenecks that have kept inflation above 7 percent.
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  last week cut the goal for
economic growth in the five years to 2017 and signaled further
fuel-price increases to curb subsidies that stoked the shortfall.  Chidambaram has pledged to narrow the budget deficit to 5.3
percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year from 5.8
percent in 2011-2012. Last year’s gap was the widest among the
largest  emerging markets , fanned by a subsidy program ranging
from diesel to fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
