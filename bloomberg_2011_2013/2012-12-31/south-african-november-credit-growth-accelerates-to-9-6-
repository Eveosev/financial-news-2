South African credit demand
strengthened in November as the central bank kept  interest rates 
at the lowest in more than 30 years to spur spending.  Borrowing by households and companies rose 9.6 percent
compared with 8.4 percent in October, the Pretoria-based  Reserve
Bank  said on its website today. The median  estimate  of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth of 8.4 percent.  The Reserve Bank last month left its benchmark lending rate
at 5 percent to help support growth in Africa’s largest  economy .
 Consumer spending , which makes up about 60 percent of demand,
has come under strain this year as the jobless rate rose to 25.5
percent and the economy expanded at its slowest pace since a
2009 recession in the third quarter.  Growth may still be “very low” in the final three months
of the year, central bank Governor Gill Marcus said on Nov. 28.
The bank is forecasting 2.5 percent expansion this year, down
from 3.5 percent in 2011.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  rose 6.3 percent in
November from a year earlier compared with 5.7 percent in
October, the central bank said. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
