European stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark index completing the biggest annual gain
since 2009, as U.S. lawmakers faced a midnight deadline to agree
on a budget deal to prevent automatic deficit-reduction measures
from coming into effect tomorrow.  ACEA SpA slipped 2.4 percent after saying it will sell its
photovoltaic plants to RTR Rete Rinnovabile Srl.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  slid
3.2 percent. Viscofan SA climbed 6.8 percent for the biggest
gain on the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.1 percent to 279.14 at 1:44 p.m. in
London, following a shortened day of trading. The benchmark
measure ended the year with a gain of 14 percent. The gauge fell
to a low of 233.87 on June 4, and rebounded 19 percent during
the rest of the year as the  European Central Bank  and the
 Federal Reserve  boosted asset purchases.  “European stocks have had a very good year, even though
the budget talks have dampened spirits at the end of the year.
Going into 2013, European markets have two huge advantages --
cheap valuation and less stress about the debt crisis,” said
Jacques Porta, a  fund manager  who helps oversee $627 million at
Ofi Patrimoine in Paris.  “The deadlock over the U.S. budget
seems to continue, which is bad news for investors.”  The volume changing hands in companies on the U.K.’s FTSE
100 Index was 46 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The volume on
France’s CAC 40 was 62 percent lower.  Fiscal Cliff  The  U.S. Senate  will convene at 11 a.m. Washington time
today to discuss measures to avert more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts, also called the
fiscal cliff.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Democrat, said
yesterday that talks were continuing and he would provide an
update today. He and Republican leader  Mitch McConnell  were
still haggling over income tax rates, estate taxes and spending
cuts as Vice President  Joe Biden  was enlisted to help evolve a
deal.  China’s manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in 19
months, a report showed today. The final reading of a  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index was 51.5 in December, according to a statement
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. That compares with
the 50.9 preliminary reading on Dec. 14 and a final 50.5 in
November. A level above 50 indicates expansion.  2012 Performance  Greece’s  ASE Index (ASE)  and Germany’s DAX Index were the best-
performing western European markets in 2012, as they surged 33
percent and 29 percent respectively.  Spain ’s IBEX 35 Index was
the worst, dropping 4.7 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 and
France’s CAC 40 advanced 5.8 percent and 15 percent
respectively.  Sky Deutschland AG, the German pay-TV operator half-owned
by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., almost tripled this year for the
best performance on the gauge. Bankia was the worst performer,
plunging 89 percent.  Auto companies had the  biggest gains  among 19 industry
groups in the  Stoxx 600, (SXXP)  as they rallied 36 percent this year.
Telecommunications shares fell 11 percent for the biggest loss.  Nine of the 18 western European markets including Germany
and Switzerland were closed today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.5
percent, while France’s CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent.  ACEA lost 2.4 percent to 4.55 euros after its renewable-
energy unit agreed to sell Apollo Srl, which manages
photovoltaic plants with a total installed capacity of 32.54
megawatts, to RTR for 102.50 million euros.  Bankia Plummets  Bankia slipped 3.2 percent to 39.1 euro cents, erasing its
earlier gains. The lender has plunged 43 percent in the last
three days, after Spain said Bankia has a negative value of 4.15
billion euros.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest lender, dropped 0.7
percent to 646.9 pence, while Banco de Sabadell SA lost 2
percent to 1.98 euros.  SNS Reaal NV, the Dutch bank and insurer struggling to meet
capital demands and repay a 2008 loan, dropped 2 percent to 1.03
euros. The company ignored Ernst & Young LLP’s advice in 2010
that it should write down as much as 1.2 billion euros on
property finance loans, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported
Dec. 29 without saying where it got the information.  Viscofan, a Spanish sausage-casings maker, jumped 6.8
percent to 42.81 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
