LodgeNet Interactive Corp. (LNET)  said it
will file for bankruptcy protection under an agreement with
affiliates of Colony Capital LLC, which will invest $60 million
in the provider of on-demand movies to hotel rooms.  The Colony affiliates will become the Sioux Falls, South
Dakota-based company’s controlling shareholder through an
expedited bankruptcy process, LodgeNet said in a statement
today. Los Angeles-based Colony will receive new common stock
representing full ownership, according to the statement.  LodgeNet hasn’t posted an annual profit since 2006. Last
year, 95 percent of its revenue came from the hotel industry,
with Hilton Worldwide and Marriott International Inc.  accounting 
for about a third of sales, according to the company’s filings.
LodgeNet has been trying to expand in health care, and its
eSUITE system was installed in 68 medical facilities at the end
of 2011, according to an annual filing.  “Under Colony’s leadership, LodgeNet is poised to
transform its business through renewed financial strength, the
introduction of new and innovative products and services, and
strengthened industry relationships,” LodgeNet Chairman Doug Bradbury said in the statement.  LodgeNet said it expects unsecured creditors will be paid
in full at the end of the Chapter 11 process. A steering
committee of lenders holding the company’s debt will support a
five-year extension of its $346 million secured credit facility,
according to the statement.  DirecTV Agreement  The agreement also calls for LodgeNet and  DirecTV (DTV)  to
operate as strategic partners within the hospitality and health-
care markets, according to the statement. LodgeNet, which
provides Internet access and other guest-paid entertainment in
1.5 million hotel rooms in the  U.S., Canada and Mexico , said
DirecTV will help it deliver new and improved services.  Colony, with $38 billion in assets under management, also
has invested in Fairmont Raffles Hotels International, hotel
operator Accor SA and Amanresorts International Pte, according
to LodgeNet’s statement.  LodgeNet fell 35 percent to 5 cents at the close in New
York. The  shares  have dropped from a closing high this year of
$4.38 on April 24.  Aaron Syvertsen, an analyst at Sidoti & Co., expects the
company to post a 2012 adjusted loss of 64 cents a share,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LodgeNet’s adjusted
loss for 2011 was 20 cents a share, according to Bloomberg data.  Revenue Decline  LodgeNet’s  sales  declined 21 percent to $421.3 million last
year from a high of $533.9 million in 2008. The company reported
that revenue through three quarters of 2012 declined 13 percent
from a year earlier to $278.7 million.  Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) ’s Miller Buckfire unit, FTI
Consulting Inc. and Moorgate Securities LLC provided financial
advice to LodgeNet. Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Leonard,
Street & Deinard were the company’s legal advisers.  Colony’s financial adviser was Guggenheim Securities LLC,
and Liner Grode Stein Yankelevitz Sunshine Regenstreif & Taylor
LLP and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP provided legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
