Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude from BP Plc at the highest price in more
than a week, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA placed
unsuccessful bids for cargoes.  Supplies from  Angola  will increase this month while output
from  Nigeria  will fall, according to researcher JBC Energy GmbH.  North Sea  Morgan Stanley paid 45 cents more than Dated Brent for a
shipment of Forties, F0108, loading on Jan. 14 to Jan. 16, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That’s the highest since Dec. 20, when a
Forties lot traded at a 60 cent premium. BP had bought lot F0108
at parity to the benchmark on Dec. 24.  Shell bid 55 cents more than Dated Brent for a cargo
loading on Jan. 14 to Jan. 16 and a second consignment on Jan.
19 to Jan. 21. Total bid 30 cents more than the benchmark for a
shipment on Jan. 23 to Jan. 28, according to the survey.  Trafigura Beheer BV offered a consignment of Forties on
Jan. 21 to Jan. 28 at 85 cents more than Dated Brent, without
finding a buyer.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ended at 12:30 p.m.  London  time today, earlier
than its usual finish of 4:30 p.m. because of the New Year
holiday. Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 4 cents less than
Dated Brent on Dec. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a 9 cent discount on Dec. 27.  Brent for February settlement traded at $109.55 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $110 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $108.37 a discount of $1.18 to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals grade,
according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus $1.01 on Dec. 28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe , the  discount  to Dated Brent was
at $1.35, the data showed.  West Africa  Qua Iboe blend was at $2.46 a barrel more than Dated Brent
on Dec. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Angola’s output will increase by 30,000 barrels a day in
December with the start of work at the project known as PSVM,
while Nigeria’s production will decline by 25,000 barrels a day
because of terrorist attacks, according to Vienna-based JBC
Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
