A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said talks were
progressing for a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 3.8
basis points to a mid-price of 95.6 basis points at 10:11 a.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Negotiators made progress overnight as they tried to reach
a last-minute budget deal that would let income taxes go up on
some top earners. Republicans and Democrats were narrowing the
threshold for tax increases to between $400,000 and $500,000 in
annual income.  The Senate will reconvene at 11 a.m. in  Washington  after
budget talks stalled over the weekend to resume talks on a deal
to avoid the more than $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts set to take effect after today that the
 Congressional Budget Office  said would probably cause a
recession in the first half of 2013.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
