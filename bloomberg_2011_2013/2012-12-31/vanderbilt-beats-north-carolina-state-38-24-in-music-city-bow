Clemson University beat eighth-ranked
Louisiana State University 25-24 in college football’s Chick-
fil-A Bowl with a fourth-quarter comeback capped by Chandler
Catanzaro’s 37-yard field goal as time expired.  Tajh Boyd passed for 339 yards and two touchdowns, and also
rushed for a score as No. 14 Clemson outscored LSU 12-0 during
the fourth quarter to erase a 24-13 deficit last night at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  Georgia Tech beat the University of Southern California
21-7 in yesterday’s Sun Bowl, spoiling the Trojans’ postseason
return after a two-year ban.  Also yesterday, Vanderbilt beat North Carolina State 38-24
in the Music City Bowl as Jordan Rodgers threw for 108 yards and
two touchdowns and ran for another score. The University of
Tulsa defeated Iowa State 31-17 in the Liberty Bowl behind three
touchdown runs by Alex Singleton.  In Atlanta, Clemson (11-2) rallied to win for the second
time in its past seven bowl games.  DeAndre Hopkins caught 13 passes for 190 yards and two
touchdowns, including a 12-yarder from Boyd with two minutes, 47
seconds remaining. The Tigers failed on the two-point conversion
attempt, but got the ball back and drove 60 yards in 10 plays to
set up Catanzaro’s winning kick.  “They fought for every patch of grass and they overcame a
lot of adversity,” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said in a
televised interview. “I’m so proud of my football team.”  LSU, led by Jeremy Hill’s 125 rushing yards and two
touchdowns, fell to 10-3.  Sun Bowl  Georgia Tech quarterback Tevin Washington threw for a
touchdown and ran for another score in El Paso,  Texas , as the
Yellow Jackets (7-7) ended a seven-game bowl losing streak.  “It’s great and I couldn’t be happier for them,” Georgia
Tech coach Paul Johnson said in a televised interview. “The
whole team really showed up to play.”  USC, which started the season ranked No. 1 in the
Associated Press media poll, lost five of its final six games to
finish with a 7-6 record. The Trojans, who were without starting
quarterback Matt Barkley because of a shoulder injury, were held
to 107 passing yards, with freshman backup Max Wittek getting
intercepted three times.  Georgia Tech was granted a waiver to play in a bowl game
after finishing the regular season with a 6-7 record and rushed
for 294 yards against USC. The Yellow Jackets, who had lost to
Florida State in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship
game, finished with just 75 passing yards on 10 attempts.  With the score tied 7-7 at halftime,  Washington  scored on a
1-yard run in the third quarter to put Georgia Tech ahead for
good. He added a 17-yard touchdown pass to Orwin Smith in the
fourth quarter.  In Nashville,  Tennessee , Vanderbilt (9-4) took advantage of
three interceptions and two fumbles by North Carolina State.  The Wolfpack (7-6) played the game under interim coach Dana Bible, who took over when Tom O’Brien was fired after a 7-5
regular season. Former Northern Illinois coach Dave Doeren will
be the coach next season.  In  Memphis , Tulsa scored 24 straight points after falling
behind 17-7 after one quarter.  Trey Watts ran for 149 of Tulsa’s 316 rushing yards as the
Golden Hurricane improved to 11-3 on the season.  Iowa State had three turnovers against the Conference USA
champions in falling to 6-7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
