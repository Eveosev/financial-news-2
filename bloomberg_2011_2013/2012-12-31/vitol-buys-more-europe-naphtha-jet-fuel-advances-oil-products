European naphtha declined even as
Vitol Group bought two cargoes, extending its purchases for the
past week to about 17 lots. Jet fuel gained as Royal Dutch Shell
Plc bought a shipment for a second session.  Gasoline barges weakened as Total SA sold two lots. Gasoil
fell for a third session on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  as  Brent crude  dropped. Trafigura Beheer BV purchased a
diesel cargo.  Light Products  Naphtha traded at $938 a metric ton, down from $947 to $949
in the previous session, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.
Trafigura and Glencore International Plc sold the cargoes.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed 10 cents to
$4.59 a barrel as of 11:26 a.m. local time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded at
$946 a ton, according to similar survey of the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with deals from $953 to $961 in the
previous session.  Vitol and BP Plc bought 2,000 ton barges of the Eurobob
grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to Brent, narrowed for a
second session to $5.37 a barrel, PVM data showed. It was $5.81
on Dec. 28.  Middle Distillates  Vitol sold the 30,000 ton jet fuel cargo for delivery to
the U.K. partly priced at $7 more than benchmark prices to
Shell, the Platts survey showed. That’s up from trades on Dec.
28 at premiums from $4 to $6 a ton. On the barge market, BP
bought one lot from  Air France-KLM  at $80 more than ICE gasoil,
according to the survey.  Trafigura purchased a diesel shipment from Vitol for
delivery to Fiumicino,  Italy  at $3 more than benchmark prices.
That compares with a Dec. 14 deal to Lavera,  France  at a
discount of $1.75.  In the diesel barge market, lots changed hands at $18 and
$19 a ton more than ICE gasoil. That’s little changed to deals
at a $19 premium in the previous session.  Gasoil barges strengthened to a discount of $1 a ton to the
futures contract compared with minus $2 on Dec. 28.  January gasoil fell $5, or 0.5 percent, to $928 a ton as of
1:01 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange.  Gasoil’s crack  narrowed to $14.86 a barrel as of 12:30 p.m.
versus $15.31 as of 16:30 p.m. on Dec. 28. Brent fell 92 cents
to $109.70 on ICE.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  changed hands from $574 to $577 a ton,
the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $574.75 to $578
on Dec. 28. The low-sulfur grade traded from $604 to $606 a ton
versus $609 to $610 in the previous session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
