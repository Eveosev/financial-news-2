Sugar rose in  London  to the highest
price in almost four weeks on speculation demand for the refined
variety exceeded estimates. Robusta coffee gained.  The premium commanded by white, or refined, sugar over raw
sweetener climbed 5.4 percent in the past month,  data  compiled
by Bloomberg showed. That may mean demand was underestimated,
London-based broker Marex Spectron Group said in a report dated
today. Sugar is down 13 percent in London and 16 percent in New
York in 2012, heading for a second year of declines, as global
supply is set to outpace demand for a third year in the 2012-13
season begun in October.  “The fact that the white premium is holding up at levels
which enable tolling to take place, after six months when all
tolling refiners have been working more or less at full
capacity, and when  India  and  Pakistan  are unexpected sources of
white exports, must mean that demand for high-quality white
sugar has exceeded statistical forecasts,” said Paul Bannister,
head of sugar brokerage at Marex Spectron. Tolling refers to
imports of raw sugar for processing into white and re-export.  White sugar for delivery in March advanced 0.6 percent to
$524.90 a metric ton, the highest since Dec. 4, by 11:04 a.m. on
NYSE Liffe in London. Raw sugar for delivery in March rose 0.6
percent to 19.54 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Sugar output in India, the second-biggest producer, rose 2
percent from a year earlier to 4.9 million tons from Oct. 1
through Dec. 15, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said Dec.
18, fueling speculation the country may have enough to export.
Pakistan allowed 400,000 tons of sugar exports, according to a
Finance Ministry statement last month.  Speculator Holdings  Large and small speculators excluding  index funds  reduced
their net-short position, or bets on lower prices, in raw sugar
to 58,621 ICE contracts in the week ended Dec. 24 from 62,668
lots a week earlier, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  data . Index funds are likely to buy 30,000 lots in
2013’s second week due to changes in annual weightings in
commodity indexes, Marex Spectron estimates.  “The stalemate continues,” Bannister said. “In the
bearish trench is the big surplus. In the opposite trench is a
rather motley crew, the large managed funds’ short position.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in March advanced 1.3 percent
to $1,936 a ton in London, leaving prices up 7 percent this
year. Arabica coffee for delivery in March, down 36 percent in
2012 in  New York  trading, fell 0.5 percent to $1.461 a pound.  Cocoa for delivery in March was unchanged at 1,438 pounds
($2,325) a ton on NYSE Liffe, for an annual gain of 4.2 percent.
Cocoa for delivery in March added 0.3 percent to $2,256 a ton on
ICE and was up 7 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
