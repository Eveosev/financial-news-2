Copper gained, extending an annual
advance in  London , as data showed that manufacturing in China
expanded at the fastest pace in 19 months, boosting optimism
that demand will improve in the world’s biggest user.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $7,950 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
was at $7,944 at 11:08 a.m. in Shanghai, rising 4.5 percent in
2012. The metal declined 21 percent last year.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 51.5 in December,
according to a final reading from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. The figure was the highest since May 2011, and
compares with a preliminary figure of 50.9 reported on Dec. 14.  “Today’s data confirmed market expectations of an
improving macro environment in  China ,” Xu Liping, an analyst at
HNA Topwin Futures Co., said from Shanghai. “But given the
rising global supply, the copper price will find it difficult to
rally much next year.”  Copper, used in pipes and wires, may advance to as much as
$9,000 a ton in 2013, according to the median of 29 analysts’
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey published Dec. 18. Global output
may gain 3.9 percent to 20.9 million tons in 2013, from a 2.3
percent rate this year, Barclays Plc said in a Dec. 14 report.  Lawmakers in the U.S., the second-largest copper user,
struggled to reach a budget deal before automatic tax increases
and spending cuts start to take effect from tomorrow. A failure
to reach an agreement risks a recession, the  Congressional
Budget Office  has said. The Senate will resume its session today.  Net-long  positions , or wagers on rising prices, held by
funds were 14,988 futures and options contracts as of Dec. 25,
compared with 24,531 a week earlier, the highest since August
2011, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Copper for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to 57,820  yuan 
($9,283) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Metal for
delivery in March rose 0.6 percent to $3.612 a pound on the
Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum, nickel and zinc gained, while lead
declined. Tin was little changed at $23,299 a ton, poised for
the biggest rise this year among base metals, gaining 21 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
