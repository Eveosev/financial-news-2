New York  City attracted a record 52
million tourists this year, an all-time high and a 2.1 percent
increase over 2011, officials said.  Visitors to the most populous U.S. city spent $36.9
billion, up from $34.5 billion in 2011, and created an estimated
$55.3 billion in economic impact, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYC & Company, the marketing and tourism office.  Bloomberg, who set a goal of 55 million visitors and $70
billion in economic impact by 2015, has promoted tourism as a
way to become less reliant on Wall Street. Since 2006 he has
created 18 marketing offices in North America, South America,
 Europe , Asia and  Australia . Leisure and hospitality provided
356,000 jobs this year, 26 percent more than in 2000, when there
were 282,000.  “The tourism industry is thriving, creating thousands of
jobs for New Yorkers at all rungs of the economic ladder,”
Bloomberg said today in statement prepared for a news conference
at  Manhattan ’s American Museum of Natural History. “We are well
on our way to achieving our new goal.”  Even with the addition this year of 17 new hotels, which
brought the city’s total number of rooms to 91,500, hotel
occupancy averaged 87 percent, highest in the nation, said Chris
Heywood, an NYC & Company spokesman. The city collected a record
$504 million in hotel tax revenue.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
