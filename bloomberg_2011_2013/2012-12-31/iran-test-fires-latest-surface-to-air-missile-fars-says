Iran  “successfully” test-fired a
surface-to-air-missile on the fourth day of a military drill
around the  Strait of Hormuz , the state-run  Fars  news agency
reported, citing a military official.  The locally-built Rahd missile is the Iranian naval forces’
latest such missile, said Commander Rear Admiral Amir Rastegar,
a spokesman for the exercise, according to Fars.  The drill covers a large area extending to the Sea of Oman
and the north of the  Indian Ocean  and is aimed at “displaying
the readiness of armed and naval forces to defend Iran’s
waterway and national interests,” Iranian Navy Commander
Habibollah Sayari said four days ago. The exercise will involve
testing defensive and missile systems, combat vessels and
submarines, military officials have said.  Iran is entangled in a conflict with western powers over
its nuclear program, which they allege may be aimed at
developing atomic weapons, a charge the Persian Gulf country
rejects.  Israel  has said “all options are on the table,”
including a military offensive, to stop Iran from building a
bomb.  The Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman is a transit
point for about 20 percent of the world’s traded oil, which
Iranian officials have at times threatened to close down if
their country’s national security were to be put in jeopardy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
