Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , struck by an
interruption of its video-streaming service on Christmas Eve,
said today some customers may be unable to access its DVD
website because of a technical malfunction.  Engineers are working to resolve the problem, Joris Evers,
a spokesman for  Los Gatos , California-based Netflix, said today
in an e-mailed statement. The streaming operation hasn’t been
affected, he said.  The company said last week that many customers in the
Americas were unable to access online content because of a
disruption caused by  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Web storage and computing
system. In a  website  statement, Amazon apologized for the
problem, without identifying Netflix.  Netflix’s website, dvd.netflix.com, which lets members add
discs to their mailing queue, is experiencing technical issues
preventing access for some users, Evers said in a separate
statement today. Shipments of discs already in users’ queues are
working normally, he said.  Shares of Netflix rose 3.6 percent to $92.59 at the close
in New York. The stock has  gained  34 percent this year. Amazon,
based in Seattle, added 2.3 percent to $250.87, giving it a gain
this year of 45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
