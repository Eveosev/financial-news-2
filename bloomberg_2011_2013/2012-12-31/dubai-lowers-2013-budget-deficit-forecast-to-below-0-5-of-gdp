Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, approved a budget that forecast a gap of less
than 0.5 percent of 2013’s gross domestic product, the Dubai
Media Office said in an e-mailed statement today.  The emirate expects revenue to rise 7.8 percent next year
to 32.62 billion dirhams ($8.9 billion) with spending at 34.12
billion dirhams, according to the statement. The budget gap is
expected to narrow by 18 percent compared with 2012.  Government spending  on infrastructure will fall by 5
percentage points to 16 percent of total expenditure because of
the completion of a number of “large projects,” according to
the statement. “The government remains committed to its
announced infrastructure projects which participate in economic
growth and stimulate domestic and foreign investments,” the
media office said.  Dubai allocated 6 percent of spending to debt servicing, it
said. The emirate owes 10.3 billion dirhams in outstanding debt
and interest next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
