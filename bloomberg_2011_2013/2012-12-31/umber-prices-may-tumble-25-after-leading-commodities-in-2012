Lumber futures may tumble as much as
25 percent from a seven-year high as output increases in  Canada ,
the world’s biggest exporter, according to Forest Economic
Advisors LLC.  The price may touch $300 per 1,000 board feet in 2013, Paul F. Jannke, a principal at the Westford, Massachusetts-based
consulting  company , said in a telephone interview on Dec. 27. In
mid-October, he correctly forecast the rally. Futures on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Dec. 26 reached $399.50, the
highest since April 2005.  “We’re pretty close to the peak,” Jannke said. “The
initial spike tends to be the highest, then production ramps up.
If the mills increase shifts from a 40-hour week to a 50-hour
week, that’s a big jump, and everybody is ratcheting up their
work weeks.”  As the U.S. housing market rebounded this year, lumber
prices soared 44 percent, the biggest annual gain since 1993.
That topped the 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index, led by a 19 percent rally in wheat futures in
 Chicago .  U.S. building permits, a proxy for future construction,
rose to an annual rate of 900,000 in November, the highest in
four years, government data shows. That helped boost the shares
of lumber producers including  Weyerhaeuser (WY)  Co. and Plum Creek
Timber Co.  Weyerhaeuser’s plants weren’t running at full capacity this
year, and the company may increase production to meet demand,
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Fulton said on a conference call
on Oct. 26. The company is “cautious” on U.S. housing and
prospects for demand in China and  Europe , he said.  China’s Economy  A leading index for China’s economy rose at a slower pace
in November, signaling limits on a rebound.  Gross domestic
product  in the third quarter expanded 7.4 percent, the lowest
since the first quarter of 2009.  China , the consumer of 10 percent of the world’s softwood
lumber, reduced imports of logs and lumber by 19 percent in the
eight months ended Aug. 31 from a year earlier, Wood Resources
International LLC in Bothell,  Washington , said in October.  Lumber was the top commodity pick for 2013 at Scotiabank
Group because rising demand in the U.S. and China will strain
tight supplies. “Substantial” mill closures across North
America since 2006 set the stage for a multiple-year recovery,
the Toronto-based bank said in a statement on Dec. 20.  The average cash price of lumber will be $360 per 1,000
board feet in 2013, up from $298 in 2012,  Patricia Mohr , a
Scotiabank economist, said in an e-mail on Dec. 27.  ‘Tremendous Crash’  Demand from China is ebbing because builders made “regular
purchases” in the second half of 2012,  Shawn Hackett , the
president at Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. in Boynton Beach,
 Florida , said in a telephone interview on Dec. 27. Rising
production from mills in North America will drive prices lower
in 2013, he said.  “We are heading for a tremendous crash in the lumber
market,” Hackett said. “We’ve gotten way overdone to the
upside. This is the time to be a bear.”  Lumber futures for March delivery fell 2.5 percent to close
at $375.10 at 1:07 p.m. in Chicago. In the fourth quarter, the
price jumped 34 percent, the most in two years.  Shares of Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Washington,
rose 0.9 percent to $27.82. They soared 49 percent this year.  Seattle-based  Plum Creek (PCL)  gained 1.2 percent to $44.37. The
stock climbed 21 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
