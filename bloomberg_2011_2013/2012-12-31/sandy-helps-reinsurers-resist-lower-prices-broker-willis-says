Sandy, the October storm that
battered the U.S. Northeast, is helping reinsurers maintain
prices after a year in which natural-disaster costs fell, broker
 Willis Group Holdings Plc (WSH)  said.  Prices for property-catastrophe reinsurance for Jan. 1
renewal rose 10 percent for U.S. customers with losses and were
unchanged to down 5 percent on businesses without losses, the
London-based broker said today in a  report  on its website.
International rates were unchanged to down 5 percent.  Reinsurers such as  Munich Re  and Swiss Re Ltd. help primary
carriers including  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and Travelers Cos. shoulder
the costliest disasters. The industry benefited this year as
losses from storms, earthquakes and other catastrophes fell by
half from last year’s $120 billion, even as the bill for Sandy
may reach $25 billion, Willis said.  “In the absence of Superstorm Sandy, reinsurers would have
found it difficult to resist buyer pressure for further
concessions,” the broker said in the report. “As such, Sandy’s
impact has helped to stabilize market pricing.”  This year’s reduced claims bill helped reinsurers
accumulate a record  $480 billion  of capital by the end of June,
according to a report by Aon Benfield, the largest reinsurance
broker. Reinsurers and their clients renew the majority of their
annual contracts in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
