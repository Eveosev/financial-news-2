Canadian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index heading toward a gain for the year, as U.S.
lawmakers worked to reach a last-minute budget deal.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and Goldcorp Inc., the world’s two
largest producers of the metal, rose at least 0.8 percent as the
price of gold was set to post a 12th straight annual gain.
The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 23.07 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,339.19 at 10:33 a.m. in Toronto. The equity
gauge has gained 3.2 percent this year, trailing markets in
every developed nation in the world except Portugal and Spain.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he’s hopeful
negotiators can reach a last-minute budget deal that would
protect all but top earners from a tax increase. Lawmakers are
seeking to avoid more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases that will kick in at midnight. Failure to avert the
so-called fiscal cliff will probably send the U.S. into a
recession in the first half of the year, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
