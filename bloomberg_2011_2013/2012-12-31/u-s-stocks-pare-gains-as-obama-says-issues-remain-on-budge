U.S. stocks pared gains after
President  Barack Obama  said there were still issues to resolve
on reaching a budget deal.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,410.91 at 1:55 p.m. in New York, after jumping as much as 1.1
percent as Obama began to speak at the White House.  The president said he was “hopeful” Congress will reach a
smaller deal that prevents tax hikes, and that the deficit can
be tackled in stages.  Stocks rallied earlier on signs of progress in budget
negotiations after a weekend of private talks and public sniping
as lawmakers sought to avert more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts that make up the so-called fiscal
cliff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
