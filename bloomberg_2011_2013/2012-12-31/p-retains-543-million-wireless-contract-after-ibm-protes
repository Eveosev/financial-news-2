Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  retained a $543
million federal contract to provide wireless tracking of medical
devices following  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ’s
protest.  IBM had challenged a June decision to give the five-year
Department of Veterans Affairs contract to HP. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates contract
disputes, agreed with IBM’s argument that the VA didn’t properly
evaluate proposals from vendors seeking the contract. In
October, it directed the agency to reconsider the award.  After re-evaluating the bids, the department decided to
stick with HP, according to  Jo Schuda , a VA spokeswoman.  The VA chose HP “again as the best value for the
government,” Schuda said in an e-mail today.  HP, based in Palo Alto,  California , beat five other
companies to win the work to provide veterans hospitals with
wireless tracking systems, according to VA documents.  The technology would help minimize lost equipment, track
whether medical devices are properly sterilized and identify
patients who may have received recalled products, according to
documents posted online.  The VA ordered HP to stop work on the project in June,
after Armonk, New York-based IBM protested the award.  -- Editors: Stephanie Stoughton, Steve Geimann  To contact the reporter on this story:
