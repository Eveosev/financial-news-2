Vestar Capital Partners, which
yesterday agreed to sell  Duff & Phelps Corp. (DUF)  to investors
including  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  for $665.5 million, will reap a more
than three-times return on its stake in the investment-banking
firm.  Vestar, a New York-based buyout firm, paid about $53
million for a 34 percent stake in Duff & Phelps in 2005,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified because the terms are private. Vestar
previously pocketed about $160 million from the company in share
sales and distributions, according to filings with the  U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission . It stands to get another
$35.6 million when the sale is completed, the person said.  Vestar and Lovell Minnick Partners LLC, a Philadelphia-
based buyout firm that invested an undisclosed amount in 2004,
took Duff & Phelps  public  in 2007, raising about $133 million in
an initial offering. The two private-equity firms subsequently
cashed out the bulk of their holdings through follow-on sales.  Vestar, created in 1988 by Daniel S. O’Connell, Sander M. Levy and other members of First Boston Corp.’s buyout team,
oversees about $7 billion in assets, according to its website.
Levy did not return a call seeking comment on the transaction.  Ebitda Multiple  Carlyle and its Duff & Phelps co-investors -- Swiss bank
Pictet & Cie, U.S. private-equity firm Stone Point Capital LLC
and Geneva-based Edmond de Rothschild Group -- are paying about
eight times trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization for the 80-year-old company.
Revenue at the firm, which also provides financial-advisory
services, is predicted to rise 17 percent this year to $465.8
million, the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shares of Duff & Phelps, which has more than 1,000
employees worldwide, gained about 8 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 13 percent. The stock advanced
1.9 percent to $13.05 on Dec. 28, below the 2007 initial public
offering price of $16.  Duff & Phelps  surged  20 percent today to close at $15.62 in
New York.  The Duff & Phelps merger agreement provides for a “go-
shop” period ending on Feb. 8, during which the company can
solicit and receive alternative proposals. Duff & Phelps would
pay a break-up fee of about $6.65 million if it gets a higher
bid and ends the agreement before March 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
