Coach Norv Turner and General
Manager A.J. Smith were fired by the  San Diego  Chargers today
following the National Football League team’s first losing
season since 2003.  Turner led the Chargers to the American Football Conference
championship game after the 2007 season, his first with the
team, and reached the playoffs following the 2008 and 2009
campaigns. He was 3-3 with San Diego in the postseason, tying
Don Coryell and Bobby Ross for most playoff wins in franchise
history.  Smith joined the Chargers as assistant general manager in
2001 and took over the GM’s job two years later when John Butler
died.  “Both Norv and A.J. are consummate NFL professionals, and
they understand that in this league, the bottom line is
winning,” team President Dean Spanos said in a statement. “My
only goal is the  Super Bowl , and that is why I have decided to
move in a new direction with both our head coach and general
manager positions.”  The Chargers finished the season 7-9, with a 24-21 victory
over the  Oakland Raiders  yesterday.  The 60-year-old Turner had a 56-40 regular-season record
since replacing Marty Schottenheimer, following two seasons with
the Oakland Raiders and seven with the Washington Redskins. He
has a 114-122-1 record as an NFL coach.  The Chargers went 3-3 to open the season, including wins
against the Raiders, Tennessee Titans and  Kansas City Chiefs ,
before losing five of their next six games.  A Dec. 16 loss to the  Carolina Panthers  ensured the team’s
first losing record since the 2003 squad finished 4-12.  Later that week, Turner indicated in an interview with New
York reporters that he might accept a job as offensive
coordinator, a post he held with the  Dallas Cowboys  in the 1990s
when they won two Super Bowl titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
