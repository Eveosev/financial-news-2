Most  Hong Kong   stocks  gained as
Chinese manufacturing expanding faster than estimated, tempering
concern that U.S. lawmakers’ inability to strike a budget deal
will drag the world’s largest economy into recession.  Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , which makes steel, mines iron ore and
sells cars, climbed 2.5 percent.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a
maker of power tools that counts  North America  as its biggest
market, fell 1.6 percent. Property stocks, the best performing
group in the Hang Seng Index, advanced, led by Hang Lung
Properties Ltd., which rose 1.3 percent.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed at 22,656.92 at the
noon close for the year in Hong Kong, after rising 0.1 percent

Markit Economics. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of
mainland companies gained 0.5 percent to 11,436.16.  “We’ve got a very weak U.S. market and theoretically they
are still concerned about the fiscal cliff problem, but the
underlying sentiment in Hong Kong is very strong,” said  Alex Wong , a Hong Kong-based director at Ample Capital Ltd. “The
China PMI data is helping but there is probably not much further
upside because we are still waiting for the outcome of the U.S.
fiscal cliff.”  China’s Economy  About nine stocks rose for every seven that fell on the
broader Hang Seng Composite Index. Volume for the 50-member Hang
Seng Index was 3.9 percent above the 30-day average, according

at a faster pace in December, according to the final reading of
a Purchasing Managers’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. The 51.5 figure, the highest since May 2011,

generation company in China, gained 1.4 percent to HK$19.78.

production, on the back of a strong increase in new business
inflows,” said Xiaoping Ma, a China economist at HSBC Holdings
Plc in a note today. “We expect Beijing to keep its pro-growth
fiscal and monetary policy stance in place, and pursues an
appropriate pace of growth in total social financing as well as
tax cuts. Growth in infrastructure investment is expected to
maintain strong momentum as there are still plenty key
construction projects in the pipeline.”  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.4 percent today. Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  rejected the latest Republican offer
to resolve the crisis as Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  reached

failure risks a recession, the  Congressional Budget Office  has
warned. The Senate will resume its session today.  Exporters Drop  Techtronic slid 1.6 percent to HK$14.36. Glorious Sun Ltd.,
