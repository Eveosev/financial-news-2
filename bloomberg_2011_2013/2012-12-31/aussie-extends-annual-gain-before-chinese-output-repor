The Australian dollar held an
advance this year as a private gauge showed manufacturing
expanded more than economists forecast in  China , the South
Pacific nation’s biggest trading partner.  The so-called Aussie and its New Zealand counterpart
climbed versus most of their major peers before data this week
that analysts say will indicate an expansion in U.S. factory
output. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said the chamber will
resume a session today in an attempt to avoid more than $600
billion in tax increases and federal spending cuts set to start
taking effect in January in the world’s biggest economy.  “The global backdrop paints a relatively favorable picture
for the Aussie dollar,” said Gavin Stacey, the chief interest-
rate strategist in Sydney at Barclays Plc. “It’s hard to
envisage a selloff for the Aussie when the global manufacturing
backdrop is in an improving mode.”  The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to $1.0385 as of
4:38 p.m. in Sydney and climbed 0.4 percent to 89.44 yen. New
Zealand’s currency, also known as the kiwi, advanced 0.4 percent
to 82.33 U.S. cents and increased 0.7 percent to 70.92 yen. The
Aussie has risen 1.7 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this year,
while its New Zealand peer added 5.9 percent.  Australia ’s  10-year bond yield  fell five basis points to
3.27 percent after earlier touching 3.23 percent, the least
since Dec. 12. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, declined 2 1/2 basis points to
2.67 percent.  Manufacturing Gains  The  final reading  for a Chinese manufacturing gauge by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed the index was at 51.5
this month. That compares with a preliminary 50.9 figure
published on Dec. 14 and 50.5 in November. A reading above 50
indicates expansion. A separate  government-backed gauge  probably
rose to 51 in December from 50.6 last month, analysts estimated
before the data is published tomorrow.  Economists predict the  Institute for Supply Management  will
say its  manufacturing index  for the U.S. rose to 50.3 this month
from 49.5 in November, according to a separate Bloomberg poll
before the Jan. 2 release.  Senator Reid said there are still “significant differences
between the two sides, but negotiations continue,” referring to
budget talks among U.S. lawmakers. The Senate will resume its
session today at 11 a.m. Washington time, according to Reid, a
Democrat from  Nevada .  The difference in the number of wagers on a rise in the
Australian dollar compared with those on a decline -- so-called
net longs -- dropped to 75,433 last week, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
That compares with a record 103,376 in the week through Dec. 11.  Bets for a gain in  New Zealand ’s currency were at 14,739
over the same period, after rising to a five-year high of 24,600
in the week ended Dec. 11, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
