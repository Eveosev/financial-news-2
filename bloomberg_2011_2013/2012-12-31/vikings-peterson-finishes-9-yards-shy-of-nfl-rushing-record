Adrian Peterson  helped run the
 Minnesota Vikings  into the National Football League playoffs
before finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson’s 28-
year-old record for rushing yards in a season.  Peterson, 27, entered yesterday’s regular-season finale
against the  Green Bay  Packers 207 yards shy of Dickerson’s mark
of 2,105 yards set in 1984 with the Los Angeles Rams.  Peterson ran for 199 yards, including a 26-yard dash that
set up the winning field goal in a 37-34 victory that put the
Vikings in the postseason for the first time since 2009.  “It’s a bittersweet feeling,” Peterson told reporters.
“The first thing that came to my mind when I heard that I was
nine yards short was, ‘It is what it is. It wasn’t meant to
happen.’ Not to say it doesn’t hurt, because it does.
Ultimately, we came in here and accomplished the ultimate goal
of getting a win and taking our team into the playoffs.”  Peterson had a career-high 34 carries and scored two
touchdowns yesterday, a year to the day he underwent surgery to
repair torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in
his left knee.  Peterson rushed for 91 yards during the first half to help
the Vikings open a 20-10 halftime lead. With a 20-yard run in
the third quarter, he became the seventh running back in NFL
history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season, joining Dickerson,
 O.J. Simpson  (1973),  Barry Sanders  (1997), Terrell Davis (1998),
Jamal Lewis (2003) and  Chris Johnson  (2009).  Peterson said he wasn’t aware during the game how close he
was to Dickerson’s mark. His season rushing total of 2,097 yards
is now the second-most in NFL history.  “I know Eric Dickerson is probably feeling so good,” said
Peterson, who averaged six yards a carry. “God-willing I’ll get
it next year, or at least make it close.”  Peterson rushed for 409 yards in two games this season
against the Packers, who the Vikings will play again in the
first round of the playoffs on Jan. 5 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Peterson has been voted to the NFL’s  Pro Bowl  in five of
his six NFL seasons since being selected by the Vikings in the
first round of the 2007 draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
