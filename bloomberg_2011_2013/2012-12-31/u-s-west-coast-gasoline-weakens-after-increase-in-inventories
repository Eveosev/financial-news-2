gasoline futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:51
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in Los Angeles narrowed 0.25 cent to a

narrowest that differential has been since Dec. 21.  The discount for conventional, 84-octane gasoline in
 Portland ,  Oregon , widened 1.25 cents to 4 cents a gallon. The
