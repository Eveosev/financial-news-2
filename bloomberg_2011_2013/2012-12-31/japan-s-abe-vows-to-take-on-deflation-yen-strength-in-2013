Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
vowed in a New Year message to focus his newly appointed
Cabinet’s efforts on reviving the country’s economy, which has
shrunk almost 10 percent over the past half-decade.  “ Japan ’s most pressing task is to free itself from
deflation and the strong yen so an economic recovery can
occur,” he said in a statement distributed to reporters.  The Japanese currency in 2012 was set to close out its
biggest annual decline in seven years, after reaching a postwar
high in 2011 that eroded the competitiveness of the country’s
exporters. Japan also remains mired in deflation, with consumer
prices excluding fresh food dropping 0.1 percent in November
from a year earlier.  Abe also said Japan will maintain a heightened level of
security in response to “incidents” last year concerning
airspace and territorial waters.  Japan dispatched F-15 fighter jets on Dec. 13 after a
Chinese marine surveillance propeller plane flew through
Japanese-controlled airspace around uninhabited islands in the
 East China Sea  claimed by both countries. China filed a report
with the  United Nations  on Dec. 14 arguing its sovereignty over
the islands, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.  “We will resolutely maintain our legitimate borders,” Abe
said. “We will defend our land, airspace and territorial waters
and our citizens’ lives and property.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
