Afferro Mining Inc. (AFF) , a developer of
iron-ore projects in Cameroon, rose the most in more than a year
after saying it received two takeover approaches.  Afferro jumped 40 percent to C$2.10 in Toronto, the biggest
gain since August 2011. The stock rose 11 percent earlier in
London.  Afferro received an “initial approach” from International
Mining & Infrastructure Corp. Plc, or IMIC, it said in a
statement. IMIC would be prepared to make an offer, subject to
completion of satisfactory due diligence and certain other
conditions at 115 pence ($1.87) to 140 pence a share, Vancouver-
based Afferro said.  IMIC bought a 3.9 percent stake in Afferro for 2 million
pounds ($3.2 million) with the intention of turning the holding
into a strategic one, it said in a statement on July 11.
Afferro, which has doubled this year, owns the Nkout, Ntem and
Akon iron-ore projects in Cameroon.  “The approach from IMIC is at a very early stage,”
Afferro said today. “There can be no certainty that a formal
offer will be forthcoming.”  Afferro said it’s also in talks with anther party about a
possible offer, which precludes it from engaging in discussions
with IMIC until Jan. 13. IMIC would fund its offer with “an
undisclosed mix of cash, yet to be raised by IMIC, and new IMIC
shares,” Afferro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
