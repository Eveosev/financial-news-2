Kenya ’s shilling weakened and headed
for its third straight yearly loss against the dollar, as
inflation stayed below target and raised expectations of deeper
interest-rate cuts.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy declined less
than 0.1 percent to 86.10 a dollar by 12:08 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. A close at that level would mark a 1.2 percent
depreciation in 2012 and the lowest year-end close since at
least 1989, when Bloomberg began tracking the data. The shilling
weakened 5.4 percent last year and 6.5 percent in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy makers have cut Kenya’s  benchmark interest rate 
three times since July to stimulate consumption after economic
growth slowed in the first and second quarters.  Slowing  inflation  gave the central bank scope cut borrowing
costs by 7 percentage points to 11 percent and may allow for a
further reduction at the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting
on Jan. 10, Duncan Kinuthia, chief dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.  “We’ve seen an improvement in the stability of the
shilling this year compared to previous years,” he said. The
“moderate” weakness in the shilling in 2012 coincided “with
interest rate being lowered gradually and a huge current account
deficit,” he said.  While Kenya has set 5 percent as its inflation target for
2012-2013, growth in consumer prices slowed to 3.2 percent in
December from 3.3 percent a month earlier, the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said on Dec. 28.  Kenya’s  current-account deficit  widened by 35.3 percent to
$4.3 billion in the year to September 2012 from $3.2 billion a
year ago, as imports jumped 10.1 percent and exports climbed 2.9
percent, the central bank said on its website on Dec. 6.  Uganda’s shilling weakened for a second day, falling less
than 0.1 percent to 2,685 a dollar, while the Tanzanian currency
gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,582.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
