percent to 1,578.74.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose, capping the longest run of annual gains since at

China will take steps to spur economic growth and as U.S.
leaders near a budget deal.  Investors from  John Paulson  to  George Soros  have a $140.6
billion bet via near-record holdings in gold-backed exchange-
traded products after the  Federal Reserve  said Dec. 12 it would
buy $45 billion of  Treasury securities  a month as of January,

the motor fuel.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for January delivery added
0.4 percent to $2.812 a gallon, gaining 4.7 percent in 2012.  Heating-oil futures rose less than 0.1 percent to $3.0451 a

percent to $3.351 per million British thermal units. This year,

terminals.  The contract dropped 1.6 percent to 60.5 pence a therm at
1:43 p.m. London time, which would be the lowest close since
Oct. 2, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average this year was 59.75 pence, compared with 56.4 pence in
2011. Today’s price is equivalent to $9.79 per million Btu.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Orange-juice futures tumbled the most in 11 months as
