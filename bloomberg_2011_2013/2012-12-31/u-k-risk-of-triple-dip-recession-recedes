U.K. executives’ confidence for 2013
improved this month, indicating the risk of a triple-dip
recession has receded, according to Lloyds Bank.  An  index of business sentiment  rose to 40 from 35 in
November, the unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in a report
in London today. A gauge measuring the  outlook for the economy 
increased to 20 from 17, which Lloyds said is consistent with
“broadly flat underlying growth” at the end of this year.  Britain’s economy emerged from a recession in the third
quarter, helped by a boost from the London  Olympic Games . While
the  Bank of England  has said  gross domestic product  may decline
this quarter in what will be a “zigzag” pattern of output, it
forecasts a gradual recovery through 2013.  There is a risk of a “marginally negative outturn in the
headline figure due to the unwinding of Olympics-related
consumption,” said Trevor Williams, chief economist at Lloyds
Bank in London. “However, the upward momentum in confidence, if
sustained, would point to a return to growth in the early stages
of 2013, though external risks remain.”  Lloyds said the increase in both sentiment indexes suggests
the probability of a recession, defined as two consecutive
quarters of negative growth, fell to 11 percent this month --
the lowest level since April -- from 17 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
