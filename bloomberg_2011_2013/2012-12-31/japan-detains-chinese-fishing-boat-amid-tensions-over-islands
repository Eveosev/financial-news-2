Japan  freed the captain and crew of a
Chinese fishing boat that entered its waters near Kagoshima
prefecture over the weekend, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday.  The boat’s captain, Lin Shiqin, and two crew members, were
released after being brought in for questioning on Dec. 29,
Xinhua said, citing the Chinese Consulate General in Fukuoka.  The incident comes amid a dispute between  China  and Japan
over territory in the  East China Sea , with China asserting
sovereignty over uninhabited islands that are administered by
Japan. The detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain in
September 2010 in the area of the islands -- known as Senkaku in
Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese -- strained relations between the
world’s second- and third-biggest economies.  Chinese ships conducted patrols around the islands
yesterday, Xinhua said, citing the State Oceanic Administration.
In a briefing yesterday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua
Chunying reiterated China’s claim of sovereignty over the
islands.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
