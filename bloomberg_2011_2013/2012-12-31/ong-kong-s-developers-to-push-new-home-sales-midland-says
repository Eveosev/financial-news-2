Hong Kong  builders  will sell more
new homes next year even as government curbs pushed the number
of transactions to a six-year low in 2012, according to  Midland
Holdings Ltd. (1200) , the city’s biggest publicly traded realtor.  Total residential units sold this year probably fell to
82,700, down from 86,000 in 2011 and the lowest since 2006,
according to Midland’s estimate. While the number of  new home
sales  probably rose to almost 13,000 in 2012 from 10,500 a year
earlier, second-hand transactions fell more than 7 percent to
about 63,000.  Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who pledged to
make housing more affordable during his election campaign, has
imposed three rounds of measures to curb home prices since
taking over in July, including a plan to increase land supply.
 Home prices  in November had its biggest drop in 11 months after
the government levied a 15 percent tax on all foreign
homebuyers.  “They’ll still be aggressive,” said Buggle Lau, Hong
Kong-based chief analyst at Midland. “They need the funds to
replenish land reserve and the government has made it clear
they’ll be pushing more land out. We don’t see this changing for
a while.”  Builders are embracing for more available land to boost
sales. Sites provided by the government in the fiscal year ended
2013 will provide more than 20,000 residential units when
construction is completed, Development Secretary  Paul Chan  said
Dec. 24.  Sales Boost  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , the developer controlled by Hong
Kong billionaire  Li Ka-shing , expects to generate home sales of
as much as HK$30 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2013, up from the
HK$27 billion this year, Anita Fung, a spokeswoman for the
company, said by phone.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s biggest
developer, expect sales volume to fall in the fiscal year ending
June from a record in the year earlier, when it generated HK$38
billion from home sales, deputy managing director Victor Lui
said in a phone interview.  “You can’t have new record every year so volume will slow
down a bit,” he said, declining to provide a target. “We’ll be
doing a bit of catch up in the next six months and launching
quite a few projects.”  Home prices  in Hong Kong fell 2.1 percent from a record in
the three weeks to Dec. 2, the biggest drop since January,
according to an index compiled by Centaline Property Agency Ltd.
The city, the world’s most expensive place to buy an apartment,
faces the risk of an “abrupt correction” in property prices,
the  International Monetary Fund  said earlier this year.  Record low mortgage rates, an influx of mainland Chinese
buyers and a lack of new housing supply have pushed up home
prices, which have doubled in the past four years and surpassed
the previous peak in 1997, according to the Centaline index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
