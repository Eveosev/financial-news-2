Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (SLXP) , a maker
of gastrointestinal drugs, won U.S. clearance to sell Fulyzaq,
the first approved medicine to treat HIV-associated diarrhea.  The Food and Drug Administration approved the Raleigh,
North Carolina-based company’s application to sell Fulyzaq, or
crofelemer, to people with the virus that causes AIDS. Diarrhea
is a common reason why those with HIV stop or switch
antiretroviral therapies, the agency said in a  statement  today.  Derived from the crimson-colored sap of the Dragon’s Blood
tree, the first-of-a-kind drug is also the second botanical
prescription medicine approved by FDA. Salix, which got about 69
percent of its $540 million in  sales  last year from the
antibiotic Xifaxan, has said the U.S. HIV-associated diarrhea
market represents a $300 million-a-year opportunity.  Analysts estimated that crofelemer may add about $18
million in sales in 2013 and $26 million in 2014, according to
the average of  seven estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  An FDA decision on the company’s treatment had been delayed
twice this year, including postponement of a September target
date.  To contact the reporters on this story:
