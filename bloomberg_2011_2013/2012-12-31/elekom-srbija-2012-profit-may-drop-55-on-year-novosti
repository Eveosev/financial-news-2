Telekom Srbija AD, Serbia’s state-
controlled phone company, expects a 55 percent drop in 2012
profit to about 10 billion dinars ($116 million),  Vecernje
Novosti  reported, citing acting General Manager Predrag Culibrk.  The decline is mostly due to dinar weakness in the first
half of the year that made Telekom’s foreign loans more
expensive than expected, the newspaper quoted Culibrk as saying.  The former monopoly will double investments in 2013 to try
to keep up with competitors, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
