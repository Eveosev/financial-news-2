Hog futures fell to the lowest in
almost two weeks after a report showed the sow herd unexpectedly
increased, signaling more pork supplies. Cattle prices were
little changed.  About 5.817 million  sows  were being held back for breeding
at the start of this month, up 0.2 percent from 5.803 million a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
quarterly report released after the close of regular trading on
Dec. 28. Ten analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected the
herd to decline 0.8 percent, on average.  “The hog and pig report was negative,”  Christian Mayer , a
market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “When you’re
looking at more pigs down the line, that’s not what the trade
was necessarily anticipating. We’ll have a time where we set
back here a little bit.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 1.4 percent to
85.2 cents a pound at 10:03 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after reaching 84.85 cents, the lowest for the most-
active contract since Dec. 18. The price rose 2.5 percent this
year through Dec. 28, heading for the fifth straight increase.  Sows averaged 10.15 pigs per litter in the three months
ended Nov. 30, a record for the quarter and up from 10.02 a year
earlier, the USDA said in the  report .  Cattle futures for February delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$1.3365 a pound in  Chicago . The price gained 10 percent this
year through Dec. 28, heading for the fourth straight annual
rally.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement advanced 0.4
percent to $1.554 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
