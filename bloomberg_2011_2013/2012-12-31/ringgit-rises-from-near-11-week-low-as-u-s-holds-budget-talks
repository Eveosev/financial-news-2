Malaysia’s ringgit climbed from near
an 11-week low as U.S. policy makers continue negotiations to
avert the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in
spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect tomorrow.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday
significant differences remain between Democrats and Republicans
as both parties work to bridge gaps over income tax rates, the
estate tax and other issues. Total loan applications in the
Malaysian banking system contracted 19 percent in November from
a year earlier, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in October,
according to a Dec. 28 central bank report.  “The fiscal cliff issue has to be resolved in some way and
the market is waiting,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based
foreign-exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA) 
“It’s still in suspense.”  The ringgit advanced 0.2 percent to 3.0583 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It closed at 3.0640 on Dec. 28, near the 3.0788 level
reached on Dec. 26, which was the weakest since Oct. 11. The
currency has gained 3.6 percent this year. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, to 4.81 percent.  Government bonds were steady. The yield on the 3.314
percent notes due October 2017 held at 3.25 percent, according
to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
