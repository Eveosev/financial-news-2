Zambia’s kwacha weakened against the
dollar before its rebasing tomorrow.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest copper producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 5,206 per dollar at 8:01 a.m. in
Lusaka, the capital.  The kwacha may retreat further at the start of the new
year, Mwewa Kyamulanda, a currency trader with  Investrust Bank
Plc (INVESTRU) , said by mobile phone from Lusaka. The re-basing will take
place on Jan. 1 and  remove three zeros from the current
 exchange rate . The currency will probably average 5.19 to 5.21 a
dollar in January, he said. Other African countries including
Zimbabwe and  Ghana  have in the past rebased their respective
currencies.  “There will be some short term depreciation from some
players in the market that would prefer to convert their cash
into dollars,” he said. “We actually traded a large volume of
cash over the past few weeks,” when clients were changing their
kwacha for dollars, said Kyamulunda.  Higher inflation rate in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted
in the kwacha weakening from as much as 960 per dollar in 1994
to 5,650 a dollar in 2009.  Zambia  will remove from circulation bank notes including
50,000 kwacha, 20,000 kwacha and 10,000 kwacha. It will
reintroduce coins denominated in ngwee. One kwacha is worth 100
ngwee.  The kwacha was Africa’s strongest performer on Dec. 24 with
a gain of 4 percent as the government was said to be supporting
it. It was the weakest on Dec. 27, slumping 5.3 percent, as
investors swapped kwacha for dollars.  The new currency code for kwacha will be ZMW.  To contact the reporter on this story:
