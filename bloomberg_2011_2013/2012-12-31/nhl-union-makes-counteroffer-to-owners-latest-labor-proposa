The National Hockey League Players’
Association made a new counteroffer to the NHL’s latest
Collective Bargaining Agreement proposal as the two sides met
yesterday for the first time in about two weeks.  NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would respond
to the union today. The NHL and its players’ association,
seeking to end a 106-day lockout, met face-to-face yesterday in
 New York  to discuss details of a 10-year offer.  The league presented the players’ union with its most
recent offer on Dec. 27. After reviewing it, the union countered
with its latest offer yesterday. The NHL is seeking a deal by
Jan. 11 to allow for training camps to begin the next day with a
48-game season set to start Jan. 19.  “Their response was a comprehensive one, dealing with a
full slate of issues that we raised in the proposal we put
forth,” Bettman told reporters. “We’re in the process of
reviewing their response.”  The two sides hadn’t held face-to-face negotiations since
Dec. 13 when federal mediators were present.  Under the league’s latest offer, the limit of individual
free-agent contracts was raised to six years from five years or
seven years if a team re-signs its own player, the  Associated
Press  reported, citing a person familiar with the document that
it didn’t identify. It also offered to raise the salary variance
from one year to another to 10 percent from 5 percent.  The latest proposal would run through the 2021-22 season,
with both sides having the right to opt out after eight years,
AP said.  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of the
season, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.
11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped out
the 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost to
a labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and other
issues, including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billion
last season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,
or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or
43 percent, was shared among the league’s 30 team owners. The
league this time has offered a 50-50 split.  To contact the reporter on this story:
