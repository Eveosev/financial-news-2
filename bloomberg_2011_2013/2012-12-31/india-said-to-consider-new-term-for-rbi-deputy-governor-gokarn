India is considering a new term for
Subir Gokarn, the deputy governor in charge of monetary policy
at the nation’s central bank, a government official with direct
knowledge of the matter said.  The  finance ministry  may take a decision on the appointment
today, the official said, asking not to be identified before an
announcement. Kalpana Kochhar, South Asia chief economist at the
World Bank, has also been shortlisted for the job, the official
said. D.S. Malik, a spokesman for the finance ministry, didn’t
answer two calls made to his mobile phone seeking comment.  Gokarn, who was the Asia-Pacific chief economist at
 Standard & Poor’s , was appointed to the post at the  Reserve Bank 
of India for three years in November 2009. His term ends today.  The central bank, based in Mumbai, is headed by Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao, who is assisted by four deputies. While Gokarn
overseas the monetary policy, Anand Sinha handles banking
operations and K.C. Chakrabarty is in charge of co-operative
banks and human resources. Harun  Rashid Khan  heads the foreign
exchange and internal debt management departments.  Subbarao has left the policy benchmark unchanged since a 50
basis-point cut in April. Elevated inflation has limited the the
central bank’s scope to cut borrowing cost even as the
government forecast the economy will expand at the slowest pace
in a decade.  The Economic Times newspaper earlier today reported Gokarn
and Kochhar are being considered for the deputy governor’s post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
