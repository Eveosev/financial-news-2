OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  won’t repeat the
surge that made it the biggest gainer among Russian U.S.-traded
stocks in 2012 as the oil company’s fields are depleted and it
switches to international accounting standards, according to VTB
Capital and Rye Man & Gor Securities.  Preferred American depositary receipts of Surgut rose 3.6
percent yesterday to cap a 30 percent advance in  New York  last
year, tracking a 21 percent jump in the producer’s Moscow
 preferred stock . The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the
most-traded Russian shares in the U.S. added 9.7 percent in
2012, beating the Moscow-based Micex Index’s 5.4 percent jump.  Surgut won’t extend its best year since 2009 as the
company, which currently posts earnings to Russian accounting
standards, will probably move to International Financial
Reporting Standards this year, tempering speculation about the
switch that has been the stock’s “greatest growth factor,”
said Mikhail Loshinin, an analyst at RMG. The Siberian company,
 Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer, said in October that net
income in the first nine months of 2012 fell 40 percent.  “Surgut is not going to be a significant outperformer next
year,” Dmitry Loukashov, an analyst at VTB Capital, a unit of
Russia’s second-largest bank, who rates the stock buy, said by
phone from Moscow Dec. 28. “Everyone in the market knows
they’re going to publish to IFRS standards.”  Fields ‘Exhausted’  The Russia-US gauge of 14 stocks rose 1.5 percent to 99.31
in New York yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 1.7
percent to $29.90, pushing its advance in 2012 to 12 percent.
RTS Index  futures  due in March added 0.4 percent to 153,590.  Surgut’s preferred ADRs climbed to $6.64 in New York
yesterday, while its preferred shares listed on the Micex
dropped 1.1 percent to 19.92 rubles on Dec. 28, the equivalent
of 65 cents. Russia’s New Year holiday extends until Jan. 9.  The crude producer’s fields in Western Siberia are “very
exhausted” and other projects in Siberia aren’t very developed,
meaning they won’t be able to compensate for declines in
revenue, RMG’s Loshinin, who rates Surgut buy, said by phone
Dec. 28.  The company won rights to the Shpilman field in the Khanty-
Mansiisk region of Siberia last month, after losing out to TNK-
BP on the Lodochnoye oil field, in Siberia’s Krasnoyarsk region,
earlier in December. Energy companies are investing in Siberia
to revive aging fields and open up new areas for development as
President  Vladimir Putin  offers tax incentives.  International Standard  Surgut said in April that it would publish 2012 financial
results to IFRS, following a law that requires Russian companies
to switch to the international standard.  An e-mail requesting information on the status of the move
sent to Surgut’s investor-relations office yesterday wasn’t
returned. Russia’s three biggest oil producers -- OAO Rosneft,
OAO Lukoil and TNK-BP -- currently report to U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and have either already
shifted to IFRS or pledged to do so.  Crude oil for February delivery jumped 1.1 percent to
$91.82 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.
Prices fell 7.1 percent last year. Brent oil for February
settlement rose 0.4 percent to $111.11 on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe , capping a 3.5 percent advance for 2012. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export oil blend, rose 0.4 percent to
$109.72 a barrel, pushing prices up 3.8 percent in 2012, the
fourth annual climb.  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s second-biggest crude producer, rose
1.4 percent to $67.50 in New York, the highest close since July
2011. The ADRs gained 27 percent last year, while the Moscow-
based company’s Moscow shares added 18 percent, the best
performance in three years.  RusHydro’s Decline  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , the state-run hydropower producer, added 1.3
percent to $2.35 in New York yesterday, trimming a 22 percent
decline in 2012 that was the worst performance on the Russia-
U.S. index. RusHydro’s Moscow stock sank 24 percent in 2012.  ADRs of  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest producer of
steelmaking coal, added 2.4 percent to $6.93 in New York, paring
an 18 percent decline for the year.  Mechel (MTLR)  shares in Moscow slid
25 percent in 2012.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  rose 0.7 percent to $10.49 yesterday,
extending last year’s 11 percent jump. The Algerian government’s
purchase of a stake in Djezzy, a local unit of VimpelCom’s
Orascom Telecom Algerie, is nearing completion and is pending
selection of seven board members, Al-Fadjr independent newspaper
reported, citing unidentified Finance Ministry officials.  Ruble futures showed the currency little changed at 30.783
per dollar in U.S. trading hours yesterday. The ruble climbed
5.7 percent against the dollar last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
