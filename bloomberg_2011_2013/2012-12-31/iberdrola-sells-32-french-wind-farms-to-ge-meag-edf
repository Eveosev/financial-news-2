Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Spain ’s biggest
utility, said it sold its French renewables unit to  General
Electric Co. (GE) , Meag and  Electricite de  France  SA.  The deal is valued at 350 million euros ($462 million),
including the sale price, loans and debt repayments, according
to an Iberdrola  filing  today posted on the Spanish stock market
regulator’s website. A further payment of 50 million euros is
possible, Iberdrola said, without detailing the conditions.  Chairman Ignacio Sanchez Galan said in a Dec. 2 interview
he was negotiating sales of French, German and Polish wind
farms, and has now announced deals in Germany and France. The
latest sale means Iberdrola has divested about 850 million euros
of assets in 2012 as part of a plan to sell 2 billion euros
worth by the end of 2014 to strengthen its balance sheet. The
French unit that Iberdrola is selling directly or indirectly
owns 32 wind farms, with a total of 321.4 megawatts of capacity,
according to the filing.  Meag Munich Ergo Asset Management GmbH, an asset manager
for  Munich Re  and Ergo, acquired 40 percent of the French wind
farms through MR Rent-Investment GmbH, a Munich Re unit,
according to today’s filing. GE took another 40 percent through
Guayama PR Holdings BV, and EDF’s renewables unit took the
remaining 20 percent, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
