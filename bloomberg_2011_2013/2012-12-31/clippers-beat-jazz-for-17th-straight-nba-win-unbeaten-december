The Los Angeles Clippers beat the
Utah Jazz 107-96 to push their winning streak to 17 games and
become the third team in National Basketball Association history
with a 16-0 record in a single month.  Caron Butler scored 29 points last night at the Staples
Center in Los Angeles while Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford added
19 each for the Clippers, who are an NBA-best 25-6 this season.  The Clippers’ winning streak is the league’s longest since
the Boston Celtics won 19 games in a row during the 2008-09
campaign. They join the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers and 1995-96
San Antonio Spurs as the only NBA teams to go 16-0 in a month.  The Clippers next play tomorrow at the Denver Nuggets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
