India ’s 10-year bond  yield  fell to a
five-month low on optimism the central bank will ease monetary
policy in 2013 to revive economic growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent next quarter, the first reduction
since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Inflation averaged 7.6 percent this year, compared
with 9.5 percent in 2011. The rupee completed a third monthly
decline. The current-account deficit widened to a record $22.3
billion in the three-months through September, according to an
RBI statement published after market hours.  “Growth is a concern and expectations for a rate cut are
quite legitimate given that headline inflation is coming
lower,” said Lakshmi Iyer, Mumbai-based head of fixed income at
Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. overseeing the equivalent of
$5.6 billion.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 dropped
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.05 percent as
of in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
That’s the lowest level since July 16. The rate fell 13 basis
points this month and 52 basis points in 2012.  Seven economists see a 25 basis point reduction in the repo
rate. One expects no change while Woori CBV Securities Corp.
forecasts a 25 basis point increase. The next review is Jan. 29.  Yield ‘Milestone’  “The next milestone for the 10-year bond yield is 8
percent and even that could be breached if the magnitude of a
rate cut next month is more than 25 basis points,” Iyer said as
she predicted such a move.  The rupee fell 0.4 percent today, the most in more than a
week, to 54.9950 per dollar in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It declined 1.4 percent in December,
taking this year’s loss to 3.5 percent, second only to
 Indonesia ’s rupiah among  Asia ’s 10 most-used currencies
excluding the yen.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 10
basis points to 10.10 percent. The measure decreased 190 basis
points in 2012.  Three-month onshore forwards traded at 55.68, compared with
55.74 at the end of last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 55.71 versus 55.70.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  Inflation Outlook  Asia’s third-largest  economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the
three months through September, matching the first-quarter
growth rate that was the lowest in three years.  At a policy review on Dec. 18 the RBI signaled it will cut
 interest rates  in the coming months, after holding the
repurchase rate at 8 percent for a fifth meeting.  Wholesale-price increases will average 7.7 percent this
quarter and 7.2 percent in the first three months of 2013,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
Bloomberg in December.  “In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy
has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to
growth,” the Reserve Bank said in a statement on Dec. 18.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points today to 7.61 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The contract was at 7.75 percent at the end of 2011.  The overnight interbank borrowing  rate  rose 90 basis points
to 9 percent, the highest level since March, as lenders borrowed
1.565 trillion rupees ($28.5 billion) from the central bank’s
repo window today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
