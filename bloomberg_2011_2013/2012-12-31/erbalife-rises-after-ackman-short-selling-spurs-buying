Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) , the stock shorted by
hedge fund manager  Bill Ackman , rose the most in more than seven
months.  The shares advanced 12 percent to $32.94 at the close in
 New York  for the biggest increase since May 16. The Cayman
Islands-based company sank 38 percent in the week ended Dec. 21.  Ackman, head of New York hedge fund Pershing Square Capital
Management LP, said earlier this month that a year of research
convinced him Herbalife is a pyramid scheme. The company, whose
shares he began selling short about seven to eight months ago,
misrepresents sales figures, misleads distributors about
potential earnings and sells a commodity product at inflated
prices, he said.  The shares are relatively inexpensive now, which may be
triggering increased buying, Timothy Ramey, an analyst at D.A.
Davidson & Co. in  Lake Oswego ,  Oregon , said in an interview. He
advises buying the shares.  In an e-mailed statement after Ackman’s presentation, the
company called his assertions a “malicious attack on our
business model based largely on outdated, distorted and
inaccurate information.”  The maker of nutritional and weight-loss supplements said
last week that it hired Moelis & Co. as a strategic adviser.
Herbalife will hold an analyst meeting to discuss Ackman’s
comments on Jan. 10.  Short selling refers to the practice of borrowing shares
and selling them, with the goal of profiting by repurchasing
them later at a lower price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
