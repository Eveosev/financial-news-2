ESL Investments Inc., the hedge fund
run by  Edward Lampert , named former Best Buy Co. interim chief
executive officer G. Mike Mikan as president.  Mikan, whose appointment is effective Jan. 1, will report
to Lampert, the firm said today in a statement. Mikan served as
interim CEO at Best Buy from April to September and had been on
the company’s board since 2008, according to the statement.
Mikan has resigned from Best Buy’s board, the Richfield,
Minnesota-based consumer-electronics retailer said today in a
regulatory  filing .  “Mike’s background fits with our strategy and he will be a
great asset to me and to ESL’s portfolio companies,” Lampert,
whose firm controls retailer  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) , said in the
statement.  At Best Buy, Mikan had succeeded  Brian Dunn , who resigned
after a board investigation found he had an inappropriate
relationship with a female employee.  Best Buy advanced 5 percent to $11.85 at the close in New
York. The shares slumped 49 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
