UT Bank Ghana Ltd. (UTB) , a lender in the
West African nation, headed for its highest level in 16 months
on bets of stronger financial performance this year.  The stock rose 2.7 percent to 38 pesewas by 1:55 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, the highest level since August 2011.  “Changes made to the top shareholding structure this year
increased the bank’s attractiveness to big corporate and
institutional borrowers,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader with
 Ecobank Development Corp.  in Accra, said by phone. “Coupled
with UT’s experience in lending to small- and medium-sized
companies, we are expecting remarkable growth in profit for this
year,” he said without specifying a full-year earnings
forecast.  The International Finance Corp. invested $15 million for a
20 percent stake in UT Bank this year. A $10 million equity
investment and $5 million loan from Deutsche Investitions und
Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, a Cologne-based company also known
as DEG, bought a shareholding of about 13 percent in the African
lender. The combined investment boosted UT Bank’s capital to 84
million cedis ($44 million) in July, compared with 60 million
cedis required by the central bank.  UT Bank’s net income surged 57 percent to 13.5 million
cedis in the nine months through Sept. 30, according to the
company. Net interest income climbed to 46.9 million cedis from
37.8 million cedi a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
