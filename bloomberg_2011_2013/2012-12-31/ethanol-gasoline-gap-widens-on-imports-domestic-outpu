Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as the biofuel fell, capping its worst monthly
performance since May on increased  imports  and advances in
domestic production.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline expanded 1.61 cents to 62.2
cents a gallon based on January futures contracts, the widest
differential since September 28. The biofuel’s price declined
9.1 percent this month while gasoline increased 1.8 percent.  Imports have averaged 27,000 barrels a day in 2012,
compared with 6,000 in the previous year, according to Energy
Department data compiled by Bloomberg. Production rose 12,000
barrels to 834,000 barrels in the week ended Dec. 21, the
department reported last week.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery declined 0.2
percent, or 0.4 cent to $2.19 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest settlement since June 26. Futures sank 6.6
percent in the fourth quarter, and 0.6 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.285 a gallon, on the Gulf Coast at $2.215, on the West
Coast at $2.35 and in  Chicago  at $2.185, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline futures gained on speculation negotiators will
reach a last-minute U.S. budget deal, helping to prevent a dip
in demand for the motor fuel.  Gasoline for January delivery added 1.21 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.812 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.
January contracts expired at the close of floor trading today.  Corn for March delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.9825 a
bushel in Chicago.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 34
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
