The  Cleveland Browns  fired General
Manager Tom Heckert and coach Pat Shurmur after finishing the
National Football League season with a 5-11 record.  The Browns were purchased for $1 billion in October by
Jimmy Haslam, president of Pilot Travel Centers LLC, the
nationâ€™s largest operator of travel centers and truck stops.
Haslam hired former Phladelphia Eagles executive Joe Banner as
chief executive officer after his purchase.  The team last made the playoffs in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
