The  U.S. population  is on track for
its slowest decade of growth since the Great Depression.  The Census Bureau estimates there will be 315.1 million
people living in the country on New Year’s Day, a 0.73 percent
rise from last year’s estimate and 2.05 percent more than the
most recent census count in April 2010. At the current pace, the
nation’s population will grow by 7.3 percent during the decade,
the lowest level since the 7.25 percent increase recorded
between 1930 and 1940, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The slow rate of growth during the first part of the decade
indicates the U.S. continues to emerge slowly from the worst
economic downturn since the 1930s. The nation’s birth rate and
immigration fell in the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession.
Between 2000 and 2010, the Census Bureau reported the nation’s
population grew by 9.7 percent.  William Frey , a senior fellow at the  Brookings
Institution ’s Metropolitan Policy Program, said one bright spot
is that mountain states in the West were among the fastest-
growing places in the nation.  “There are some signs of growth in Nevada and Arizona,
states that were hit particularly hard by the recession,” he
said.  Dakota Leads  North Dakota, propelled by an energy boom, registered a 2.2
percent population increase between 2011 and 2012, according to
census figures released earlier this month. It was trailed by
the  District of Columbia , which reported a 2.15 percent growth
rate to reach its highest population total since 1987. The
nation’s capital has lost 20 percent of its population over the
last half-century, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Five of the 10 fastest-growing states between 2011 and 2012
were in the West.  Wyoming , the least-populous state in the
nation, grew 1.6 percent to 576,412 people. Utah, Nevada and
Colorado increased their population by about 1.4 percent, and
Arizona gained 1.3 percent to 6.6 million residents.  Two states lost population during the year. Vermont shed
0.1 percent of its residents to 626,011, and  Rhode Island  dipped
0.03 percent to 1.05 million people. West Virginia, which ranks
No. 3 among states with the oldest median age of people, added
0.03 percent to its population, giving it almost exactly the
same number of residents as it had in 1960.  To contact the reporter on this story:
