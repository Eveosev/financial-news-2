Asia’s gasoil crack spread capped a
third annual gain, signaling increased profit for refiners
making diesel. Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. bought gasoline cargoes in
 Singapore , the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude was at $18.86
a barrel at 2:04 p.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread , a gauge of
processing profit, has widened 8.9 percent in 2012, its third
annual increase.  BP Plc bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil  with sulfur content
of 10 parts per million from Chevron Corp. for Jan. 15 to Jan.
19, the earliest loading period, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitor the Platts window. The cargo
changed hands at a premium of 90 cents a barrel to average
January prices. That’s the first reported transaction for ultra-
low-sulfur diesel since Oct. 16.  BP also purchased a similar quantity of gasoil with 0.5
percent sulfur from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a discount of $2.50
a barrel to January prices, the survey showed. The shipment is
for Jan. 26 to Jan. 30 loading.  Jet fuel  rose 5 cents to a premium of 50 cents a barrel to
gasoil, PVM said. This  regrade  has rebounded from a 20-cent
discount at the end of 2011, showing it is more profitable to
make aviation fuel over diesel.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures was at $110.90 a metric ton at 2:14 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, widened 15 percent this year.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification naphtha for second-half February delivery to Shell
at $952 a ton, according to the Bloomberg survey. The world’s
biggest commodities trader also sold the same quantity for
first-half March to Vitol Group at $946 a ton. Mabanaft GmbH
sold a similar March cargo to BP at $947 a ton.  Arcadia bought three 50,000-barrel cargoes of 95-RON
gasoline loading Jan. 15 to Jan. 19, the survey showed.
PetroChina Co. sold one shipment at $122.70 a barrel and a
second parcel at $122.80 a barrel. BP was the seller of the
third cargo for $122.70 a barrel.  PetroChina bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
grade, the survey showed.  China ’s biggest oil company paid
$120.40 a barrel to Arcadia for Jan. 15 to Jan. 19 loading and
$120.20 a barrel to Gunvor Group Ltd. for Jan. 18 to Jan. 22.  Fuel Oil  OAO Lukoil sold 40,000 tons of 380-centistoke high-sulfur
fuel oil to a unit of SK Innovation Co. at a discount of $1 a
ton to average January prices, according to the Bloomberg
survey. The cargo is for Jan. 18 to Jan. 22 loading.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 42 cents to
$9.18 a barrel at 2:04 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This crack spread has increased from a $1.55 discount at the end
of 2011, indicating increased losses for refiners producing
residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after falling to $8.75 a ton, PVM data
showed. The  viscosity spread  has narrowed 19 percent this year,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, declined less than supplies used
in power stations.  Refinery News  Exxon Mobil Corp. is in the process of starting an ethylene
facility at its expanded petrochemical plant in Singapore,
according to an e-mailed statement on Dec. 29. Production at the
steam cracker is expected to begin “in the next few months,”
the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
