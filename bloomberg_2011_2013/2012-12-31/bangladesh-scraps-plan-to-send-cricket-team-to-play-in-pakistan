Bangladesh  scrapped a plan to send
its cricket team to play in  Pakistan , citing security concerns
in the nation.  Bangladesh’s cricket team was scheduled to play a one-day
and a Twenty20 match in Pakistan on Jan. 12 & 13. The Bangladesh
Cricket Board has sent a letter to the  Pakistan Cricket Board 
about the decision, board President Nazmul Hassan told reporters
in Dhaka today.  “The security situation in Pakistan has remained
unchanged, and we decided not to send our cricket team for the
January tour,” Hassan said.  A car bomb yesterday struck a convoy of three buses bound
for Shiite holy sites in neighboring Iran. The attack in the
Mastung district of Baluchistan province triggered a fire in one
of the vehicles, state-run Pakistan Television reported. The
attacks come as Pakistan’s army battles Taliban fighters in the
northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan.  In the latest violence in the region, Taliban killed 21
security personnel kidnapped last week from their posts near the
city of  Peshawar , according to a statement from Pakistan
President Asif Ali Zardari’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
