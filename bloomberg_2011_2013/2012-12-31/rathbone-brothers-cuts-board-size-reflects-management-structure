Rathbone Brothers Plc (RAT) , the U.K. fund
manager founded in 1742, said board members Richard Smeeton,
Andrew Morris and Ian Buckley will step down.  The changes will take effect from the end of the financial
year, the company said in a statement today.  “The decision to reduce the number of executive directors
on the Rathbone Brothers Plc board will better align this board
with the business and the new management structure introduced
within our main operating company, Rathbone Investment
Management Limited,” Chairman Mark Nicholls said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
