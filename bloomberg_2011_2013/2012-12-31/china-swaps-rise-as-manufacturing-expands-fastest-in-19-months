China’s five-year interest-rate swap
rose by the most in two weeks on signs growth in the world’s
second-biggest economy is picking up. The yuan strengthened.  The nation’s manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in
19 months in December, according to the final reading of a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics issued today. The central bank may cancel open-market
operations this week because China’s financial markets will be
shut from Jan. 1 to Jan. 3 for the New Year’s holiday, according
to a trader required to bid at the auctions.  “Growth may be good next year,” said He Weisheng, a
Shanghai-based strategist at Citigroup Inc. “Domestic demand is
good. Urban development projects may also spur the economy.”  The five-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained four
basis points to 3.67 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in  Shanghai , the
biggest increase since Dec. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It climbed 86 basis points this year.  The People’s Bank of  China  said it will stick to a prudent
monetary policy next year and try to stabilize growth, rebalance
the economy and contain inflation. The four-paragraph statement
released late Dec. 28 after a quarterly meeting of the monetary
policy committee, mostly reiterated the stance set out at a
government work conference earlier this month.  Temporary Shortage  The PMI reading of manufacturing from HSBC and Markit
Economics was 51.5 in December, compared with the 50.9
preliminary level and a final 50.5 in November. Fifty is the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  The seven-day  repo rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, rose 46 basis points to 4.58 percent today, a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center shows. The measure dropped 102 basis points, or 1.02
percentage points, in 2012.  “The cash shortage is only temporary before the holiday,”
said He. “Cash supply may rebound in the second week of
January.”  The  yuan  strengthened 0.06 percent to 6.2282 per dollar,
bringing gains this year to 1.1 percent, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency appreciated 4.7
percent last year and 3.6 percent in 2010. It reached 6.2223 on
Nov. 27, the highest level since the country unified official
and market exchange rate sin 1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.14 percent to
6.3272 per dollar, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, declined four basis
points to 1.80 percent.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 dropped four basis points to 3.17 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
