Unidentified gunmen opened fire on
protesters in Cairoâ€™s  Tahrir Square  today, wounding two people,
including one said to be the sole witness in the killing of
another activist last year.  The 20-year-old man who was critically wounded after being
shot in the face was identified as Mohannad Samir, Health
Ministry spokesman Ahmed Omar said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Samir is an activist with the April 6 youth movement, the
state-run Ahram Gate website reported, and was the sole witness
to the killing of another activist in a demonstration in
December 2011 near the Cabinet in which protesters clashed with
soldiers. He had been imprisoned as a result of the protest, the
website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
