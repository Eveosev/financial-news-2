U.K. stocks  dropped for a second
day, trimming their annual gains, as concern that U.S. lawmakers
haven’t yet reached a budget deal overshadowed growth in Chinese
manufacturing and improving British business sentiment.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  retreated 0.9 percent as the
Financial Times reported U.K. retailers expect a challenging
year in 2013.  Premier Foods Plc (PFD) , owner of the Hovis bread and
Bisto gravy brands, slid the most in five months.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 27.56 points, or 0.5 percent, to
5,897.81 at the close in London. The gauge still climbed 5.8
percent in 2012 as the European Central Bank set out a program
of unlimited bond purchases to support the euro area’s weakest
economies. The broader  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  also retreated 0.4
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.4 percent.  “We’ve been relatively complacent going into the new year
under the assumption that everything in the States will just be
wrapped up and it’s obviously not going to happen today,” Adam Carroll, U.K. equity fund manager at NFU Mutual Insurance Ltd.,
which oversees about $20 billion, said by phone from Stratford-
Upon-Avon,  England . “Investors are getting impatient; it’s more
of a political game being played at the moment and we never like
to see political games being played.”  Trading in U.K. stocks closed at 12:30 p.m. on the last day
of the year. The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100
companies today was 40 percent lower than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Budget Talks  The U.S. Senate will convene at 11 a.m. Washington time
today to discuss measures to avert more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts to come into effect
tomorrow, known as the fiscal cliff. Talks between Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell 
that began Dec. 28 stalled yesterday because of disputes over
income tax rates, the estate tax and other issues.  China’s manufacturing unexpectedly expanded at the fastest
pace in 19 months in December, boosting optimism that a recovery
in the world’s second-biggest economy is gaining traction. The
final reading of a Purchasing Managers’ Index was 51.5 in
December, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics today. That compared with the 50.9 preliminary
reading on Dec. 14 and a final 50.5 for November. A level above
50 indicates expansion.  In the U.K., executives’ confidence for 2013 improved this
month indicating the risk of a triple-dip recession has receded,
according to a Lloyds Bank report. An index of business
sentiment rose to 40 from 35 in November, the unit of Lloyds
Banking Group Plc said in the report today. A gauge measuring
the outlook for the economy increased to 20 from 17.  Annual Advance  The 5.8 percent advance in the FTSE 100 this year compares
with a 14 percent rally in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  and a 12
percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The gain on
the U.K. benchmark ranked 21st among 24 developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg.  A  gauge of banks  in the FTSE 350 surged 34 percent in 2012
for the biggest jump in 15 years, even as regulators fined some
lenders for rigging the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc soared 85 percent for the biggest
annual gain in the FTSE 100.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
climbed 61 percent, and Barclays Plc surged 49 percent.  A gauge of metal producers accounted for the biggest annual
losses as  China’s economy  cooled. The  FTSE 350 Industrial Metals
& Mining Index (F3METL)  slumped 29 percent as Evraz Plc, the steelmaker
part-owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , tumbled 31 percent.  Marks & Spencer, the U.K.’s largest clothing retailer, fell
0.9 percent to 382.3 pence today.  Andy Clarke , chief executive
officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s U.K. Asda chain, said he
expects 2013 to be challenging, according to an FT report.  Premier Foods dropped 7.6 percent to 113 pence for the
biggest decline on the FTSE All-Share Index today, trimming this
year’s gain to 94 percent.  Rexam Plc (REX)  retreated 0.1 percent to 436 pence as the U.K.
beverage can maker said Chinese authorities approved the sale of
its personal care unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
