Subcomandante Marcos, the ski-masked
leader of  Mexico ’s Zapatista rebel movement, urged President
Enrique Pena Nieto to fulfill government promises and grant
constitutional rights to indigenous groups, Reforma reported.  In a letter made public last night, Marcos asked the
president to fulfill agreements signed in 1996 by former
President Ernesto Zedillo from Pena Nieto’s party, the Mexico
City-based newspaper said.  More than 30,000 members of the Zapatista Army for National
Liberation, based in the state of Chiapas, held a silent protest
march on Dec. 21, the Mexican newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
