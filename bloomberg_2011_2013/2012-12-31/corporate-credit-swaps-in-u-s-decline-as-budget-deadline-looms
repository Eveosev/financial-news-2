A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as the deadline for an agreement to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff approached.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.8
basis points to a mid-price of 97.7 basis points at 8:14 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The Senate will reconvene at 11 a.m. in  Washington  after
budget talks stalled over the weekend. “There’s still
significant differences between the two sides but negotiations
continue,” Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said yesterday. A
failure to avoid the more than $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts set to take effect next year would cause a
recession in the first half of 2013, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office .  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
