Bolivia’s state oil company
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos awarded exploration
concessions to  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,
according to state-controlled news outlet Agencia Boliviana de
Informacion.  Petrobras won the right to the almost 100,000-hectare Cedro
area in Santa Cruz department, while BG Group gained the
453,000-hectare Huacareta area in Chuquisaca and Tarija
departments. Contracts for both awards must be signed by Feb.
28, 2013, the  news agency  said.  “Cedro is an important traditional area and it’s estimated
that there’s a mega-field in Huacareta,” YPBF Vice President
Luis Sanchez said, according to the statement published today.  The announcement came a day after President  Evo Morales 
ordered the nationalization of the Bolivian operations of
 Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s largest utility. Other companies bidding
for the Cedro and Huacareta fields included  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
 Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Statoil ASA (STL) , Korea Gas Investments Co., Tecpetrol
SA, and China Petrochemical Corp., the Bolivian  news agency 
said.  YPBF said the tender procedure was unsuccessful for Madre
de Dios, La Guardia and Alegria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
