The New York Jets fired Mike Tannenbaum as general manager and said  Rex Ryan  would remain as coach after a 6-10 season.  Owner Woody Johnson made the announcement in a statement this morning, a day after the Jets concluded their season with a 28-9 loss to the Buffalo Bills.  “Like all Jets fans, I am disappointed with this year’s results,” Johnson said. “However, I am confident that this change will best position our team for greater success going forward.”  Johnson offered support for Ryan to remain as the team’s coach.  “I believe that he has the passion, the talent, and the drive to successfully lead our team,” Johnson said.  The Jets failed to score a touchdown in yesterday’s loss to the Bills. They entered the final week with an offense that ranked 30th out of 32 National Football League teams in total yards.  The Jets’ season was also marked by unrest at the quarterback position, as the team rotated among  Mark Sanchez ,  Tim Tebow  and  Greg McElroy .  Sanchez, the team’s former first-round pick, was benched in the next-to-last week in favor of McElroy, while Tebow was used sparingly after being acquired in an offseason trade with Denver. Sanchez returned to start yesterday’s loss to the Bills after McElroy suffered a concussion, and finished the season with 27 turnovers, including 18 interceptions and nine lost fumbles.  The Jacksonville Jaguars also fired the team’s general manager today, as owner  Shahid Khan  dismissed  Gene Smith  following a 2-14 season. The Jaguars and Kansas City Chiefs tied for the worst record in the NFL.
