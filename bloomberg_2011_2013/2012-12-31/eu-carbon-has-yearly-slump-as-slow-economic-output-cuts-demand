European Union carbon permits
slumped for a fourth year in five as slow economic output in the
region curbed demand and offset supply surged.  The EU contract for December next year fell 0.6 percent to
close at 6.67 euros ($8.80) a metric ton on London’s ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. That takes the annual drop to 8.9 percent
compared with 49 percent last year. Certified Emission
Reductions plunged 92 percent to 39 cents in the 12 months,
while Emission Reduction Units dropped 89 percent.  Euro area economic output declined 0.6 percent in the year
through September, Eurostat said Dec. 6. German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said yesterday the economic environment will be
more difficult in 2013 than this year, and that Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis is “far from over.” EU nations are
considering a European Commission plan to boost carbon prices by
temporarily limiting supply sold in auctions through 2015.  The delay proposal of 900 million tons of carbon allowances
to fix a glut of supply poses a big risk to the bloc’s industry,
 Germany ’s Economy Ministry said Dec. 17. That statement may
lower the chance of regulatory intervention in the first three
quarters of next year, keeping carbon prices muted, Barclays Plc
said on the same day.  Supply of EU allowances sold at auctions will rise to 14.7
million tons next week and to 18.8 million tons the following
five working days, according to data from the websites of the
European Energy Exchange AG and ICE. No allowances were to be
sold this week.  Supply of new CER credits rose 5.9 percent to to record 339
million tons this year, according to  United Nations data  on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
