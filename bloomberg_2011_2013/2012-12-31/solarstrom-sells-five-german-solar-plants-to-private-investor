S.A.G. Solarstrom AG, a German solar
power developer, sold five photovoltaic plants in the country to
an undisclosed private investor.  The ground-mounted plants, built between 2007 and 2008,
have a total capacity of 12 megawatts, Freiburg-based Solarstrom
said in an e-mailed statement today. The transaction value is in
the “double-digit million” range, according to Solarstrom,
which declined to disclose further details when contacted.  The company, which sold four German photovoltaic plants to
Cologne-based Wattner AG in November, is planning to build 440
megawatts of solar plants in Spain, as well as new projects in
southeastern  Europe  and  Chile .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
