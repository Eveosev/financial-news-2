Warburg Pincus LLC, a New York-based
private-equity firm, bought a majority of specialty-drug company
JHP Pharmaceuticals LLC from Morgan Stanley Principal
Investments for $195 million.  The acquisition was made on a “debt-free, cash-free
basis,” JHP, a 5-year-old firm based in Parsippany, New Jersey,
said today in a statement. JHP co-founder and Chief Executive
Officer Stuart Hinchen and other managers retained ownership
interests. Additional terms weren’t disclosed.  JHP, which develops and makes aseptic injectable drugs, was
created by Hinchen and Peter Jenkins in 2007 with  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s backing. That October, it bought a manufacturing plant
in Rochester, New York, from King Pharmaceuticals for about $90
million. The following year, it paid an undisclosed sum to
Procter & Gamble Co. for global rights to  Dantrium (PG) , used to
treat malignant hypothermia. Hinchen, who had been president,
became CEO when Jenkins retired in 2011.  Warburg Pincus, a buyout sponsor and venture-capital firm
started by the late Lionel Pincus in 1966, has more than $30
billion in managed assets. It closed its latest flagship
investment fund, a $15 billion vehicle, in 2007.  Elizabeth H. Weatherman, who heads Warburg Pincus’s health-
care group, didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
