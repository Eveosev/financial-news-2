Central African Republic President
Francois Bozize pledged to hold talks with rebel groups to end a
conflict as they advanced on the capital Bangui.  After meeting yesterday with African Union leader Thomas Boni Yayi, who is also president of  Benin , Bozize said he is
ready to go to Libreville in Gabon to meet with representatives
of the rebel group known as Seleka. Bozize pledged to form a
government of national unity and to step down when his term ends
in 2016, he said in comments broadcast on state-owned Radio
Central.  Rebel forces say Bozize hasn’t complied with the terms of a
peace agreement in 2007 and oppose his plans to seek a third
term in office. They took up arms on Dec. 10, capturing more
than 10 towns including Sibut, about 180 kilometers from Bangui.  France  sent about 150 more troops to Bangui yesterday to
support a peace-keeping mission and help protect the 1,200
French citizens living in the Central African Republic capital.
The U.S. embassy in the Central African Republic suspended
operations last week.  Eric Massi, a spokesman for Seleka, told France24 the group
will hold talks with Yayi to study the details of Bozize’s plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
