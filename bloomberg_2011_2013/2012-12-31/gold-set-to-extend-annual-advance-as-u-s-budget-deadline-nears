Gold advanced, poised for a 12th
annual gain, as U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach a budget deal
before automatic tax increases and spending cuts start to take
effect from tomorrow, boosting demand for a haven.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced as much as 0.3 percent
to $1,660.60 an ounce and was at $1,660.10 at 9:35 a.m. in
 Singapore . Prices have gained 6.2 percent this year as central
banks from  Europe  to the U.S. to China pledged additional
stimulus to spur economic growth.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  rejected the latest
Republican offer to resolve the crisis as Minority Leader  Mitch
McConnell  reached out to Vice President  Joe Biden  to try to
break the impasse. Congress is working to avert more than $600
billion in tax rises and spending cuts, known as the fiscal
cliff, and a failure risks a recession, the  Congressional Budget
Office  has warned. The Senate will resume its session today.  “There’s a murky cloud over the outlook in the short term
that’s purely being driven by the U.S. fiscal deadlock,” said
 Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne. “Once that’s resolved,
there’s better clarity in the market, gold has more upside than
downside risk.”  Gold, down 6.3 percent since September and set for the
biggest quarterly drop since 2004, may climb to $2,000 next year,
the median of 49 estimates in a Bloomberg survey published on
Dec. 18 showed. Morgan Stanley said Dec. 6 that bullion will be
among next year’s best-performing commodities. Prices may peak
in 2013 as the U.S. recovers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts.  ETP Holdings  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold stood
at 2,631.84 metric tons on Dec. 28, according to data tracked by
Bloomberg. The holdings reached a record 2,632.52 tons on Dec.
20 and are up 12 percent this year, the data show.  Gold for February delivery gained 0.3 percent to $1,660.60
an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  Silver for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent
to $30.25 an ounce and was at $30.225. Prices have gained 8.6
percent this year. Holdings in silver-backed ETPs stood at a
record 18,916.92 tons on Dec. 28.  Spot platinum advanced 0.3 percent to $1,525.50 an ounce,
taking this year’s gain to 8.9 percent. Palladium was little
changed at $698 an ounce and is up 6.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
