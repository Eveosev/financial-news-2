     Dec 31 (Bloomberg)-- Malawi’s President Joyce Banda said
she won’t reverse the currency’s devaluation as consumer groups
plan nationwide protests next month against soaring costs.  “I will not stop the flotation of the kwacha,” Banda said
on the Lilongwe-based Zodiak Broadcasting Station today. “That
will be suicidal. We just have to be patient.”  Malawi devalued the kwacha by a third against the dollar on
May 7, a month after Banda took office, and agreed to let the
exchange rate float to meet conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund. Since then, the currency has dropped 26 percent
to 326 per dollar, making it the worst-performing unit in
 Africa . Inflation in the southern African nation surged to 33
percent in November from 30.6 percent in the previous month.  “I am the first one to agree devaluation has brought
suffering,” Banda said. “However, this has also helped
exporters earn more and for the first time in as many years,
tobacco growers benefited a great deal from their crop as a
result of devaluation. Our only problem is that we have a very
narrow export base and this is why we have been hit hard by this
devaluation.”  The Consumers Association of Malawi has organized mass
demonstrations to take place on Jan. 17 to protest against
soaring prices. The group is also calling on Banda to reduce her
budget on travel and vehicles and cut back on government
spending.  Banda said food shortages this year have added to
consumers’ woes. About 2 million Malawians are without food,
forcing the government to increase aid to vulnerable families,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
