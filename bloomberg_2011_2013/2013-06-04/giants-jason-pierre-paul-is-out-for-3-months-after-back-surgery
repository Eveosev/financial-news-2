New York Giants defensive end  Jason Pierre-Paul  is expected to be sidelined until close to the
season opener after having back surgery today, the team said.  Pierre-Paul had a “successful procedure” in  California  to
repair a herniated disc, the Giants said on their website.  “My back has been bothering me for a while, and even last
season I played through some back issues,” Pierre-Paul said in
a statement. “The treatment I’ve been doing has helped manage
the issue, but this procedure is going to get me fully healthy
and there should be no more pain.”  The Giants open their National Football League season in
just over three months, at the Dallas Cowboys on Sept. 8.  Pierre-Paul received multiple epidural injections last
season to deal with back pain, ESPN reported without saying
where it got the information.  The 24-year-old Pierre-Paul had 66 tackles last season, one
interception and a team-high 6 1/2 sacks. Drafted by New York
with the No. 15 pick in the 2010 draft, he has 27 1/2 sacks and
five forced fumbles in three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
