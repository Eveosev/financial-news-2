Members of the U.K. Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards have not yet reached a consensus on whether  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  should be broken up, three people familiar with the discussions said.  The people said lawmakers are considering the contents of a draft report before meeting next week to agree on conclusions. The future of RBS will be part of those talks, two of them said. They asked not to be identified because the draft is private.  The  British Broadcasting Corp. reported  today that the commission’s draft calls for RBS to be split into a so-called good bank and a bad bank. Another person familiar with the contents said that while RBS is likely to form part of the final report, it will not necessarily be a major thread, as the commission has examined culture and practices at all banks.  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King urged the government in March to split up RBS, Britain’s largest publicly owned lender, into a good bank that could fund itself and a bad bank, where unprofitable assets would be transferred. RBS was bailed out by the U.K. taxpayer during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 in a 45.5 billion-pound ($70 billion) rescue.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  set up the  10-person panel  in response to the scandal over the rigging of the London interbank offered rate. Three banks, including RBS, have been fined $2.5 billion in total for manipulating the benchmark.  Minority Opinions  One of the people familiar with the discussions said the banking commission would seek to reach consensus on RBS before publishing its recommendations, though parliamentary committees do publish reports in which minority opinions are noted.  A spokesman for the parliamentary panel, which is headed by Conservative Party lawmaker  Andrew Tyrie , declined to comment on the content of the report. An RBS official in Edinburgh also declined to comment when contacted.  A fifth person who also declined to be identified said a possible breakup of RBS is being examined by the commission, though he noted that lawmakers spent only a small amount of time gathering testimony on the subject compared with the hours spent examining Britain’s banking culture as a whole.  The panel is examining corporate governance within Britain’s banks, transparency and conflicts of interest, and their implications for regulation and government policy.
