The premium that copper buyers are
expected to pay in Europe climbed in the past month amid limited
availability of the metal, according to four people who trade
the market.  The surcharge in Rotterdam is about $115 a metric ton,
based on the median of midpoints from ranges given by the
people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. That compares with $105 last
month and $90 at the end of April.  The fee is added to the price of copper cathode, a form of
refined metal, for immediate delivery on the London Metal
Exchange. It includes insurance and costs to ship to Rotterdam.
Premiums ranged from $100 to $130 a ton, compared with $80 to
$125 last month. One person put the range at $110 to $120 and
another at $120 to $130. One person gave a single figure of $100
and another said $115.  Producers in the region are sold out for this month and
supplies are limited, the people said. They cited curbed
availability of scrap as one reason for the higher premiums.
Warehouse companies are paying incentives to attract metal to
their sheds, further supporting premiums, they said.  Buyers are being asked to pay a premium of about $135 a ton
for copper warrants, certificates giving the bearer ownership of
metal stored in LME-approved warehouses in Rotterdam, Europe’s
biggest port, according to three traders. That’s based on the
median of midpoints from the ranges and compares with $80 to $85
in March and $65 to $70 in February.  Stockpiles  LME copper stockpiles in Rotterdam fell 71 percent this
year to 4,900 tons, the lowest since Oct. 5, exchange data
showed today. They account for 3.3 percent of European
stockpiles. The Belgian city of Antwerp holds 90 percent of the
bourse’s inventory in the region.  Premiums may start to come down now that a backlog of
shipments is starting to ease out of  Chile , the world’s largest
producer, the traders said. Strikes at Chilean ports which ended
in April were holding back 60 percent of the country’s copper
exports, Mining Minister Hernan De Solminihac said April 4. It
takes about 23 days to ship metal from northern Chile to
Rotterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
