Foreigners’ holdings of Australian
 government securities  fell to the lowest proportion of the total
in 2 1/2 years, as an improving global outlook damped demand for
the safety of the top-rated debt.  Offshore holdings declined to 68.9 percent of total
outstanding debt as of March 31, down from 70 percent three
months earlier and the least since the third quarter of 2010,
according to government data compiled by Bloomberg. Non-residents owned A$206.4 billion ($200.8 billion) worth of
 government bonds  and bills, down from A$207 billion at the end
of the prior quarter.  Australian government bonds fell for a second quarter in
the three months ended March 31, the first back-to-back declines
since the first half of 2009. Foreign holdings of the nation’s
debt peaked at a record 77 percent in June 2012, up from 59 five
years earlier, boosted by purchases from foreign central banks.  “The magnitude of those flows are a lot less than they
perhaps were a couple of years ago,” said  Sally Auld , a Sydney-based interest-rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “That’s
consistent with this idea that central banks have moved from the
build-up phase of their portfolio in Aussie bonds to a
maintenance phase.”  Offshore demand for Australian government securities
remains strong, with foreign central banks holding notes across
the yield curve, Rob Nicholl, head of the Australian Office of
Financial Management, said today in Sydney.  Price Declines  Offshore investors bought a net A$2.2 billion of Australian
securities, while price declines reduced the value of their
stakes by A$2.9 billion, according to data from the  Australian
Bureau of Statistics  released today.  Foreign holdings of sovereign notes with maturities longer
than a year fell to A$199.6 billion last quarter, from A$200.1
billion on Dec. 31. The total value of bonds outstanding rose to
A$282.4 billion from A$274.4 billion, according to the
Australian Office of Financial Management.  Offshore investment in government bills fell to A$6.8
billion from A$7.0 billion, as the pool of such debt shrank to
A$16.9 billion from A$21.4 billion.  Japanese Money  Japanese investors sold a net 1.2 trillion yen ($12
billion) of Australian securities in the six months ended March
31, the biggest sales after the U.S., according to data from the
Tokyo-based Ministry of Finance. The sales came as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies helped weaken the yen and drove
up stock prices in the world’s third-biggest economy.  Those outflows may have started reversing, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. Japanese investors were net buyers of
Australian bonds in May for the first time this year, the
Sydney-based company said today, citing data compiled from flows
it manages.  “Our own flows give us some reason to believe that the
worst of the currency-related selling may in fact be over,”
Westpac analysts Damien McColough and Timothy Jung wrote in a
report.  Japanese interest was tilted toward longer-dated notes,
with purchases of  securities  maturing in 10 years or more
dominating, Westpac said. They were net buyers of notes due in
more than five years, and net sellers of shorter-term
securities.  Sovereign Investors  Interest from sovereign investors in Australian bonds
surged again in May, especially from  Asia , according to
McColough and Jung. While there were flows across various
maturities, the data indicate a preference for bonds due in 10
years or more, Westpac said. The A$4 billion sale by the federal
government of a new 2025 bond helped spur interest, the analysts
wrote.  The Aussie traded at 97.10 U.S. cents as of 1:50 p.m. in
Sydney, after reaching 95.82 cents on May 29, the weakest level
since October 2011.  Australia ’s benchmark  10-year yield  has risen this year by
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.42 percent.
Australian government notes handed investors a 0.1 percent loss
in the first quarter after dropping by 0.6 percent in the final
three months of 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
