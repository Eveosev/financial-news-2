The  Boston  Bruins rode a four-goal
first-period blitz to defeat the host Pittsburgh Penguins and
take a two-games-to-none lead in their National Hockey League
playoff series.  Brad Marchand got two goals, while Nathan Horton and David Krejci also scored in the first period for the Bruins as they
won 6-1 at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.  Marchand took 28 seconds to find the net and Horton doubled
the lead after 14 minutes, 37 seconds. Less than two minutes
later it was 3-0 as Krejci got his eighth goal of the
postseason. After Brandon Sutter scored for the Penguins with 34
seconds left in the first period, Marchand restored Boston’s
three-goal advantage with his second goal, nine seconds before
the end of the period.  After a goalless second period, Patrice Bergeron got
Boston’s fifth goal 27 seconds into the third period and Johnny Boychuk completed the rout with 1:24 to play.  The best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals now move to
Boston for games tomorrow night and on June 7.  The series winner will play the Chicago Blackhawks or the
defending Stanley Cup-champion Los Angeles Kings in the title
series. The Blackhawks won the first two games at home in the
series, which resumes tonight with Game 3 in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
