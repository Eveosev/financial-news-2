Apple Inc. (AAPL)  plans to boost its
employee count by 46 percent to 23,400 in its hometown of
Cupertino,  California , paying out $2.9 billion in annual wages
by the time a massive new headquarters is completed in 2016.  The maker of iPhones and iPads estimates that Cupertino
workers’ base salaries will rise by about the same percentage,
from $2 billion last year. The data was included in an 82-page
 report  commissioned by Apple on the economic impact of the
project, called Campus 2.  The plan, one of co-founder  Steve Jobs ’s last projects
before his death in 2011, calls for a donut-shaped, 2.8 million
square-foot main building that’s two-thirds the size of the
Pentagon, featuring curved 40-foot exterior walls made of
concave glass from Germany. Apple would add 6,000 trees and hide
almost all the roads and parking spaces underground.  The campus will also generate 9,200 construction jobs and
$38.1 million in one-time construction taxes and fees for the
city, according to the report. Taxes paid by Apple generated 18
percent of Cupertino’s general fund in 2012, according to the
report, which was prepared by consulting firm Keyser Marston
