The U.K. parliament rejected a
proposal that would have required the government to set a target
for reducing carbon emissions by April 1, a victory for Prime
Minister  David Cameron  over rebel lawmakers.  Members of Parliament in the House of Commons voted 267-290
to reject an amendment to the Energy Bill that would have
required a goal for removing most carbon emissions from power
generation by 2030. The government had proposed to postpone that
decision until 2016.  The legislation is scheduled to clear the House of Commons
this evening. It must be passed by the House of Lords before it
can become law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
