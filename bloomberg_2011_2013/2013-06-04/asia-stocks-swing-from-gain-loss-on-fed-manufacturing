Asia’s benchmark stock  index rose
from a three-month low amid optimism the Federal Reserve will
maintain record monetary stimulus. Japanese shares rallied the
most in a month.  Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a furniture maker that gets 51
percent of its sales in the U.S., gained 9.2 percent in Hong
Kong. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest
brokerage, rebounded 12 percent after slumping yesterday.
 Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the Australian surfwear company
that has breached debt-payment terms, plunged 49 percent after
takeover talks with two suitors ended.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.9 percent to 134.68 as
of 7:36 p.m. in Tokyo, snapping a three-day losing streak after
yesterday closing at the lowest since Feb. 27. About two stocks
gained for each that fell as all 10 industry groups advanced.  “It’s premature even to start debating about the Fed’s
exit from stimulus as corporate activity continues to be
sluggish, keeping the labor market from recovering
dramatically,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about 10.2 trillion yen ($102 billion) in assets. “The
situation hasn’t changed for Japanese shares. It’s hard to
imagine they will keep falling regardless of valuations.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 7.5 percent through
yesterday from May 20, which was the highest close since June
2008. Asia’s benchmark gauge traded at 13 times average
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 14.9 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Japan’s  Topix (TPX) 
index was trading at 15.05 today, about 11 percent cheaper than
the average since the start of 2010.  Regional Gauges  The Topix gained 2.6 percent in Tokyo, its biggest increase
since May 7.  Japan ’s broadest equity measure has fallen 12
percent after touching a near five-year high on May 22. South
Korea’s Kospi index was little changed. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.3 percent as the nation’s central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate at a record low 2.75 percent. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed, and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index retreated 1.2 percent.  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index was little changed, while Taiwan’s Taiex
Index fell 0.1 percent.  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The gauge
advanced 0.6 percent yesterday, erasing losses after Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said central-bank officials are committed to record stimulus measures. Shares
fell earlier after the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index unexpectedly slid to 49 in May, the lowest reading since
June 2009.  Exporters Climb  Companies that do business in the U.S. advanced. Man Wah
climbed 9.2 percent to HK$9.04 in Hong Kong.  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , a maker of Ryobi power tools that gets about 73
percent of sales from North America, added 3 percent to
HK$20.90.  Japanese exporters to the U.S. reversed losses after the
yen fell against most of its major counterparts.  Mazda Motor
Corp. (7261) , an automaker that generates 73 percent of its sales
abroad, rose 2.7 percent to 385 yen after losing as much as 8.5
percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics exporter that gets
68 percent of its sales outside Japan, gained 3.7 percent to
2,009 yen. A weaker yen increases the value of overseas sales
for exporters.  Nomura Rallies  Brokerages in Japan rose the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after declining more than 25 percent from a May
20 high through yesterday. Daiwa soared 12 percent to 855 yen.
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s biggest brokerage by market value,
surged 7.6 percent to 778 yen.  Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd. (1332) , a Japanese maker of seafood
products, jumped 10 percent to 212 yen after saying it will sell
all of its holdings in  Germany ’s Leuchtturm Beteiligungs und
Holding Germany AG, a frozen seafood distributor.  Among stocks that fell, Billabong slumped 49 percent to 23
Australian cents. Sycamore Partners Management and Altamont
Capital Partners, which had been in separate talks to buy
Billabong, are now in refinancing and asset-sale discussions
with the Gold Coast, Australia-based retailer, it said in a
statement today.  Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. (2689) , a maker of paper and
packaging materials co-founded by Cheung Yan, one of China’s
richest women, slumped 7.5 percent to HK$5.28 in Hong Kong. The
company may face more earnings downside risk if paper prices
continue to weaken, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
