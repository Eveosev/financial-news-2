LondonMetric Property Plc (LMP) , a real
estate investment trust created by a takeover last year, agreed
to sell logistics centers in a deal valued at 247.6 million
pounds ($379 million) including debt to a company owned by
 Prologis Inc. (PLD)  and Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund.  LondonMetric would receive 68.3 million pounds after
repayment of debt and fees for the 11 warehouse properties with
2.4 million square feet (223,000 square meters) of combined
space, the London-based company said in a statement today. The
deal’s net initial yield is 6.25 percent, it said.  “This disposal is in line with our strategy to focus on
distribution assets in the retail sector,” LondonMetric
Chairman Patrick Vaughan said in the statement. “We have a
number of investment acquisition opportunities agreed and in
solicitors’ hands which will allow us to reinvest.”  Norway ’s wealth fund, the world’s biggest, in December
agreed to buy half of a European property portfolio from
Prologis for 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion). Norges Bank
Investment Management, manager of the fund, is expanding into
real estate with a plan to have 5 percent of the fund’s assets
invested in the industry. The deal was its first purchase of
industrial property.  LondonMetric was created by a merger of two commercial
property companies in a deal announced in November. It owns and
rents out commercial and residential buildings in  London  and
retail space in the city’s suburbs. Prologis is a San Francisco-based REIT specializing in industrial properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
