Corn tumbled for a second day as
planting neared completion in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower, easing concern that acreage would be smaller than
predicted by the government. Wheat and soybeans fell.  Corn for delivery in December lost as much as 1.3 percent
to $5.53 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and was at
$5.5375 at 12:04 p.m. Singapore time. Soybeans for July fell 0.7
percent to $15.2175 a bushel.  About 91 percent of the corn crop was  planted  as of June 2,
up from 86 percent a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said in a report yesterday. The nation will  harvest 
a record 359.2 million metric tons, the USDA said May 10.  “When we see an improvement in the planting progress,
prices do come down,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte., said from Singapore. “If the crop didn’t get planted soon
enough, we would have expected a reduction in acreage.”  Wheat for July delivery lost 0.9 percent to $7.025 a bushel
in Chicago. Prices of U.S. wheat may fall should more countries
delay or cancel purchases after an unauthorized, genetically
modified strain was found in Oregon, Abdolreza Abbassian, a
senior economist at the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization, said in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
