Traveling light is almost impossible when you have a gaggle of children in tow. But packing smart certainly isn’t—especially if you have help from  Condé Nast Traveler ’s fashion editors. We asked  CNT  moms and dads for their packing conundrums and tapped our style team to find fixes that are easy to tote on any warm-weather vacation. 1. The Need:  "A sun hat that doesn't hinder my ability to see what my daughter is up to. Bonus if my husband can borrow it." – Nelida Mortensen, Photo Research Editor    The Solution:  The classic unisex  Eric Javits Panama  hat protects your face—without preventing you from watching the family. When packing, stuff the crown with tees and pack pants around the brim ($240). 2.  The Need:  "How about compact sunglasses that I can slip into my pocket before they're lost or broken by an unruly child? They should look good, too." – Eimear Lynch, Word of Mouth Editor    The Solution :  The new foldable frames by  Oliver Peoples for Porter  bend three times to fit in a pocket or clutch. And the bold, retro-cool acetate frames are unisex ($595). 3.  The Need :  "I might buy ten bottles of water during a day with my wife and two kids. I'd love to waste less with light, reusable water bottles with non-spill tops." – Peter Stevenson, Features Editor    The Solution :  Bobble bottles  are BPA-free and filter impurities from drinking-fountain water, so you can refill anywhere. And each kid gets his or her own cap color (from $9). 4.  The Need :  "My three-year-old requires so much stuff—I'd love a towel that doubles as a beach blanket and doesn't have to be crammed into our beach bag." – Jocelyn Miller, Picture Editor    The Solution :  Big enough for everyone to sit on and shaped like an animal pelt,  Maslin & Co 's Jaguar Hide Beach Towel comes with a holster and cross-body strap for easy carrying ($260). 5.  The Need :  "My three boys run fast—in opposite directions. I'd like sandals with traction, comfort, and enough style for dinner out." – Lisa Gill, Contributing Editor    The Solution :  Made of leather that withstands sun and sand,  Tod 's Perforated Leather Sandals are slim (so easily packable); the ankle strap keeps them on your feet; and they're dressy enough for evening ($665).
