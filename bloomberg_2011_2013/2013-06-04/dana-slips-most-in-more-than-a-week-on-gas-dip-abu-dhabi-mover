Dana Gas PJSC (DANA)  fell the most in more
than a week on speculation a slide in natural gas futures could
hurt full-year profit for the United Arab Emirates energy
company.  The shares declined 1.6 percent, the most since May 26, to
60 fils at the close in Abu Dhabi. The stock was the second-most
active on the benchmark  ADX General Index (ADSMI) , with 45.6 million
shares traded, or 2.9 times the three-month daily average
volume. Abu Dhabi’s gauge dropped 0.5 percent.  Natural gas for July delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent
before trading 0.1 percent higher at 3.994 per million British
thermal units in  New York . Dana Gas, the U.A.E.-based fuel
producer which primarily operates in  Egypt  and Iraq’s Kurdish
region, may report a 30  percent increase  in 2013 profit to 787
million dirhams ($214 million), according to the median estimate
of three analysts on Bloomberg.  “Natural gas futures are showing weakness recently and
might indicate less-impressive earnings for the company toward
the end of the year,” said Tariq Qaqish, head of asset
management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital PSC. The drop is also
“associated to investors’ profit-taking,” he said.  Dana’s shares gained 20 percent last month and the stock’s
14-day  relative strength index  rose to 66.7 yesterday. A reading
of 70 signals to some analysts that a security or index is
poised to decline. The measure fell to 61.5 today. Four analysts
 recommend  investors buy the stock and three advise holding the
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares climbed 33 percent this year, trailing a 36
percent increase for  Abu Dhabi ’s index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
