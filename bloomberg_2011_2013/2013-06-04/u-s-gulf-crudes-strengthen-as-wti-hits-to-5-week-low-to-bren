Crude oil produced in the U.S. Gulf
of  Mexico  strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as the
domestic benchmark weakened to a five-week low versus Brent.  WTI’s discount widened to $9.93 a barrel, the most based on
settlement prices since April 26, and reached $10.05 in intraday
trading. The discount strengthened to $7.65 on May 13. When WTI
loses ground to Brent, it typically raises the value of U.S.
grades that compete for space in Gulf Coast refineries with
foreign crudes priced against the international benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet gained 55 cents to $9.30 a barrel
over WTI at 3:39 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 80
cents to $9.40 a barrel.  Mars Blend gained 45 cents to $4.80 a barrel over WTI,
while Poseidon rose 15 cents to a $4.25 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars and Poseidon, increased by 30 cents to $7.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook,  Minnesota ,
strengthened 50 cents a barrel to a $4.50-a-barrel discount to
WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
