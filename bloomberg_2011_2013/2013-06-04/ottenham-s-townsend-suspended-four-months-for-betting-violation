Tottenham midfielder Andros Townsend
was suspended four months and fined 18,000 pounds ($27,500) for
breaking rules on gambling, English soccer’s governing body said
today.  The 21-year-old’s suspension will be backdated to May 23,
when he withdrew from  England ’s under-21 squad, and three months
of the punishment is suspended unless he breaks the gambling
rules again before July 2016, the Football Association said
today on its website.  Townsend played this season with Queens Park Rangers, and
has also played on loan at Birmingham and Leeds. He joined Spurs
in 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
