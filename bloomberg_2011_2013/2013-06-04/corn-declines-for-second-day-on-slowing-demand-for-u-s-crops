Corn for delivery after the Midwest
harvest fell for the second straight day on speculation that
Chinese demand for U.S. grain will shift to cheaper suppliers.  COFCO Corp.,  China ’s largest grain trader, bought the
nation’s first cargo of Argentine corn since the two countries
signed an import agreement in February 2012, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the deal. Ukraine was also
approved as a supplier in November.  World corn  production  may rise 13 percent to a record 965.8
million metric tons, the biggest annual increase since 2005, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said May 10. From 2007 to 2011,
U.S. farmers produced 38 percent of the global crop, down from
an average of 44 percent from 1968 to 1972 as rising prices
boosted global production, Ohio State University said in a
report May 31. U.S. exports in the marketing year that ends
Sept. 30 will fall to a 41-year low, the USDA said.  “Argentina shipping corn to China reflects the declining
U.S. market share,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “There are cheaper corn supplies available around
the world that will reduce demand for U.S. exports.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
$5.5425 a bushel at 10:13 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after dropping 1.3 percent yesterday. Earlier, the contract
touched $5.4675, the lowest since May 28.  Premiums Cut  Exporters at terminals near New Orleans yesterday cut
 premiums  paid for immediately delivery of the grain for export
12 percent to 93 cents over July futures, the lowest since May
15, after farmers increased sales last week, Grow said.  About 63 percent of the  corn  crop was rated in good or
excellent conditions as of June 2, the USDA said yesterday.
That’s about 3 percent below the 10-year average for the date
and a sign that crops seeded during rainy weather in the past
three weeks are benefiting from the  improvement  in soil
moisture, Grow said. Farmers  planted  91 percent of the crop as
of this week up from 86 percent a week earlier, the agency
reported.  “Crop conditions are a little better than some suspected
and could improve with the forecasts for warmer temperatures
next week,” Grow said.  The USDA estimated May 10 that the corn harvest will rise
to a record 359.2 million tons this year as farmers plant the
most acres since 1936 and fields recover from last year’s
drought.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $77.4 billion in
2012, followed by soybeans at $43.2 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
