B.P. Marsh & Partners Plc, the U.K.
private-equity firm with investments ranging from  risk
assessment  to financial advising, rose for a record sixth
consecutive day as investors await a potential payback from the
sale of an insurance stake.  B.P. Marsh didn’t address dividend plans in an earnings
report today, meaning a special payment based on the planned
sale of 80 percent of its stake in Hyperion Insurance Group Ltd.
to private-equity firm General Atlantic may be possible, Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said in a note.  The  shares  rose as much as 1.6 percent to 131 pence, the
highest intraday price since Oct. 2007, and were up 0.8 percent
at 11:44 a.m. in  London . B.P. Marsh has gained 5.7 percent since
the stock began rising on May 28, the longest winning streak
since the company’s 2006 listing.  B.P. Marsh (BPM)  is an early-stage minority investor in financial
businesses, particularly insurance, that was founded in 1990 by
majority holder Brian Marsh. Profit rose 56 percent to 5.7
million pounds ($8.7 million) in the year ended Jan. 31, the
London-based company said today.  The venture capital provider said yesterday that Besso
Insurance Group Ltd., in which it owns 36.5 percent, bought
Istanbul-based aviation broker HSB. B.P. Marsh is also “in the
final stages of completing a new investment,” it said today.  “The uncertainty over what will happen to the Hyperion
proceeds and a flagged new investment” prompted Cornes to
maintain a hold recommendation on shares, with a price target of
130 pence. The stock has risen 12 percent this year compared
with a 10 percent advance in the 83-company FTSE AIM Financial
Services Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
