Dollar General  Corp. declined the
most in two years after reducing the top end of its full-year
earnings forecast, citing “moderating” sales growth.  The shares  fell  9.2 percent to $48.64 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since June 2011. Dollar General has
advanced 10 percent this year compared to a 14 percent gain for
the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index.  “We have updated our outlook for the year to reflect
moderating sales growth and a lower expected gross profit rate
than we previously anticipated,” Chief Executive Officer  Rick Dreiling  said in a statement today.  Full-year adjusted earnings per share will be as much as
$3.22, decreased from a previous forecast of a maximum of $3.30,
the Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company said in the
statement. Analysts projected $3.28, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
