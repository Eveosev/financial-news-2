The House panel that approves defense
funding has produced a draft budget that bankrolls all 29 F-35
jets that the Pentagon requested for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.  The approval for the fighters made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) 
is the highest-profile action on weapons systems in the proposal
released today by the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
The panel is scheduled to adopt the  funding proposal  tomorrow.
The full appropriations committee hasn’t yet scheduled a meeting
to act on the measure.  The F-35 is the Pentagon’s most expensive program, with a
fleet of 2,443 planes projected to cost $391.2 billion, a 68
percent increase since the Pentagon signed its initial contract
with Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed in 2001.  The House panel’s draft bill approves $512.5 billion in
non-war  spending  under its jurisdiction, which doesn’t include
military construction and Department of Energy nuclear funding.
The proposed bill includes $85.8 billion in war spending,
primarily in  Afghanistan , or $6.4 billion more than the
Pentagon’s request.  The draft legislation includes $129.6 billion to provide
pay for 1.3 million active-duty troops and 833,700 reserves,
fully funding a 1.8 percent pay raise, instead of the 1 percent
the Pentagon requested.  The draft legislation provides $98.4 billion, or $750
million less than requested, for equipment procurement and
upgrades.  The bill includes $15 billion to procure eight Navy ships,
including fully funding two SSN-774 attack submarines made by
 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII)  and  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)   A
congressional aide who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly said
the $15 billion also includes money to buy an additional four
Littoral Combat Ships, two each from Lockheed Martin and  Austal
Ltd. (ASB)   United Technologies  The draft proposal includes $2.2 billion to buy 73 UH-60
and 37 MH-60S/R helicopters made by  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s
Sikorsky Aircraft unit and $1.9 billion for 21 Boeing Co. EA-18G
Growler electronic warfare aircraft.  The draft bill also includes $220 million for  Israel ’s Iron
Dome anti-rocket program. For the first time, the Pentagon
included money for the system in its annual budget request
instead of adding it months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
