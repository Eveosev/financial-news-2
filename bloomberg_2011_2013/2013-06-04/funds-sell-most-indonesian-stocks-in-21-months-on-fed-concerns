Overseas funds sold the most
Indonesian stocks in 21 months yesterday as concerns the U.S.
Federal Reserve will scale back monetary stimulus.  Foreign institutional investors  sold  a net $171.2 million
of Indonesian equities yesterday, the biggest outflow since
August 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Jakarta Composite Index fell for a fourth day today, dropping
0.5 percent to the lowest in a month. The gauge’s 15-day
historical  volatility  rose to 19.6 today, the highest level in a
year. The rupiah fell 1.8 percent last month through May 29 to
9,905 per dollar, the weakest level since September 2009.  Jakarta Composite Index has  surged  15 percent this year,
driving valuations to 16.8 times projected 12-month earnings on
May 23, the highest since December 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign investors poured a net $2.57
billion into the nation’s stocks this year through May 22, a
record for the period, as monetary stimulus by central banks
from the U.S. to  Europe  and  Japan  stoked demand for emerging-market assets. They’ve sold a net $759.1 million since.  “Losses are being driven by the market expectation that
the Federal Reserves is likely to scale back quantitative
easing,” Wilianto Ie, head of research at PT Nomura  Indonesia ,
said by phone today. “The Asean market has been the beneficiary
of the global liquidity flow and has been performing very well,
so it is prone to profit-taking.”  Indonesian stock markets declined the most in a year
yesterday, while the currency weakened 0.1 percent, after data
showed the nation’s trade deficit rose to a near record in April
as exports dropped amid declining commodity prices.  “The April trade balance number makes the situation
worse,” Nomura’s Ie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
