R.J. Reynolds  Tobacco Co. was ordered
to pay Vermont $8.3 million by a state-court judge who ruled
that the company violated consumer-protection laws by stating
that its Eclipse cigarette brand reduced health risks.  Vermont Superior Court Judge Dennis Pearson said the
company violated a settlement agreement and a 1998 consent
decree from the court, according to a filing dated yesterday.  Pearson issued an injunction barring Reynolds from making
“risk reduction” claims for tobacco products without
“supporting studies that have been accepted by the scientific
community.”  “This decision is a multimillion-dollar wakeup call for
Reynolds and other  tobacco companies ,” Vermont Attorney General
William Sorrell said in a statement today. “If you make
unsubstantiated health claims about your deadly products, you
will pay dearly.”  Bryan Hatchell, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, didn’t
immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the
ruling.  R.J. Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is a
unit of  Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) , the second-largest U.S. tobacco
company.  The case is State of Vermont v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
s1087-05CnC, Vermont Superior Court, Chittenden Unit
(Burlington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
