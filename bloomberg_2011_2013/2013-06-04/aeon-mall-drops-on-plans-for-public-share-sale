Aeon Mall Co. (8905) , the shopping center
developer controlled by  Japan ’s largest general retailer, fell
the most in more than two years after saying it would raise as
much as 67.9 billion yen ($682 million) in a public share sale.  The stock fell as much as 14 percent to 2,200 yen, headed
for the biggest drop since March 2011, before trading at 2,485
yen at 10:46 a.m. in Tokyo today. Aeon dropped 1 percent. The
Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3 percent.  The company will use proceeds from selling the shares in
Japan and overseas markets to invest in new stores, it said
yesterday in a filing with Japan’s Finance Ministry. Aeon Co.,
Japan’s largest general retailer, has a stake of about 56
percent in the smaller company, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Aeon Mall will offer as many as 26 million shares, it said
in a  statement  to the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange yesterday. Its shares
have gained more than 65 percent over the last 12 months.  The company may price the share sale as early as June 12
and will split its shares at a ratio of 1.1-for-1 effective Aug.
