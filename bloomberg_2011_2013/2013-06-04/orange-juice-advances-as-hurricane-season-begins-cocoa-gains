Orange-juice  futures climbed on bets
that severe weather will threaten already shrinking supplies in
 Florida , the world’s second-largest citrus grower. Cocoa also
rose, while coffee and sugar slid. Cotton was little changed.  A weak, low-pressure system drifting northeast through the
 Gulf of Mexico  has a “medium chance” of becoming a tropical
storm, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said today in an
 advisory . In the 12 months started Oct. 1, Florida will produce
138 million boxes of oranges, down 5.9 percent from a year
earlier, the government forecasts. The Hurricane season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30.  “Any tropical storm that may threaten the groves in
Florida is bullish,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity
Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in an e-mail.  Orange juice for July delivery advanced 1.2 percent to
$1.524 a pound at 11:15 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. On
May 30, the commodity reached $1.5575, the highest since April
2012.  Also in New York, cocoa futures for July delivery climbed
1.4 percent to $2,277 a metric ton, after touching $2,282, the
highest since May 23.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery slid 0.2 percent to
16.4 cents a pound. Earlier, the sweetener reached 16.37 cents,
the lowest since July 2010.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery declined 1.2
percent to $1.275 a pound.  Cotton futures for July delivery slid 0.1 percent to 82.31
cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
