Russia  stocks climbed after falling
to a six-week low yesterday as the nation’s biggest lenders
advanced after a Federal Reserve official said the U.S. central
bank is committed to record stimulus measures.  The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 1.2 percent to
1,352.81 by 10:57 a.m. in Moscow. The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 1.4 percent
to 1,337.94. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, jumped 1.6
percent to 100.27 rubles, the first gain in five days. VTB Group
increased 2.9 percent to 4.81 kopeks.  The RTS Index plunged as much as 20 percent from this
year’s high yesterday as manufacturing conditions in Russia
deteriorated in May and Chinese manufacturing indexes showed
small businesses struggling, damping the economy of the world’s
second-biggest oil user.  Financial stocks  added 1.7 percent on
average as the Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart 
said recent data suggest the economy isn’t strong enough to
justify a reduction in the central bank’s bond-buying program.  “Positive news from the U.S. is supporting our market and
bank shares today,” Natalia Berezina, an analyst at UralSib
Capital, said by phone from Moscow. “After a stretch of
declines, banks are bouncing back.”  ‘Big Fall’  Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of 9 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 2.5 percent forecast
a month earlier.  The nation’s economy grew at the weakest pace since 2009 in
the first quarter as the euro area’s longest recession hurt
demand for commodity exports, federal data showed on May 17.
Russia’s central bank kept its  main interest rates  on hold for
an eighth month in May.  “We took quite a big fall yesterday, now we’re seeing a
correction, we could rise as much as 5 percent,” Sergey Kucherenko, who manages about $50 million in Russian equities at
Nomos Bank in Moscow, said by phone. “There are persisting
concerns that the commodity growth cycle is over.”  Crude oil dropped 0.3 percent to $93.22 in  New York  after
the biggest gain in a month.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank could reduce the pace of its asset purchases if
officials see signs of sustained improvement in growth. The Fed
buys $85 billion of debt a month to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on  interest rates .  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 64 percent
above the gauge’s 30-day average, while 10-day price swings
subsided to 26.56.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has dropped 8.1
percent this year, compared with a 10.2 multiple for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has retreated 4.8 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index decreased 3.5 percent to
26.62. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. added 0.5 percent to 88.06
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
