The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
board will vote on rules defining whether a non-bank company is
engaged in financial activity to an extent that would subject it
to the agency’s liquidation in the event of its failure.  The definition, if approved today, would echo a Federal
Reserve rule adopted in April. The Dodd-Frank Act required the
agencies to define the threshold for firms covered by the FDIC’s
authority to take apart systemically risky non-bank firms when
they fail and the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s
authority to decide such a firm warrants additional oversight.  The FDIC’s initial proposal in March 2011 detailed how
regulators may determine the threshold for companies falling
within the agency’s authority, which Dodd-Frank outlined as
firms with more than 85 percent of their revenue or assets
linked to finance. The proposal was written to parallel the Fed
definition -- effective last month -- of non-bank firms that
could be evaluated for potential risks to the financial system.  The oversight council, established by Dodd-Frank, met
yesterday to label some non-bank companies as systemically
important, a move that puts them under heightened Fed
supervision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
