Gleacher & Co., the brokerage that’s
closing its businesses after failing to sell itself, named
Christopher J. Kearns chief restructuring officer and chief
executive officer.  Kearns, 56, is a co-founder of Capstone Advisory Group LLC,
which Gleacher hired to help with its restructuring, the New
York-based firm said today in a statement. Gleacher also said it
is shutting its investment-banking business immediately,
affecting about 20 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
