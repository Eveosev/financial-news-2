Authorities opened an investigation
into the former vice governor of a central Chinese province, as
President Xi Jinping oversees a campaign to root out graft in
the country.  The official, named Ni Fake, is accused of “serious
discipline violations,” the  Ministry of Supervision  said in the
one-sentence statement on its website today. Born in 1954, Ni
was deputy party secretary of the city of Wuhu before moving to
Lu’An city where he later become party secretary, according to
an  official biography . He was named Anhui deputy vice-governor
in 2008.  China has sent inspection teams to oversee local
authorities as part of its anti-corruption campaign, the
official Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.  Xi, appointed the ruling Communist Party’s general
secretary in November, pledged in January to weed out corrupt
high-level officials, dubbed “tigers,” as well as lower-level
individuals he called “flies.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
