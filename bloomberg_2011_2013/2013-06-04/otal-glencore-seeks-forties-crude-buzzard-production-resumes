Total SA (FP)  and Glencore Xstrata Plc
failed to buy North Sea Forties crude at lower differentials
than yesterday. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals
blend in  Europe  for a second day.  The Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea resumed production
overnight, Karen Fordyce, a spokeswoman for Nexen Inc., said
today in an e-mailed statement.  North Sea  Total failed to buy Forties for June 18 to June 24 at 5
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while Glencore was unable
to buy the grade for June 20 to June 26 at a discount of 10
cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with
yesterday’s trade at parity to the benchmark.  Trafigura Beheer BV didn’t manage to sell cargo F0614 for
June 18 to June 20 at 5 cents more than Dated Brent, while BP
Plc sought to sell shipment F0618 for June 24 to June 26 at a
premium of 15 cents without success, according to the survey.  Eni SpA withdrew its bid for Forties for June 23 to June 25
at a discount of 25 cents, the survey showed.  Production at the 200,000 barrel-a-day Buzzard field, the
largest contributor to Forties, is expected to “return to
normal levels by mid-week,” Fordyce said. The facility was shut
last weekend because of equipment failure.  Statoil ASA failed to sell Oseberg lot 20130605 for June 21
to June 23 or consignment 20130606 for June 26 to June 28 at
$1.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to the survey.
The second cargo was advanced by one day, said four people with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  BP failed to sell Ekofisk cargo C11386 for June 28 to June
30 at $1.05 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Trafigura didn’t manage to sell Ekofisk shipment C11387 for
June 24 to June 26 at a premium of $1.10 to Dated Brent,
according to the survey. This cargo was deferred for a second
time by 10 days, the people said.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose by 17 cents to a premium of 5 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
was the highest since May 20.  Brent for July settlement traded at $102.27 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $101.93 in the previous session. The August contract was at
$101.98 at the same time today, a discount of 29 cents to July.  North Sea  loading programs will be issued later this week,
with Forties due June 6, according to people with knowledge of
the matter.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 2 cents to a discount of
41 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was 3 cents a barrel
to the benchmark, versus a 5-cent discount yesterday. That’s the
smallest discount since Aug. 16.  PT Pertamina bought 3.75 million barrels of crude for
August delivery to its Balikpapan and Cilacap refineries, said a
company official who asked not to be identified because the
transactions are confidential.  The company bought two cargoes of 950,000 barrels each of
Azeri Light, 600,000 barrels of  Brunei ’s Champion, 650,000
barrels of  Libya ’s Sharara, and 600,000 barrels of  Algeria ’s
Saharan Blend, the official said.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $2.20 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
