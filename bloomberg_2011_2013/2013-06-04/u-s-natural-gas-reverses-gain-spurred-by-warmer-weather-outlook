Natural gas futures rose in New York
on speculation that above-normal temperatures in the southern
U.S. will boost demand from  power plants  to run air
conditioners.  Futures advanced for a second day as Texas and the south-central U.S. will turn hotter through June 18, according to a
note to clients from MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland .  Dallas  will reach 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius)
on July 13, 6 degrees higher than normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Demand will be tempered in the Northeast, as
temperatures in  New York  will be below normal through June 12.  “The 11- to 15-day forecast is now showing the heat begin
to build in Texas,” said Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “After last
week’s selloff, this news might lift prices above $4.”  Natural gas for July delivery advanced 0.7 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $3.998 per million British thermal units
at on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading was 48 percent
below the 100-day average at 2:49 p.m.  Futures have gained 20 percent this year as a colder-than-normal March eliminated a supply glut that had persisted since
September 2011. Inventories expanded by 88 billion cubic feet to
2.141 trillion in the week ended May 24, the Energy Information
Administration reported last week. A storage  deficit  to the
five-year average was unchanged at 3.9 percent.  The EIA may report on June 6 that supplies increased by 99
billion cubic feet in the seven days ended May 31, according to
the median of seven analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average gain for the week is 92 billion.  Power Plants  Hot weather boosts power demand and reduces the amount of
fuel put in storage. Power generation accounts for 32 percent of
U.S. gas consumption, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “ Texas  consumes the most natural gas for generating
electricity, averaging 18 percent of all gas used for U.S.
electricity generation over the past three years,” Viswanath
said.  Supplies have reached records in each of the past four
years as production from shale formations including the
Marcellus in the Northeast pushed output to an all-time high.
Inventories will rise to 3.796 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 134 billion less than the same time last year,
the EIA said in its May 7  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Gas Output  Production will rise to 69.9 billion cubic feet a day this
year and to 70.1 billion next year, according to the EIA.  “We’re really being pushed back and forth by the
weather,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker with
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re seeing really
big production in the U.S., and if we don’t match that with
seasonal demand, we’re going to come under pressure.”  Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
have boosted U.S. oil and gas output and cut the country’s
reliance on foreign fuels. The U.S. met 88 percent of its own
energy needs in February, the highest monthly rate since 1985,
EIA data show.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July was 28.40 percent at 3:15 p.m. in New York, compared with
29.18 percent yesterday.  July $3.90 puts were the most-active options in electronic
trading, slipping 0.8 cent to 6.4 cents on volume of 1,191 as of
3:19 p.m. July $4.50 calls, the next-most active, were unchanged
at 0.9 cent on volume of 871. Puts accounted for 58 percent of
options volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
