Peru ’s sol gained the most in a month
as demand for emerging-market assets increased after a Federal
Reserve official supported a stimulus program.  The sol appreciated 0.7 percent to 2.7060 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, the most since May 3, according to prices from
Datatec.  Recent data suggest the U.S. economy isn’t strong enough to
justify a reduction in bond buying, Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said yesterday. The sol fell
to 2.7360 on May 31, its lowest since October 2011, on
speculation the Fed will reduce purchases that have buoyed
emerging market assets.  “Sensitivity to U.S. economic data is at its strongest,”
said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at Banco Santander SA’s
local unit. Local and foreign dollar supply and banks’ large
holdings spurred the sol gains, he said.  President Ollanta Humala held the first of a series of
meetings with business leaders to discuss government measures to
accelerate investment projects, according to an e-mailed
statement from his office.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark sol bond due in August 2020
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.75
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.32 centimo to 118.52 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
