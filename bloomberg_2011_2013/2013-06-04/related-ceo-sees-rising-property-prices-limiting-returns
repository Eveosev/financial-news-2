Investor demand for top buildings in
major U.S. markets is driving property prices so high that
returns may be limited, said Jeff Blau, chief executive officer
of Related Cos.  Buying at low capitalization rates, a measure of investment
yield that is net operating income divided by purchase price,
may make exiting investments “hairy” and refinancing a
challenge, Blau said today at the  Bloomberg Link Hedge Funds
Summit  in  New York . In markets such as  Manhattan , there is
“tremendous” demand for high-quality real estate, he said.  “With  interest rates  low and everybody chasing yield,
you’re driving asset prices up,” said Blau, whose New York-based company is the developer of Manhattan’s Time Warner Center
and Hudson Yards project. “When you start buying at 3 and 4 cap
rates, where are you going to go from there?”  Demand for top-quality buildings helped commercial real
estate prices rise in April above an August 2007 record,
according to Green Street Advisors Inc., a  Newport Beach ,
California-based research firm that measures values based on
property appraisals. Another gauge, the Moody’s/Real Capital
Analytics Commercial Property Price Index, regained 51 percent
of its peak-to-trough losses as of March, the latest available
data. That measure is based on repeat-sales transactions.  The resurgence in the market for commercial-mortgage backed
securities is helping to fuel demand, Blau said.  “For stabilized assets, the CMBS market is wide open and
as frothy as it’s ever been,” he said. “There’s no liquidity
problem. It’s a very, very competitive market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
