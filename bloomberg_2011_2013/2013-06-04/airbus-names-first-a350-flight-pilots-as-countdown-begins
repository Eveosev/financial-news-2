Airbus SAS (EAD)  has nominated the pilots
and engineers who will conduct the first test flight of the new
A350, signaling the countdown to the wide-body aircraft’s maiden
voyage may be just a matter of days.  The first flight will have a crew of six, including two
test pilots and a project test-flight engineer who will sit in
the cockpit, Airbus said. Three additional flight test crew
members, all experimental flight test engineers, will work at
dedicated stations on the plane to manage the flight’s progress.  The first take-off will mark the beginning of more than
nine months of testing, in which pilots put the aircraft through
increasingly complex maneuvers to ensure its airworthiness and
safety. The first plane doesn’t carry passengers, and is stuffed
with computers and equipment to record performance data.  A first flight in coming weeks would be a public-relations
coup for Airbus ahead of the  Paris Air Show , the year’s biggest
aviation expo, which starts June 17. While the organizers
haven’t confirmed the plane’s appearance at the event, Airbus
may choose a so-called “fly-by” if civil aviation authorities
give it clearance.  Airbus has routinely said the maiden flight is set for the
middle of the year, without committing to a specific date.  Tom Enders , the chief executive officer of Airbus parent European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., told shareholders at the annual
general meeting on May 29 that he was “quite confident” about
a flight in coming weeks.  The long-range A350 is designed to take on both  Boeing
Co. (BA) ’s twin-engine wide-body models, with the 300-seat A350-900 -
- the first to fly -- and the smaller A350-800 competing with
the 787 Dreamliner and the 777-200. The A350-1000, seating 350,
is a challenger to the 777-300ER and new 777X. The mid-sized
A350 version costs $287.7 million at list price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
