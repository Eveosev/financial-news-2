Gasoline futures were little changed
along with Brent crude in early trading. Crack spreads widened.  Futures swung between gains and losses as Brent failed to
build on yesterday’s 1.7 percent gain after the Buzzard oil
field in the North Sea resumed production. The U.S. National
 Hurricane Center  said the low-pressure system has a medium
chance of becoming a subtropical or tropical cyclone.  “The return of the Buzzard field should put some downward
pressure on the market,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst
at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The possibility of a storm
in the Gulf is keeping the market from seeing more downward
pressure.”  Gasoline for July delivery gained 0.35 cent to $2.7886 a
gallon at 10:04 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange after
trading between $2.78 and $2.8035. Trading volume for all
contracts was 27 percent below the 100-day average for the time
of day.  Brent crude for July settlement fell 12 cents to $101.94 a
barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange.  July gasoline’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
gained 73 cents to $24.25 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  over
Brent rose 27 cents to $15.18.  Nexen Inc. said Buzzard production resumed last night and
should return to normal levels by mid-week. Buzzard has a
capacity of 200,000 barrels a day and is the largest contributor
to Forties, the grade that typically sets the Dated Brent
benchmark.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery rose 0.05 cent to
$2.8339 a gallon on trading volume that was 13 percent above the
100-day average.  The July ULSD contract’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude oil widened 53 cents to $26.08 a barrel,
while the  premium over Brent  gained 18 cents to $17.12 a barrel.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.619 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
are 3.4 cents above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
