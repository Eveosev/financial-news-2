The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  advanced a second day as
phone company Oi SA surged the most since 2008 after naming a
new chief executive officer and industrial stocks rose after
 Brazil ’s production expanded more than forecast.  Marfrig Alimentos SA gained following a report by newspaper
 Valor Economico  that BRF SA may consider buying the Asian
operations of the meatpacker’s Keystone Foods, if its put up for
sale. Oi contributed the most to the bechmark’s advance after
Zeinal Bava was named as CEO.  The Ibovespa gained 0.1 percent to 54,002.86 at 12:08 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . The real fell 0.3 percent to 2.1308 per dollar,
reversing an earlier gain. Brazil’s industrial production grew
1.8 percent in April from the previous month, the national
statistics agency reported today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 1 percent expansion.  “The industrial production numbers were better than
expected, and that brings some comfort,” said Otavio Vieira, a
partner at the Rio de Janeiro-based hedge fund Fides Asset
Management. “We’ve had a strong and fast drop in stocks, so
there could be some improvement.”  Oi’s voting shares jumped 16 percent to 5.33 reais, the
biggest intraday surge since April 2008. Marfrig gained 0.7
percent to 7.80 reais.  The MSCI Brazil/Industrials Index climbed 1.2 percent, the
biggest one-day advance since May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
