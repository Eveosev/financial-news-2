Following are comments from Andreas Sohmen-Pao, chief executive officer of BW Group Ltd., on the
effect of slumping charter rates for ships stemming from a glut
of vessels. He spoke at the Nor-Shipping conference in Oslo
today.  “Another problem with overcapacity is it forces people to
cut corners and the risk of incidents goes up. We’ve seen this
time and again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
