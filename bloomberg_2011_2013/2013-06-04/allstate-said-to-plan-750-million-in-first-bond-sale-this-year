Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, sold $1 billion of bonds in
its first offering in about 17 months.  The company issued $500 million each of 3.15 percent, 10-year debt to yield 102 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and 4.5 percent, 30-year notes to pay a relative
yield of 122 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The debt, which may be rated A3 by Moodyâ€™s Investors
Service, was increased from $750 million marketed earlier today,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who asked
not to be identified because the terms are private.  Proceeds will be used to fund a tender offer and for
general corporate purposes, the Northbrook, Illinois-based
company said today in a filing.  Allstate last sold debt in January 2012, issuing $500
million of 5.2 percent, 30-year debentures to yield 225 basis
points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The securities
traded at 116.3 cents on the dollar to yield 4.21 percent on May
28, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
