The pound was little changed against
the dollar and euro before a report that economists said will
show U.K. construction shrank for a seventh month in May.  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers in
 construction  industries rose to 49.8 from 49.4 in April, Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
will say today, according to the median of 14 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.6 billion
pounds ($2.45 billion) of inflation-linked gilts due in 2024.  The pound traded at $1.5304 at 7:48 a.m. London time after
rising to $1.5376 yesterday, the most since May 13. Sterling was
at 85.34 pence per euro.  Separate data showed a gauge of U.K.  retail sales  rose in
May. Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
increased 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the  British Retail
Consortium  and KPMG said in an e-mailed report.  The pound has fallen 2.4 percent this year, the worst
performer after the yen and Australian dollar among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. currency gained 4.4 percent and the
euro strengthened 3.2 percent.  U.K. gilts lost 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to the  Bloomberg British Sovereign Bond Index. (BRIT)  German
bonds dropped 0.8 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 0.9
percent, separate indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
