Drought affected some grain crops in
 Russia ’s Southern and North Caucasus federal districts in May,
the state weather center  said  on its website today.  There was 10 millimeters (0.4 inch) or less moisture in the
top soil layer in some parts of Volgograd, Rostov, Kalmykia and
Krasnodar regions during May, the weather center said. The four
regions accounted for about 25 percent of the national crop in
2012, according to state statistics data.  “Such dry conditions in these areas affected grain,
resulting in dried leaves and damaging crops’ reproductive
parts,” the center said, without providing an estimate of the
damaged fields’ acreage.  “Intensive air dryness” covered almost all of the
territory of the Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts
in the last 10 days of May, the center said. The two districts
accounted for about 35 percent of the national crop in 2012,
according to state statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
