Copper advanced to near the highest
level in more than a week amid a shutdown at the world’s second-biggest mine and signs of improvement in manufacturing activity
in  China , the biggest consumer.  Metal for three-month delivery climbed as much as 0.6
percent to $7,380.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
at 11:43 a.m. in  Seoul . Prices yesterday touched $7,397.75, the
highest since May 23. Futures for September rose 0.2 percent to
53,090  yuan  ($8,667) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s production in
Indonesia is shut for a government probe into accidents at its
Grasberg mine that may take as long as three months. A tunnel
collapse on May 14 killed 28 people and another worker died on
June 1 from a separate incident. An official purchasing
managers’ index released June 1 in China rose to 50.8 in May
from 50.6 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 50, the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “We remain bullish copper,” said Will Yun, a commodities
analyst at Hyundai Futures Corp. “We’ve recently had some signs
of improvement that can support demand. Still, there are many
others who are skeptical about China’s recovery.”  The suspension at Grasberg, lack of production at Bingham
Canyon in  Utah  and reduced output at Collahuasi in  Chile  are set
to reduce supplies in what is normally a seasonally strong
period for demand, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bank
expects copper at $8,000 in six months.  On the LME, most of the other base metals including
aluminum and zinc declined. Copper for July delivery was little
changed at $3.339 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
