Gold swung between gains and losses
after rising the most in two weeks yesterday as investors
weighed the prospect of the U.S.  Federal Reserve  maintaining
asset purchases. Outflows from investor holdings slowed.  Spot gold traded at $1,407.50 an ounce at 3:01 p.m. in
Singapore, after climbing and dropping at least 0.3 percent.
Prices jumped 1.7 percent yesterday, the most since May 20, as
U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May. Cash silver
declined 0.5 percent to $22.62 an ounce.  Gold fell 16 percent this year after a 12-year bull run as
investors sold the metal from exchange-traded products at a
record pace on speculation the Fed may taper quantitative
easing. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETP, were unchanged for a third day yesterday after
expanding on May 29 for the first time in almost three weeks,
according to data on the company’s website.  “Gold advanced on speculation that the Federal Reserve
will continue to provide monetary stimulus,”  Lachlan Shaw , an
analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in an e-mail.
Commodities were supported “as the dollar weakened after an
unexpected contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector.”  Bullion for August delivery slid 0.3 percent to $1,407.40
an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices rose 1.4 percent
yesterday as the Dollar Index, a gauge against six counterparts,
slumped 0.9 percent after a report showed the  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 49, the lowest reading
since June 2009. This compares with April’s 50.7 and economists’
median estimate for 51.  Platinum slipped 0.4 percent to $1,490.30 an ounce after
surging as much as 3.2 percent yesterday to the highest level
since May 15. A local union official was killed and a second
wounded in a shooting near  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine in  South
Africa , where labor disputes last year disrupted supplies.
Palladium fell 0.2 percent to $756.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
