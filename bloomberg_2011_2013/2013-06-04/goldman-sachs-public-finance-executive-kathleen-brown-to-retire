Kathleen Brown, who helped lead
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s municipal finance business after
serving as  California ’s state treasurer, is retiring after 12
years with the firm.  Brown, 67, was chairman of investment banking for the
Midwest, according to a memo from Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the firm’s co-heads of investment
banking.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, confirmed the memo.  “Kathleen has played an integral role in building the
firm’s public sector and infrastructure franchise,” the memo
reads. “She has developed trusted relationships with many of
the firm’s clients and has led many important transactions.”  Brown ran the firm’s West Coast municipal finance team
until 2010, when she moved to a newly created post in  Chicago 
and helped lead the public finance unit in the Midwest. The move
came in part to avoid any conflict of interest after her brother
Jerry Brown was elected California’s governor.  Brown’s father, Edmund “Pat” Brown Sr., also served as
governor and Brown herself was the 1994 Democratic nominee,
losing to Pete Wilson. She served as treasurer of the state from
1991 to 1995.  Brown worked at  Bank of America Corp.  before joining
Goldman Sachs in 2001 with its private wealth management group,
according to the memo.  Dow Jones Newswires reported Brown’s retirement earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
