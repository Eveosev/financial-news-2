Apple Inc. is in talks to resolve a
lawsuit brought by THX Ltd., the sound-engineering company
founded by “ Star Wars ” producer  George Lucas , alleging
infringement of a patent for speaker technology used in
iPhones, iPads and iMac products.  Lawyers for both companies filed a request with the federal
court in  San Francisco  today to postpone a scheduled June 14
case-management conference to July 26.  “The parties are currently attempting to resolve this
matter outside of this litigation,” according to the filing.  THX holds a 2008 patent for a speaker unit that can boost
sound output and attach to computers or flat-screen televisions,
according to a complaint filed in March.  Apple products that incorporate the speaker units infringe
the patent, causing “monetary damage and irreparable harm,”
according to San Rafael, California-based THX. The company seeks
a court order to stop the alleged infringement and a reasonable
royalty, or damages to compensate for lost profit.  THX on Jan. 29 announced its first mobile application, THX
tune-up, available in Cupertino, California-based Apple’s iTunes
 App Store . The app allows consumers to use an Apple device with
the iOS operating system to adjust the performance of
televisions, projectors and speakers, according to the company’s
statement.  The case is THX Ltd. v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , 13-01161, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
