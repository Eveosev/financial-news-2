Kino Polska SA soared to a record
after UniCredit SpA recommended buying shares of the Polish
television broadcaster on expectations higher advertising
spending on thematic channels will boost earnings.  The  shares  advanced 2.1 percent to 17.76 zloty as of 1:05
p.m. in Warsaw, the highest since the stock started trading in
April 2011. The amount of shares traded was 69 percent of the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  UniCredit rated Warsaw-based Kino Polska as buy and set its
12-month price estimate at 19.6 zloty a share, according to a
research note today. Its business model features “strong
operating cash flow generation and light business capex needs,”
which results in low leverage and supports a stable stream of
future dividends,’’ according to UniCredit.  “The company’s flagship TV channel, Kino Polska, is one of
the top three most watched film stations in  Poland  and it should
benefit from the ongoing increase in advertising spend in the
thematic TV segment,” Lukasz Jakubowski, an analyst at
UniCredit in Warsaw, said in a report today.  Kino Polska, which broadcasts and produces TV channels,
boosted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization 29 percent to 6.28 million zloty ($1.9 million) in
the first quarter from a year earlier, according to a
 presentation  on its website.  Kino Polska shares have  surged  31 percent in 2013, compared
with a 5 percent decline by Warsaw’s WIG20 Index of the
country’s biggest and most liquid stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
