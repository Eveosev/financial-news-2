American Homes 4 Rent, the housing
landlord led by Public Storage founder B. Wayne Hughes, is
seeking to raise as much as $1.25 billion in a U.S. initial
public offering.  The real estate investment trust didn’t disclose the number
of shares or the offering price in a regulatory filing today.
The offering size is a placeholder amount used to calculate
registration fees and may change.  Operators of single-family rental homes are going public,
creating a new real estate asset class in a field once dominated
by small investors. There are 14 million for-lease homes in the
country with an average price of $200,000, valuing the industry
at about $2.8 trillion, according to an April report from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. American Homes 4 Rent, based in Malibu,
 California , plans to use proceeds from the offering to buy and
renovate homes, it said in its filing.  Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the offering. The company
plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
AMH.  Colony American Homes Inc., a single-family rental unit of
Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital LLC, is scheduled to price its IPO
tomorrow, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It filed
plans last month to raise as much as $260 million as a REIT.
Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., a single-family rental company
based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, was the first to go public as a
REIT in December, followed by Scottsdale, Arizona-based American
Residential Properties Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
