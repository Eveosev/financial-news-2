The koruna slid from the strongest
level in almost a month as the Czech Republic’s economy shrank
more than estimated in the first quarter, deepening its longest
recession on record.  The Czech currency depreciated as much as 0.4 percent, the
most on an intraday basis since May 22, and traded 0.3 percent
weaker at 25.777 per euro by 11:36 a.m. in  Prague .  The currency reversed an earlier gain after the statistics
office in Prague said gross domestic product shrank 1.1 percent
in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter.
That was the worst reading in four years and more than the
office’s preliminary estimate for a 0.8 percent contraction.  “The revised data represents a clearly negative impulse
for the koruna,” analysts Jan Bures and Jan Cermak at CSOB AS
in Prague wrote in a report to clients today.  The exchange rate has lost 4.8 percent since Sept. 17, the
day before the central bank first signaled readiness to sell the
koruna in a market intervention should more monetary easing be
required to damp the risk of deflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
