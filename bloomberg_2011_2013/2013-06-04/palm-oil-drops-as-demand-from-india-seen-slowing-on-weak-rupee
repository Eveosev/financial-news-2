Palm oil  fell on speculation that
demand may slow from India, the world’s biggest buyer, and as
Malaysia’s currency advanced the most in almost a month against
the dollar, reducing the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for August delivery dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 2,376 ringgit ($768) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, and ended the morning session at 2,378
ringgit. Palm for  physical  delivery in June was at 2,360 ringgit
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  India’s rupee touched an 11-month low yesterday on concern
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back asset purchases
that have spurred fund flows into  emerging markets . Shipments
from  Malaysia , the second-largest producer, to India dropped 14
percent to 163,650 tons in May from a month earlier, Societe
Generale de Surveillance said on May 31.  “Demand from India is slightly low due to the rupee,”
Vijay Mehta, a director of Commodity Links Pte., said from
Singapore. “The buying momentum is slightly missing.”  The ringgit strengthened today after an unexpected decline
in U.S. manufacturing reduced speculation that the government
will roll back its stimulus. The ringgit gained as much as 0.5
percent to 3.0831 per dollar, the most since May 8, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “When you have a stronger ringgit, this means that exports
will be pricier and this will affect the demand,” said Sim Han Qiang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore.  Soybean oil for July dropped 0.6 percent to 48.37 cents a
pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans fell 0.7
percent to $15.2125 a bushel. Refined palm oil for September
delivery retreated 1.6 percent to 6,096  yuan  ($995) a ton on the
 Dalian Commodity Exchange , while soybean oil lost 1.4 percent to
7,414 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
