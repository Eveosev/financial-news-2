Enterprise Holdings Inc. named Pamela M. Nicholson, the rental-car company’s president, its new chief
executive officer, the first CEO to come from outside the
founding Taylor family.  Nicholson will retain her president title and continue to
oversee day-to-day operations of the company, which operates
Alamo Rent A Car and National Car Rental, Enterprise said in a
statement. She has been chief operating officer for 10 years and
president for five, and at the company for 32 years, according
to the statement.  Nicholson succeeds Andy Taylor, 65, who will hold the title
of executive chairman, the company said. Enterprise was founded
in 1957 by Jack Taylor, Andy’s father. Andy has been CEO since
1991. He entered the family business at 16 and joined the
company full-time in 1973. He said in a January interview that
it wasn’t certain a family member would be the next CEO.  The executive succession is taking place as St. Louis-based
Enterprise moves to expand internationally to sustain growth.
The company has moved into markets including China, Spain and
 France . Enterprise, which is closely held, is the largest
rental-car company by sales.  Enterprise revenue rose from $78 million in 1980 to $6.5
billion in 2002 and $15.4 billion last year. Jack Taylor, 91,
has an estimated net worth of $15.7 billion, according to the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
