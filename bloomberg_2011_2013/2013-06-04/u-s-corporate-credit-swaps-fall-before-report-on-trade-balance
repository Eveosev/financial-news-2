A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell as investors awaited a report on the trade balance.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.9 basis point to a mid-price of 77.8 basis points at 8 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking for signs on the health of the
economy to determine when the Federal Reserve might start to
scale down its debt-purchasing program. The  trade deficit 
probably  widened  to $41.1 billion in April from a three-month
low of $38.8 billion in March, economists forecast before the
Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
