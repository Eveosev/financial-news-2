Spot wholesale electricity prices on
the three main eastern U.S. grids declined for a second day as
demand dropped amid milder weather.  Temperatures will be seasonal to below normal from New
England into the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states over the
next two days, according to WSI Corp. Power prices surged late
last week as the regions saw highs reach the low 90s Fahrenheit
(32 to 34 Celsius).  On-peak electricity for New York City dropped $11.76, or 24
percent, to $38.07 a megawatt-hour at 2:12 p.m. from yesterday
while  Boston  slid $15.50, or 35 percent, to $29.23, data from
the regional grid operators show. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m.  Spot power for PJM Interconnection’s benchmark  Western hub ,
which includes prices from Erie,  Pennsylvania  to  Washington ,
fell $8.28, or 28 percent, to $38.24 a megawatt-hour, according
to the manager of the 13-state grid.  The high in Washington today will be 78 degrees, 3 lower
than the usual reading, while New York may be 1 below normal at
75 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
Pennsylvania.  Demand  on the PJM grid, which stretches from New Jersey
into North Carolina and  Illinois , will peak at 96,348 megawatts
at 4:30 p.m., the grid operator’s website showed. Yesterday’s
peak was 104,562 megawatts at 2:15 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
