Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
concern that rising prices will encourage Brazilian imports of
the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, widened 4.41 cents to
26.62 cents a gallon. Ethanol futures have gained 23 percent
this year, and the U.S.  imported  27,000 barrels a day in the
week ended May 24, according to Energy Information
Administration data. They were the first foreign purchases of
the biofuel since April 19.  Brazil  is the largest supplier to
the U.S.  “The front of the ethanol curve has gathered quite a bit
of strength over the last several weeks,” said Michael Breitenbach, a broker and director of research at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York. “It will be interesting to watch if
this trend is reversed if we begin to see significant imports
arrive from Brazil as we move further into the summer.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 1.1 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.552 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
June contract, which expires tomorrow, lost 3 cents to $2.68.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 3.31 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.8182 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.43 a gallon in the
week ended May 24, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. is made mostly from corn, with one
bushel distilling into about 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.
Production has struggled to rebound to levels before last
summer’s drought wilted crops and raised manufacturing costs.  Corn Futures  Corn for July delivery climbed 4.75 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $6.605 a bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the
cost difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed
to make it, was 15 cents, down from 18 cents yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Production of the biofuel declined 1.4 percent to 863,000
barrels a day in the week ended May 24, 4.3 percent less than a
year earlier, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm,
said. Stockpiles of the fuel sank 0.8 percent to 16 million
barrels, the lowest level since October 2010.  Renewable Identification Numbers, which track compliance
with government fuel-blending mandates, gained.  Corn-based
ethanol RINs for 2013  rose 3 cents to 93 cents at 5:15 p.m.  New
York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, climbed 5 cents to $1.05.  EIA Reports  The EIA is scheduled to release the latest production and
stockpile figures tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The most recent report showed ethanol-blended gasoline made
up about 96 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool in the week
ended May 24, compared with 94 percent the previous week.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged at $2.81 a
gallon in New York, $2.70 in Chicago and $2.765 on the  Gulf
Coast , data compiled by Bloomberg show. West Coast prices sank
2.5 cents to $2.80 a gallon.  New York Harbor’s premium to  Chicago  was unchanged at 11
cents while the Gulf’s discount to the West Coast narrowed 2.5
cents to 3.5 cents, the smallest since May 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
