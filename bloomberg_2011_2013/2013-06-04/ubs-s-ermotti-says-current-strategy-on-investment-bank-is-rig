UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  said he’s confident his strategy of having a “focused”
investment bank is correct.  “It’s the right model to drive the long-term success of
UBS,” Ermotti told investors at a presentation in  New York 
today. He gave examples of successful collaboration between the
investment bank and UBS’s other businesses and said it wouldn’t
be in the interests of shareholders to speed up the reduction of
assets through sales.  Knight Vinke Asset Management LLC, a shareholder based in
New York, said in an open letter before UBS’s annual general
meeting last month that ownership of the investment bank, which
“nearly destroyed UBS” during the financial crisis, could be
transferred to employees and managers, while the job of reducing
investment-bank assets could be contracted out.  The assets UBS is reducing are mainly over-the-counter
derivatives and selling them at “distressed prices” would
destroy capital, Ermotti said.  Ermotti confirmed the target for the investment bank of a
pretax return on equity of more than 15 percent. The bank plans
to expand in businesses it’s chosen to keep, he said.  “There is no demonstration that clients have changed their
view of us” in equities and foreign exchange as a result of the
bank’s decision to shrink in fixed-income trading, Ermotti said.
Instead, “those franchises are now benefiting from being at the
center of attention and getting the resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
