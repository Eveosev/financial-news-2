Gold fell in  London , after climbing
the most in two weeks yesterday, as a gain in equities curbed
demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  Gold jumped 1.7 percent yesterday, the most since May 20,
as U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May at the
fastest pace in four years. The dollar rebounded from a three-week low set yesterday. European equities climbed as Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said recent
data suggest the economy isn’t strong enough to justify a
reduction in the central bank’s bond-buying program.  “A recovery in the stock market is currently a negative
factor for gold,”  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative
Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany , said today by
phone. “Investors have an incentive to shift funds from gold
into equities,” and a rebound in the dollar is also weighing on
bullion, he said.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1,406.90
an ounce by 9:42 a.m. in London. Bullion for August delivery was
0.4 percent lower at $1,406.30 on the Comex in New York. Futures
trading volume was 42 percent below the average in the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gold slid 16 percent this year as equities rose and on
speculation the Fed may scale back quantitative-easing measures
that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run in 2012. Holdings in
 exchange-traded products  fell 3.6 metric tons to 2,144.7 tons
yesterday, the lowest since May 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  U.S. Dollar  The U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge against six currencies, slid
0.9 percent yesterday after a report showed the Institute for
Supply Management’s factory index fell to 49, the lowest reading
since June 2009. The dollar gauge was up 0.2 percent today.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $22.63 an
ounce in London. Palladium was down 0.5 percent at $753.45 an
ounce. Platinum lost 0.3 percent to $1,491.90 an ounce. Prices
reached the highest since May 15 yesterday after a local union
official was killed and a second wounded in a shooting near
 Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine in South Africa, where labor disputes
last year disrupted supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
