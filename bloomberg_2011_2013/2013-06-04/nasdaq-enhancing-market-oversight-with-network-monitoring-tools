Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. will implement
a software package to track trading on its U.S. exchanges and
bolster safeguards and reliability, the exchange operator said
in a statement today.  Nasdaq, the second-largest operator of U.S. equity markets,
said Corvil Ltd.’s CorvilNet monitoring system will let exchange
officials analyze activity at the network, application and
trading levels, helping to spot anomalies. The technology could
also be used to follow the full cycle of a trade.  The Securities and Exchange Commission last week said it
would collect $10 million from Nasdaq to settled charges that
its mishandling of  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s May 2012 initial public
offering was a violation of securities laws. In the year since
the IPO, Nasdaq had created the position of chief information
officer and global market systems and changed many of its
systems.  “We continue to proactively integrate sophisticated
technology solutions as a means to reduce risk exposure in a
constantly evolving electronic marketplace,” said  Eric Noll ,
executive vice president of transaction services for the U.S.
and U.K at Nasdaq. “There is a need for greater visibility to
deal with competitive and regulatory forces that shape
operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
