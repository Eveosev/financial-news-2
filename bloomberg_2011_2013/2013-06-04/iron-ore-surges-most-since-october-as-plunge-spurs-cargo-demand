Iron ore  jumped the most since
October amid speculation that a collapse in prices for the
steelmaking raw material is spurring a surge in demand.  Ore with 62 percent iron content climbed 4.2 percent to
$116.60 a dry metric ton at Tianjin in northeast  China ,
according to prices from The Steel Index Ltd. That’s the biggest
gain since the 6.2 percent increase on Oct. 9.  Stronger demand spurred the rebound, Ben Goggin, a London-based broker of iron-ore swaps at ICAP Plc, said by e-mail
today. Traders began increasing purchases on May 31, when the
price slumped to $110.40 a ton, the lowest in almost seven
months, he said.  “It appears that traders are diving in,” Goggin said by
e-mail today. “It looks like they are making a play based on
the expectation that it dropped to a level and found support.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
