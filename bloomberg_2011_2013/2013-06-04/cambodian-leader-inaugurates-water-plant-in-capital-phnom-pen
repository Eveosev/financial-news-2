Cambodia’s prime minister inaugurated
a $90 million water plant in  Phnom Penh  today to help meet
demand for supplies in the capital, the Xinhua news agency
reported, citing the premier.  Japan and  France  provided about $60 million in loans to
state-owned Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority for the plant,
which can produce 130,000 cubic meters of clean water a day,
Prime Minister Hun Sen was quoted as saying.  About 85 percent of Phnom Penh’s 2.2 million residents have
access to clean water, aided by four water-treatment plants, the
premier said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
