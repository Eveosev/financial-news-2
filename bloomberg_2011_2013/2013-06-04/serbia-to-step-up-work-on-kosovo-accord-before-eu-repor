Serbia  will speed up implementation
of an agreement with Kosovo before a June 18 European Union
report that may help the country get a date to start talks on
joining the 27-nation bloc.  Catherine Ashton , the EU’s foreign-policy chief and
Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule will publish a report on
Serbia’s progress on the accord and issue their recommendation
on June 18, Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  told reporters in
Belgrade today, after meeting with Slovak Foreign Minister
Miroslav Lajcak. Serbia needs to make headway on the EU-brokered
agreement on normalizing ties with Kosovo for a positive
recommendation, Dacic said.  “It’s important that as much as possible is done by that
time of the concrete things that are in the implementation plan,
so that we have a positive decision,” Dacic said. “I really
don’t see when Serbia should get a date to start entry talks if
not now.”  The EU may set a date for the start of entry talks with
Serbia at its June 27-28 summit “without additional
conditions,” Lajcak said.  While the EU probably won’t set a date this month, it will
start preparations to begin talks this year, Blic newspaper
reported yesterday, citing Milan Pajevic, the head of the
Serbian EU Integration Office.  Dacic and his  Kosovo  counterpart, Hashim Thaci, last month
reached the agreement, that paves the way to reconciliation
after years of conflict and tension. The two sides have until
June 15 to work out power sharing in telecommunications and
energy and make progress in clarifying the fate of people
missing since the war that ended in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
