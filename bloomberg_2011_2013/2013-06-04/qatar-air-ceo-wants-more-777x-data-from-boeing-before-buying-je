Qatar Airways Ltd. wants more
information from  Boeing Co. (BA)  on its 777X before placing an order
for the long-haul jet the U.S. planemaker has begun marketing.  “We want more technical details and more clarification,”
said Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of the Persian
Gulf’s second-largest airline. The carrier won’t place an order
at the  Paris Air Show  starting June 17, he said, after signaling
earlier it may announce a deal at the event.  “It is too short a time since the program was launched,”
Al Baker said in an interview at the IATA annual general meeting
in Cape Town today. Qatar’s next 777 order will be for the new
model available from about 2020, Al Baker said. Boeing began
formally marketing the plane last month, as it works on an
update of the 777 featuring new wings and engines.  The Doha-based carrier, an operator of the Boeing 787
Dreamliner, has no plans to buy the largest version, the
787-10X, Al Baker said.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  on May 30 became
the first carrier to sign for the jet, provided the Chicago-based aircraftmaker’s board gives the go ahead to build the
model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
