A surplus of the largest  oil tankers 
in the  Persian Gulf , the world’s biggest crude-loading region,
rose from a six-month low as demand to book the ships weakened,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  There are 13 percent more very large crude carriers
available over the next 30 days than probable cargoes, the
median from four shipbrokers and two owners showed today. That
compares with 12 percent last week, the smallest excess since
Nov. 27. Each of the tankers can hold 2 million barrels of oil.  Charter costs for VLCCs on the benchmark route to  Japan 
from  Saudi Arabia  jumped 19 percent last week, according to the
 Baltic Exchange , a London-based publisher of shipping rates for
commodities, before sliding yesterday. Refineries returned from
maintenance, spurring demand for crude. The exchange will update
costs today around 4 p.m. local time.  “Charterers have stepped back a bit and supply has
risen,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at investment bank
Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, said in an e-mailed report. “We
see a further decline on the cards today.”  The Worldscale system is a way of pricing oil cargoes on
thousands of trade routes. Each individual voyage’s flat rate,
expressed in dollars a metric ton, is set once a year. The
current level of 45.06 industry-standard Worldscale points means
hire costs on the benchmark route are 45.06 percent of the
nominal Worldscale rate for the voyage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
