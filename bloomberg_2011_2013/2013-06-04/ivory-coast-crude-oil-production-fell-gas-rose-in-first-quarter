Production of crude oil in  Ivory
Coast  dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year,
according to a document from the country’s ministry of mines,
oil and energy.  Output declined to 2.44 million barrels from 2.82 million
last year in the same period, a posting on the ministry of
finance’s website showed. Production fell in three  oil fields 
operated in the world’s biggest cocoa producer, except in the
CI-27 field, the document said.  Natural gas output rose 24 percent in the same period to
18.19 trillion British thermal units from 14.72 trillion a year
ago, according to the document. The increase follows investments
in CI-26 and CI-27 blocks and was tampered by the fall of supply
from CI-11 and CI-40 blocks, the ministry said.  Production of oil products rose 16 percent to 554,022
metric tons from 477,775 tons last year in the same period, the
document showed. Exports surged 84 percent to 210,332 tons from
last year 114,570 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
