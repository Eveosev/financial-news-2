BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK)  Laurence D. Fink,
head of the world’s largest asset manager, said his firm would
fare better than peers if asset managers become more regulated.  “We already have tremendous regulatory oversight,” Fink,
chief executive officer of New York-based BlackRock, said today
during the Deutsche Bank dbAccess Global Financial Services
Investors Conference. “I’m certainly not feeling the pressure
that banks may feel in terms of too big to fail.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
