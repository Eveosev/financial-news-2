Nathan Tinkler , the former Australian
mining billionaire, agreed to pay A$12 million ($11.7 million)
to settle a dispute with  Blackwood Corp. (BWD)  over a failed share
purchase, the company said.  Tinkler has until June 30 to raise the money by selling
assets, the Brisbane-based coal company said today in a
statement. He agreed in May 2011 to buy A$28.4 million of shares
in Blackwood, though the deal fell through when Tinkler failed
to raise the money.  Blackwood sued Tinkler and his Mulsanne Resources Pty,
which was ordered liquidated by a New South  Wales  state judicial
officer in November. The liquidators applied on May 22 to freeze
Tinkler’s assets, including his 19.5 percent stake in coal
producer  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC)  and a family trust managed by his
wife, which Tinkler said holds about A$1.4 billion of assets.  “If payment is not made by 30 June 2013 then legal
proceedings against directors and the former company secretary
of Mulsanne Resources and the freezing order application are to
continue,” Blackwood said in the statement.  Tim Allerton, a spokesman for Tinkler at City Public
Relations, said he would seek comment from the mining
entrepreneur.  Tinkler was listed as one of three directors of Mulsanne in
an Australian Securities and Investments Commission document. He
knew Mulsanne had no assets when he offered to buy the Blackwood
shares, Blackwood had said previously. That amounts to insolvent
trading, which is illegal in Australia, the company said.  The case is In the matter of Mulsanne Resources Pty
2012/00296966.  Supreme Court  of New South Wales (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
