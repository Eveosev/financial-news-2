A weak low-pressure system that may
become a tropical storm this week won’t be a threat to offshore
energy platforms in the  Gulf of Mexico , said Dan Kottlowski, a
meteorologist for AccuWeather Inc.  The  U.S. National Hurricane Center  in Miami gives the storm
a 40 percent chance of becoming tropical in the next two days.
The system is moving northeast toward Florida and away from the
majority of offshore platforms and rigs, which are closer to
Louisiana and Texas.  West Texas Intermediate crude rose briefly amid speculation
that the storm might affect those operations.  “There are thousands of people who speculate on oil and
they just don’t have their facts straight,” Kottlowski, a
tropical weather expert, said by telephone from  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . “It just goes to show how ignorant they are, and
ignorant isn’t a bad word in this case, that they don’t do
enough research on this.”  If the system organizes and its top winds reach 39 miles
(63 kilometers) per hour, it will become Tropical Storm Andrea,
the first of the  Atlantic hurricane season  that began on June 1
and ends on Nov. 30.  Heavy rain will fall across  Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula,
western Cuba and Florida, the hurricane center said.  Kottlowski said the system has only about a day and half to
get organized before wind shear may tear it apart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
