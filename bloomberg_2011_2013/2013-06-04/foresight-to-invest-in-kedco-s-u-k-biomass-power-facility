Foresight Group LLP, a U.K. investor,
will channel funds into  Kedco Plc (KED) ’s planned biomass facility in
London and help raise further money for the project.  Foresight will provide funds for debt and equity to part
finance construction and operation of the 12-megawatt project,
Cork, Ireland-based Kedco said in a statement. A co-investor is
needed to invest, it said. Foresight today confirmed the deal.  Kedco, which has invested more than 2 million pounds ($3
million) in the plant, will retain equity and won’t be required
to invest further. Construction is due for the third quarter.  The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates
bioenergy plants may meet 8 percent to 11 percent of the
nation’s primary energy demand by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
