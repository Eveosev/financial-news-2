Brazil ’s industrial production jumped
in April more than analysts predicted, prompting traders to
reinforce bets policy makers will continue to raise rates at a
faster pace.  Industrial output rose 1.8 percent in April after gaining a
revised 0.8 percent in March, the national statistics agency
said today in Rio de Janeiro. The gain beat all 31  estimates  in
a Bloomberg survey with a median forecast of 1 percent.
Production rose 8.4 percent from the  year  before, the fastest
pace since August 2010.  Brazil’s central bank unexpectedly accelerated the pace of
interest rate increases last week in a bid to slow inflation
that is hurting economic growth. Brazil’s gross domestic product
unexpectedly slowed to 0.55 percent in the first quarter, below
the 0.9 percent median economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
as higher consumer prices eroded demand.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 9.03 percent at 9:21 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.1198 per U.S. dollar.  The central bank increased on May 29 the Selic rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent, surprising 38 of 57 analysts, who
expected policy makers would raise borrowing costs by 25 basis
points for a second consecutive time.  To buoy industrial output, President Dilma Rousseff’s
administration reduced taxes on consumer goods, slashed a levy
on payroll and cut energy tariffs. The efforts have yet to
consolidate recovery of industry, which in the first quarter was
the only sector to contract.  Industry contracted 0.3 percent in the first quarter over
the previous three months, according to gross domestic product
figures released by the national agency on May 29. Services rose
0.5 percent and agriculture increased 9.7 percent over the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
