Malaysian palm oil production may
rise to a record this year as crops in the main growing state of
Sabah received ample rain, Oil World said.  Palm oil output in  Malaysia , the world’s largest producer
after  Indonesia , may be 19.4 million metric tons, 600,000 tons
more than in 2012, the Hamburg-based researcher said today in an
e-mailed report. Yields may be 4.4 tons a hectare (2.47 acres).
The country’s exports may be as much as 18.8 million tons, up
from 17.6 million tons last year, according to the report.  While some areas of West Malaysia saw below-normal rainfall
in March and April, “this is not yet critical because of partly
well above-normal moisture received in the preceding eight
months,” Oil World said. In the eastern state of Sabah, crops
received 159 percent of normal precipitation in April, “more
than offsetting the inferior rainfall a month earlier.”  Demand for  palm oil  is increasing globally, helping spur
total world export volume of 17 major oils and fats to a record
75.65 million tons in the 2012-13 marketing year that began Oct.
1, Oil World said. Global exports of palm oil may rise by 3.4
million tons, compared with a year earlier. Indonesia was the
top exporter of all oils and fats at 23.2 million tons, followed
by Malaysia at 20.2 million tons, according to the report.  “This development reflects primarily the rising dependence
on palm oil, given the insufficient production of seed oils in
the current season,” Oil World said.  Global production of palm kernel oil may climb 6.4 percent
from a year earlier to 6.16 million tons in 2012-13, Oil World
said. Output in Malaysia may be a record 2.3 million tons while
Indonesian production may be 3 million tons. Palm oil is made
from the fruit yielded from the oil palm plant, while palm
 kernel  oil is yielded from its seed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
