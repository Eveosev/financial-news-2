India’s rupee rose from an 11-month
low after data showing an unexpected drop in U.S. manufacturing
tempered concern the  Federal Reserve  will reduce  asset purchases 
that have spurred fund flows into  emerging markets .  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major counterparts, fell the most since January yesterday as a
factory index for the world’s largest economy declined to 49,
the lowest level since June 2009. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction. The rupee advanced the most since April 30 after
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram signaled yesterday
policy makers will act to rein in a surge in gold imports that
contributed to a record current-account deficit.  “The market sees what it wants to see, clinging on to the
idea and hope that weak data may lead to a possible delay of
quantitative easing tapering,” Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong , wrote in a research note
today. India will need “drastic” steps to curb gold imports
and shield the rupee against the current-account gap, he wrote.  The rupee appreciated 0.4 percent to 56.5625 per dollar as
of 9:54 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 56.8250 yesterday, the weakest level since June 28,
2012. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 17 basis points,
or 0.17 percentage point, to 8.96 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of India doesn’t seek any particular
exchange rate for the rupee, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao told the
 Press Trust of India  yesterday. The central bank probably sold
dollars around 56.75 last week to curb the local currency’s
drop, according to J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank in Mumbai.  Fed Stimulus  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said yesterday U.S.
policy makers are committed to record stimulus measures. The Fed
is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds each month
to keep borrowing costs low and spur the economy.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 57.46 per
dollar, compared with 57.61 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 57.44 versus 57.72. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
