BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK)  Laurence D. Fink,
head of the world’s largest asset manager, said he was surprised
by investors’ negative reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke ’s most recent comments on the future of the central
bank’s asset purchases.  “I actually believe it’s a statement that the Fed is going
to navigate its behavior depending on the marketplace, depending
on inflationary pressure,” Fink, chief executive officer of New
York-based BlackRock, said today during the Deutsche Bank
dbAccess Global Financial Services Investors Conference. “I
look at the chairman’s statement to be one of extreme positivism
and so I’m not terribly worried about what it means.”  Bernanke on May 22 defended the central bank’s record
stimulus program under questioning from lawmakers, telling them
that ending it prematurely would endanger a recovery hampered by
high unemployment and government spending cuts. U.S. stocks
initially extended gains and Treasuries rallied on his remarks.  Stocks erased their rally and Treasuries fell after
Bernanke, responding to a question that same day, said the Fed
could “take a step down in our pace of purchases” in the
“next few meetings” if it is confident gains in the economy
can be sustained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
