Hogs futures advanced, extending a
rally to the highest since July, on signs that demand will rise
as U.S. supplies of slaughter-ready pigs tighten. Cattle gained.  Meat plants  slaughtered  402,000 hogs yesterday, down 1.5
percent from a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture Data
show. Wholesale pork has surged 15 percent this year through
yesterday to 95.05 cents a pound, according to the USDA.  “We’re still seeing some very tight supplies of market-ready hogs,”  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale
Inc., said in a telephone interview from McHenry,  Illinois .  Hog futures for July settlement rose 1.4 percent to 94.875
cents a pound at 11:36 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching 94.925 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 3. Prices are up 9.1 percent this year
through yesterday.  Cattle futures for August delivery added 0.2 percent to
$1.197 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.4
percent to $1.4505 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
