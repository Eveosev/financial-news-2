Canada ’s  merchandise trade  deficit
widened in April as energy drove imports to a record while
exports fell for the first time in five months.  The deficit of C$567 million ($550 million) followed a C$3
million shortfall in March that Ottawa-based Statistics Canada
originally reported as a C$24 million surplus. With today’s
revisions, Canada has recorded 16 straight trade deficits, the
longest run in at least a quarter century.  Canada’s dollar fell after the report, which National Bank
Financial senior economist  Krishen Rangasamy  said gives little
evidence of a return to large surpluses seen before the 2008
financial crisis. The  Bank of Canada  has said the export
recovery is the slowest since World War II and on May 29 kept
its  key interest rate  at 1 percent, where it’s been for more
than two years.  ‘There are still going to be challenges for exporters in
Canada’’ in coming months, Rangasamy said by telephone from
 Montreal . “The Canadian dollar is still strong, still
overvalued,” and “you have a global economy that remains
weak.”  The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent to C$1.0328 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:15 a.m. in Toronto. The currency gained 0.9 percent
yesterday, the biggest increase since June 29, 2012. One dollar
buys 96.82 U.S. cents.  Record Imports  April’s deficit compared with a C$500 million forecast in a
Bloomberg economist survey. Imports rose a fourth month to a
record C$40.8 billion, a gain of 1.2 percent,  Statistics Canada 
said. Energy imports rose 6 percent to C$3.90 billion, including
a 33.9 percent jump in refined petroleum to a record C$1.2
billion, while motor vehicles and parts rose 1.9 percent to
C$7.16 billion.  Exports fell 0.2 percent to C$40.3 billion in April,
according to the Statistics Canada report. Energy declined 1.7
percent to C$9.33 billion on a 29.1 percent drop in the
“other” category that’s dominated by coal, while crude oil and
bitumen shipments fell 2 percent as prices declined.  The volume of imports advanced 1.5 percent and export
volumes rose 0.5 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  The weaker  trade balance  was driven by non-U.S. countries
in April. The  surplus with the U.S.  widened to C$3.87 billion in
April from C$3.82 billion a month earlier, and the deficit with
other countries grew to C$4.43 billion from C$3.83 billion.  The U.S. trade  deficit  widened in April from more than a
three year low, by 8.5 percent to $40.3 billion according to a
Commerce Department report from  Washington  today.  Exports make up about one-third of Canada’s economy, with
about 75 percent  shipments  going to the U.S. Today’s report
follows May 31 figures showing the economy grew at a 2.5 percent
annualized first-quarter pace on record oil exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
