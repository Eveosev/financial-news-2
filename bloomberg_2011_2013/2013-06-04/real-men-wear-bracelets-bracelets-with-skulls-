Loot recently found itself seated next to Buzz Aldrin at an event. As the famous astronaut detailed his plan to colonize  Mars , we were struck by something a little closer to home -- the man was decked out in jewelry, and it looked fantastic. Loot couldn't help but ask: Fashion statement? Religious adornment? Space rocks? Skulls, actually.  His first skull bracelet, a large, translucent number on his right wrist, was given to him "by a lady friend," he told us. He gave it a patriotic spin, putting red, white and blue stones in the skulls' eye sockets. Success breeds success; other admirers made headway. Aldrin's jewelry (three skull bracelets, one beaded bracelet, two watches on one band and three gold rings, by Loot's count) remind us that men can look great with a few well-placed baubles.  For those without an admiring public, perhaps it's best not to wait for bracelets to be gifted -- take jewelry into your own hands. Eddie Borgo designs a seasonal menswear line. His  Compass Cuffs  in sterling silver, which sell for $550, manage to be fairly low-key without being bland. For those who subscribe to the never-too-old-for-summer-camp aesthetic, Catherine Zadeh makes  friendship-bracelet style designs  with sterling silver beads. The only thing mature about them is the price ($335). And if you like outdoorsy but don't want to fear for your bracelet's safety, Sailormade's  Contender  ($105) fits the bill.  A word of advice: Best not to go overboard when accessorizing. One or two bracelets will do.  Yes, we know. But he walked on the moon.
