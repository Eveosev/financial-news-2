Former New York Jets coach  Eric Mangini  is joining the  San Francisco 49ers  as a senior offensive
consultant, the National Football League team announced today in
an e-mailed release.  The team wasn’t specific about its plans for the 42-year-old Mangini, who has worked as an analyst for ESPN since 2011.  Mangini was 23-25 in three seasons with the Jets, leading
the team to a 10-6 record and a playoff berth in his first year
in 2006 and gaining the nickname “Mangenius.” He was fired
after the 2008 season when the team lost four of its last five
games and failed to make the postseason.  Mangini was hired for the same position by the Cleveland
Browns, where he was 10-22 in 2009 and 2010.  The position in San Francisco will be a change of roles for
Mangini, considered to be a defensive coach for much of his
previous time in the NFL. He was defensive assistant with the
Jets and  New England Patriots  from 1997 to 2004, and served as
the Patriots’ defensive coordinator in 2005.  Mangini’s new job reunites him with 49ers General Manager
Trent Baalke, who was a scout for the Jets in 1998 and 1999,
when Mangini was a defensive assistant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
