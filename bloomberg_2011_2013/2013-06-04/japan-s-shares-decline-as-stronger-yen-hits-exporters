Japan ’s  Topix index  advanced the most
in a month as brokerages, banks and consumer lenders rose after
leading declines yesterday and carmakers climbed in the
afternoon as the yen weakened.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. jumped 12 percent, as a measure
of brokerages in the Topix rebounded after falling more than 25
percent from a near five-year high in May. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest lender, added 7.5 percent
after dropping the most in a month yesterday. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, reversed declines to gain
2.1 percent. Wakita & Co. tumbled 11 percent after announcing a
share sale.  The Topix climbed 2.6 percent to 1,125.47 at the close in
Tokyo, its biggest increase since May 7, with more than two
shares rising for each that fell. The measure dropped as much as
1.9 percent in morning trading. The gauge is down about 12
percent from an almost five-year high on May 22.  “There’s no rationality in the recent market crash,” said
 Tomomi Yamashita , a  fund manager  who helps oversee the
equivalent of $5 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “After sharp drops there’s going to be a rebound with
some bargain-hunting. Investors see the long-term trend is still
for a weaker yen.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 2.1 percent to
13,533.76, with volume about 18 percent above the 30-day average
at the close. Fast Retailing Co., the heaviest-weighted company
on the equity benchmark, rose 1.1 percent.  A gauge of option
prices  gained 1.1 percent to 37.81, indicating traders expect a
swing of 11 percent for the Nikkei 225 in the next 30 days.  Market Swings  The  Topix, (TPX)  Japan’s broadest equity measure, had an intraday
trading range of 4.9 percent today and has swung by an average
of 3.9 percent daily since May 23.  The  Nikkei 225  and the Topix entered corrections on May 30
after dropping more than 10 percent from their highs. The
Topix’s 14-day Relative Strength Index, which tracks the
velocity of price changes, was at 35 yesterday, near the 30
threshold some traders see as a sign that stocks may be poised
to rise.  “On a technical level the market has fallen too much, too
quickly, and it wouldn’t be surprising if we saw a rebound in
the near term,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at SMBC
Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.  All but one of the Topix’s 33 industries increased today,
led by brokerages, consumer lenders and banks. At the close
yesterday eight of the groups had declined more than 20 percent
from recent highs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaires’ Losses  Japan’s three richest men -- Fast Retailing Chairman  Tadashi
Yanai , SoftBank Corp. President Masayoshi Son and Rakuten Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Hiroshi Mikitani -- lost a combined $4.2
billion on paper as shares dropped the past two weeks, according
to data from the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  Japan is still the best-performing major equity market this
year, with the Topix and Nikkei 225 both up around 30 percent on
optimism the nation can emerge from 15 years of deflation. The
rally is being fuelled by earnings growth that is three times
faster than the world average. Profits for the Topix will climb
57 percent to 74.78 yen a share in 2013, compared with the
global average of 19 percent, according to more than 5,000
analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
