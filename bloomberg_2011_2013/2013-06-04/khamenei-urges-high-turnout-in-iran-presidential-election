Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei called on all Iranians to take part in this month’s
presidential election to create a “political epic.”  The objective is “to have people’s glorious presence at
ballot boxes,” Khamenei said in an speech outside of the
Iranian capital today aired live on state television. “Whoever
you vote for, it will be a vote for the Islamic Republic, you
will be indicating your trust in the political system.”  The presidential election on June 14 will be the first
since the 2009 vote, which sparked street protests amid
allegations that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s re-election was the
result of ballot fraud. Ahmadinejad can’t run for a third time
in this month’s contest.  Khamenei was addressing a crowd of supporters gathered for
the annual ceremony commemorating the death of Islamic Republic
founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He said he had no favorite
among the eight candidates participating in the race. The
shortlist was drawn up from among more than 650 candidates after
a screening process by the Guardian Council based on their
qualifications and loyalty to the Islamic Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
