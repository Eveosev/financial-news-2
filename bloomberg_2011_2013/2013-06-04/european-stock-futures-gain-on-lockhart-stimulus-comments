European stocks  rose, rebounding from
a one-month low, as Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President
 Dennis Lockhart  said the central bank is committed to its
stimulus program.  Banco Santander SA and Inditex SA paced gains in Spanish
equities as unemployment declined more than forecast.
Assicurazioni Generali SpA advanced 1.2 percent after agreeing
to sell its U.S. reinsurance unit to Scor SE. STMicroelectronics
NV rallied the most in almost a month as Chief Executive Officer
 Carlo Bozotti  said orders have been positive.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.3 percent to 299.59 at
the close. The benchmark gauge fell to the lowest level since
May 2 yesterday amid speculation the Fed will scale back bond
buying. The measure rose 1.4 percent in May for a 12th straight
monthly advance and has rallied 7.1 percent this year.  “Markets are seeing Lockhart’s comments as positive,”
Herbert Perus, who helps oversee about $36 billion as head of
equities at Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna, said by
phone. “We think the macro data in the U.S. will not be very
bullish and that the quantitative easing will continue. We’re
very bullish on European equities as it’s the most undervalued
market in the world.”  Lockhart said late yesterday that recent data suggest the
economy lacks the strength to justify a reduction in the central
bank’s bond-buying program.  “To the extent that the markets are seeing mixed messages,
it simply reflects the debate that’s going on among the
colleagues on the  Federal Open Market Committee ,” Lockhart said
in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The bigger picture is
that any adjustment is not a major policy shift.”  Stoxx Target  Nick Nelson , a strategist at UBS AG in London, raised his
year-end forecast for the Stoxx 600 by 12 percent to 325 today,
saying equity valuations will increase as the  U.S. economy 
reaches “escape velocity” and risks in Europe diminish. The
new target is 8.5 percent above today’s closing level.  The Stoxx 600 trades at 13.2 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with 14.9 times for the  S&P 500  and 13.1 times for the
MSCI Asia Pacific, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.5 percent, while
 France ’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX increased 0.1 percent.  Spain ’s IBEX 35 Index advanced 1 percent as the Labor
Ministry said  registered unemployment  fell by 98,265 to 4.89
million in May from a month earlier. Economists on average had
forecast a drop of 50,000.  Santander, Spain’s biggest lender, increased 1.5 percent to
5.58 euros. Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer,
added 0.7 percent to 97.92 euros.  Reinsurance Deal  Generali,  Italy ’s biggest insurer, advanced 1.2 percent to
14.51 euros after Scor said it will pay about 579 million euros
($757 million) plus an “earnings adjustment” for Generali USA
Life Reassurance Co. Scor, France’s largest reinsurer, rose 2.7
percent to 22.86 euros.  STMicroelectronics,  Europe ’s biggest chipmaker, gained 4.5
percent to 7.50 euros in Milan after Bozotti said in an
interview with Le Figaro that orders have been positive in all
regions. The company is seeking an increase of 5 percent to 10
percent in orders this year, according to the newspaper.  A gauge of food and beverage companies was the  best
performer  among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Nestle SA,
the world’s biggest food producer, climbed 3.2 percent to 63.95
Swiss francs, the biggest jump in almost 21 months. Brewers
SABMiller Plc and Heineken NV advanced 1.5 percent to 3,360
pence and 0.9 percent to 53.87 euros, respectively.  Rentokil Unit  Rentokil Initial Plc rallied 2.6 percent to 90.75 pence
after the Financial Times reported that private equity firm
Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC is considering buying the pest-control provider’s Initial Facilities unit. Clayton Dubilier
plans to combine the office-maintenance unit with Balfour Beatty
Plc’s WorkPlace, the newspaper said, citing unnamed people
familiar with the matter.  Balfour Beatty, the U.K.’s largest construction company,
fell 1.9 percent to 228.1 pence.  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA soared 7 percent to 3.37 euros,
the biggest jump in three years. The Portuguese phone company
said Zeinal Bava will become chief executive officer of Oi SA,
while Portugal Telecom Chairman Henrique Granadeiro will take on
the additional role of CEO.  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s second-largest bank, advanced
1.4 percent to 31.03 euros as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
recommended investors  buy  the shares, citing the firm’s improved
funding levels.  Wolseley Challenges  Wolseley Plc slid 6.3 percent to 3,145 pence, the largest
drop in three years, after saying markets in Europe remain
challenging. The world’s largest distributor of heating and
plumbing products posted third-quarter revenue of 3.23 billion
pounds ($4.9 billion) and said comparable sales fell 9.2 percent
in France as new residential construction stayed weak.  Cobham Plc (COB)  retreated 4.6 percent to 272.9 pence, the
biggest drop in six months. A  shareholder  of the world’s largest
maker of airborne-refueling kit is selling 39.1 million shares

lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
