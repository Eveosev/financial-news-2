Black & Veatch Corp. and Garney Holding Co. are among the contractors that built a $200 million, 20 million-gallon-a-day drinking water system in 12 months to meet demand in drought-stricken Midland,  Texas .  The project in the Permian Basin oil city included 44 water wells drilled about 650 feet (200 meters) deep and a 58-mile (93-kilometer) pipeline, Black & Veatch, based in  Overland Park , Kansas, said today in a statement.  Midland rushed to finish the project after drought and a surge in population attracted to the region for work drained two of its three water supply reservoirs and reduced the third to a critical level, Black & Veatch said. An oil boom made Midland, hometown of former U.S. President  George W. Bush , the fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan area in the year ended July 2012,  according  to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The project comes at a time when Midland imposed water restrictions Jan. 1, punishable by a $500 fine, that limit lawn irrigation to two evenings a week. “The water restrictions will continue for now but this buys us another 40 years, if not 50 years, of a dependable water supply,” Midland Mayor Wes Perry said today in a phone interview.  “This is the biggest public works project we’ve ever done,” Perry said. The project taps water from a ranch purchased by the city as a water source in 1965, Garney, based in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a  statement .  Other group members included Midland County Fresh Water Supply District No. 1, Parkhill Smith and Cooper, Hilliard Energy and Southwest Water Co., according to Garney.
