The  Sacramento Kings  and new owner
Vivek Ranadive hired Golden State Warriors assistant Michael Malone as head coach.  Ranadive, the founder of  Tibco Software Inc. (TIBX) , held a
minority stake in the Warriors before heading a group that last
month completed a National Basketball Association-record $534
million purchase of the Kings. Malone was the lead assistant to
Mark Jackson in Golden State the past two seasons.  “As vice chairman of the Warriors, I developed a great
relationship with coach Malone and witnessed first-hand how
instrumental he was to the success of the team,” Ranadive said
in a statement. “His work ethic, passion and vision for the
game will create an entirely new culture and style of play.
Hiring coach Malone is our first step in giving the best fans in
sports the excellence they deserve.”  Malone, a native of Queens, New York, replaces Keith Smart,
who was fired by the new ownership group after amassing a 48-93
record during his two years with the Kings. Malone has also been
an assistant with the New Orleans Hornets,  Cleveland Cavaliers 
and  New York Knicks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
