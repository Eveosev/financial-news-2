Spot gasoline in  San Francisco 
weakened for a third straight day against futures as  Tesoro
Corp. (TSO)  reported a unit startup at the Golden Eagle oil  refinery 
in Northern California.  The 170,000-barrel-a-day plant filed notice with Contra
Costa County regulators that a sulfuric acid plant started
today. The Golden Eagle is running at “planned unspecified
rates,” Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in
 San Antonio , said by e-mail.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
slipped 0.5 cent to a premium of 5.75 cents a gallon, a two-month low, against futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:10 p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
outright price gained 2.81 cents to $2.8757 a gallon.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery near
San Francisco is running the crude unit at full rates after
starting it in April for the first time since an Aug. 6 fire,
two people familiar with operations said May 30.  In Los Angeles, Carbob was unchanged against futures at a
premium of 4.25 cents a gallon. Prompt delivery there rose 3.31
cents to $2.8607 a gallon.  The  premium  for San Francisco Carbob versus the same fuel
in Los Angeles narrowed 0.5 cent to 1.5 cents a gallon, the
least since May 10.  Retail Prices  Retail gasoline  in the state fell 0.3 cent to $3.984 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices at the
pump are down 5.6 percent from a year ago.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco dropped
0.5 cent versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex to
a discount of 2 cents a gallon. The same fuel in  Los Angeles 
fell against futures for the first time in more than a week,
slipping 0.5 cent to a premium of 2.5 cents a gallon.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  conventional, 84-octane gasoline 
climbed 0.5 cent to reach parity with Nymex gasoline futures.
 Low-sulfur diesel  there dropped a second day, declining 1 cent
to 9 cents a gallon under ULSD futures, its lowest level in more
than four months.  Portland gasoline’s discount to Los Angeles Carbob narrowed
0.5 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a fourth
day, gaining $1.44 to $20.20 a barrel at 4:12 p.m.  New York 
time. The spread, a rough measure of refining margins, is at the
highest level in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
