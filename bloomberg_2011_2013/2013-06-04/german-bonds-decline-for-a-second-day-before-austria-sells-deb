Italian and Spanish government bonds
rose for the first time in three days as a recovery in stocks
boosted demand for the euro region’s higher-yielding assets.  German bunds fell for a second day as demand for safer
investments waned. Austria’s bonds were little changed after the
nation auctioned a total of 1.43 billion euros ($1.87 billion)
of debt maturing in 2017 and 2023 today. The  European Central
Bank  will this week keep its main  interest rate  at a record-low
0.5 percent, according to all except two of 59 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the announcement on June 6.  “The market is risk-seeking,” said Marchel Alexandrovich,
a senior European economist at Jefferies International Ltd. in
 London . “Gains in Italian and Spanish debt are being driven by
liquidity that’s also driving up stocks.”  Italy’s 10-year yield  fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.10 percent at 4:38 p.m. London time after
climbing to 4.23 percent yesterday, the  highest  level since
April 19. The 4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 rose 0.47, or
4.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.55.  The yield on similar-maturity  Spanish debt  declined five
basis points to 4.43 percent and the rate on Portuguese 10-year
securities dropped 10 basis points to 5.71 percent.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  increased two basis points to 1.54
percent after climbing to as much as 1.57 percent yesterday, the
highest since Feb. 25.  ‘Dovish Comments’  “German bund yields are driven higher more by gains in
stocks and news from the U.S., rather than domestic news,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “There are still a lot
of troubles in the  euro zone . I expect German yields to
stabilize around these levels in the near term as the market
anticipates dovish comments from the ECB.”  Further declines in German bonds may be limited before a
report tomorrow that economists said will show the 17-nation
euro-area economy contracted in the first quarter. Gross
domestic product of the region shrank 0.2 percent in the three-months through March, according the median of 40 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.3 percent, rebounding
from a one-month low, after Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said the U.S. central bank is
committed to its stimulus program.  ‘Choppy’ Surveys  Euro-area contraction in the first quarter and “choppy”
business surveys will lead to lower ECB projections for growth
and inflation, Greg Fuzesi, economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
London wrote in a note to clients.  The ECB will probably revise its 2013 forecast to 0.7
percent contraction from a 0.5 percent decline forecast in
March, the bank said. It predicts the central bank’s inflation
rate estimate for 2013 will be revised down to 1.4 percent from
1.6 percent previously.  Italian and Spanish bonds have been supported since ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said in July he would do whatever it
takes to safeguard the euro and followed that with a pledge to
buy government bonds of countries that ask for assistance. The
ECB cut its main refinancing rate to a record last month.  Spain ’s 10-year yield has dropped more than 3 percentage
points since climbing to a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on
July 25, the day before Draghi made his pledge. Italy’s has
fallen more than 2.5 percentage points.  Spain’s  registered unemployment  declined in May, lending
support to the government’s prediction of an economic recovery
this year. The number of people registering for jobless benefits
fell by 98,265 from April to 4.89 million, the Labor Ministry in
 Madrid  said in an e-mailed statement.  Austria sold 715 million euros of bonds due in 2023 at an
average yield of 1.903 percent, up from an  all-time low  of 1.621
percent at the previous auction on May 7. The securities yielded
1.91 percent today.  Spanish bonds returned 6.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Spain Sovereign Bond
 Index. (BSPS)  Italian securities earned 3.8 percent, while German bonds
handed investors a loss of 0.8 percent, separate indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
