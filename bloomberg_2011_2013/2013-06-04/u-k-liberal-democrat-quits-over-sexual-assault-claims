A lawmaker from Deputy Prime
Minister  Nick Clegg ’s Liberal Democrats resigned from the party
while he challenges allegations of sexual assault.  Mike Hancock, who represents the parliamentary district of
Portsmouth on the southern coast of  England , said in a letter
released by the party late last night that he is stepping down
temporarily to defend himself against a High Court civil action
against him by a female constituent.  “I can assure you that I will continue to vigorously
defend my position and that I completely refute the allegations
made against me,” Hancock said in the letter to the Liberal
Democrats’ Chief Whip Alistair Carmichael, who is in charge of
party discipline.  Clegg has faced repeated media questions about how he has
dealt with the case of Hancock, who was arrested by police over
the allegations in 2010. No action was taken then as prosecutors
said there was insufficient evidence against him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
