Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest seller of computer services, agreed
to buy SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage
provider that will help it compete with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)   IBM is paying almost $2 billion for Dallas-based SoftLayer,
according to a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be
named because the financial terms aren’t being released.
SoftLayer had $335 million in revenue in 2012, Chief Executive
Officer Lance Crosby said in an interview.  IBM plans to add SoftLayer to its SmartCloud unit to create
a new Cloud Services division to capitalize on a market that
researcher IDC estimates may more than double to $105 billion by
2016 from last year. SoftLayer specializes in public clouds --
data-center networks that manage computing and software for
businesses remotely -- where Amazon dominates. IBM is pairing
those capabilities with private-cloud operations, building
dedicated systems for individual customers.  Starting a new division through acquisition “allows us to
get focused,” said Ric Telford, IBM’s vice president of cloud
services. “It’s all about acceleration. We had been building
out but we saw SoftLayer and the acquisition was too compelling
to pass up,” he said.  “They have the same capabilities” as Amazon, Telford said
of SoftLayer.  While Amazon leads the infrastructure-as-a-service market,
it’s growing so quickly that companies from  AT&T Inc. (T)  to  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  are looking to gain share, said Frank Gens, an analyst at
IDC. That market is set to grow to $38 billion in 2016, compared
with $12 billion last year, according to IDC estimates.  Revenue Target  IBM has a goal of reaching $7 billion in cloud revenue by
2015, which doesn’t change with this deal. SoftLayer serves
about 21,000 customers using a network of 13 data centers in the
U.S.,  Asia  and Europe. The company’s client base and public
cloud offering would help IBM reach small- and medium-sized
businesses.  IBM, which started offering cloud services in 2008, has
invested about $4 billion on deals with a software-as-a-service
component, the company said.  SoftLayer started looking for suitors about a year ago and
has been in talks with IBM for six months, Crosby said.  EMC Approached  EMC Corp., the largest maker of storage computers, said it
was also contacted by SoftLayer about making an offer.  “EMC was initially approached, uninterested, and decided
not to bid,” Dave Farmer, an EMC spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and AT&T looked at SoftLayer as well, said a
person familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be named
because the information is private. The person didn’t say
whether any of those companies made an offer.  Mark Siegel , a spokesman for AT&T, and  Deborah Hellinger ,
an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, expects to complete the
SoftLayer deal in the third quarter, setting the stage for the
new division to be formed. SoftLayer is majority owned by
private-equity firm GI Partners of  Menlo Park ,  California .  Both Crosby and James Sciales, an IBM spokesman, declined
to comment on a deal price.  Deutsche Bank AG served as IBM’s financial adviser, while
Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG advised SoftLayer.  IBM fell 1.3 percent to $206.19 at the close in New York.
The shares have advanced 7.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
