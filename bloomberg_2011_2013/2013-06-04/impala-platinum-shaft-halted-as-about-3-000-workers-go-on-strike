  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
world’s second-biggest producer of the metal, said about 3,000
workers started an unauthorized strike after an employee was
dismissed from one of its South African mines yesterday.  Workers didn’t report for duty at shaft No. 14 in
Rustenburg, northwest of Johannesburg,  Bob Gilmour , a spokesman
for the company, said by phone. “They are protesting the
disciplinary action,” he said.  Spokespeople for the Association of Mineworkers and
Construction Union, which represents more than 50 percent of
employees at Impala, didn’t answer calls. The  National Union of
Mineworkers  didn’t know about the strike, spokesman  Lesiba Seshoka  said by phone.  Impala last year fired 17,200 workers for participating in
in a six-week stoppage that halted output from the world’s
biggest platinum mine. The company later reinstated most of the
employees. A round of mining strikes in recent months fueled by
labor-union rivalry has threatened a turnaround in the
continent’s largest economy, which grew at the slowest pace
since a 2009 recession in the first quarter.  Producers in South Africa are struggling with higher costs
as demand wanes, prompting companies including  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s largest miner of the metal, to
consider cutting back operations and fire workers.  More of Impala’s shafts are producing at a loss as prices
decline and costs rise, it said on May 2. The company is
assessing the operations to determine their viability, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
