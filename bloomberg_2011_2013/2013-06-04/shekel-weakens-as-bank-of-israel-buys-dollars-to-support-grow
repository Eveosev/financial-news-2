The  Bank of Israel  bought U.S.
dollars for the first time this month in a bid to prevent shekel
appreciation from undermining growth, traders said. The currency
fell for a third time in seven days.  The central bank bought “small amounts” of dollars, said
Tom Gerszbejn, a currency trader at  Union Bank of Israel Ltd.  in
Tel Aviv. Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading for  Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI) , estimated the purchase at less than $100 million. The
bank has continued to intervene since it bought dollars on April
8 for the first time in almost two years as the shekel rose to
an 18-month high of 3.5898 a dollar.  The currency fell as much as 0.4 percent, the most this
month, to 3.6819 a dollar before trading at 3.6715 at 4:42 p.m.
in Tel Aviv. The central bank last month announced the purchase
of $2.1 billion by the end of the year. The shekel surged 3.8
percent in the past six months and is the best performer among
31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The central bank will continue to intervene in the market
as part of its announced policy” to moderate shekel gains and
support exporters, Gitlin said by phone.  Exports make up about 40 percent of  Israel ’s economy which
will probably slow to 3.4 percent in 2014 from 3.9 percent this
year, according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development estimates.  The bank’s monetary policy committee, led by Governor
 Stanley Fischer , last month also cut  interest rates  to a three-year low to spur growth and boost exports hurt by shekel gains.
Central bank spokesman Yossi Saadon declined to comment today.  Borrowing Costs  Rate reductions by the  European Central Bank  and  Bank of
Japan  as well as Israel’s natural gas finds had strengthened the
shekel to the point where it didn’t reflect economic
fundamentals, Barry Topf, senior adviser to Fischer said in an
interview on May 29. The Bank of Israel last month trimmed
borrowing costs by a cumulative 0.5 percentage point to 1.25
percent.  The central bank today issued 10 billion shekels of one-year Makam bills, with the average yield falling to 1.35 percent
from 1.68 percent last month, central bank data on Bloomberg
show. The yield on bills due May 2014 fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
