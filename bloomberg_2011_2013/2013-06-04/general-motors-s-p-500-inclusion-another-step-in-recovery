General Motors Co. (GM) , four years after
being kicked out of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, will heal
another wound of the financial crisis when it rejoins the
benchmark gauge for American equities this week.  The largest U.S. automaker is replacing H.J. Heinz Co.,
which will be purchased by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital in a $23 billion
buyout, according to a statement yesterday by S&P Dow Jones
Indices LLC. GM, which had been in the S&P 500 since the index
was established in 1957 until its 2009 bankruptcy, will be added
to the gauge on June 6 and would be the 79th biggest company
based on yesterday’s closing market values.  “They’re in essence getting a vote of confidence from
S&P,” Daniel Genter, who oversees about $4 billion as president
of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital Management, said in a
phone interview. “S&P expects that GM is going to have
significant longevity and growth, for which reason it should be
added back into the business mix of America.”  GM’s return to the  S&P 500  is a milestone for the company
since emerging from a 2009 reorganization and $49.5 billion U.S.
government bailout that became a centerpiece of President  Barack Obama ’s first term. Optimism about GM is growing as the  U.S.
Treasury  sells down its stake and the stock topped the $33 a
share initial public offering price on May 17 for the first time
in two years.  Shares Rally  Shares of the Detroit-based company rose 2.8 percent to
$35.53 as of 7:59 p.m. in  New York  in trading after the close of
U.S. exchanges yesterday. GM is up 19 percent in 2013, compared
with a 15 percent advance for the S&P 500.  GM returned to the stock market in November 2010 with an
initial public offering that raised $15.8 billion, before
expanding to $18.1 billion when underwriters exercised the over-allotment option. The revisions in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  may prompt money
managers to shift holdings to match the index. About $5.58
trillion is benchmarked to the gauge, according to S&P’s
website.  The Treasury said in December that it plans to sell its
entire GM holding within 15 months after the automaker bought
$5.5 billion of its stock, or 200 million shares, from the
government. As of April 1, the Treasury held 241.6 million GM
shares, representing a 16.4 percent stake, according to GM’s
proxy statement.  Free Float  GM’s free float has increased to at least 56.2 percent this
year from 44.5 percent at the beginning of 2012, data compiled
Bloomberg show. A minimum free float -- the percentage of shares
available to the public -- of 50 percent is required for
companies to be considered for addition to the S&P 500,
according to criteria published on the website of S&P Dow Jones
Indices, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Cos. and CME Group Inc.  “The GM team has been working very hard to earn the
business of customers around the world and to win the confidence
of investors, and rejoining the S&P 500 shows we’re very much on
track,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said in an e-mail.  GM and Citigroup Inc. were removed from the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  and replaced by Cisco Systems Inc. and
Travelers Cos. on June 1, 2009. GM filed for  bankruptcy
protection  that day and Citigroup was recipient of $45 billion
in taxpayer aid.  The automaker has been  profitable  every quarter since its
IPO in November 2010. GM is being helped by plans to introduce
about 20 new vehicles in the U.S. this year, including Chevrolet
Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, as it seeks to rebound from an
88-year-low market share in 2012.  Cadillac ATS  The company’s new Cadillac ATS, introduced last year, is
already boosting sales, with the luxury brand’s deliveries
increasing 38 percent to 69,750 through May. That was the
brand’s biggest year-to-date increase since 1976, when sales
jumped 45 percent to 135,258.  “S&P is allowing them back in as a salute to the
significant actions they’ve taken,” Michael Shinnick, a  fund
manager  at Salt Lake City-based Wasatch Advisors Inc., said in a
phone interview yesterday. His firm manages $16 billion and owns
GM shares. “The company didn’t just get profitable for a
quarter or a year. They’ve demonstrated now multiple years of
steady profitability.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
