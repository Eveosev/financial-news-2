Saudi Arabia approved 32 more
contracts valued at 325 million riyals ($87 million) for water
and sanitation projects across the kingdom, state-owned  Saudi
Press Agency  said, citing the water and electricity minister.  The contracts include building reservoirs, pumping
stations, water-treatment plants and sewage networks in areas
including Najran, Onaizah, al-Hafouf and Tabouk, SPA said,
citing Minister Abdullah Al-Hussayen. Saudi Arabia, the biggest
oil producer, is also the largest producer of desalinated water.  Saudi Arabia spent $1.1 billion on 128 water and sanitation
projects just in the capital  Riyadh  last year. The Ministry of
Water and Electricity has 285 water projects listed kingdom-wide
this year on its  official website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
