Indian bonds rose, halting a five-day
decline, after the central bank said it will resume debt
purchases for the first time in a month to boost funds in the
financial system.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy as much as 70 billion
rupees ($1.2 billion) of government notes on June 7, it said in
a statement yesterday. The monetary authority last bought 96.6
billion rupees of bonds on May 7 to ease a cash  shortage . The
RBI may purchase 750 billion rupees of debt in the first half of
the fiscal year that started April 1, said Srinivasa Raghavan,
the Mumbai-based executive vice president of treasury at
Dhanalaxmi Bank Ltd.  “The debt buying will keep the bonds supported for the
time being as it will boost liquidity,” he said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government securities due
June 2022 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.43 percent as of 9:32 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  Increasing cash availability is necessary to offset the
funding squeeze from a record 6.3 trillion rupees government
borrowing program, according to Raghavan. For the first time in
15 years, the  finance ministry  will sell inflation-linked notes
today, offering 10 billion rupees of 10-year debt.  In the fiscal year that ended March 31, the central bank
added 1.6 trillion rupees to the financial system through open-market debt purchases, RBI data shows.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.18 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
