German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said fighting unemployment in Europe will take time as
he defended efforts to resolve the debt crisis, adding that
letting the currency collapse would mean “catastrophe.”  Leaders of the 17-member single currency now turning to
battle youth unemployment cannot allow the younger generation
“to wait five years,” Schaeuble told a conference. He pointed
to improving signals in crisis countries, saying that Portugal
and Ireland will likely return to the market next year.  “Unemployment is always the late indicator,” Schaeuble
told a gathering of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian
Democratic Union  in Berlin. Joblessness “comes late during a
worsening economy, but it goes late as well.”  Schaeuble said that as the European economy takes time to
recover, competitiveness in  Spain  and a revival of Greece’s
tourism industry indicate that Europe “is on the right path.”  He also defended the currency as essential for Germany’s
interests as the CDU confronts a challenge from the anti-euro
Alternative for Germany party, saying that the economic fallout
from a euro collapse “would be nothing compared with 2009.”  “We would cause a grave economic catastrophe if we
destroyed the euro, or factored in a destruction,” Schaeuble
said. “That’s why we’re not going to do that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
