The  Institute of International
Finance  warned that Europe’s and Japan’s monetary stimulus may
be leading investors to underprice risk while an abrupt end to
U.S. bond buying could threaten economic growth.  Purchases of riskier assets and higher equity prices while
corporate earnings growth remains weak are a “cause of
concern,” the IIF’s market-monitoring group said in a statement
today. A reduction in U.S. bond buying may prompt swings in
capital flows and “jeopardize a fragile economic recovery,”
particularly in the euro region, the Washington-based bank-lobbying group said.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s signal last
month that stimulus could be pared if there’s a sustained
recovery pushed up borrowing costs and volatility. A spike in
bond yields would lead to “significant valuation losses for
holders of bonds, including for central banks,” the  IIF ’s risk
group, headed by Jacques de Larosiere and  David Dodge , wrote in
the statement.  The IIF said banks’ zero risk-weighting of domestic
 government bonds  should be reconsidered for nations that are
members of a currency union. Euro-area banks’ holdings of
 government securities  have increased and may weaken lenders if
the repayment of government debt came into question again, the
IIF said.  Companies in Ireland, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, where
corporate debt in relation to gross domestic product remains
high, are vulnerable to interest-rate increases and higher
funding costs, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
