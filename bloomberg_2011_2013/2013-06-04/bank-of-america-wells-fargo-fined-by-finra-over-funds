Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  were ordered to pay about $5.2 million in fines and
restitution by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority over
sales of loan funds.  Brokers at units of the two banks recommended funds that
invested in floating-rate debt to customers who weren’t looking
for risky deals, the industry-funded regulatory group said today
in a  statement . Bank of America was fined $900,000 and ordered
to reimburse $1.1 million in losses, while San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo was ordered to pay a $1.25 million fine and about $2
million in restitution.  Salespeople at  Banc of America Investment Services Inc.  and
 Wells Fargo Investments LLC  recommended the unsuitable mutual
funds in 2007 and 2008, Finra said in regulatory filings.
Customers lost money when they sold the funds after their value
fell during the financial crisis, according to the regulator.  “Wells Fargo and Banc of America allowed their brokers to
sell floating-rate bank loan funds to investors for whom the
positions were unsuitable, resulting in significant losses to
many customers,” Brad Bennett, Finra’s chief of enforcement,
said in the statement.  The banks neither admitted nor denied the charges, Finra
said.  Bill Halldin , a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America, said the firm was pleased to resolve the
issue, while Wells Fargo’s Erica Van Ross declined to comment on
Finra’s allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
