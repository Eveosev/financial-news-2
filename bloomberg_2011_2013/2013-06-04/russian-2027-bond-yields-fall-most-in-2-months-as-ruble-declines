Ruble bonds rallied, pushing down the
yield on benchmark notes due February 2027 the most in two
months, as investors speculated a selloff was overdone.  The yield on the 2027 OFZs dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 7.45 percent by the close in Moscow. That’s
the biggest decline since April 8.  Russia ’s local-currency ruble bonds fell the most last
month since February 2009 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said the U.S. central bank could reduce the pace of its
asset purchases if officials see signs of sustained improvement
in growth. The yield on the 2027 notes rose 74 basis points in
May, the most in a year. to November levels.  “We saw a rebound from oversold levels,” Igor Akinshin, a
trader at OAO Alfa Bank in Moscow, said by phone.  The ruble retreated 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 36.3194 and declined 0.4 percent versus
the dollar to 31.9150 by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the central bank
stops trading. Brent crude dropped as much as 0.3 percent to
$101.71 per barrel. Oil and natural-gas industries contribute
about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  Consumer prices accelerated 7.4 percent in May from a year
earlier after 7.2 percent in April, the Federal Statistics
Service in Moscow said today by e-mail. The median forecast of
24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.3 percent.  “At first glance, the inflation numbers came in worse than
expected, but we point out the impact of non-monetary factors,
like prices of vegetables,” Leonid Ignatiev, head of fixed
income research at BCS Financial Group, said in e-mailed
comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
