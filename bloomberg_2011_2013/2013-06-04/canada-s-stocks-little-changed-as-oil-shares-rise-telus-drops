Canadian  stocks  fell for a third day,
to the lowest close in more than two weeks, as consumer staples
and gold producers declined and investors considered mixed trade
data and prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus.  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. lost 1.5 percent after Seven
& I Holdings Co., operator of 7-Eleven convenience stores, said
it may more than double its North American outlets. Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd. fell 2.8 percent as Pershing Square Capital
Management LP said it will sell part of its stake.  Barrick (ABX)  Gold
Corp. retreated 1.7 percent after saying production at its
Pascua-Lama project will be delayed.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 15.83
points, or 0.1 percent to 12,593.97 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
lowest since May 16. The index has added 1.3 percent this year.  “Investors want more clarity on when the Fed will taper
its bond purchasing program, and a lot of it is dependent on
economic data, which has been mixed signals,” Anish Chopra, a
fund manager with TD Asset Management Ltd., said from Toronto.
He helps manage about C$204 billion ($197 billion). “When you
look at gold stocks, the actual commodity has fallen quite a
bit. Investors are trying to figure out where the new range
is.”  Esther George, Fed Bank of Kansas City President, urged the
Fed to reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond buying as the U.S.
economy improves. Data today from the Commerce Department showed
the trade deficit in the U.S. widened in April from a more than
three year low, reflecting a rebound in imports of consumer
goods and business equipment that eases concern about the degree
of slowing in economic growth.  Canada’s merchandise trade deficit widened in April to
C$567 million ($550 million) from a revised C$3 million
shortfall in March. Canada has recorded 16 straight trade
deficits, the longest run in at least a quarter century.  Couche-Tard  Consumer staples stocks fell 1.2 percent as a group, as
eight of 10  industries  in the S&P/TSX retreated. Trading volume
was 8.8 percent higher than the 30-day average.  Alimentation Couche-Tard, which operates convenience stores
and gas bars across North America and in  Norway , lost 1.5
percent to C$57.70. Competitor 7-Eleven may increase its North
American store count to as high as 30,000, Seven & I Holdings
Chairman Toshifumi Suzuki said in an interview with Bloomberg on
May 30 in  Tokyo .  Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer, retreated 1.7
percent to C$21.57 after announcing production at its Pascua-Lama project on the border of  Chile  and Argentina won’t start in
the second half of 2014 as planned, due to demands from Chile’s
environmental agency. The delay will lead to higher capital
costs, the company said in a filing.  Cost Estimate  Barrick has already raised the cost estimate for the
project twice in the past year, to as much as $8.5 billion.  AuRico Gold Inc. slipped 2.5 percent to C$5.41 and Kinross
Gold Corp. lost 1.6 percent to C$6.66 as the price of gold
declined 1 percent to settle at $1,397.20 an ounce in New York.  CP Rail (CP)  lost 2.8 percent to C$131.76 after  William Ackman ’s
Pershing Square said in a statement yesterday it will cut its
stake in the railway by about 29 percent by selling as many as 7
million shares over six to 12 months.  Ackman took control of the company last year, hiring  Hunter Harrison  as the new chief executive officer to improve
operations. The stock has tripled since his 2011 investment and
 jumped  81 percent in the past year.  Lululemon Athletica Inc. advanced 2.1 percent to C$83.30.
The company is restocking its Luon black yoga pants in stores
and online this month after they were pulled in March for being
too sheer, the company said yesterday in a  note  on their
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
