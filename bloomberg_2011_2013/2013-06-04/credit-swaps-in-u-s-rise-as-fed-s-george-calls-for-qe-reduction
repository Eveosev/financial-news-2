A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose the most in more than two months as Federal Reserve Bank of
Kansas City President Esther George called for a reduction in
the pace of stimulus efforts amid a strengthening economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 3.2
basis points to a mid-price of 81.8 basis points at 3:06 p.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
earlier reached 83.5 basis points in the biggest increase since
March 20, when traders started moving into a new index version.  Investors are looking for clues to determine the Fed’s next
move, as members debate when it should begin tapering its $85
billion of monthly bond buying, or quantitative easing, that has
bolstered economic growth. Improving conditions warrant slowing
the pace of the asset purchases, George, 55, said today in the
text of a speech in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico . George was unable to
speak because of an illness.  “Waiting too long to acknowledge the economy’s progress
and prepare markets for more-normal policy settings carries no
less risk than tightening too soon,” she said.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
