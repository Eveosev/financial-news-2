BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, said it delivered the first Terrier combat
vehicle to the British army in a project worth 360 million
pounds ($550 million).  The Terrier, an armoured digger, can be operated by remote
control enabling soldiers to clear routes from a safe distance.
The project will equip British troops with 60 vehicles due for
delivery by January, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said today in
a statement. The 32-ton tracked vehicle, which can be equipped
with a 7.62mm machine gun and fire smoke grenades, can travel at
speeds of almost 50 miles per hour and carry 5,000 kg.  “Terrier represents a step change in vehicle design,”
David Bond, managing director of Combat Vehicles for the London-based company said in a separate statement, likening the vehicle
to a combat Swiss army knife.  Remote control operations include a 1km wireless link, with
the operator using video-game like controls. The Terrier is also
equipped with five onboard cameras that allow remote operations
at night.  Terrier’s “versatility will pay huge dividends on the
battlefields of the future,” General Peter Wall, head of the
British Army said in the ministry’s statement. The vehicle is
being used by the Royal Engineers.  The vehicle, which BAE will help maintain for at least the
first five years, has a range of 600 km, the company said,
adding that deliveries will be completed five months ahead of
plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
