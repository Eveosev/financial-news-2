Wheat fell for the first time in
three sessions as rain improved crop prospects in  Australia  and
 Russia , the world’s biggest exporters behind the U.S. and
 Canada . Soybeans also declined.  Rain fell in Australia growing regions during the past
seven days, adding to soil moisture, while scattered showers in
Russia will ease the stress of earlier dry spells, forecaster
DTN said in a report. Precipitation also is boosting prospects
for crops in the eastern Midwest of the U.S. Global output may
jump to a record 701.1 million metric tons in the year that
started this month, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Wheat is very abundant,” Jon Marcus, the president of
Lakefront Futures & Options LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. In the U.S., “the amount of moisture has proven to
be pretty friendly to this crop. The overall feeling has been
one of optimism for the crop, and obviously that is going to
hurt prices.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $7.0625
a bushel at 9:30 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The price
through yesterday declined 8.9 percent this year, partly on
speculation that global production will increase.  Soybean futures for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$15.215 a bushel in Chicago. The price through yesterday was up
8.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
