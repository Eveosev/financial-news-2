Stocks are much cheaper after four
years of gains than they were in the two previous bull markets
after taking corporate earnings into account, according to Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the ratio of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index to profits at all U.S. companies, as compiled
quarterly by the Commerce Department and expressed in billions
of dollars. For the first quarter, the reading was 1.02.  Although the latest ratio was the highest since 2008, it
was far from peaks of 1.43 in the third quarter of 2007 or 2.65
in the first quarter of 2000, as the chart shows. Both readings
were posted near the end of multiyear gains in share prices.  “The stock market’s performance has been well supported,”
Dutta said yesterday in an interview. “It’s perfectly sensible
to pay up for profits.” The New York-based economist presented
a similar chart in a May 31 note to clients.  S&P 500  company profits for the first quarter appear to
have set a record, according to  Howard Silverblatt , a senior
index analyst at S&P in New York. Operating earnings equaled
$25.76 on a per-share basis, based on results reported as of
last week. The current record is $25.43 a share, set in last
year’s second quarter.  Comparing the S&P 500 with the broader profit indicator
shows the current  bull market  has more going for it than the
Federal Reserve’s policy of buying bonds and holding  interest
rates  near zero, Dutta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
