The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for April
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise imports rose 1.2% in April, while
exports edged down 0.2%. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit
with the world went from $3 million in March to $567 million in
April.  Imports rose for a fourth consecutive month to a record
high of $40.8 billion. The increase in imports was led by energy
products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal ores and non-metallic minerals. Overall, volumes were up 1.5%.  Exports edged down to $40.3 billion, as decreases in metal
ores and non-metallic minerals, energy products, and industrial
machinery, equipment and parts were partially offset by a large
increase in metals and non-metallic mineral products. Overall,
prices declined 0.7%, while volumes were up 0.5%.  Imports from the  United States  increased 1.9% to a record
high of $26.2 billion. The gain was led by metal ores and non-metallic minerals, as well as energy products. Exports to the
United States grew 1.8% to $30.1 billion. Consequently, Canada’s
trade surplus with the United States went from $3.8 billion in
March to $3.9 billion in April.  Exports to countries other than the United States fell 5.6%
to $10.2 billion, as decreases were recorded in most principal
trading areas. Imports from countries other than the United
States were relatively unchanged in April at $14.6 billion. As a
result, Canada’s trade deficit with countries other than the
United States increased from $3.8 billion in March to $4.4
billion in April.  Energy products lead gain in imports  Imports of energy products increased 6.0% to $3.9 billion
in April, as volumes were up 5.7%. Refined petroleum energy
products led the overall increase in energy products, rising
33.9% to a record high of $1.2 billion. Imports of crude oil and
crude bitumen declined for the fifth consecutive month,
partially offsetting the section’s increase.  Imports of motor vehicles and parts grew 1.9% to $7.2
billion, led by passenger cars and light trucks, up 3.7%. Also
contributing to the increase was medium and heavy trucks, buses
and other motor vehicles, which rose 7.2% to a record high of
$887 million.  Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals increased
10.3% to $1.3 billion, on the strength of other metal ores and
concentrates, which grew 11.7% to $888 million. Overall, volumes
rose 8.2%.  Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts
declined 3.5% to $3.7 billion in April, as widespread decreases
were recorded throughout the section. Volumes were down 3.2%.  Offsetting movements result in a slight decrease in exports  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals declined
13.8% to $1.5 billion in April, as volumes fell 9.8%. Copper
ores and concentrates was the main contributor to the overall
decrease, declining 62.0% to $136 million.  Exports of energy products decreased 1.7% to $9.3 billion,
as prices declined 1.4%. Exports of other energy products,
mainly coal, fell 29.1%. After posting four consecutive monthly
gains, exports of crude oil and crude bitumen fell 2.0% on lower
prices. Higher exports of natural gas (+14.3%) partially offset
the overall decrease in the section.  Exports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts fell
5.0% to $2.1 billion. Widespread declines were recorded
throughout the section, led by miscellaneous parts of machinery
and equipment.  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products grew
10.6% to $4.9 billion, as volumes (+5.6%) and prices (+4.7%)
rose. An increase in exports of unwrought precious metals and
precious metal alloys more than offset widespread decreases in
the section.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months. For
this release, BOP based data have been revised for the previous
four years.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
