Baxter International Inc. (BAX) , the
world’s second-largest maker of dialysis products, issued $3.5
billion of debt in five parts to help fund its 18.3 billion
kronor ($2.8 billion) acquisition of Gambro AB.  The company’s $500 million of 0.95 percent, three-year
notes yield 50 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $750 million of 1.85 percent, five-year debt pay a
relative yield of 80 basis points, $1.25 billion of 3.2 percent,
10-year securities have a 110 basis-point spread and $500
million of 4.5 percent, 30-year bonds pay 122, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company also sold $500 million of 18-month, floating-rate notes to yield 17 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate.  About $3 billion of proceeds from the offering will be used
for the Gambro deal, with the remainder going toward general
corporate purposes including the repayment of commercial paper,
the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said today in a regulatory
filing.  Baxter agreed to buy Lund, Sweden-based Gambro to expand
its kidney-equipment business, according to a Dec. 4 statement.
Baxter, which also makes blood products and intravenous drugs,
trails  Bad Homburg , Germany-based Fresenius Medical Care AG in
kidney-dialysis products. Gambro ranks third.  The company last sold debt in August, raising $1 billion in
two parts including $700 million of 2.4 percent, 10-year
debentures to yield 80 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 96.6 cents
on the dollar to yield 2.82 percent on May 23, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. managed today’s offering, Bloomberg data show. The bonds,
are rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings company
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
