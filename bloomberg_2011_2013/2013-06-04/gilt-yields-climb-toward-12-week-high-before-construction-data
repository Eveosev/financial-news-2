U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
 10-year yields  toward a 12-week high, as an unexpected increase
in a purchasing managers index of U.K. construction reduced
demand for the safety of fixed-income assets.  Two-year yields climbed the most in three weeks as a gauge
of Britain’s  retail sales  also improved in May. The pound
weakened against the dollar and euro. The U.K. sold 1.6 billion
pounds ($2.45 billion) of inflation-linked gilts before sales of
debt due in 2023 and 2032 scheduled for next week. The Bank of
England will keep its target for bond purchases, or quantitative
easing, unchanged at a two-day meeting starting tomorrow,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “The PMIs have been stronger so far this week and the
retail sales number overnight was a bit better so there’s
growing evidence that the recovery, whilst still very young, is
gaining a bit of momentum,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. “It’s
certainly cementing the view that QE is on hold and we do have a
lot of supply in the pipeline. There are plenty of reasons to
justify the backup in yields.”  The 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 3:10 p.m. London time after
climbing to 2.06 percent yesterday, the highest level since
March 8. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.405,
or 4.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.555.  Two-year  gilt yields  advanced four basis points to 0.39
percent, the biggest increase since May 10.  Annual Loss  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign
Bond Index. (BRIT)  German bonds dropped 0.8 percent and U.S. Treasuries
declined 0.9 percent.  A gauge of U.K.  construction  rose to 50.8 in May from 49.4
the previous month, according to Markit Economics and the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an increase to 49.8, below the
level of 50 that indicates expansion. Retail sales at stores
open at least 12 months rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier,
the British Retail Consortium and KPMG said.  “The numbers out this morning have been stronger rather
than weaker so that’s contributing” to the higher yields, said
 Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London. “If rates move up a bit further, people will probably
see some value there and come back.”  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5294 after climbing to
$1.5376 yesterday, the strongest level since May 13. The U.K.
currency weakened 0.1 percent to 85.39 pence per euro.  Sterling has declined 2.4 percent this year, the third-worst performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 4.5
percent and the euro rose 3.3 percent.  Markit said yesterday its index of U.K. manufacturing
climbed to a 14-month high in May, adding to signs the economy
is improving. The Bank of England will leave its bond-purchase
target at 375 billion pounds this week, according to all except
one of 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
