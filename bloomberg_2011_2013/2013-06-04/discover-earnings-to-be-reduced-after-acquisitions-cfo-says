Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
third-biggest U.S. payments network, said earnings per share
will be reduced by several cents this quarter after the firm
acquired some businesses in Europe.  Earnings will be reduced by “mid to high single-digit
pennies per share” after the Riverwoods, Illinois-based company
acquired the Diners Club franchise in Italy and a card-processing firm in Slovenia, Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf
said today at a conference in  New York  hosted by Deutsche Bank.  “It’s going to be one-time in nature,” Graf said.
“There’s no significant run-rate impacts going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
