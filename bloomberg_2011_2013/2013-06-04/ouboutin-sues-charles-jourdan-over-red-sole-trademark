Christian Louboutin Sarl sued Charles
Jourdan Fashion Footwear LLC claiming it infringed a trademark
for red-soled women’s shoes.  Jourdan supplied and shipped counterfeit shoes to retailers
in New York, Louboutin said in a filing today in federal court
in  Manhattan .  “Defendants were and are aware that the counterfeit
products they sell are not genuine Louboutin products,” Paris-based Louboutin said in its complaint.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled in September
that Louboutin has the right to trademark protection for women’s
shoes with red soles when the remainder of the shoe has a
different color. The decision came in a case brought against
Yves Saint Laurent America Inc.  Louboutin said in the complaint against Jourdan that the
counterfeit shoes were sold on the website of  DSW , or Designer
Shoe Warehouse, and at stores in Manhattan and  Brooklyn . It
seeks $2 million in damages for each mark that is infringed.  Rachel Taylor, a spokeswoman for Huntington Beach,
California-based Jourdan, didn’t respond to e-mails seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  Christian Louboutin, a French fashion designer, created his
brand with the lacquered red-soled shoes in 1992. They are
priced from $495 to $6,395 a pair, according to the complaint.  The case is Christian Louboutin SAS v. Charles Jourdan
Fashion Footwear LLC, 13-cv-3776, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
