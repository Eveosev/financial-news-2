Charley Hoffman, Rory Sabbatini and
two-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion Jordan Spieth headline a
group of 55 golfers who earned spots in next weekâ€™s U.S. Open

players such as Ryo Ishikawa, Robert Allenby, Ben Curtis, Ben Crane, David Duval and Justin Leonard.  Hoffman was 11-under-par through two rounds yesterday in
Columbus,  Ohio , the best score among the 120 golfers competing
for 15 U.S. Open spots. Sabbatini, Nicholas Thompson, David
Hearn, Robert Karlsson, Brandt Jobe and Aaron Baddeley were
among those who also qualified from Columbus.  Speith shot 8-under for two rounds in Dallas, tying with
Matt Weibring and Edward Loar for the best qualifying score.

playoff today to determine the last of the four U.S Open berths
from the  Dallas  sectional.  There were also sectional events held yesterday in Purchase,
New York; Springfield, Ohio; Ball Ground, Georgia; Bradenton,
