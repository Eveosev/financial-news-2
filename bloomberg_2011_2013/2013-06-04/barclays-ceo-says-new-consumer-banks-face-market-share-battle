Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer
 Antony Jenkins  said new entrants to Britain’s consumer-banking
market will find it hard to win market share as the Co-Operative
Bank Plc struggles to meet regulatory capital targets.  “The Co-Op is a great example of a worthy institution with
a lot of longevity in the U.K. that’s found that banking is
quite challenging,” he said at the Deutsche Bank Global
Financial Services Investor Conference in New York today.
Tighter regulation is making consumer banking “tough,” Jenkins
said.  Co-op, which traces its roots to Britain’s 19th-century
industrial north, had its  credit rating  cut six steps by Moody’s
Investors Service on May 9, which cited a capital shortfall for
its decision. Co-Operative Bank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio
under the latest round of Basel rules was 6.7 percent in
January, less than the 7 percent target of financial strength
set by U.K. regulators, Moody’s said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has pledged to
make it easier for new banks to get approval to operate.
Britain’s Prudential Regulation Authority, responsible for bank
supervision, will let new lenders trade with a capital ratio as
low as 4.5 percent, the minimum allowed under global standards,
in an attempt to revive banking competition, it said in March.  Britain’s four largest banks have about 75 percent of the
checking account market, the  Office of Fair Trading  said in
January.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
