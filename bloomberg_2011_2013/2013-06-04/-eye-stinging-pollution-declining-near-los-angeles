Threats to the Earth’s ozone and
“eye-stinging” airborne irritants are declining near the  Los
Angeles  area, the second-most-populous U.S.  region , according to
the  Journal of Geophysical Research .  Air pollution in the region has decreased even as the
population of Southern California tripled from 1960 through 2010
because of policies enacted to restrict nitrogen oxides and
other emissions , according to the  study  published online.  “L.A.’s air has lost a lot of its ‘sting,’” Ilana
Pollack, a Boulder, Colorado-based scientist from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Cooperative Institute
for Research in Environmental Sciences, said in a statement
today. The study “confirms that California’s policies to
control emissions have worked as intended.”  California said May 30 it will sell carbon allowances this
month to reduce further its output of  greenhouse gases  through a
cap-and-trade program. The  United Nations  is leading
negotiations among more than 190 countries seeking to achieve a
binding treaty by 2015 to limit the amount of greenhouse gases
released into the atmosphere.  Pollack, the study’s lead author, and her colleagues used
information collected from research aircraft and archived data
from roadside monitors “to produce a comprehensive study of air
pollution in the Los Angeles region,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
