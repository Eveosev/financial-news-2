Emirates, the biggest international
airline, said it’s studying plans to become the first completely
global carrier by picking up people in  Asia  and flying them over
the Pacific using the world’s largest roster of wide-body jets.  The Gulf operator’s fleet of Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos,
set to grow to 90 planes, could comfortably fly from northern
Asia to cities in the north and central U.S., as could  Boeing
Co. (BA) ’s 777-200LR, Emirates President  Tim Clark  said in  Cape Town .  “The last piece of the jigsaw is the trans-Pacific,”
Clark said in a strategy briefing. “Where we will go, when we
will do it, and with what, is under plan at the moment.”  Emirates serves 134 cities and has scope to double that,
aided by orders for extra A380s and Boeing’s new 777X, Clark
said. The carrier will be able to board people in Asia under
liberalized traffic rights secured by the United Arab Emirates.  “The open skies arrangement that the U.A.E. has with the
U.S. allows us to take passengers on a fifth-freedom basis from
the west coast and central points in the U.S. to points in
Asia,” he said. “On the other side of the equation we have
open skies with  Singapore ,  Thailand  and certain points in
 Japan .”  Clark said that the plan for Pacific flights doesn’t change
the aspirations of its business model, though these “have
morphed into being a truly global airline.”  777X Interest  The 777X will most likely be available from 2020 or 2021,
18 months later than initially promised, Clark said, after
Boeing decided to make the largest 787-10X Dreamliner available
from 2018 pending a formal program go-ahead.  The 777 upgrade, featuring a new wing and engines, as well
as larger windows and other cabin enhancements, should secure
“a few hundred” orders initially for Boeing, which began
formally marketing the model last months, Clark estimates.  “All the 777 operators are interested,” he said at the
International Air Transport Association meeting in  South Africa .  Emirates will likely buy both the 777-9, the larger model
due first, and the smaller 777-8 that could carry 300 passengers
on extremely long routes such as Sydney-Rome, he said.  Already the largest A380 customer, Emirates will order more
of the planes once airport infrastructure constraints in Dubai
are resolved around 2017, Clark said, adding that he remains
interested a stretched A380-900 that Airbus has not committed
to.  Wing Fixes  Capacity issues could impair growth in the near term as the
Dubai undergoes a “renaissance” after rebounding from the
slump that set in 2008, Clark said. Emirates’s hub is poised to
reach 90 million passengers three years ahead of a 2020 target.  Emirates is adding 44 planes this year after boosting its
fleet by 34 in 2012 as it lifted full-year net income 34 percent
to 3.1 billion dirhams ($840 million).  Growth in the next year will also be limited as Emirates
parks A380s to install a fix to failed wing parts that have led
to cracks. The airline has taken the first two affected jets out
of service, with two more to follow shortly, Clark said.  The retrofit program for the 34 A380s already delivered to
the airline should be completed by November 2014, with Airbus
seeking to cut the downtime from 56 days to 40-45, he said.  The start of the upgrade was delayed as Airbus continues to
struggle to meet delivery plans for new A380s, with some
handovers falling as many as two months behind plan, Clark said.  “The delivery stream has been slow,” Clark said, adding
that about seven A380s allocated to Emirates are “cluttering up
the ramp” at Airbus’s fit-out facility in Hamburg,  Germany .  To contact the reporters on this story:
