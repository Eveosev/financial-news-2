Vietnam ’s government bonds gained,
with the one-year yield sliding to the lowest level since 2006,
after borrowing costs fell at a bill auction. The dong was
little changed.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($95 million) of
364-day securities to yield 5.68 percent yesterday. That
compares with 6.03 percent at the previous offering on May 20.  “Investors have to look at relative yields of different
securities,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the fixed-income
department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in
Hanoi. “So when yields on the T-bills fall, bond yields also
drop.”  The  one-year  yield dropped 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, to 5.77 percent, the lowest level since July
2006, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.
The  five-year  yield fell nine basis points to 7.64 percent, the
least since August 2007.  The dong traded at 21,010 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 21,008 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
