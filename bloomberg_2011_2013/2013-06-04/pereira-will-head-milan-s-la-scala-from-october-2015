Alexander Pereira, the director of
the  Salzburg Festival , has been appointed head of La Scala in
Milan, a spokesman for Milan mayor Giuliano Pisapia said.  The native Viennese will share the role with the incumbent
Stephane Lissner until October 2015, when Lissner moves to the
Paris Opera after a 10-year stint in Milan, the spokesman said
by telephone. Pisapia met with members of La Scala’s board
today.  Born in Vienna in 1947, Pereira was director of the  Zurich
Opera  for 20 years. The Austrian cultural administrator, who
began his career in tourism, has held his position at Salzburg
since October 2011. His contract there runs until 2016.  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Warwick
Thompson  on U.K. theater,  Catherine Hickley  on art,  Mike Di
Paola  on preservation and  Amanda Gordon ’s Scene Last Night.  To contact the writers on the story:
