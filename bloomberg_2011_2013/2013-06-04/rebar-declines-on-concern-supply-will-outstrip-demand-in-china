Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell on concern that supply will continue to outstrip
demand.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,467  yuan  ($566) a
metric ton and was at 3,474 at 10:13 a.m. local time. Futures
gained 2 percent yesterday after falling for a fourth month in
May.  The steel industry’s purchasing manager’s index in May rose
to 46.8 from 45.1 in April, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday. The steel industry’s output index also expanded to 49
in May from 44.9 a month ago, it said.  “There’s no sign the  steel mills  are cutting production,
while previous expectations for stronger demand to help absorb
this supply hasn’t really materialized,” Li Jinlu, an analyst
at Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at the Tianjin port in
 China  rose for the first time in eight sessions yesterday,
advancing 1.4 percent to $111.90 a dry ton, according to the
Steel Index Ltd. The steel making ingredient fell to $110.40 a
dry ton on May 31, the lowest since October.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.7 percent to 3,444
yuan a ton yesterday, the lowest since September, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
