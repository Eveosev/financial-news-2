Indian (SENSEX)  stock futures swung between
gains and losses as overseas funds sold the most domestic shares
in two months amid signs the nation’s economy is slowing.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery fell 0.1
percent to 5,950 at 9:45 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index lost 0.8 percent to 5,939.30 yesterday. The S&P BSE
Sensex also dropped 0.8 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon
India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares increased 0.6 percent.  Indian stocks declined to a one-month low yesterday after
data showed factory production in May fell to the lowest in 50
months.  Gross domestic product  grew a decade-low 5 percent in
the 12 months ended March 31, official data showed May 31.
Overseas investors sold $88 million rupees of local stocks on
May 31, the biggest net outflow since April 9.  “The output and growth figures don’t augur well for
investor sentiment,” Jitendra Panda, head of broking at  Capital
First Ltd. (CAFL) , said in a phone interview yesterday. “Concerns that
overseas fund flows may taper off once monetary stimulus is
withdrawn is putting the markets on tenterhooks.”  U.S. stocks rallied yesterday amid speculation the Federal
Reserve will maintain its pace of monetary stimulus until
economic growth picks up, after data showed that manufacturing
unexpectedly contracted in May at the fastest pace in four
years.  The Sensex has slumped 3.3 percent since climbing to its
highest level since Jan. 5, 2011, on May 17. The measure has
still advanced 1 percent in 2013 as monetary easing by global
central banks boosted flows into emerging markets.  Foreign funds have bought a net $15.1 billion of Indian
shares this year, a record for the period and the second-biggest
in Asia this year after  Japan .  The Sensex is valued at 13.5 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.2
times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
