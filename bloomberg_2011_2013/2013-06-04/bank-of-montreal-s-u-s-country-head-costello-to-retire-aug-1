Bank of Montreal (BMO)  said Ellen Costello
is retiring as U.S. country head and will be succeeded by Chief
Auditor Chris Begy.  Costello, who’s also president and chief executive officer
of the lender’s U.S. holding unit BMO Financial Corp., will
leave Aug. 1, the Toronto-based lender said today in a
statement. She’s responsible for governance and regulatory
oversight for all of Bank of Montreal’s U.S. businesses.  Costello, 58, joined Bank of Montreal in 1983. She has held
various leadership roles in her 30-year career, including CEO of
the firm’s U.S. consumer-lending business, Harris Bank, between
2006 and 2011. Mark Furlong is currently CEO of the Chicago-based lender.  Begy, who joined the company 26 years ago, has led Bank of
Montreal’s corporate audit function since 2001 and held
leadership positions including corporate controller, finance and
chief accountant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
