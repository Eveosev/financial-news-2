Cocoa bean shipments from Sulawesi
island in  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest grower, fell to
the lowest in nine months because of expanding domestic demand.  Exports from South and Central Sulawesi provinces dropped 4
percent in May to 5,654 metric tons from 5,905 tons a month
earlier, according to the Indonesian Cocoa Association. Sales
were 7,412 tons in May last year.  Reduced supply from Indonesia may help sustain a rally in
prices of the chocolate ingredient in New York. Futures climbed
10 percent from this year’s low in March to $2,246 a metric ton
yesterday. Ivory Coast and  Ghana  are the biggest producers.  “It’s not surprising as most beans are processed by local
grinders now,” Dakhri Sanusi, secretary general of the
association, said from Makassar, South Sulawesi. “The era for
exporters has passed, now is the era for grinders. Output also
dropped because of lower yields from aging trees,” he said.  The Central and South Sulawesi provinces represent about 75
percent of bean exports and output from Indonesia. Shipments in
the first five months of the year rose 3.5 percent to 36,361
tons from year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
