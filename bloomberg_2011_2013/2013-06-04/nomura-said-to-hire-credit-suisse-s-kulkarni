Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s largest
brokerage, hired Ashwin Kulkarni as an executive director and
head of U.S. interest rate volatility trading, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the move.  Kulkarni was previously in charge of rates volatility
trading at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, according to the
person, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t
been made public. He will report to Jeff Michaels, head of macro
products in the Americas, the person said.  Nomura has been hiring and reassigning existing workers
amid a global push to increase fixed-income staff in Asia, the
Americas and Europe. The company, run by Chief Executive Officer
Koji Nagai, said in May it hired Eric Miller as head of
interest-rates sales for the Americas and Tom Haskins as head of
foreign-exchange sales for the region. Nomura also added Javier Kulesz as a managing director in its emerging-markets group,
according to a statement last month.  Kulkarni didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed message
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
