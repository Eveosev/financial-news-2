Euro-area  producer prices 
unexpectedly declined from a year earlier in April for the first
time since 2010, indicating inflation will slow more and adding
to arguments for further action by the  European Central Bank .  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation economy fell 0.2
percent after a 0.6 percent annual increase in March, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the first annual decline since February 2010, when prices
fell 0.6 percent. Economists had projected a 0.2 percent gain in
April, according to median of 16 estimates, in a  Bloomberg News
survey. (EUPPEMUY)   Euro-area annual consumer-price growth has been below the
ECB’s 2 percent ceiling since February, though the rate
accelerated to 1.4 percent in May. The ECB will keep its
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent when it meets on
June 6, according to the median of 59 economists in a separate
 Bloomberg survey .  “Our baseline scenario continues to be one of a very
 gradual recovery  starting in the latter part of this year,” ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday in  Shanghai . ‘There are a
few signs of a possible stabilization,” though the economic
outlook is “challenging,” he said.  The euro was little changed against the  U.S. dollar  after
the data, trading at $1.3073 at 11:04 a.m. in Brussels, up less
than 0.1 percent on the day.  Energy Costs  Energy costs at the producer level fell an annual 2 percent
in April after a 0.3 percent decline in the prior month, today’s
report showed. Prices of intermediate capital goods decreased
0.3 percent in April, while durable goods showed a 0.7 percent
gain.  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, producer-price
inflation slowed to 0.1 percent in April from 0.4 percent,
according to the report. French factory prices rose 0.6 percent,
while those in Spain declined 0.5 percent.  From a the prior month, April producer prices declined 0.6
percent. The March year-on-year increase was previously
estimated at 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
