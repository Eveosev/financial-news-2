The ruble climbed for a second day
against the dollar as the price of oil, the nation’s main
export, advanced.  The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2455 against the dollar,
and retreated 0.3 percent to 40.4150 versus the euro as of 3:23
p.m. in Moscow. Those movements left the currency of the world’s
biggest energy exporter little changed at 34.8234 against the
dollar-euro basket the central bank targets to smooth exchange-
rate moves that crimp exporter competitiveness.  Oil headed for a four-month high in  New York , trading up
0.2 percent at $94.47 a barrel. While central banker Alexei Ulyukayev warned yesterday that leading economies are on the
brink of a “currency war,” the regulator bought 15.3 billion
rubles ($506 million) of foreign currency at the start of the
year to weaken the ruble after it jumped the most in four months
on Jan. 9, the first day of trading.  The currency now trades 17 kopeks weaker than the 34.65
level against the basket at which policy makers intervene to
curb its gains, according to Ivan Sinelnikov, an analyst at OAO
Gazprombank.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 159,
according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government yields rose two basis points to 6.4498
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
