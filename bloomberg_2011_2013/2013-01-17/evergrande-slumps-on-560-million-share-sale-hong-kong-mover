Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
 China ’s biggest developer by sales volume, fell by the most in
five months in Hong Kong trading after it announced a share
placement.  The  stock  fell 6 percent to HK$4.35 as of 11:27 a.m. local
time, set for its biggest drop since Aug. 15. The company is
seeking to place 1 billion shares at HK$4.35 each. The developer
will use the HK$4.35 billion ($560 Million) raised to repay debt
and for working capital, it said in a statement to Hong Kong
stock exchange today.  “Investors’ reaction is a one off as the placement
improves the company’s balance sheet,” said Alan Jin, a Hong
Kong-based property analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. by
phone today. “The placement probably is the best way for
Evergrande to raise funds as it aims to improve its gearing.”  Chinese developers are seeking financing for more sites as
the land market recovers. China’s Ministry of Land and Resources
said this week that it expected the country’s urban land prices
to rise “moderately” this year.  Shanghai  sold the year’s most
expensive plot for 5.4 billion yuan last month.  KWG Property Holding Ltd. (1813) , the Hong Kong-listed developer
whose projects include the five-star Sheraton Huadu Resort in
 Guangzhou , is offering perpetual notes that yield about 10.25
percent, a person familiar with the matter said this week. The
company is the second Chinese developer to sell perpetual bonds
this year after  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  raised $700 million
from a sale of 8.25 percent notes last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fund raising helps improve the balance sheet and provides
more funding for land acquisitions, wrote David Ng, a Hong Kong-
based property analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd., in a note
today.  The gross proceeds raised should help improve Evergrande’s
net gearing by 9 percentage points, while its latest net gearing
for December is expected to be 75 percent, according to Ng.  Evergrande targets sales this year of 100 billion  yuan , 25
percent higher than the target in 2012, it announced in a stock
exchange statement this week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
