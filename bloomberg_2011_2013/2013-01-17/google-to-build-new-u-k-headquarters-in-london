Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
search engine, purchased 2.4 acres next to King’s Cross rail
station in London to build a new U.K. headquarters, according to
a joint statement today.  Google expects to move into the 1 million square-foot
(92,900 square-meter) building in 2015 after buying the site
from King’s Cross Central LP, according to the statement.
Construction will start at the end of this year, subject to
approval by the borough of Camden, the  Mountain View ,
California-based company said in the joint statement.  “This is a big investment by Google,” Matt Brittin,
Google’s vice president for Northern and  Central Europe , said in
the statement. “We’re committing further to the U.K. -- where
computing and the web were invented.”  The King’s Cross area is being revived by King’s Cross
Central as part of a plan to develop 67 acres of land by
building 1,900 new homes and enough office and retail space for
35,000 jobs. More than half of the business space there has been
finished or leased prior to completion, according to the
statement.  British lawmakers criticized Google as well as other U.S.
companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Starbucks Corp. last year
for using complex accounting methods to reduce tax liabilities
in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
