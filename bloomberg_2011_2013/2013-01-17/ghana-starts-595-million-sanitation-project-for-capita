Ghana  has started a $595 million
project to improve sanitation, sewerage and storm-water drainage
in the capital, Accra, a growing city where more than a third of
households use public toilets.  The five-year project will be carried out by the Accra
Metropolitan Assembly, the city authority, in partnership with
Conti Infrastructure Ghana Ltd., the local unit of Edison, New
Jersey-based Conti Group.  The project will “alleviate the flooding and insanitary
conditions” in the city, according to an e-mailed statement
from President John Dramani Mahama’s office today.  The Export-Import Bank of the United States, the World Bank
and Standard Chartered Plc will finance the project, the state-
owned Ghana News Agency reported.  Accra’s population grew 28 percent to 4 million in the
decade to 2010, according to the nation’s census. Of the
capital’s 1.04 million households, 34 percent use public
washrooms while 8.2 percent have no toilet facilities, according
to the study conducted by the Ghana Statistical Service.  Ghana has West Africa’s second-biggest economy, worth $39
billion, and is the world’s second-largest producer of cocoa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
