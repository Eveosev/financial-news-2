Rafael Nadal will return to tennis
at next month’s  Chile  Open, the 11-time Grand Slam champion and
tournament organizers said.  The Spaniard, who’s been sidelined since June by injury and
illness, will play at the clay-court tournament that begins Feb.
4 in Vina del Mar, according to the event’s website.  “I am delighted to confirm my participation at the Vina
del Mar tournament in Chile,” Nadal, 26, posted on his  Twitter 
account. “I have many fans in the Andean country. I will
finally be able to go there to be with them in person and play
my first tournament after an injury that has kept me away for so
long.”  Nadal, who was suffering from a partially torn patella
tendon and knee inflammation, hasn’t played competitively since
losing in the second round of Wimbledon. He also missed a
tournament in Abu Dhabi last month and the Australian Open,
currently under way in  Melbourne , because of a stomach
infection.  After Chile, Nadal will play at the Brazil Open, which
begins Feb. 11 in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
