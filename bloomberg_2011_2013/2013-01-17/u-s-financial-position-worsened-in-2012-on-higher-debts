The U.S. government’s net financial
position worsened to a $16.1 trillion  deficit  in fiscal 2012
from $14.8 trillion the previous year, the Treasury Department
said today in its annual assessment of the government’s assets
and liabilities.  “Our current fiscal challenges are not, of course, the
only economic obstacle facing the  United States ,” Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said in the report. “While the
economy has expanded and businesses are investing and hiring,
our efforts must continue to strengthen growth long into the
future.  ‘‘This will require economic policies that protect middle-
class families, promote retirement security, and reduce the
deficit in a balanced fashion in order to preserve room for the
investments that spur economic growth,’’ Geithner said.  Debt held by the public and accrued interest contributed
$11.3 trillion to the deficit, up from $10.2 trillion in 2011,
according to the report.  The Treasury’s financial report of the U.S. government is a
broader look at the nation’s finances than the primarily cash-
based accounting that is usually used to analyze the  federal
budget . The government budget deficit for the year ended in
September 2012 was $1.09 trillion, the fourth-largest since
World War II, the Treasury said on Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
