Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will present his road map for the euro area at a
meeting of finance chiefs on Jan. 21,  Germany ’s DPA news agency
reported, citing Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.  Dijsselbloem will explain “how he intends to craft the
itinerary for the next few years,” Juncker told DPA in an
interview published today. “There’s a desire, and this desire
is understandable, that the upcoming Eurogroup chief submit a
program. I did that in January 2010.”  Juncker, who reiterated his intention to step down as head
of the group of euro-area finance ministers before the end of
this month, said Dec. 19 that he had “reason to believe” the
Dutchman could be his successor.  Juncker’s comments came in response to  concerns  raised by
French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici about the process used
to find the new Eurogroup head. Moscovici criticized
Dijsselbloem for not having outlined his vision for economic and
financial policies, and said a decision wouldn’t be made until
February, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported today.  “The succession process is the correct one,” Juncker told
DPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
