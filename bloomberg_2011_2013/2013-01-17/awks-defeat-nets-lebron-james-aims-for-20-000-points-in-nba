LeBron James  became the youngest
player to score 20,000 points in the National Basketball
Association, while the Atlanta Hawks won for the first time in
three starts to end the Brooklyn Nets’ seven-game unbeaten run.  James, at 28 years, 17 days, reached 20,001 career points
on a short jump shot with two minutes, 45 seconds to play in the
first half against the Golden State Warriors (23-14) last night
at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.  James, who needed 18 points to hit the mark, finished with
25 points and 10 assists as his Miami Heat (25-12) won 92-75.
The Hawks, who had lost six of their previous seven games, never
trailed against the Nets and led by as many as 26 points during
the 109-95 victory at Philips Arena in Atlanta.  Kobe Bryant  of the Los Angeles Lakers, at 28 years, 122
days, is now the second youngest of the 38 players to score at
least 20,000 points in the NBA.  James joined the club in his 726th regular-season game,
placing him seventh on the list in that measure behind Wilt Chamberlain, who needed 499 games,  Michael Jordan  (620), Oscar Robertson (671), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (684), Elgin Baylor (711)
and Allen Iverson (713).  Shaquille O’Neal  did it in 727 games.  Jeff Teague  led the Hawks with 28 points and 11 assists,
Devin Harris added 18 points and  Al Horford  had 17 points and 13
rebounds.  The Nets converted four of 26 3-point attempts, or 15
percent, while Atlanta made eight of 21, a 38 percent success
rate.  The Nets (23-16) are second in the Eastern Conference’s
Atlantic division, two games behind the New York Knicks (24-13),
who play the Detroit Pistons in London today.  Atlanta (22-16) trails Miami by 3 1/2 games in the
Southeast division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
