India ’s rupee fell for a third day
on speculation local refiners stepped up dollar purchases to pay
for costlier crude imports.  Oil prices in New York have climbed 9 percent since the end
of October, heading for a third monthly advance. Asia’s third-
biggest economy imports more than 75 percent of its energy
needs. India’s current-account deficit widened to a record $22
billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, official data showed on
Dec. 31. The currency’s decline was limited by speculation gains
in the nation’s stocks will attract investors.  “The rupee weakened, weighed by dollar demand from oil
firms,” foreign-exchange analysts at Marex Spectron Group Ltd.
wrote in a report. “Gains in domestic shares helped sentiment
for the rupee.”  The rupee fell 0.1 percent to 54.75 per dollar as of 9:50
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, rose five basis
points to 9.80 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares rose through 20,000
this week for the first time since January 2011, and climbed 0.3
percent today on speculation the central bank and the government
will boost efforts to spur the economy.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 55.75 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 55.79
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
