Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , the
biggest investor in the U.K. stock market, appointed former
Resolution Plc executive Wadham Downing as merger and
acquisitions director as it prepares for small deals.  Downing, 45, who worked for Britannic Group before it
merged with Clive Cowdery’s Resolution, takes the newly created
job after serving as interim chief financial officer at the
insurer, London-based Legal & General said in a statement today.  The firm will pursue “a selective mergers and acquisition
strategy meeting strict and attractive criteria,” Chief
Executive Officer Nigel Wilson said in the statement. Wilson
said he is looking for “bolt-on” acquisitions on Aug. 7.  Legal & General has been raising its dividend and
generating more cash for investors over the past three years by
exiting unprofitable businesses and focusing on growing its
annuities and savings divisions, which have higher profit
margins. Wilson said he plans to use some of this cash for small
acquisitions in areas such as non-life insurance and digital
savings technology.  Legal & General’s last acquisition was Suffolk Life, a firm
specializing in self-invested personal pensions, in 2008. It
paid 62 million pounds ($99 million) for the company.  The insurer’s search for a permanent CFO to replace Wilson,
who was promoted to CEO in June, is proceeding “according to
plan,” it said in the statement.  The  stock  rose 1.5 percent to 151.3 pence a share at 3:13
p.m. in  London , valuing the firm at about 8.9 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
