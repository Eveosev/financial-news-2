Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
a Canadian pension-fund manager with about C$70 billion ($71
billion) in assets, expects 2013 to be a “challenging” year
with bond returns declining, said Chief Executive Officer Leo de Bever.  The portfolio of AIMCo, as the  Edmonton , Alberta-based fund
is known, will grow about 6 percent this year after 10 percent
growth in 2012, de Bever said in a briefing with journalists in
Calgary today. Central banks have added liquidity to economies
which has driven up asset prices, including bonds and real
estate, he said.  “Last year was a very confusing year and I have this idea
that 2013 will be very similar,” de Bever said. Equities will
probably outperform bonds, he said.  “Going forward, things get more and more dicey for
bonds,” he said. “I only see two scenarios there - a bad one
and a really bad one. If I look out over a period of 5 years,
stock returns are going to be higher than bond returns.”  Austerity policies in  Europe  are failing to lift growth in
economies like  Spain , he said. As countries begin a process of
re-regulating the banking industry, AIMCo is buying up assets
from financial organizations like re-insurance and
infrastructure financing businesses.  AIMCo has focused on investments in food, energy and
materials, as well as technology de Bever said. The fund aims to
invest in “enabling technology” that helps companies reduce
costs and improve efficiencies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
