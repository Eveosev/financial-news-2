Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , fell the most in more than a month
in Stockholm trading as Barclays Plc said it’s concerned about
the company’s reliance on European markets.  Scania declined as much as 1.6 percent, its steepest
intraday drop since Dec. 13, and fell 0.4 percent to 137.4
kronor at 1:12 p.m. local time. Today’s trading volume was less
than 40 percent of the three-month daily average.  Michael Tyndall  and Kristina Church, London-based analysts
at Barclays, today cut Scania shares to underweight from equal-
weight with a new share price estimate of 113 kronor.  Europe ,
where demand is slumping amid the sovereign debt crisis, rising
unemployment and austerity measures, accounted for 60 percent of
Scania’s third-quarter sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Tyndall and Church said they’re “uneasy” about a
number of factors at Scania, they said.  “Much as we want to be positive on Scania, we can’t get
around the valuation, its geographic bias to ailing Europe and
the changing competitive environment,” they wrote in a note to
clients today. “We struggle to see much volume improvement in
2013 and also wonder how an aging R-Series, its main product,
will fair against a newish Mercedes Actros and new Volvo FH.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
