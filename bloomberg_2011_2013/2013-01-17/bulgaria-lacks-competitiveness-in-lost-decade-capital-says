Bulgaria  needs wages and prices to
fall further to increase competitiveness and help economic
output return to pre-crisis levels, Capital Economics Ltd. said.  Bulgaria’s fixed exchange rate has left the lev about 10
percent overvalued when adjusted for inflation, stifling
exports,  Neil Shearing  and Lisa Ermolenko, economists at London-
based Capital, wrote today in an e-mailed note. Gross domestic
product is 5 percent below its 2008 peak and will only reach
that level again in 2015, they said.  “The lack of competitiveness means growth is likely to
remain extremely weak for years to come,” Capital wrote. “By
the time Bulgaria’s output returns to its pre-crisis peak, the
economy may have lost close to a decade of growth.”  Bulgaria’s economy has struggled because of ties to the
euro region’s weakest economies, with Greece and  Italy  buying a
fifth of exports and controlling about half of banking assets.
Even amid a freeze on public-sector wages, nominal gross  wages 
have risen 50 percent since 2008, while prices have advanced 15
percent, according to Shearing and Ermolenko.  While the the poorest European Union member grew more than
6 percent a year before 2008, it will  stagnate  this year before
returning to 2 percent to 3 percent expansion, Capital
forecasts. To boost growth rates to 3 percent to 4 percent
during the next decade, the government must attract investment
by cutting bureaucracy and corruption, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
