The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia from non-payment fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased two basis points to 109 basis
points as of 8:19 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The measure has declined 4.4 basis
points this year, after sliding 93 in 2012, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped two basis points to
140 as of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark has fallen 19 basis points this year, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 116
as of 11:20 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. prices. The gauge has retreated 11.5 since Dec. 31,
extending a 53 basis-point drop in 2012, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
