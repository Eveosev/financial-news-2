France  may need to take additional
measures to tackle its  budget deficit , European Union Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “Important steps have been taken which include
consolidation measures aimed at bringing the deficit to 3
percent of GDP, measures on competitiveness to lower in
particular the fiscal burden on companies and the on-going
negotiation to reform the labor code,” Rehn said in a written
response to a question from the European Parliament. “In many
cases, these reforms are still at a very early stage and
additional efforts might still be needed.”  The French government “needs to undertake wide-ranging
structural reforms to ensure a sustainable return to growth and
to continue fiscal consolidation efforts to bring the excessive
deficit procedure to an end,” Rehn said in the response, which
is dated Jan. 16.  “The increasing unemployment also calls for specific
attention,” Rehn said. “Finally, the deterioration of export
competitiveness has resulted in serious external imbalances.”  At the same time, Rehn noted that “the yield on French
bonds has decreased over the last year, reflecting the high
confidence of investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
