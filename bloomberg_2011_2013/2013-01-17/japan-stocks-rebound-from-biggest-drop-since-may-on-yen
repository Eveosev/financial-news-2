Japanese shares rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  paring the biggest loss since May
yesterday, as the yen reversed gains to fall against most its
major counterparts.  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  dropped on concern about its
lithium-ion batteries.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that gets about 70 percent
of its sales outside Japan, rose 1.3 percent.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  led
gains on the Nikkei 225 on a report it may sell a television
factory in  China  to Lenovo Group Ltd. GS Yuasa, a supplier of
batteries to Boeing 787 planes, dropped 5 percent after U.S.
regulators ordered airlines to prove the batteries are safe.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent to close at 10,609.64 in
 Tokyo  after falling as much as 1.6 percent and gaining as much
as 0.9 percent. The gauge declined 2.6 percent yesterday, the
biggest drop since May 18. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.3
percent to 890.46.  “The stock market has become nervous about currency
moves,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at
Daiwa Securities Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage.
“It’s not that we have outstanding factors to the market, but
the market is becoming more volatile.”  The Topix capped the longest weekly advance since 1989 on
Jan. 11 after a new government announced a 10.3 trillion yen
($117 billion) stimulus package. Japan’s broadest measure of
equity performance rose 24 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced, through Jan. 11. The yen fell 10 percent against
the dollar in the period.  Yen Declines  The Topix is trading at 1.05 times book value, compared
with 2.20 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.59 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stocks advanced as the yen fell against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas earnings
at Japanese exporters. Toyota gained 1.3 percent to 4,210 yen.
 Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory robots that generates 76 percent
of its sales outside Japan, rose 1.5 percent to 14,670 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index dropped 0.2 percent today
after the benchmark gauge was little changed yesterday as a
reduction of the World Bank’s global growth forecasts offset a
rally in Apple Inc. shares.  GS Yuasa Drops  GS Yuasa declined 5 percent to 305 yen after the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to prove that
lithium-ion batteries in Boeing 787 Dreamliners “are safe and
in compliance.” A 787 operated by All Nippon Airways Co.
yesterday made an emergency landing after pilots saw smoke in
the cockpit and a Japan Airlines Co. Dreamliner had a battery
fire last week. Both carriers have grounded their 787 fleets.  Sharp gained 7.3 percent to 338 yen after the Nikkei
newspaper said the company may sell a TV factory to Lenovo and
form a China sales venture with the PC maker.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 0.4 percent
to 22.32, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
