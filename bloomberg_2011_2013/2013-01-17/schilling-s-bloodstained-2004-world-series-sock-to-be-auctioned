The bloodstained sock worn by former
Boston Red Sox pitcher  Curt Schilling  during the 2004  World
Series  will be put up for sale next month and may
bring in at least $100,000, auction organizers said.  Schilling pitched with stitches in his right ankle to
stabilize an injured tendon and helped lead Boston to its first
World Series championship in 86 years. Blood from the wound
seeped into his white sock, which has been on display at the
National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, since
2004.  Schilling, 46, is putting the piece of Boston sports
history up for auction eight months after his video-game
company, 38 Studios LLC, went bankrupt and left Rhode Island
taxpayers responsible for a $75 million state loan.  Chris Ivy, director of sports memorabilia at Dallas-based
Heritage Auctions, said Schilling’s sock represents the
“physical incarnation of the exorcism” of the so-called Curse
of the Bambino, a jinx that Boston fans blamed on the sale of
 Babe Ruth  to the  New York Yankees  for $100,000 in 1920.  Heritage Auctions sold the so-called Buckner Ball in April
for $420,000. The baseball rolled between the legs of former Red
Sox first baseman  Bill Buckner  for an error that precipitated
Boston’s 1986 World Series loss to the New York Mets.  “We thought this was a great opportunity to balance the
scales and give collectors a chance to decide which moment is
worth more,” Ivy said in a statement.  Two Socks  Schilling’s sock, worn in Game 2 of Boston’s World Series
sweep of the  St. Louis Cardinals , will be put up for online
bidding on Feb. 4, with a minimum price of $25,000. The sale
will culminate with a live auction on Feb. 23 in New York.  Schilling had two bloody socks from games he pitched in the
2004 postseason. The one he wore during his Game 6 win against
the Yankees in the American League Championship Series was
thrown away. The image of Schilling’s bloodstained sock was
transferred onto posters that hung throughout New England.  A six-time All-Star, Schilling retired from  Major League
Baseball  in 2009 after a 23-year playing career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
