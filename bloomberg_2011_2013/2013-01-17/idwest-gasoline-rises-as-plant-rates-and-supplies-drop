The discount for spot gasoline in
the U.S. Midwest narrowed to the smallest against futures in
almost a month as refineries processed  less crude-oil  and
inventories fell.  Refiners in the region known as  PADD 2  processed  3.39
million barrels  a day of crude and other feedstock in the week
ended Jan. 11, down 0.6 percent from a week earlier, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a division of the
Energy Department. Stockpiles of gasoline in the region
retreated 969,000 barrels to  54.4 million .  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reported a release yesterday at the
238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet,  Illinois , refinery, the fifth-
largest in the region, a filing with state regulators showed.  The discount for  conventional gasoline  in the Midwest, or
Group 3 region, narrowed 1 cent to 23.5 cents a gallon versus
gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
4:15 p.m. East Coast time. That’s the  smallest discount  since
Dec. 19. CBOB, or 85-octane gasoline to be blended with ethanol,
gained 4.5 cents in Chicago to trade at a discount of 26.5 cents
a gallon.  Refinery margins, or cracks spreads, in the U.S.
Midcontinent have dropped to the lowest levels in almost a year.
The  3-2-1 crack spread  between WTI Midland crude and
Midcontinent gasoline and diesel narrowed $2.257 a barrel to
$23.787, the lowest since Feb. 29.  The spread between conventional gasoline on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and the Midwest narrowed 2.25 cents to 8.25 cents a gallon
after reaching a four-year high of 33 cents on Jan. 8.  Diesel Fuel  The discount for  ultra-low sulfur diesel  in the
Midcontinent narrowed 0.63 cent to 3.25 cents a gallon below
heating oil futures.  The same fuel  in  Chicago  narrowed 2 cents
to 11.5 cents below futures.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
U.S. Gulf Coast widened 1.25 cents to 15.25 cents a gallon
against futures after Motiva Enterprises LLC was said to be
restarting the 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit at the  Port
Arthur ,  Texas , refinery.  The unit waas expected to be processing as much as 200,000
barrels a day by the end of the weekend, two people familiar
with operations at the refinery said. The plant replaced two 8-
to 10-foot (2.4-to-3-meter) sections of a 14-inch (35.6-
centimeter) diameter pipe to fix a recurring leak, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
