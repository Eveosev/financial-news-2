Thomas Jones, who retired a year ago
after 12 seasons as a running back in the  National Football
League , will allow his brain to be studied after his death for
evidence of disease caused by repeated head injuries,  ESPN said .  Jones told the broadcaster he will donate the organ to the
Sports Legacy Institute, which will look for signs of chronic
traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.  In 180 games for the  Arizona  Cardinals, Tampa Bay
Buccaneers,  Chicago Bears ,  New York  Jets and Kansas City Chiefs,
Jones rushed for 10,591 yards and 68 touchdowns. He told ESPN he
didn’t know how many concussions he suffered.  Jones’s company, Independently Major Entertainment Films,
is editing a six-part documentary series, “The NFL: The Gift or
the Curse?” The first episode deals with concussions and
suicide, ESPN said.  Former linebacker Junior Seau’s family revealed Jan. 10
that his brain showed evidence of CTE when he committed suicide
in May. Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowl selection who played the last
of his 20 NFL seasons in 2009, was 43 at the time of his death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
