The euro approached a 10-month high
against the dollar after Spain’s borrowing costs fell at a 4.5
billion-euro ($6 billion) sale of bonds, underscoring increased
confidence in European debt markets.  The shared currency rose versus all of its 16 major peers,
while the yen slid to the weakest since 2010 against the dollar
as Nikkei newspaper said the  Bank of Japan (8301)  is preparing to ease
policy next week. The Swiss franc fell to the lowest versus the
euro since the nation’s central bank imposed an exchange-rate
cap in September 2011.  Mexico ’s peso advanced as economic data
beat forecasts in the U.S., the nation’s biggest trade partner.  “We’re in a real grinding risk-on environment,” Dan Dorrow, head of research in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Faros
Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview. “The tail risks in
the  euro zone  seem to be mitigated because bond sales are doing
well for them. There’s more confidence in the market.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.3376 at 5 p.m. New York
time. It touched $1.3404 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since
Feb. 29. The euro rose 2.4 percent to 120.21 yen and touched
120.61, the highest since May 4, 2011.  Japan ’s currency dropped
as much as 2 percent to 90.13 per dollar, the weakest since June
23, 2010, before trading at 89.88, down 1.7 percent.  Implied  volatility  climbed for a third day, reaching the
highest in more than four months. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G7
 Volatility Index , based on three-month options on Group of Seven
nations’ currencies, touched 8.97 percent, the most since Aug.
31, exceeding its 200-day moving average of 8.74 percent. It
fell to 7.06 on Dec. 18, the lowest since August 2007.  Franc Weakens  Switzerland ’s currency slid against most major peers as
speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing sapped demand for
haven assets. The franc weakened as much as 1 percent to 1.2490
per euro before trading at 1.2476, down 0.9 percent. The  Swiss
National Bank  capped the currency at 1.20 per euro after it
surged to 1.008 per euro in August 2011.  “People are going back into risk assets,” Eimear Daly, a
currency-market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. in  London , said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Guy Johnson . “People were so concerned about risk and were holding
the Swiss franc as a highly liquid asset; now the fear has
abated.”  Peso Gains  The  Mexican peso  climbed to a 10-month high versus the
dollar after U.S.  housing starts  rose 12.1 percent last month,
more than forecast, to a 954,000 annual rate, the most since
June 2008.  Initial claims  for  unemployment benefits  fell last
week to 335,000, the lowest level since January 2008, the
government also reported.  The peso gained 0.5 percent to 12.5556 per dollar, the
strongest since March 14, before trading at 12.5867.  Scandinavian currencies rose versus the greenback as
investors sought riskier assets. Sweden’s krona added 0.2
percent to 6.4926 to the greenback, and the Danish krone gained
0.7 percent to 5.5792.  Stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advancing
0.6 percent.  Australia ’s dollar slid versus most major counterparts
after a report showed employers in the country unexpectedly cut
payrolls last month, adding to concern the domestic economy is
slowing. Employment fell by 5,500 in December, compared with
economist estimates for a 4,000-job increase.  The Aussie lost 0.3 percent to $1.0546. It climbed as much
as 1.7 percent to 95.02 yen, the highest since August 2008.  Spanish Bonds  The euro strengthened as  Spain  sold 2.409 billion euros of
3.75 percent 2015 notes at an average yield of 2.713 percent,
down from 3.358 percent at the previous sale in December.  The shared currency rose 2.5 percent over the past three
months in a basket of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar lost 0.1
percent, and the yen slid 13 percent in the worst performance.  The yen dropped today, erasing a two-day rally before the
Bank of Japan reviews its 1 percent inflation goal at a Jan. 21-
22 meeting. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for the target
to be doubled as he works to spur economic growth.  BOJ and government officials reached basic agreement on a
joint statement calling for a 2 percent inflation target and
additional funds for purchasing assets, Nikkei reported without
attribution.  “The market is waiting to see what measures are introduced
next week,” said Antje Praefcke, a senior currency strategist
in  Frankfurt  at Commerzbank AG. “We think that they have to
deliver at their meeting.”  Yen Outlook  The yen will depreciate to 95 per dollar in the next six
months, Praefcke predicted. It last traded at that level in
August 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Japanese currency has found resistance this week at the
87.80-per-dollar level, which implies it now may continue
weakening, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote today in a client note. It might
continue to decline through a support level at 89.67 and then to
90.84, Bain said, which would be its weakest since June 2010.  Resistance refers to an area on a chart where sell orders
may be gathered, and support is where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
