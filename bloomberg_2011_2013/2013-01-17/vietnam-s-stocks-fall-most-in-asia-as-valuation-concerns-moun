Vietnamese  stocks  dropped the most
in Asia on concern the benchmark index’s surge to an eight-month
high was excessive relative to earnings prospects.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  slid 1.8 percent, the biggest drop since Nov.
2, to 456.76 at the close in  Ho Chi Minh City . It settled
yesterday at the highest level since May 14.  Vietnam Dairy
Products Joint-Stock Co. (VNM) , the biggest company by market value,
lost 1.5 percent. PetroVietnam Gas Corp. fell 3.9 percent.  The VN Index gauge rallied 24 percent through yesterday
from last year’s low on Nov. 2 after the central bank cut
 interest rates  and the State Securities Commission said it may
increase the foreign-ownership cap on some companies. The index
traded at 12.9 times reported profit yesterday, the  highest
level  since January 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The index is under profit-taking pressure and even the
most bullish investors don’t want to buy at the current price
levels,” Le Chi Phuc, investment director at SGI Capital, a
unit of Saigon Invest Group, said by phone today. “Given
historical earnings, or expected earnings in a short term,
valuations are no longer so cheap.”  The Vietnamese stock gauge’s 14-day  relative strength
index , a measure of how rapidly prices have risen or fallen in
that period, was at 76 today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the 16th straight day the level has been above
the 70 reading some traders use as a signal to sell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
