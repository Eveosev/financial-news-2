Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , a U.S. biofuel
company, lowered its borrowing costs with a 245.7 million-real
($120 million) loan from  Brazil ’s national development agency
BNDES for a plant it’s building in the South American country.  The funding “represents a sharp reduction in the cost of
capital compared to typical clean-technology financings,”
Laurence Alexander, an analyst with Jefferies Group Inc. in New
York, said in a research note today. It’s “a significant
milestone for both Solazyme and the biochemicals industry.”  Solazyme Bunge Renewable Oils, a joint venture with  Bunge
Ltd. (BG) , is paying about 4 percent interest for the eight-year
loan, South San Francisco, California-based Solazyme said in a
statement yesterday.  Alexander rates Solazyme a buy, with a 12-month price
target of $23. Shares fell 9.2 percent to $6.88 at the close in
 New York .  Solazyme makes oils from sugar-consuming algae that are
processed into fuel and specialty chemicals.  The companies broke ground in June on the commercial-scale
plant, which is expected to be begin production in the fourth
quarter. The facility is adjacent to Bunge’s Moema sugar-cane
mill in Sao Paulo state.  The funding is part of a joint program between the
development agency, formally Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social, and the country’s research-financing agency
 FINEP  to encourage investment in sugar-based energy and chemical
projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
