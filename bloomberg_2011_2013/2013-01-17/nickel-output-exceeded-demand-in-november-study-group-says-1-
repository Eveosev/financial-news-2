Refined nickel production increased
to 153,100 metric tons in November, exceeding demand of 142,600
tons, the International Nickel Study Group said.  Demand was up from 141,200 tons in October when output was
148,700 tons, the Lisbon-based study group said in a report e-
mailed today.  For the 11 months last year, production was 1.574 million
tons compared with demand of 1.506 million tons, for a surplus
of 68,000 tons, according to the figures. In the same period in
2011, output was 1.47 million tons compared with demand of 1.478
million tons, for a shortage of 8,000 tons, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
