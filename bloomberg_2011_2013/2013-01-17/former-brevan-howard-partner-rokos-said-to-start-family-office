Chris Rokos, the  Brevan Howard  Asset
Management LLP co-founder who left the firm last year, has
started a family office to manage his own money, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  Rokos, 42, has set up the office in London, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the firm is
private. Rokos announced his retirement in August from Brevan
Howard,  Europe ’s second-largest hedge fund with $39 billion of
assets under management.  He started London-based Brevan Howard in 2002 with four
other traders from Credit Suisse Group AG’s proprietary fixed-
income trading desk, including Alan Howard. The Sunday Times
estimated Rokos has a personal fortune of 230 million pounds
($368 million), in an article published in April.  Rokos declined to comment about what he’s been doing since
leaving Brevan Howard. His LinkedIn profile lists him as working
at a  London  family office focused on investment management.
Rokos’ family-office plans were reported earlier by Reuters.  A non-compete agreement between Rokos and Brevan Howard
restricts him from managing money for outside clients for a
certain period of time, said the person. He hasn’t yet decided
what he will do once the agreement lapses, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
