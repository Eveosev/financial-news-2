The soft wheat area in  France , the
European Unionâ€™s largest grower, may be 1.6 percent bigger this
year than in 2012, while fields planted in rapeseed decline,
FranceAgriMer said.  Soft wheat planting, including winter and spring varieties,
may total 4.949 million hectares (12.23 million acres) this
season, compared with 4.871 million hectares a year ago, the
Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based crop office said in a  report 
on its website dated Jan. 15. Durum wheat, a hard variety of the
grain used to make pasta, will be sown on about 406,815
hectares, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the
report.  Rapeseed planting may total 1.489 million hectares, down
7.1 percent from 1.602 million hectares a year earlier,
FranceAgriMer said. Barley sowing was pegged at 1.083 million
hectares, up 10 percent from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
