Gold traded little changed near a
two-week high as investors weighed concern about slowing global
economic growth and expectations for more stimulus. Palladium
was near the highest level since September 2011.  Spot gold was at $1,680.05 an ounce at 10:29 a.m. in
 Singapore  from $1,679.95 yesterday. The metal reached $1,685.25
on Jan. 15, the most expensive since Jan. 3, as U.S. lawmakers
wrangled over increasing the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling. Since
1960, Congress has raised or revised the debt limit 79 times,
including 49 times under Republican presidents, according to the
Treasury Department.  Gold gained 7.1 percent in 2012, rallying for a 12th year,
as central banks around the world took measures to boost their
economies. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  may introduce new monetary easing
measures at a meeting next week. The World Bank on Jan. 15 cut
its global growth estimate to 2.4 percent from 3 percent.  “Global economic data remains mixed and uncertainty over
the U.S. debt ceiling continues to weigh on investor
sentiment,” said Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at
Everbright Futures Co., a unit of one of  China ’s largest state-
owned investment companies. “Gold is torn between its role as a
haven and its association with other risky assets.”  Gold for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,679.60 an
ounce on the Comex in New York.  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity retreated 0.1 percent
to 337.30  yuan  a gram ($1,686.16 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange. Volumes for benchmark cash contract were 10,496
kilograms (10.5 metric tons) yesterday, more than double the
daily average in 2012, according to the bourse’s website and
data tracked by Bloomberg.  Palladium Rallies  Cash palladium rose as much as 0.4 percent to $725.25 an
ounce before trading at $721.25. The price touched $727.50
yesterday, the costliest since Sept. 19, 2011. Palladium, used
in autocatalysts, is expected to outperform platinum as demand
outpaces supplies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The majority of growth in the global automotive sector is
coming from gasoline markets like the U.S. and China, Goldman
analysts wrote in a report yesterday. Carmakers typically use
more palladium for gasoline engines and more platinum for diesel
types. Palladium will continue to substitute platinum in diesel
markets and tighter emissions regulations in  Europe  will see a
shift back to gasoline there, the analysts wrote.  Spot platinum slid 0.2 percent to $1,685.75 an ounce,
trading above gold for a third day. The metal jumped to a three-
month high of $1,701 on Jan. 15 after  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s largest producer of the metal, announced plans
to reduce jobs and output. Holdings in exchange-traded products
reached a record 52.9039 metric tons yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver slipped 0.2 percent to $31.415 an ounce. Assets in
exchange-traded products expanded to an all-time high of
19,114.93 tons yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
