Spain matched its maximum target of
4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) at its second bond sale of the
year as the Treasury seeks to fast-track a higher issuance
program than last year.  The Madrid-based Treasury priced its 3.75 percent 2015 bond
to yield 2.713 percent, compared with 3.358 percent the last
time it was sold on Dec. 13. The 2018 bond yielded 3.77 percent,
down from 3.988 percent on Jan. 10, and the 2041 bond 5.696
percent, compared with 5.893 percent the last time a similar
maturity bond was sold on Dec. 13.  With 10-year yields around 5 percent, Spanish debt is
trading at levels unseen since early March 12, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi flooded the banking system
with more than a trillion euros. Draghi sparked another rally in
July, pledging debt purchases on secondary markets for
sovereigns applying for European Union aid.  Demand for the 2015 bond was 2.02 times the amount sold,
compared with 4.81 in December, while the bid-to-cover ratio was
2.32 for the 2018 bond, compared with 2.59 last week, and 2.0
for the 2041 notes from 2.09 last month.  The yield on the  10-year benchmark bond  was little changed
at 5.03 percent after the sale, at 10:50 a.m. in  Madrid ,
compared with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25. The
spread with similar German maturities narrowed to 344 percentage
points.  Financing Needs  Spain needs to issue an average of 10 billion euros a month
this year, according to Justin Knight, a UBS AG rates strategist
in  London . The Treasury  plans  to raise net issuance by 24
percent to 71 billion euros as a deepening  recession  dries up
tax receipts and undermines domestic demand, forcing most of the
largest semi-autonomous regions to rely on it for funding.  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in office since December
2011, wants to avoid seeking an ECB intervention to lower
Spain’s borrowing costs. Economists forecast his government will
miss budget goals set by the EU to tackle the second-largest
shortfall in the euro area, as large as  Greece ’s at 9.4 percent
of gross domestic product in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
