Tom Albanese will leave  Rio Tinto
Group (RIO)  without a cash windfall, forgoing his bonus for a third
straight year after failed deals in aluminum and coal saw him
relinquish control of the world’s second-biggest mining company.  Albanese resigned as chief executive officer after Rio said
it will take about $14 billion of writedowns. He won’t get a
short-term performance bonus for 2012 or 2013, or any lump-sum
payment upon leaving, the London-based company said. He’ll go
with about 10.7 million pounds ($17 million) of share options.  The 55-year-old executive would have been entitled to about
1.27 million pounds in cash and deferred shares for last year
had he met performance targets, Rio’s  annual report  shows. He
already gave up his 2011 bonus following an earlier writedown.
In contrast, Canada’s  Kinross Gold Corp. (KGC)  booked a severance
expense of $16.4 million after CEO Tye Burt was replaced.  “It was almost a given that he wouldn’t get a payoff
leaving under these circumstances,” said Deborah Hargreaves,
director of U.K. monitoring body the High Pay Centre. “It’s
also not certain that he would have qualified for the other
performance targets.”  Companies in Britain and the U.S. have faced mounting
pressure to curb executive remuneration amid an investor revolt
dubbed the shareholder spring. The backlash was first primarily
directed at financial institutions, with Barclays Plc giving
former CEO Robert Diamond about a 10th of his full entitlement
on departure after politicians pointed to his role in the Libor-
fixing scandal that saw the bank fined 290 million pounds.  Live Issue  “The government has made a big issue out of payment for
failure and payoffs for people who have been seen to screw up,
so I think that’s concentrated minds,” Hargreaves said. “It’s
been on the agenda since the shareholder spring. All the people
I speak to on remuneration committees say it’s a very live issue
with them.”  Albanese’s basic salary was 1.06 million pounds in 2012, a
2.5 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Rio’s
annual report. His total remuneration fell 19 percent to 4.47
million pounds in 2011 after he declined a bonus, citing an $8.9
billion writedown of the company’s aluminum division.  “While I leave the business in good shape in many
respects, I fully recognize that accountability for all aspects
of the business rests with the CEO,” Albanese said yesterday in
a statement. He was unavailable for an interview.  Rio climbed 1.8 percent to 3,502.5 pence by the close in
London trading. It earlier advanced 2.7 percent to A$66.35 in
Sydney, more than the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index’s 0.3 percent
gain.  Rio executives have contracts that can be terminated by
either party with 12 months’ notice, or immediately by paying
the base salary, according to the company’s annual report.  Share Options  Albanese will leave with vested but unexercised share
options granted from 2003 through 2009 and valued at about 10.7
million pounds. He also has 1.6 million pounds of shares that
may vest in February. His accrued pension was worth 476,000
pounds a year at the end of 2011.  Albanese’s lack of bonus or lump-sum payment contrasts with
the package awarded to Kinross’s Burt, who was replaced after
the shares fell 28 percent in the first seven months of last
year. Burt had presided over a $2.49 billion writedown on the
Tasiast mine in  Mauritania , an asset Kinross acquired as part of
its C$8 billion ($8.1 billion) purchase of Red Back Mining Inc.
in 2010. His total compensation in 2011 was $7.68 million,
including $1.44 million in salary, according to an April filing.  Canadian peer  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , which fired its CEO Aaron Regent in June, recorded $13 million in severance costs in the
first nine months of 2012. Regent’s 2011 compensation was $9.3
million, including $1.66 million of salary, according to a March
filing.  State Pressure  Directors in the U.K. “have to consider the political
ramifications well beyond what directors in North America have
had to consider,” said Steve Chan, principal at Hugessen
Consulting Inc. in Toronto, which advises boards on pay. “The
U.K. government and regulators as you know have intervened in
executive compensation matters much more than in  Canada  and the
U.S.”  Rio paid $38 billion to buy aluminum producer Alcan Inc. in
2007, an acquisition that soured when metal prices plunged
during the global financial crisis. The company has written down
asset values at its aluminum division by more than $29 billion
since 2009.  Rio is also writing down 70 percent of the value of
Albanese’s A$3.9 billion ($4.1 billion) purchase of Mozambique
coal producer Riversdale Mining Ltd., less than two years after
completing the deal.  The board picked Sam Walsh, the 63-year-old head of Rio’s
iron-ore unit, to take the helm. Walsh will earn a basic salary
of A$1.9 million (1.25 million pounds), 18 percent more than
Albanese last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
