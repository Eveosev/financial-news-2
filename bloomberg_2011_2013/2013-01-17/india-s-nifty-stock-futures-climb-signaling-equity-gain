Indian stocks advanced after the
government allowed  oil companies  to increase diesel prices as it
seeks to narrow the fiscal deficit. Refiners and software
exporters led the gains.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, increased 0.7
percent to 19,964.03 at the close, with volumes exceeding the
30-day average by 35 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s
most-valuable company, rose to a 15-month high.  Oil & Natural
Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the biggest state explorer, surged to a 21-month
high.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software maker, climbed to
the highest level in almost nine months.  The government wants to pare spending on fuel subsidies as
part of a plan to cut the  budget deficit  to a two-year low of
5.3 percent of gross domestic product and avoid a credit-rating
downgrade. The decision is the latest in the series of measures
taken by Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to revive the economy
expanding at the weakest pace in a decade.  “This is by far the single biggest endorsement that India
is taking difficult decisions to restore growth,” said Abhay Laijawala, managing director and head of research at Deutsche
Equities India Pvt. in Mumbai. “This is a big positive from the
point of view of the fiscal deficit” for the year starting
April 1, he said.  Standard and Poor’s and Fitch lowered their outlooks on
India’s rating, currently at the lowest investment-grade level,
to negative in 2012 and said the nation’s large fiscal deficits
and debt are constraining ratings.  Fuel Subsidy  Reliance, the owner of the world’s largest oil-refining
complex, jumped 3.3 percent to 890 rupees, the highest close
since Oct. 28, 2011. Oil & Natural Gas increased 3.5 percent to
314.45 rupees, the highest close since April 28, 2011. The two
stocks have a combined 13 percent weighting on the Sensex. The
 BSE India Oil & Gas Index (BSEOIL)  jumped to a 19-month high.  The three state refiners --  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) ,  Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. (HPCL)  and  Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL)  -- lost a combined
738 billion rupees ($14 billion) selling diesel below cost in
the nine months ended Dec. 31, oil ministry data show. ONGC is
forced by the government to sell crude oil to the refiners at a
discount to partly compensate them for fuel sales below cost.  Indian Oil climbed 6.4 percent, the most since Dec. 1,
2010. Hindustan Petroleum gained 5.4 percent to a six-month high
and Bharat Petroleum rose 3.7 percent to the highest close in 28
months. The companies are not Sensex members.  Policy Action  Since mid-September, Singh has reduced taxes on companies’
overseas debt, cut fuel subsidies to improve public finances and
allowed more foreign holdings in local-currency bonds and
industries including retailing and aviation. In December, the
government approved changes to a century-old land law to help
accelerate infrastructure projects, and this week, delayed a
clampdown on  tax avoidance  until 2016 after the plan spooked
foreign investors when announced in March.  The steps helped the Sensex to its  biggest annual rally 
since 2009 last year and prompted offshore funds to invest a net
$24.5 billion in local shares, the most among the 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg. Offshore funds have bought a net
$1.97 billion of shares this year, a record for the period, the
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex surpassed the 20,000 level for the first time in
two years on Jan. 15. The gauge may climb to 22,500 this year if
policy steps continue, Deutsche Equities predicted in a Jan. 15
report.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said the same day it expects the measure
to reach 23,069 by December.  “Inflows are likely to continue on expectation that the
government will extend its reform initiatives,” Deven Choksey,
managing director at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in
Mumbai, said in a phone interview today.  Earnings Scorecard  Wipro climbed 2.6 percent to 430.70 rupees, the highest
close since April 24. The software exporter may report tomorrow
a profit of 16.3 billion rupees for the quarter ended December,
according to the median estimate of 37 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the biggest software
exporter, rose 1.1 percent to 1,362 rupees, the highest since
Sept. 14.  Infosys Ltd. (INFY)  gained 1.1 percent to 2,797.95 rupees.  Out of the four Sensex companies that have posted earnings
for the December quarter just one has lagged analysts’
estimates. That compares with 40 percent of the index companies
missing forecasts for the July-September period, the same as for
the June quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar and Land Rover luxury
brands, advanced 2.8 percent to 328.95 rupees, the most since
Jan. 9.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , India’s biggest motorcycle maker,
dropped 0.9 percent to 1,818.7 rupees, a second day of loss. The
company reported profit of 4.88 billion rupees for the December
quarter, trailing the 5.93-billion rupee estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Earnings were announced after trading ended.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest mobile services company,
gained 3.1 percent to 353.5 rupees.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index added 0.6 percent to 6,039.2. The
India VIX index, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the Nifty, rose 0.1 percent to 14. The BSE Mid-Cap
Index rose 0.3 percent to 7,182.25.  The Sensex  trades  at 15.8 times estimated earnings, the
highest reading since March. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
valued at 10.9 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
