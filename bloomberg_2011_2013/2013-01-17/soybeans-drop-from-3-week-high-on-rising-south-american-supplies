Soybeans declined from the highest
price in three weeks as forecasts of increased production in
 South America  outweighed estimates of improving demand for U.S.
supplies. Corn was little changed.  Soybeans for March delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$14.30 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at $14.32
by 1:13 p.m. Singapore time. The most-active contract earlier
advanced to $14.415, the highest level since Dec. 26. The
oilseed is heading for a 4.2 percent gain this week.  Production in  Brazil , set to overtake the U.S. as the
largest exporter, may be higher than estimated last month after
recent rainfall, researcher Oil World said Jan. 15. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  raised its outlook for Brazil’s crop
on Jan. 11 to 82.5 million metric tons. While drier weather in
Argentina in the two weeks to Jan. 10 aided planting, the total
area planted in summer crops may still be about 1 million
hectares (2.47 million acres) below farmers’ original intentions
because of flooding in some areas, Oil World said.  “We look to be consolidating some of the very strong
gains,” said  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “We have seen very strong
export sales out of the U.S. into  China  and that pace suggests
that there might be a stronger-than-expected drawdown.”  U.S. export sales may have climbed to 450,000 tons to 1.1
million tons in the week ended Jan. 10, from 321,803 tons a week
earlier, a survey of four analysts by  Bloomberg News  shows.  Crushers in China, the world’s biggest buyer, boosted
purchases to 30 cargoes from the U.S. or South America last week,
the equivalent of about 1.8 million tons, according to the
median of estimates from five crushers and one researcher
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a usual weekly average
of 10 cargoes to 20 cargoes, respondents said.  Corn for March delivery was little changed at $7.3175 a
bushel after gaining as much as 0.3 percent. Prices advanced for
an eighth straight session yesterday, the longest rally since
December 2011, and reached $7.35, the highest since Dec. 10.  Wheat for March was little changed at $7.84 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
