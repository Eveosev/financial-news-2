TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS (TAVHL) ,
Turkey’s biggest airport operator, rose to the highest in 5 1/2
years after a minister said details of a tender to build
Istanbul’s third airport will be announced in a week.  TAV, in which Aeroports De Paris acquired a 38 percent
stake last year, climbed 1.5 percent to 10.20 liras at the close
in Istanbul today, the highest level since July 2007. The stock
is rated buy by 16 out of 24 analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Details of the tender have been “completed to a great
extent,” Transport Minister Binali Yildirim was cited as saying
by the state-run Anatolia news agency today. The airport will
have a capacity of 150 million passengers a year, the minister
said in May.  “TAV is the most probable candidate to operate this new
airport,” Alper Ozdemir, an analyst at Istanbul-based Oyak
Securities, said by phone today. “Operating Istanbul’s Ataturk
Airport, it has the experience and the know-how. Its partnership
with  Aeroports De Paris (ADP)  is another plus.”  The company’s third-quarter profit rose 36 percent to 122.6
million liras ($69.8 million). The shares trade at 13.7 times
current earnings, compared with 17.7 for Aeroports De Paris,
14.9 for  Germany ’s Fraport AG, 18.3 for  Singapore ’s  SATS Ltd. (SATS) ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
