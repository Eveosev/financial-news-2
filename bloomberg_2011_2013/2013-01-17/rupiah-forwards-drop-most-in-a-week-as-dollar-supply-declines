Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards dropped
the most in a week on speculation exporters held back from
repatriating overseas income to boost profits on odds of further
exchange-rate declines.  Dollar supply in domestic markets has dwindled because
exporters aren’t converting earnings, Bank Indonesia Governor
Darmin Nasution said on Jan. 11. The central bank will respond
to “out of proportion” concern over the  current-account 
deficit, estimated to have been 2.3 percent of gross domestic
product last quarter, he said. Global funds cut holdings of
local sovereign  debt  by 2 trillion rupiah ($206 million) this
month to 268.53 trillion rupiah on Jan. 14, the lowest level
since November, finance ministry data show.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1
percent to 9,900 per dollar as of 2:01 p.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 1.9 percent weaker than the
spot rate, which slid 0.6 percent to 9,710, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to settle
non-deliverable forward contracts was set at 9,865 today by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore . The rupiah lost 0.7 percent
this month, after dropping in each of the last three quarters.  “The rupiah’s story remains the same in that dollar supply
onshore is limited,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “There is still
interest in Indonesia but investors are beginning to hedge their
investments in case of further currency declines and any
difficulty in exiting the market.”  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.75 percent, the highest level since September.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent notes due May
2023 was little changed at 5.26 percent, the lowest level since
Jan. 11, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
