Former San Diego Chargers coach Norv Turner joined the  Cleveland Browns  for his fifth stint as an
offensive coordinator in the National Football League.  Turner, 60, was fired by the Chargers on Dec. 31 after the
team’s first losing season since 2003. He joins the staff of new
Browns coach Rob Chudzinski, who was assistant head coach and
tight ends coach under Turner in San Diego in 2009-10.  “Norv has been one of the most respected offensive coaches
in the NFL over the last 25-30 years, and he has had a
tremendous amount of success at each one of his stops,”
Chudzinski said in a statement. “I was able to learn a great
deal in the time that I worked for him in San Diego, and I
expect that having him as our offensive coordinator will make a
big impact on that side of the ball.”  Turner has spent 14 years as an NFL head coach, compiling a
114-122-1 record with the Chargers, Oakland Raiders and
Washington Redskins. He’s also been an offensive coordinator for
the Chargers, San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins and  Dallas
Cowboys .  The Browns’ offense ranked 25th of 32 teams this season in
total yards. Rookies  Brandon Weeden , Trent Richardson and Josh
Gordon led the team in passing, rushing and receiving,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
