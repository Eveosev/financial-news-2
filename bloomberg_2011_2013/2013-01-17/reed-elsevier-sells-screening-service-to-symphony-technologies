Reed Elsevier Plc (REL)  agreed to sell the
screening division of its LexisNexis risk solutions business to
private equity firm Symphony Technology Group as it focuses on
businesses with more predictable earnings.  Symphony plans to join the screening unit with its
portfolio company, First Advantage, London-based Reed Elsevier
said in a statement today. The division being sold is used to
screen and check people for employment and has about 1,000
employees and revenue of about $180 million, said a person with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the details havenâ€™t been publicly disclosed.  The screening unit depends on U.S. hiring patterns and its
business is more cyclical than other parts of LexisNexis risk
solutions, said the person. London-based  Reed Elsevier  has been
disposing of businesses to focus on electronic data services and
research offerings.  Reed sold its Australian media business last week to
private equity firm Catalyst Investment Managers Pty and in
October it sold entertainment trade magazine Variety to Internet
entrepreneur Jay Penske.  Reed shares rose 1 percent to 675.50 pence at 2:14 p.m. in
 London  trading, extending the gain to 29 percent in 12 months.  LexisNexis risk solutions had sales of 908 million pounds
($1.45 billion) in 2011. Underlying revenue rose 6 percent in
the first nine months of 2012, Reed said.  Symphony, based in  Palo Alto , California, is focused on
software and services and has about $2.5 billion in annual
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
