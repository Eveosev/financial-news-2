New Jersey ’s public-pension fund,
the 12th largest of its kind in the U.S., gained 13.3 percent
for the year ended Dec. 31.  The State Investment Council released returns, minus those
for police and firefighter funds, today at its annual meeting in
Trenton.  Chairman Bob Grady described the funds, with $71 billion in
assets, as on “far sounder” footing than in recent years as a
result of measures signed by Republican Governor  Chris Christie 
in 2011, and canny strategy by the fund’s overseers. Grady said
2012 was “a good year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
