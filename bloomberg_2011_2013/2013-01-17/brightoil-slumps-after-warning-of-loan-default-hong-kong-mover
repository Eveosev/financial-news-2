Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. (933) , a
supplier of marine fuel, headed for the biggest decline in at
least three months in Hong Kong trading after saying it’s
seeking waivers from lenders to prevent a possible loan default.  The stock slumped 11 percent to HK$1.51 at 9:38 a.m., set
for the biggest decline since Sept. 26. Earlier Brightoil fell
12 percent, the most since February 2011.  Brightoil has breached the interest coverage ratio covenant
on at least one of its loans, the company said in a statement
yesterday. A default on that loan may trigger other loan
defaults, it said.  “The group is in the process of applying for relevant
waivers from the lenders,” Brightoil said, without naming the
lenders. “The group is in the process of seeking to determine
what proportion of its long-term portion of vessel financing may
need to be reclassified from non-current liabilities to current
liabilities in the 2013 interim result.”  It also expects to have a “material loss” in the six
months ended Dec. 31, from a  profit  a year ago, because of
depressed market conditions in the shipping industry and falling
bunker margins, the company said. The interim result is expected
to be released before the end of February, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
