Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, the country’s biggest public pension manager, joined a
venture formed by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and Stone Point Capital LLC to
manage and underwrite debt and equity deals.  CPPIB Credit Investments Inc., a unit of the Toronto-based
pension manager, will add $50 million to the $300 million
committed by New York-based KKR and Stone Point last year to
support the venture, called MerchCap Solutions LLC, the
companies said today in a statement. CPPIB said it plans to
invest as much as $2 billion in middle-market debt deals.  “This investment is an excellent opportunity to expand
CPPIB’s Private Debt portfolio into the middle market, an
attractive and underserved market segment,”  Mark Jenkins ,
CPPIB’s head of private debt, said in the statement.  KKR and Greenwich, Connecticut-based Stone Point committed
$150 million each to back the venture, continuing a strategy of
diversification away from leveraged buyouts. KKR in 2006 hired
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Craig Farr to create an underwriting business
for the firm’s own holdings. Farr extended those services to
non-KKR companies as Wall Street banks wrestled with heightened
regulations in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
