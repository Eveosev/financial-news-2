PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the second-largest U.S. regional bank, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 46 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as revenue
from fees increased.  Net income climbed to $719 million, or $1.24 a share, from
$493 million, or 85 cents, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
bank said today in a statement. Excluding the cost of increased
mortgage putback reserves and other one-time items, earnings per
share were $1.71, compared with the $1.48  average estimate  of 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-year profit declined 2.3
percent to $3 billion, or $5.30 a share.  Lenders including PNC and U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s
largest regional bank, are boosting provisions for mortgage
repurchases as government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and
 Freddie Mac  expand scrutiny of loans. U.S. regulators struck a
deal with 10 mortgage servicers last week in which lenders must
provide $5.2 billion in mortgage assistance and $3.3 billion in
direct payments to wronged borrowers.  “Core earnings are moving in a direction to support higher
valuations as growth continues into 2013, especially as this
foreclosure settlement should begin to streamline future
foreclosure activities and enable resources to be reduced in the
servicing department,”  Marty Mosby , an analyst at Guggenheim
Securities LLC, said in a Jan. 9 note.  NIM Narrows  Non-interest income climbed 22 percent to $1.65 billion
from a year earlier, driving a 15 percent gain in revenue to
$4.07 billion. Fees from PNC’s asset-management, corporate
services and residential mortgage banking businesses led the
gains.  Asset-management revenue rose 21 percent to $302 million,
and corporate services revenue gained 31 percent to $349
million. Revenue from residential mortgage banking advanced 32
percent to $254 million from a year earlier.  Net interest income rose 10 percent to $2.42 billion as
average total loans grew 17 percent to $183.2 billion. PNC’s net
interest margin, the difference between what a bank pays on
deposits and what it charges for loans, narrowed to 3.85 percent
from 3.86 percent a year earlier.  The bank set aside $318 million for soured loans, a 67
percent jump from a year earlier. PNC set aside $254 million for
residential mortgage repurchases, compared with $36 million in
the fourth quarter of 2011.  Cost Cuts  The lender said Jan. 9 it would book one-time fourth-
quarter items that would cut earnings by 47 cents per share.  PNC may face investor scrutiny after adjusting its reserves
for repurchasing soured loans for the third time in six months,
Mosby said in the note. The bank said in November that it was
seeing a “trending down” of demands from  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac.  The lender plans to close branches and cut staff in an
effort to reduce costs this year, Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr, 64, said last month. PNC’s goal is to trim expenses by
$500 million in 2013, he said.  PNC gained 1 cent to $59.78 at 4 p.m. yesterday in  New
York . The shares slid 2.4 percent in the past year, compared
with a 25 percent advance by the 80-company  Standard & Poor’s
500 Financials Index. (S5FINL)   U.S. Bancorp said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit rose
5.2 percent to $1.42 billion, or 72 cents a share, as loan-loss
provisions declined. The company said costs related to the
mortgage-foreclosure settlement were $80 million, or 3 cents a
share. The Minneapolis-based lender added $52 million to its
mortgage repurchase reserve, bringing the total to $240 million.  Mortgage banking revenue surged 57 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, U.S. Bancorp said. Mortgage revenue
at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest  U.S. bank  by assets, more
than doubled to $2.03 billion, the New York-based firm said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
