President Richard Fisher said the Fed needs to continually
assess the costs and benefits of pushing forward with record
accommodation.  “We don’t want inflation to raise its ugly head,” Fisher
said in a Bloomberg TV interview today, adding he doesn’t “see
that prospect right now.”  The Dallas Fed president said he is concerned that monthly
Fed purchases of Treasury notes and mortgage-backed securities
may create a price bubble in the bond market. “It’s something
we need to constantly analyze.”  The Federal Open Market Committee last month voted to
expand its open-ended bond-buying program to include Treasuries,
seeking to bring down an  unemployment rate  at 7.8 percent.
Officials are considering how long to keep that program in
place.  To contact the reporters on this story:
