The U.S. Northeast will probably be
warmer than normal during from February to April, according to a
seasonal forecast from the  Climate Prediction Center .  The region has an above-average chance of having warmer
weather, according to a probabilistic forecast from the climate
center in College Park,  Maryland . In addition, an area from
California to western  Mississippi  may also have above-normal
temperatures.  Above-normal temperatures in the large cities of the
Northeast can lower the prices for heating oil and natural gas
because people are less inclined to turn thermostats up to heat
homes and businesses. About 50 percent of U.S. households use
natural gas for heating.  In addition to the temperature forecasts, the climate
center also released precipitation maps that show parched
conditions are expected to continue from the central Great
Plains to  Texas .  The central U.S. is currently experiencing the worst
drought since the 1930s. Almost 58.9 percent of the contiguous
48 states are gripped by the drought, which is centered in Great
Plains, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor in Lincoln,
 Nebraska .  To contact the reporter on this story:
