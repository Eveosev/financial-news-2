Cocoa rose to a three-week high on
bets that an improving U.S. economy will boost demand amid
shrinking supplies from  Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
grower. Cotton advanced to a 12-week high for a second day.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
rose to the highest since October as better-than-expected U.S.
housing and labor reports bolstered growth prospects and equity
markets. From Oct. 1 to Jan. 3, purchases of cocoa from farmers
in Ghana totaled 485,000 metric tons, down 17 percent from the
same period a year earlier, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit
of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .  “It’s equity prices pumping higher and good economic data
that spills over into all the commodities markets,” John Caruso, a senior commodities broker at  Chicago , Illinois-based
RJO Futures, said in a telephone interview.  Cocoa for March delivery jumped 2 percent to settle at
$2,300 a ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching $2,310, the highest for a most-active contract
since Dec. 24. Ivory Coast is the biggest producer.  Cotton futures for March delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
close at 77.78 cents a pound on ICE, after touching 78.18 cents,
the highest since Oct. 18.  In the week ended Jan. 10, exports sales of upland cotton
from the U.S., the world’s top shipper, jumped 73 percent from a
week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
report. Purchases were led by  China , the biggest consumer and
importer, followed by  Turkey , Indonesia and Vietnam, the figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
