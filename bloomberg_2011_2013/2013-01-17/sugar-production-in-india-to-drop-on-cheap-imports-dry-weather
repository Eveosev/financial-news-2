Sugar output in  India , the biggest
producer after  Brazil , is set to decline in the year from
October as domestic prices fall on cheaper imports and dry
weather curbs planting, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said.  Production will probably slide from 24 million metric tons
in the year ending Sept. 30, M. Srinivaasan, president of the
association, said in a phone interview. Decreasing local prices
will hamper mills’ ability to make timely payments to farmers,
encouraging them to switch to other crops, he said. He didn’t
give a forecast for 2013-2014.  A lower harvest after two years of surplus may spur the
world’s second-biggest consumer to boost  imports  further,
curbing a slide in  New York  futures. Sugar slumped 16 percent in
2012 because of a second year of glut and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its forecast this week to 18.5 cents a pound in three
and six months from an earlier estimate of 22 cents, citing
rising inventories. Cheaper sugar may extend a decline in  food
costs  tracked by the United Nations.  “The domestic sugar situation right now is pretty bad,”
said Srinivaasan. “We are going to have negative planting in
consequence to that and also due to the drought situation in
certain states. Imports are taking place too soon.”  Parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka states, which together
account for 45 percent of India’s sugar output, have been facing
drought in the past 24 months hurting monsoon and winter-sown
crops, according to the farm ministry.  Refiner Imports  Indian refiners, seeking to profit from a slump in global
prices, have contracted to import about 919,000 tons of raw
sugar since Oct. 1, including about 190,000 tons for sale in the
local market, said Abinash Verma, director general of the New
Delhi-based association.  Mills want the government to raise the import tax on white
and raw sugar to 60 percent from 10 percent to prevent inflows,
Srinivaasan said. Mills are losing as much as 4 rupees on every
kilogram (2.2 pounds) sold in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra,
while those in Karnataka are losing about 5 rupees, Verma said.  Futures in India have fallen for four straight months after
climbing to a 20-month high in August. The contract for delivery
in February was little changed at 3,255 rupees ($59.99) per 100
kilograms on the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd.
at 4:10 p.m. in Mumbai. The March-delivery contract fell 0.2
percent to 18.49 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Renuka Refineries  Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. (SHRS) , India’s biggest refiner, is
importing raw sugar for domestic sales by paying the import duty
as well as duty free for re-export, Managing Director Narendra Murkumbi said last month. Its refineries near Kandla and Haldia
ports can process 1.7 million tons annually.  India may have stockpiles of 7 million tons to 8 million
tons at the end of the crop season on Sept. 30, compared with 6
million tons at the start of the season as demand may total 22.5
million tons, he said.  Production will decrease to a three-year low of 25.6
million tons in 2012-2013 from 28.8 million tons a year earlier
and 26.6 million tons in 2010-2011, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
