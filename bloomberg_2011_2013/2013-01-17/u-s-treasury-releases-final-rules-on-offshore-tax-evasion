The U.S. Treasury released final
rules aimed at fighting offshore tax evasion that expand the
scope of payments not subject to withholding and phase in
timelines for due diligence.  Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or Fatca,
overseas banks worldwide are required to inform the Internal
Revenue Service annually about the balances and activity in
their U.S. customersâ€™ accounts.  The regulations were announced in a statement from the
Treasury Department today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
