Koh Leong Teck, a Singapore-based
fuel oil trader at  BP Plc (BP/) , has left the company, according to
five people with knowledge of his departure.  Koh left earlier this month, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because they aren’t authorized to talk to the
media.  Sheila Williams , a London-based press officer with BP,
declined to comment in an e-mail. A person who answered the
phone at BP’s office in Singapore said Koh had left the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
