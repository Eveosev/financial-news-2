The European Central Bank said the
euro-area economy should start to gradually recover from
recession later this year as the effects of low interest rates
and calmer financial markets take hold.  “Our accommodative monetary policy stance, together with
significantly improved financial-market confidence and reduced
fragmentation, should work its way through to the economy, and
global demand should strengthen,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said
in its monthly bulletin published today, echoing President Mario Draghi’s Jan. 10 policy statement. “Inflationary pressures
should remain contained.”  The 17-nation currency area is stuck in recession as a debt
crisis that’s raged since 2010 weighs on demand and investment.
The ECB, which left its  benchmark rate  at a record low of 0.75
percent last week, said its bond-buying plan and long-term
lending operations have helped to restore relative calm to
financial markets, and it’s now up to governments to press ahead
with economic reforms.  “Further structural reforms should be rapidly implemented
to make the euro area a more flexible, dynamic and competitive
economy,” the ECB said.  Risks to the economic outlook remain on the downside, it
said. “However, more recently several conjunctural indicators
have broadly stabilised, albeit at low levels, and financial
market confidence has improved significantly,” the ECB said.
“Later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
