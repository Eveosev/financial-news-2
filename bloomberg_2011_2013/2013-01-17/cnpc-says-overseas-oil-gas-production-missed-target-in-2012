China  National Petroleum Corp., the
nation’s largest energy producer, said overseas oil and natural
gas production in 2012 missed its target.  Output of oil and gas from fields outside China was 104
million metric tons last year, or about 2 million barrels a day,
the Beijing-based company said today in a  newsletter . That’s
little changed from a year earlier and more than 15 million tons
less than annual target, CNPC said.  “In 2012, due to geopolitical effects and political
instability in resource countries, there was a production gap of
over 15 million tons for the entire year,” CNPC said in the
statement, without specifying which countries or events it was
referring to.  CNPC’s share of production was 52.4 million tons, 1.4
percent more than 2011, it said.  The company’s global oil and gas trade volume increased 19
percent to more than 300 million tons and trade value rose 20
percent to $230 billion, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
