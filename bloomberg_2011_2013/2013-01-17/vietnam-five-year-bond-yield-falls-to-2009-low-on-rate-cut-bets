Vietnam ’s bonds rose for a fourth
day, pushing the five-year yield to the lowest since June 2009,
on speculation the central bank will add to last year’s six
interest-rate cuts to support the economy. The dong weakened.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered the  State Bank  of
Vietnam to pursue policies in 2013 that spur lending and growth
while containing inflation and maintaining the dong’s value,
according to a Jan. 10 statement on the monetary authority’s
website. The State Treasury sold 1 trillion dong ($48 million)
of five-year notes at 9.30 percent on Jan. 11, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website. It paid 9.65 percent to issue
similar-maturity debt at a Dec. 27 sale.  “We believe that  interest rates  could be stabilized or
slightly decrease this week, and it seemed that the market is
expecting another rate cut in the first quarter in 2013,’
analysts at  Saigon Securities Inc. (SSI)  wrote in a research note.  The five-year bond yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 9.15 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since
June 5, 2009. The  overnight interbank deposit rate  dropped 25
basis points to 3.25 percent, the lowest since Dec. 25,
according to banks’ data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank last lowered borrowing costs on Dec. 24.
In 2012, the refinancing rate was cut by a total 6 percentage
points to 9 percent.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 3 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,845 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
