Fox’s “American Idol” attracted
about 17.9 million viewers in its season debut to lead TV
ratings last night even as the audience for the singing
competition shrank from a year earlier.  The season 12 start of the most-watched show for nine
straight years drew about 19 percent fewer viewers in the
advertiser-targeted 18-to-49-year-old demographic,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
Fox said today in an e-mail, citing Nielsen data.  After a 20 percent decline in viewers in the first half of
the TV season, Fox is counting on “Idol” and the new Kevin Bacon drama “The Following” to win back viewers. “Idol” drew
11 percent more viewers in the demographic than the combined
audiences of  CBS (CBS) , ABC and NBC, Fox said.  Mariah Carey , Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban made their debuts
as “Idol” judges following the departures of Jennifer Lopez
and Steven Tyler after last season, when the audience slid 26
percent to average 17 million.  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , gained 1.8 percent to $27.47 at the
close in New York. The stock climbed 43 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
