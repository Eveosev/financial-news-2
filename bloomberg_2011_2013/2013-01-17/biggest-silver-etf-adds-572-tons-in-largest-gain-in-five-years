Assets in iShares Silver Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded fund for the metal, climbed the most in
five years as more investors are seeking an alternative to gold.  Holdings jumped 572 metric tons, or 5.9 percent, the
biggest increase since December 2007, according to data on the
iShares website today.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the manager of the fund,
confirmed the figures. The metal worth $579 million boosted
assets to 10,735 tons, the most since May last year.  Global investment through all silver-backed exchange-traded
products is a record 19,114 tons, or about nine months of mine
output, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays
Plc. Steps by policy makers from the U.S. to  China  and  Europe  to
boost economies attracted investors to precious metals on bets
that stimulus will stoke inflation.  “Some investors see poor man’s gold as a cheaper
alternative to the yellow metal and are allocating to it,” Mark O’Byrne, executive director of Dublin-based GoldCore Ltd., a
brokerage that sells and stores bullion coins and bars, said by
e-mail today. “Allocations to silver remain very small which
suggests that the holdings could go higher resulting in higher
silver prices again in 2013.”  Silver will rise as much as 28 percent to $40.25 an ounce
this year, based on the median of 49 analyst, trader and
investor estimates compiled by Bloomberg in December. The metal
for immediate delivery was at $31.3325 an ounce today in  London .  Silver almost tripled since the end of 2008, and is up 2.9
percent this year compared with a 0.2 percent decline in gold
and 9.4 percent jump in platinum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
