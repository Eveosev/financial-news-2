Swiss money managers may relocate
businesses abroad if the Alpine nation fails to negotiate better
 market access  to the European Union, said Nicolas Pictet,
chairman of the  Swiss Private Bankers Association .  “It’s urgent and important that  Switzerland  focuses on
guaranteeing external market access for its financial
industry,” Pictet told reporters today in the Swiss capital,
Bern. Otherwise “we will see more and more relocations and our
financial center will gradually decline.”  The Swiss government neglected competitiveness and better
market access in its negotiations with the EU over financial and
tax matters, according to Pictet, who is also a managing partner
at Geneva’s biggest bank, Pictet & Cie. While EU directives on
investor protection have “noble aims,” they present barriers
to firms in countries outside the bloc, he said.  The association’s 12 members, which include Pictet and
Lombard Odier & Cie., have added 234 jobs in Switzerland over
the past three years, a 5 percent increase. That compares with a
22 percent boost, or 444 posts, overseas, said Pictet, adding
that cross-border  wealth management  provides more than half of
the “added value” created by banks in the Swiss economy.  Switzerland will later this year draft a new financial
services  law  focusing on investor protection, which mirrors an
EU directive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
