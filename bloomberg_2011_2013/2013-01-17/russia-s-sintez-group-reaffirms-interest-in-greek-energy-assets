Sintez Group, a closely-held Russian
energy company, reaffirmed its “strong interest” in Greek gas
supplier Depa and gas grid operator Desfa.  Sintez will now study the assets further before making a
“comprehensive binding offer,” the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  OJSC Negusneft, a subsidiary of Sintez, was yesterday given
approval to proceed to the final stage of the sale by the
Athens-based Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
