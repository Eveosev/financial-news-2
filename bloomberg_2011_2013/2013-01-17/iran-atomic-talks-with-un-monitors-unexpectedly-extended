Negotiations between United Nations
nuclear inspectors and Iran over access to suspected atomic
installations in the Persian Gulf country were unexpectedly
extended into a second day.  Discussions will continue today, Gil Tudor, the Vienna-
based  International Atomic Energy Agency ’s spokeswoman, said by
telephone. She declined to elaborate.  The IAEA’s investigation into alleged nuclear-weapons
studies by Iranian scientists is in its 10th year. While the
Islamic Republic denies it sought to build atomic bombs, it says
it isn’t willing to cooperate fully with inspectors until its
nuclear rights are recognized and it is allowed to see the
evidence being used against it.  UN inspectors have repeatedly verified that Iran hasn’t
diverted any of its declared uranium for weapons.  The IAEA previously announced a one-day round of talks in
Tehran to wrap up a work plan to allow inspectors broader access
to Iranian people, places and documents. IAEA Director General
Yukiya Amano warned on Jan. 11 that “negotiating with  Iran  is
quite a challenge,” where even progress can lead to new
setbacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
