Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund plans to
double its  gold  holdings this year to 30 metric tons and invest
in real estate in Asian capitals as it diversifies reserves.  The fund, known as Sofaz, bought almost 15 tons of bullion
last year as part of its plan to spend $1.5 billion to purchase
30 tons of gold in 2012 and 2013, Executive Director Shahmar Movsumov told state television channel AzTV in an interview
broadcast late yesterday. Sofaz, which last month announced
acquisitions of properties in London, Paris and Moscow, plans to
focus on real estate in Asian capitals this year, Movsumov said.  “The fund’s experts visited  Singapore , Hong Kong and
 Malaysia  to explore the markets last year,” Movsumov said. “We
plan to visit  China  and  Australia  this year.”  Sofaz , established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s income from oil and gas sales, increased profit by 2
percent, or almost $700 million, last year, Movsumov said. The
fund, which had $33.9 billion of assets as of Dec. 1, keeps 50
percent of its holdings in U.S. dollars, 40 percent in euros and
5 percent in British pounds. Last year it added assets
denominated in the Australian dollar, Russian ruble and Turkish
lira, Movsumov said.  It’s pursuing a “very conservative” investment policy to
safeguard the stockpile, according to Movsumov.  “The most important task today is to preserve the reserves
rather than to increase them,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
