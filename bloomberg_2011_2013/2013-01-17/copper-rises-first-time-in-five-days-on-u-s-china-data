Copper climbed for the first time in
five days after economic data raised expectations that demand
will improve in  China  and the U.S., the two largest users.  Metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.4
percent to $7,978.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,958 at 2:06 p.m. in  Shanghai . Copper fell
to $7,920 yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 31. Futures for
March delivery on the Comex in  New York  gained 0.2 percent to
$3.615 per pound.  Production at U.S. factories climbed more than forecast in
December from a month earlier, Federal Reserve figures showed.
The Labor Department said its consumer-price index was unchanged
last month. China’s National Bureau of Statistics will report
tomorrow that gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of 53 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . That’s up
from a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period.  “Recent data showed the two economies are accelerating,”
He Shan, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said by phone from
Beijing. “These data are helping to underpin copper prices even
as we’re about to see a strong growth in supplies.”  World supply may outstrip demand in 2013 for the first time
in four years as mine output rises, according to Pan Pacific
Copper Co., Japan’s top producer.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer, settled
treatment and refining charges for 2013 with two international
miners, including Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. at $70 a
ton and 7 cents a pound, board secretary Pan Qifang said today.
Pan Pacific Copper Co. signed similar deals with miners.  Copper for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to 57,770  yuan 
($9,289) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. On the LME, tin
declined, while lead, aluminum, zinc and nickel were little
changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
