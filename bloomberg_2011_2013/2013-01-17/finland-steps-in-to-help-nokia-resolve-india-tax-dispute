Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , facing a claim for unpaid
taxes in India, is getting help from its home country, Finland,
which is pushing for a resolution in the dispute.  Finland’s Communications Minister Krista Kiuru traveled to
India and met with her local counterpart Kapil Sibal, asking him
to help solve the situation, the Finnish ministry said in a e-
mailed statement today.  Nokia, a mobile-phone maker struggling with mounting
losses, said last week tax officials visited its manufacturing
unit in Chennai in southern India, claiming the company had
failed to pay an undisclosed amount of taxes. Once Europe’s most
valuable company, Nokia is still one of Finland’s largest
private employers even after sales declines and job cuts.  India’s government is also pressuring  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
saying the carrier owes $2.2 billion due to changes in tax laws
applied retroactively.  Separately, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia said today it is
transferring about 820 employees to India’s  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS)  and  HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT)  as part of a
reorganization and cost-reduction effort announced in June. The
company also said it will eliminate 300 jobs as part of the
previously-announced cuts.  Kiuru said in the ministry’s statement that Finland’s
relationship with India is good and the talks took place “in
candid and good spirit,” adding she believes the tax issue can
be resolved.  Nokia was  little changed  3.47 euros at 10:47 a.m. in
Helsinki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
