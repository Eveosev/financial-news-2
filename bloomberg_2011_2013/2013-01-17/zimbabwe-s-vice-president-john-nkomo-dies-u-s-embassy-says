Zimbabwean Vice President John Nkomo
has died at the age of 78, according to a statement from the
U.S. embassy in  Zimbabwe .  The embassy “expresses its condolences to the family and
the people of Zimbabwe on the death of Vice President John Landa
Nkomo,” embassy spokeswoman Sharon Hundson-Dean said in an e-
mailed statement from Harare today.  Newsday, a Harare-based daily newspaper,  said  the vice-
president died today. It didn’t give further details. Zimbabwe’s
newspapers reported last year that Nkomo was hospitalized for
