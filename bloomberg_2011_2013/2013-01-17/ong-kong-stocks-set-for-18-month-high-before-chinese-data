better news from China for it to rise,” said Steven Leung, a

Ltd. “Until investors see the Chinese economic numbers

moves until then.”  Hong Kong’s benchmark index surged 23 percent last year as
China’s economy showed signs of improvement and as central banks
around the globe added stimulus. Shares on the measure traded at
