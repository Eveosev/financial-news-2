The following is the text of the Philadelphia area
manufacturing activity from the  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  Manufacturing activity declined moderately this month, according to firms
responding to the January Business Outlook Survey. Following reported increases in
business activity in late 2012, most indicators fell back from their readings posted
last month. The survey’s broad indicators of future activity, however, showed some
improvement this month.  Indicators Suggest Slight Declines  The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion index
of current activity, decreased from a revised reading of 4.6 in December to -5.8
this month (see Chart).*  The demand for manufactured goods showed slight declines
this month: The new orders index declined from a revised reading of 4.9 in December
to -4.3  in January.  The shipments index remained slightly positive but suggests no
overall growth--the percentage of firm with increased shipments was mostly offset by
the percentage reporting decreased shipments (26 percent). The indexes for both
delivery times and unfilled orders recorded slightly negative readings this month.  Labor market conditions at reporting firms deteriorated this month. The
employment index, at -5.2, fell from -0.2 in December. The percentage of firms
reporting decreases in employment (16 percent) exceeded the percentage reporting
increases (11 percent). Firms also indicated a decrease in the average workweek
compared to last month.  Price Indexes Moderate  The indexes for prices received for respondents’ own manufactured goods and
prices paid for purchased inputs suggest reduced price pressures this month. The
prices received index decreased 14 points, from 12.4 to -1.1.  The percentage of
firms reporting lower prices for their own manufactured goods (9 percent) was
slightly greater than those reporting higher prices (8 percent). The prices paid
index fell 9 points; 20 percent of firms reported higher costs, compared to 27
percent last month.  Six-Month Indicators Improve  The survey’s future indicators suggest that firms expect recent declines to be
temporary. The future general activity index in-creased from a revised reading of
23.7 to 29.2, its second consecutive monthly increase (see Chart). The percent
expecting increases in activity over the next six months (43 percent) exceed the
percentage expecting decreases (14 percent). The future new orders and shipments
indexes also improved, increasing 4 points and 11 points respectively. The future
employment index, however, fell modestly from 11.2 to 10.7.  Only 22 percent of
firms expect employment to increases over the next six months.  In this month’s special questions, firms were asked about the factors that are
influencing their hiring plans over the next 12 months (see Special Questions). The
most frequently cited factors among firms restraining hiring were the need to keep
operating costs low and low expectations for sales growth. Uncertainty about
healthcare insurance and regulations were also highly ranked factors. Thirty-seven
percent of the firms indicated that federal fiscal policy developments have
decreased hiring plans.  Summary  The January Business Outlook Survey suggests that activity in the region’s
manufacturing sector decreased moderately this month. Firms reported decreases in
overall activity, new orders, and employment this month. Firms also reported a
moderation of prices pressures compared to the previous month. The survey’s future
activity indexes suggest that firms expect growth over the first six months of 2013.  * The survey’s annual historical revisions, which incorporate new seasonal
adjustment factors, were released on January 10, 2013. The full set of revised
