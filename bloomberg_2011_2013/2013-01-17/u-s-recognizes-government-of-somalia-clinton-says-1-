The U.S. formally recognized the
government of Somalia, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said
today following talks with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud.  “Today is a milestone,” Clinton said today. “It’s not
the end of the journey, but it’s an important milestone.”  It marks the first time the U.S. has recognized a Somali
government since 1991.  Before going to the State Department, Mohamoud met at the
White House with President  Barack Obama , who joined a discussion
between the Somali president and Deputy National Security
Adviser  Denis McDonough .  Obama told Mohamoud he should “seize this opportunity” to
move Somalia past two decades of civil strife, according to a
White House statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
