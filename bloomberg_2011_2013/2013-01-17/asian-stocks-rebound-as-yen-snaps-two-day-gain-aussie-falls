Stocks (SPX)  rose for a third day and
commodities rallied as a jump in U.S. housing starts and drop in
jobless claims fueled optimism in the world’s largest economy.
The yen slid to the lowest since 2010 versus the dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent to
1,482.96 at 4 p.m. in  New York , capping the longest rally in a
month. Oil surged 1.3 percent to a four-month high of $95.49 a
barrel to pace gains in commodities. The yen slid as much as 1.9
percent as  Japan ’s economy minister said the currency has more
room to decline. The euro strengthened against all 16 major
peers while the Swiss franc slid to the weakest level since the
central bank introduced a currency cap in 2011. Yields on 10-
year Treasuries rose five basis points to 1.87 percent.  Stocks jumped as applications for jobless benefits fell in
the week ended Jan. 12 to the lowest level in five years, and
housing starts climbed 12.1 percent last month, government data
showed. Economy Minister Akira Amari said the yen is still in
the process of correcting from excessive gains and that his
remarks earlier this week on yen weakness were misinterpreted.  “We’re getting signs that both housing and the labor
market are improving,” said Paul Zemsky, the New York-based
head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, which
oversees $170 billion. “Housing, in particular, is a huge
number. It’s positive for the economy, it’s positive for
earnings and for the stock market.”  Market Movers  Intel Corp .,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and Home Depot Inc. paced
gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which climbed above
its highest close since 2007 during the day before paring gains.
PulteGroup Inc. led an S&P gauge of  homebuilders  to the highest
level since 2007.  U.S. housing starts climbed to a 954,000 annual rate,
exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists and
the most since June 2008, the Commerce Department reported
today. Jobless claims decreased by 37,000 to 335,000 in the week
ended Jan. 12, Labor Department figures showed. Economists
forecast 369,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  CBS Corp. (CBS)  jumped 7.9 percent after saying it will convert
its outdoor advertising division into a real estate investment
trust and seek a buyer for the European and Asian parts of the
business.  BlackRock, BofA  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest money manager, gained
4.4 percent after reporting adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of
$3.93 a share, compared with the $3.71 a share average estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Corp. declined 4.2 percent after reporting
earnings that decreased 64 percent. Of the 52 companies that
posted quarterly results so far, 71 percent  topped analysts’ 
profit projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Almost four shares rose for every one that declined in the
Stoxx 600. Carrefour SA,  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  and Associated
British Foods Plc led gains among retailers. Carrefour,  France ’s
biggest retailer, climbed 6.1 percent and Delhaize, the owner of
Food Lion supermarkets in the U.S., rallied 10 percent as
fourth-quarter revenue increased. AB Foods advanced 3.2 percent
as the U.K. sugar producer that owns Primark clothing stores
reported a 10 percent gain in first-quarter sales.  ‘Currency War’  The yen slid more than 1.5 percent against its 16 major
peers before the  Bank of Japan (8301)  reviews its 1 percent inflation
goal at a Jan. 21-22 meeting. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has
called for the target to be doubled as he works to spur economic
growth.  BOJ and government officials reached basic agreement on a
joint statement calling for a 2 percent inflation target and
additional funds for purchasing assets, Nikkei reported without
attribution.  The 17-nation euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.3377 as it
strengthened against all 16 counterparts after  Spain ’s borrowing
costs decreased at a 4.5 billion bond auction.  Switzerland ’s franc fell as much as 1 percent to 1.2490 per
euro, the weakest since May 2011. The currency declined against
15 of 16 major peers as signs  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing
sapped demand for haven assets.  Major currencies have been roiled this week as policy
makers stepped up warnings on swings in exchange rates.
Thailand’s finance minister today said the baht is “not at a
good level,” while a Russian central bank official yesterday
said the world is on the brink of a “currency war.” A JPMorgan
 index of volatility  for currencies of Group of Seven nations
jumped 5.9 percent to 8.9 today, the highest level since August.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 0.2 percent.  India ’s
Sensex gained 0.7 percent as foreign investors added to their
holdings of domestic shares for a 13th straight day. Russia’s
Micex Index was little changed and  Brazil ’s Bovespa gauge gained
0.7 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.1 percent
before a report on fourth-quarter growth figures tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
