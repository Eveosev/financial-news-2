Carmelo Anthony said he has no
problem with New York Knicks owner  James Dolan  recording his on-
court conversations during a game.  Microphones were placed on the Madison Square Garden floor
for a Jan. 11 matchup against the Chicago Bulls, one day after
Knicks leading scorer Anthony served a one-game suspension for
confronting Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics after a game.
The confrontation came after Anthony and Garnett exchanged
elbows and words during the contest.  Anthony, whose average of 29.3 points per game ranks second
in the National Basketball Association to  Kobe Bryant  of the Los
Angeles Lakers, told reporters in London that he appreciates
Dolan’s support.  “I got an owner that looks out for me,” Anthony said at a
practice yesterday, a day before the Knicks play the  Detroit
Pistons  at the O2 Arena. “You can’t beat that for an owner to
try to protect his players. It just shows how much loyalty Mr.
Dolan has.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
