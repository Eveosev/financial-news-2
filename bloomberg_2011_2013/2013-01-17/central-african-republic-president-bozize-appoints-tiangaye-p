Central African Republic President
Francois Bozize appointed the oppositionâ€™s Nicholas Tiangaye
prime minister to form a unity government designed to end a
month-long rebellion that sought his ouster.  State-run Radio Centafrique announced the appointment today
in the capital, Bangui. Opposition parties proposed Tiangaye as
their choice to become premier as part of an agreement struck at
peace talks in the Gabonese capital, Libreville, on Jan. 11.  Bozize will be allowed to finish his term under the
agreement, and the Seleka rebel alliance pledged to withdraw
from occupied cities and abandon its military advance toward
Bangui. A multinational force from neighboring Congo Republic,
 France  and Gabon has been deployed in the country, which is
about the size of  Texas .  South Africa  also sent troops.  Seleka says it began the rebellion last month because
Bozize, 66, failed to honor a 2008 peace deal. The Central
African Republic has been plagued by violence since independence
from France in 1960, with at least four battles for Bangui
taking place from 1996 to 2003, when Bozize toppled predecessor
Ange-Felix Patasse, whom he served as army chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
