Sales of new cars in  Serbia  declined
25 percent last year to the lowest since 2001 amid a  recession 
and high unemployment, the national association of dealers said.  Sales fell to 23,993 vehicles from a revised 31,900 in
2011, led by Skoda Auto AS and  Fiat SpA (F)  models,  said Milos
Petrovic, head of the  Serbian Association of Vehicle Importers ,
in a phone interview. More than 90 percent of the vehicles were
imported from the European Union.  Sales fell even as Serbia reduced customs tax to 2.5
percent for most vehicles made in the EU as part of a gradual
removal of trade barriers with the bloc it wants to join.  To contact the reporter on this story:
