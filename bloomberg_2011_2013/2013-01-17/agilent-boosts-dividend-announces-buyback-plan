Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) , the
scientific-testing equipment company that was spun off from
Hewlett-Packard Co. in 1999, increased its quarterly dividend by
20 percent and approved a $500 million stock buyback.  The dividend will rise to 12 cents a share in the fiscal
second quarter from 10 cents, the  Santa Clara , California-based
company said today in a statement. The payout will happen on
April 24 to shareholders of record on April 2.  The move “reflects our confidence in Agilent’s future cash
generation capabilities and our commitment to return capital to
shareholders,” Agilent Chief Executive Officer Bill Sullivan
said in the statement.  Agilent is moving to reward shareholders after a
disappointing earnings forecast last quarter. The company said
in November it expected earnings of 65 cents to 67 cents a share
in the first quarter, excluding some items, compared with an
average analyst estimate of 75 cents.  The shares rose 1.5 percent to $43.70 at 9:49 a.m. in New
York. Agilent’s stock climbed 17 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
