The Swiss franc fell against the
euro to the weakest since the central bank imposed a cap on the
currency in 2011, as signs  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing sapped
demand for haven assets.  The Swiss currency declined for the fifth time in six days
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last
week there are strong capital inflows in the region and as
Spanish and Italian  government bonds  advanced this month.
Zuercher Kantonal Bank said last week it reserved the right to
set negative  interest rates  on franc deposits for its retail
customers. The  Swiss National Bank  capped the currency at 1.20
per euro in September 2011 to protect exporters.  “The crisis is being priced out more and more, which means
that the Swiss franc is less in demand,” said Antje Praefcke, a
senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “It
should remain under pressure and I think the SNB is probably
pleased to see that.”  The franc fell 0.7 percent to 1.2461 per euro at 4:14 p.m.
 London  time after losing as much as 0.9 percent to 1.2485 per
euro, the weakest since May 2011. It surged to 1.008 per euro on
Aug. 9, 2011. The Swiss currency depreciated 0.2 percent to
93.25 centimes per dollar. It touched 93.55 centimes, the
weakest since Dec. 11.  ‘Fear’ Abates  Switzerland’s franc has tumbled 2 percent this year, the
second-biggest decline after the yen, which slid 3.3 percent,
among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Implied volatility for the franc versus the euro, based on
one-month options, rose as high as 7.46 percent today, the most
since December 2011.  “People are going back into risk assets,” Eimear Daly, a
currency-market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. in London, said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Guy Johnson . “People were so concerned about risk and were holding
the Swiss franc as a highly liquid asset, now the fear has
abated and that’s going to pull the euro up against the franc.”  Swiss government bonds declined. The 10-year yield rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.702 percent
after reaching 0.704 percent, the most since May 2.  The yield on the nation’s three-year notes climbed above
zero for the first time since May 11.  The SNB said today it expects a full-year profit this year
of about 6 billion francs after it benefited from foreign-
currency investments and a rising gold price.  Foreign-currency reserves contributed 4.7 billion francs
and valuation gains on its gold holdings added 1.4 billion
francs, the SNB said in a statement, citing an initial estimate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
