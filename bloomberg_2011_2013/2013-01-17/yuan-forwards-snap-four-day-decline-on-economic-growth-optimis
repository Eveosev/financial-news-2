Yuan  forwards gained for the first
time in five days as economists predicted data tomorrow will
show  China ’s economy rebounded from a seven-quarter slowdown.  Economic growth quickened to 7.8 percent in the three
months ended Dec. 31, from a three-year low of 7.4 percent in
the previous period, according to the  median estimate  of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The nation will open up
its financial markets to domestic and foreign firms this year to
promote wider use of the yuan globally, China Daily reported,
citing Xing Yujing, secretary general of the central bank’s
monetary policy committee.  “Economic fundamentals for yuan appreciation are rising,”
said Kenix Lai, a currency analyst at  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  in
Hong Kong. “As the economy stabilizes, China will be more
willing to accelerate yuan internationalization. That’s
favorable for offshore yuan assets.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.14 percent to
6.2798 per dollar as of 9:51 a.m. in Hong Kong, a 0.99 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yuan climbed 0.11 percent to 6.1858 versus the
greenback in the offshore market.  The yuan was steady at 6.2174 per dollar in  Shanghai , from
yesterday’s 6.2165, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The People’s Bank of China cut the  reference rate 
by 0.04 percent to 6.2767 per dollar today. The spot is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, declined eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 1.43 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s  position  in U.S. Treasuries increased $200 million
to $1.17 trillion in November, the most in a year, Treasury
Department data released yesterday show. The nation is the
largest foreign lender to the U.S. government, followed by
 Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
