Eighteen months after the last round
of U.S. debt-ceiling talks pushed stocks lower, the impending
confrontation between congressional Republicans and the White
House over federal borrowing is returning to haunt markets.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the number of news stories
including the phrase “debt ceiling” has surged since Congress
passed a deal to avoid more than $600 billion of tax increases
and spending reductions on Jan. 1. The last time there was such
attention on the term, in mid-2011, the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index plunged 16 percent.  “The more the politicians will be seen fighting, the more
volatile the stock market will get,” said Alessandro Fezzi,
senior market analyst at LGT Bank Schweiz AG in Zurich. The debt
ceiling is “seen as one of the biggest risks to the world
economy. I think it’s a good reminder of the fundamental
problems we still face. That doesn’t mean politicians won’t find
a compromise in the last minute, as they so often do.”  Lawmakers may need to approve an increase in the $16.4
trillion debt ceiling as early as mid-February, with Republicans
planning use the vote to force President  Barack Obama  to accept
cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare. While Congress
has raised or revised the limit 79 times since 1960,
negotiations over the threshold in 2011 led S&P to strip the
U.S. of its top AAA credit rating and pushed the nation’s stocks
within 1 percentage point of a  bear market .  To contact the reporters on this story:
