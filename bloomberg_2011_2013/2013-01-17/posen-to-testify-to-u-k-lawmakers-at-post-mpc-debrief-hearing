Former  Bank of England  policy maker
 Adam Posen  will testify to U.K. lawmakers next week at a session
described by the Treasury Committee as a “post-Monetary Policy
Committee debrief.”  The hearing, the first of its kind to be held by the
committee, will take place on Jan. 22, the U.K. Parliament
committee said in an e-mailed statement today. Posen, 46, left
the MPC in August and took over as head of the Washington-based
Peterson Institute for International Economics this month.  Posen, a U.S. citizen, led the charge for the Bank of
England to restart  quantitative easing  during his three years at
the MPC. Since his departure, he has expressed concern that Bank
of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  will have too much power when he
takes over from  Mervyn King  at the head of the BOE in July.  Posen wrote in a Dec. 1 article in the Financial Times that
Carney will need “to prioritize public engagement and open
debate” in his new role, which will include control of
financial regulation as well as monetary policy.  He has also argued that policy makers should diversify
their asset-purchase program from  government bonds  into
corporate bonds and securitized loans, and do more to boost
credit. The Bank of England stopped emergency bond purchases in
November after buying 375 billion pounds ($599 billion) since
March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
