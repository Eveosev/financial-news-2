A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell after housing starts jumped to a four-year high and
jobless claims declined.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.1 basis points to a mid-price of 87.6 basis points at 5:09
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure has declined from 89.6 on Jan. 14, the highest level
this month.  Signs that the economy is growing may alleviate investor
concern that companies will be unable to repay debt. U.S.
housing starts climbed to the most since June 2008, jumping 12.1
percent last month to a 954,000 annual rate, the Commerce
Department reported. Initial jobless claims decreased 37,000 to
335,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, the lowest level since the
period ended Jan. 19, 2008, Labor Department figures showed.  “Investors are looking at the housing market recovery and
the numbers today have moved the needle,” Jody Lurie, a
corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, a
Philadelphia-based investment advisory firm, said in a telephone
interview. “The market direction is a joining of many forces.
Banks’ earnings are showing a mixed picture, and that, combined
with the economic news, sent ripples in the market.”  JPMorgan Bonds  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index fell 5.8 basis points to 440.8 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The average relative yield on junk-rated debt narrowed 8
basis points to 4.74 percentage points, led by spreads on the
bonds of technology companies, which dropped 16 basis points to
5.16 percentage points, Bloomberg data show.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which lost more than $6.2 billion
from trading lapses, sold $6 billion of fixed- and floating-rate
debt in its biggest bond sale in 21 months.  The largest U.S. bank by assets issued $1.25 billion of 1.8
percent, five-year notes to yield 103 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, $2 billion of five-year, floating-
rate bonds at 90 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate and $2.75 billion of 3.2 percent, 10-year
securities at a relative yield of 133 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
