Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , the U.S. independent
power producer that emerged from  bankruptcy protection  last
year, forecast a 2013 net loss of as much as $332 million as it
refinances  debt  to increase cash.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be $250 million to $275 million, according to
a slide presentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today before an analyst meeting in New York. The
forecast is below the $305.5 million average of four analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The range for 2013 was slightly below our expectations,”
Jon Cohen, a New York-based analyst for International Strategy &
Investment Group, said today in an e-mail. Cohen rates the
shares cautious, equivalent to a sell.  Dynegy, the owner of natural-gas and coal-fired power
plants, put a group of units into bankruptcy in November 2011
after electricity prices tumbled in the wake of the 2008
economic slump. The corporation sought bankruptcy protection in
July 2012.  Dynegy has three sell and three hold recommendations from
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
is the third-largest U.S. independent power producer behind
 Calpine Corp. (CPN)  and  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  Independent power producers
sell their output on wholesale markets or under contract to
utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
