Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
second day, heading to the lowest in a year, as the country’s
political parties prepared to nominate candidates for elections
in March.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 86.95 a dollar as of 2:01 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, poised for the weakest since Jan 13, 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The elections will be the first since a disputed 2007 vote
sparked two months of violence in which more than 1,100 people
died. The Coalition for Reform and Democracy, led by Prime
Minister  Raila Odinga  and the Jubilee Coalition of Uhuru
Kenyatta are holding party primary elections today. The shilling
may weaken in the run-up to the national ballot, Morgan Stanley
said in a report on Jan. 14.  “The shilling has weakened due to concern by the market as
political parties hold their nominations for candidates for the
forth-coming elections,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said by phone. “There is also demand for
dollars from the oil importers.”  The central bank took 4 billion shillings ($46 million) of
seven-day  repurchase agreements , out of bids of 5.4 billion
shillings, having offered 4 billion shillings for sale. The
repos are used by the regulator to withdraw  money supply  from
banks and support the shilling.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,665 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling traded unchanged at 1,600 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
