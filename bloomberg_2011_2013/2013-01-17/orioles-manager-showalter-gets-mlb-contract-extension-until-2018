Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who directed the franchise to its most wins in 15
years and a playoff spot last year, was given a contract
extension through 2018.  Dan Duquette, the Orioles’ executive vice president of
baseball operations, received a similar extension, the Major
League Baseball team said yesterday.  Showalter, 56, has accumulated a 196-185 record since
joining the Orioles during the 2010 season. Baltimore’s
appearance in the 2012 playoffs was its first since 1997.  On May 1, Showalter became the 58th manager in major league
history to win 1,000 games. He enters the 2013 season ranked
49th on the career list with 1,078 wins and is sixth among
active managers. He also has managed the  Texas Rangers ,  Arizona
Diamondbacks  and the  New York Yankees  in 1992-95.  Duquette, 54, has spent 11 seasons as general manager with
the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and Orioles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
