U.K. stocks  advanced as a report
showed housing starts in the U.S. climbed faster than analysts
had estimated and  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  gained.  AB Foods jumped 6.7 percent after reporting a surge in
revenue at its budget-clothing business. International
Consolidated Airlines Group Plc rose 3.2 percent following a
report the company’s Spanish unit has reached an agreement with
unions.  Rio Tinto  Group lost 1.8 percent after announcing $14
billion of writedowns and the departure of its chief.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 0.3 percent to 6,120.41 at 1:38
p.m. in  London , rebounding from an earlier drop of as much as
0.3 percent. The  gauge  has risen 3.8 percent this year after
U.S. lawmakers agreed to a compromise budget to prevent
automatic tax increases and spending cuts from taking effect.
The broader FTSE  All-Share Index (ASX)  also advanced 0.3 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.4 percent.  “The overall market is treading water as the earnings
season heats up in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said  Richard Hunter ,
head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London, in a
phone interview. “Rio Tinto hasn’t helped the mining sector
today even though the news may be taken positively in the medium
term as the company looks to take its foot off the pedal in
terms of making acquisitions,”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
today was 10 percent greater than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price-
earnings ratio for the FTSE 100 peaked at 15.8 times trailing
earnings on Jan. 11, its highest level in two years.  Housing Starts  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
housing starts increased at an annual pace of 12.1 percent in
December, beating the  median economist estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey for a gain of 3.3 percent. They dropped 4.3 percent in
November. A separate release from the Labor Department showed
that initial claims for  jobless benefits  retreated to 335,000
last week from a revised 372,000 the previous week.  AB Foods jumped 6.7 percent to 1,660 pence after the
company said the performance of its Primark clothing chain has
caused the business to beat its forecasts in the financial year
to date. Primark’s revenue surged 25 percent from a year earlier
in the 16 weeks ended Jan. 5, the company said in a statement.
The sugar unit’s sales increased 12 percent.  IAG gained 3.2 percent to 209.4 pence after El Pais
reported that its Spanish unit Iberia has agreed with unions to
keep capacity cuts to less than 14.5 percent. The newspaper
cited unidentified participants at the meetings between Iberia
and its unions and said an Iberia spokesman declined to comment.  Rio Tinto  Rio Tinto dropped 1.8 percent to 3,397.5 pence after the
world’s second-biggest mining company said Tom Albanese will
step down as CEO and  Sam Walsh , currently the head of Rio
Tinto’s most profitable division, will replace him.  Doug Ritchie, who oversaw the A$3.9 billion ($4.1 billion)
purchase of Mozambique coal producer Riversdale Mining Ltd. in
2011 will also step down as Rio cuts the value of its coal
assets in the East African country by about $3 billion.  The bulk of the writedown will come from Rio’s aluminum
businesses, most of which were obtained through Albanese’s $38
billion  purchase of Alcan Inc.  in 2007. Rio reduced the value of
the operations by $8.9 billion last February.  Citigroup Inc. raised its recommendation for  the shares  to
buy from neutral. The stock earlier fell as much as 4.6 percent.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  fell 1.7 percent
to 1,123.5 pence and 1.4 percent to 375.1 pence, respectively.  Home Retail  Home Retail Group Plc surged 14 percent to 138.4 pence, the
biggest gain on the broader All-Share Index. The retailer said
full-year earnings will beat estimates because sales accelerated
at its Argos catalog chain over Christmas.  Group underlying pretax profit will be about 10 million
pounds more than the market consensus of 73 million pounds.  Home
Retail (HOME)  also said it will have more than 300 million pounds of
cash at the end of its fiscal year.  The company is one of the most shorted stocks on the FTSE
All-Share with 22 percent of shares out on loan, according to
the most recent data from Markit.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  dropped 1.8 percent to 384.5
pence after reporting a 3.3 percent increase in funds under
management to 193.4 billion pounds ($310 billion) in the fourth
quarter as clients invested in  Asia . The stock  rose 6.7 percent 
from the start of the year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
