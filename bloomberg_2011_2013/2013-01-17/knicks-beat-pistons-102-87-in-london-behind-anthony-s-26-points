The New York Knicks topped the
 Detroit  Pistons 102-87 in London, using a 16-0 run in the
opening minutes to build a lead they wouldn’t relinquish.  Carmelo Anthony scored 26 points yesterday to lead the
Knicks to the victory at O2 Arena in the U.K. capital, while
Amar’e Stoudemire had 17 in his highest-scoring game since
missing the first two months of the season following knee
surgery.  “It felt good out there,” said Anthony, who helped the
U.S. win an Olympic gold medal five months ago at the same
stadium. “I definitely had some flashbacks out there. Running
out there on the court, just being in the O2 Arena.”  Fans bought all the tickets for the Knicks-Pistons matchup
within four days, the fastest sellout for one of the seven
National Basketball Association games held in  London .  The Knicks, who flew from New York on Jan. 14, hit their
first six shots of the game and took a 16-2 lead. The Knicks led
29-17 after one quarter as Anthony scored 11 points, hitting 3-
of-4 three-point attempts.  The Knicks led by as many as 20 points in the first half
before the Pistons pulled within 67-63 with 2 minutes, 23
seconds left in the third quarter. New York responded with an 8-
0 run to take a 10-point lead into the final quarter and cruise
to their fifth straight win against the Pistons.  Tyson Chandler added 10 points and 14 rebounds for the
Knicks, who won their second game in a row following a three-
game losing streak. New York, which sits atop the Eastern
Conference’s Atlantic Division with a 25-13 record, doesn’t play
again until a Jan. 21 home game against the Brooklyn Nets.  The Pistons, who hadn’t played since Jan. 12, lost for the
third time in four games to fall to 14-25. Will Bynum scored a
team-high 22 points to lead Detroit, which now returns home for
a Jan. 20 game against the Boston Celtics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
