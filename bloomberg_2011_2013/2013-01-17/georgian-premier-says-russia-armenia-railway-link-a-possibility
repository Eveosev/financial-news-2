Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili said his country and neighboring  Armenia  are ready
to restore a railway link to Russia through  Georgia .  “Georgia, in its turn, expresses willingness to do it, but
there is Russia as well,” Ivanishvili told reporters in the
Armenian capital, Yerevan, today, according to a recorded
broadcast of the news conference on Rustavi-2 television.  Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan also backed the
link, according to a transcript of the news conference provided
by his office. Ivanishvili, on a one-day trip to Armenia, also
met President Serzh Sargsyan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
