Treasury yields driven to almost
record lows by global central-bank intervention means less-
liquid debt in the corporate and real-estate sectors may offer
better returns this year, according to Thomas Strauss, chairman
of Ramius LLC.  “The clamor for liquidity has had a dramatic impact,”
Strauss said today during the Bloomberg Global Markets Summit in
New York. “If you look at the spread compression of liquid
securities against Treasuries, it’s been dramatic. If you look
at less-liquid products -- debt origination on the corporate and
real-estate side -- the spread compression is almost
negligible.”  Central banks from the  Federal Reserve  to the  European
Central Bank  and the  Bank of Japan  have kept interest rates at
record lows since the start of the financial crisis while adding
monetary stimulus to support their economies. This has sent
government debt to all-time low yields, with the benchmark U.S.
10-year note touching a record 1.379 percent in July.  The impact has been felt less in real-estate loans, debt
origination in the corporate sector and other less-liquid debt
products, Strauss said. This makes them more attractive relative
to the risk they offer, he said.  Investors can expect returns of around 10 percent from the
less-liquid securities, Strauss said, as financing for these
debt products has shrunk, forcing issuers to offer more yield.  “There has been a substantial diminution of capital to
finance these one-off transactions,” he said, “and we don’t
see that changing at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
