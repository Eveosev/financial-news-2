Agora SA (AGO)  fell for a fourth day, its
longest losing streak in three months, after  Poland ’s largest
publicly traded publisher said an asset writedown will cut
fourth-quarter profit.  The  shares  retreated 3.2 percent to 9.59 zloty at the close
in Warsaw. The number of shares traded today was 71 percent of
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The writedown of assets, mainly its magazines, will lower
the group’s operating profit by about 18 million zloty ($5.8
million), it said in a regulatory filing late yesterday.  “This information was unexpected,” Piotr Owdziej, an
analyst at KBC Securities in Warsaw, said in a note today. It is
“likely to drag down Agora’s full-year 2012 results into the
red.”  The publisher of the country’s best-selling broadsheet
title  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported a  net loss  of 8.9 million zloty
in the first three quarters of 2012, compared with a 33.2
million zloty profit a year earlier, it said on Nov. 9.  Fourth-quarter earnings  are due  on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
