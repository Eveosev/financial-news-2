SGS SA (SGSN) , the world’s largest product
inspector, cut its dividend after full-year profit missed
analysts’ estimates as it revamped businesses in Europe.  SGS plans to pay shareholders 58 Swiss francs a share via a
30 franc ordinary dividend and a bonus of 28 francs, the Geneva-
based company said in a statement today. The total is 11 percent
lower than the 65-franc payout last year.  The reduction of the dividend is “disappointing,” Patrick Hasenboehler, an analyst at Bank Sarasin & Cie AG in Zurich said
in a note to clients. SGS’s valuation “is no bargain, but
justified by the structural growth and the convincing financial
track record with a high return on capital,” he said.
Hasenboehler has a neutral recommendation on the stock.  SGS is a gauge of the broader economy as it sells services
for industries including agriculture, petrochemicals, health,
carmaking and consumer products. The company “expects to
deliver solid top- and bottom-line growth in 2013,
notwithstanding continuing weak” conditions in  Europe , it said.  The company’s shares fell as much as 1.9 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since Oct. 26, and were 1.1 percent down
at 2,073 francs as of 9:47 a.m. in Zurich.  SGS said the operating profit margin dipped slightly from a
year earlier it presses ahead with investments and acquisitions
to reach a  target  of 8 billion francs ($8.57 billion) of sales
by 2014.  Net income rose 4.1 percent to 556 million francs, missing
the 578 million-franc average of  nine analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. SGS said it had one-time restructuring costs of 47
million francs, mostly to align its operations to market
conditions in Europe. Excluding those charges, and currency
fluctuations, profit rose almost 11 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
