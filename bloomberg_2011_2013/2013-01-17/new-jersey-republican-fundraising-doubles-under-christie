New Jersey’s Republican party
doubled its campaign fundraising under the leadership of
Governor  Chris Christie , who faces re-election in November.  The party’s three-biggest political-action committees
raised $4.4 million in 2012, twice as much as in 2008, the year
before Christie was elected, according to a report today from
the state’s Election Law Enforcement Commission. Democrats
raised $2.7 million last year, a 41 percent drop from 2008.  Christie, the first Republican elected New Jersey governor
since 1997, ousted  Jon Corzine  in 2009 as voters rejected the
one-term Democrat’s handling of the the state’s economy. Since
taking office, Christie has traveled across the U.S. attracting
record out-of-state donations for his party.  Republicans have $957,497 of cash on hand, while Democrats
have $727,028, according to the report. Democrats control both
houses of the legislature, and all 120 seats are up for re-
election in November.  “Campaigns are expensive, and candidates and parties have
to start planning well ahead to have adequate cash for the
election,” Jeff Brindle, executive director of the election
commission, said in a statement announcing the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
