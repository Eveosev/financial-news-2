NuPathe Inc. (PATH) , a maker of
neurological and psychiatric medicines, won U.S. approval to
sell the first skin patch to treat migraines.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the treatment,
called Zecuity, which delivers sumatriptan, the most-prescribed
migraine headache medication, through a mild electrical current,
Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based NuPathe said yesterday in a
statement.  “We anticipate the product will be available for sale in
the fourth quarter of this year,” Armando Anido, NuPathe’s
chief executive officer, said in an interview. “We’re right now
in conversations with a number of people for partnership in the
 United States .”  In August 2011, the FDA decided against approving the
therapy, saying that while it was effective, the regulatory body
had questions about the patch’s safety, Anido said. The company
has since redesigned it.  “It was actually related to some signals around skin
reactions,” he said. “The company went through extensive work
to make adjustments to the patch in order to make it safe and
make sure these reactions never happen again.”  A  migraine  is a neurological disorder that affects about 31
million adults in the U.S., Anido said. In addition to headache
pain, patients suffer from nausea and vomiting.  NuPathe fell less than 1 percent to $3.30 at the close of
trading in  New York . The shares have  increased  53 percent in the
past 12 months.  Anido declined to say how much the patch would cost, though
he indicated it would be comparable to the $95 that a similar
medication costs as an injection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
