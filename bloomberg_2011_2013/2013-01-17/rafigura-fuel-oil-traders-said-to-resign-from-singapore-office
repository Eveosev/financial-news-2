Two Singapore-based fuel oil traders
resigned from Trafigura Beheer BV, according to four people with
knowledge of the move.  Li Shuang left earlier this week following the departure of
Kent Yeo in December, said the people who asked not to be
identified because of internal policy.  An external spokeswoman for Trafigura in  Singapore  declined
to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Neither Li nor Yeo
were available when called at Trafiguraâ€™s office in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
