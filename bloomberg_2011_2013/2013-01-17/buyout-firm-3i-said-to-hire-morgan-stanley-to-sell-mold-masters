Private-equity firm  3i Group Plc (III) 
hired Morgan Stanley to sell Canadian plastics-molding equipment
maker Mold-Masters Group and Berkshire Partners LLC is
interested, said people with knowledge of the matter.  Mold-Masters , the Georgetown, Ontario-based producer of
temperature-control systems, could be worth as much as $570
million, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the process is private. Boston-based Berkshire and OMERS Private
Equity acquired Husky Injection Molding Systems, another
Canadian plastics-equipment maker, for $2.1 billion in 2011.  London-based 3i bought Mold-Masters in August 2007.  Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment. Kathryn van der Kroft, a spokeswoman for
3i, and Michael Ellis, a spokesman for Mold-Masters didn’t
return calls seeking comment. Katherine Bush, a spokeswoman for
Berkshire, didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The Financial Times previously reported that 3i hired
Morgan Stanley to find a buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
