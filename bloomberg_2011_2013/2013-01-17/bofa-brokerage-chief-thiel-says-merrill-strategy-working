Bank of America Corp.  brokerage head
 John Thiel , who boosted incentives for financial advisers to
steer clients to more of the lender’s products, said the firm’s
strategy to garner more fees is taking hold.  Clients’ concerns about the so-called fiscal cliff helped
increase fourth-quarter  revenue  as investors took gains ahead of
higher tax rates, Thiel said today in a memo to employees.
Profit in the Merrill Lynch brokerage more than doubled from a
year earlier to $578 million, while assets under management rose
almost 10 percent to $698.1 billion and related fees reached a
record $1.6 billion.  “As clients demonstrate their confidence in our firm by
entrusting us with more of their assets, it was gratifying to
see that our fee-based, deposit and lending flows were the
highest since 2010,” Thiel said in the memo. “Our strategy is
clearly working.”  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan ,
who previously led wealth management units at the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based lender and Fleet Financial, has said the
Merrill Lynch unit was critical in building profits. Last month,
Thiel announced new bonuses that reward growth in fee-earning
funds and boosted payouts for retiring advisers.  The ranks of financial advisers at the end of the fourth
quarter fell about 2.7 percent to 14,917 from three months
earlier as underperforming brokers in Merrill’s training program
departed, the firm said. That figure excludes advisers in
Merrill Edge call centers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
