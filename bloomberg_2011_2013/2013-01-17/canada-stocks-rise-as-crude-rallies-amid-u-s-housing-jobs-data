Canadian  stocks  rose as crude
advanced after U.S. reports showed housing starts climbed more
than anticipated in December and initial jobless claims dropped
to a five-year low.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  gained 0.9 percent as oil
touched a four-month high. Ivanplats Ltd. climbed 1.7 percent
after more than doubling resource estimates at its Kamoa copper
mine.  H&R Real Estate Investment Trust (HR-U)  slumped 3.6 percent as it
offered to acquire Primaris Retail Real Estate Investment Trust,
trumping a hostile offer from another investor group.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 22.27
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,631.09 at 10:04 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge has gained 1.5 percent this year.  U.S. Commerce Department figures showed housing  starts  rose
12.1 percent in December to a 954,000 annual rate, exceeding all
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and the most since June 2008.
Initial jobless claims  fell  37,000 to 335,000 last week, the
lowest since January 2008, Labor Department figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
