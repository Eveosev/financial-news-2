The rand may strengthen to 8.67 per
dollar “in the near term” before resuming declines, Absa
Capital said, citing trading patterns.  South Africa’s currency posted a so-called shooting star
pattern yesterday, a sign that it is set for a rebound, Judy Padayachee, a technical analyst at Johannesburg-based Absa,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today. A shooting star
pattern occurs when a security’s opening, low and closing price
are similar.  “We believe that the correction we have been looking for
has a strong case,” Padayachee wrote. The currency is likely to
resume its decline, trading between 9 and 9:20 per dollar in the
second half, she added.  The rand was trading 0.2 percent stronger at 8.7862 a
dollar by 10:09 a.m. in Johannesburg. It’s weakened 3.5 percent
this year, the worst performance out of 25 emerging-market
currencies monitored by Bloomberg, after Fitch Ratings cut the
nation’s credit ratings and amid labor unrest in the mining and
agricultural industries. Should the currency close below 8.78
per dollar, that would strengthen the case for a short-term
rebound, Padayachee wrote.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
