RWE AG (RWE) ’s U.K. unit captured the
first ton of carbon dioxide in a test project at a Welsh power
station as it seeks to gain experience of the technology before
it can be rolled out on a commercial scale.  The pilot carbon-capture facility will trap about 50 tons
of CO2 a day from smokestack gases at the Aberthaw coal-fired
plant, RWE Npower said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the same amount of CO2 produced from 3 megawatts of power
generation.  “This pilot plant at Aberthaw will provide invaluable data
on the viability of capturing carbon at an industrial scale,”
Kevin Nix, head of U.K. hard coal and gas at the company’s RWE
Generation unit, said in the statement.  Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, gathers climate-change
linked emissions from power stations and factories for storage
underground. The technology is yet to operate at full-scale on a
power plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
