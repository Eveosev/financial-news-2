Sri Lanka  left  interest rates 
unchanged to damp price gains and bolster economic growth.  The  Central Bank of Sri Lanka  kept its  reverse repurchase
rate  at 9.5 percent and the  repurchase rate  at 7.5 percent, it
said in a statement in  Colombo  today. All seven economists in
Bloomberg News survey predicted no change in the repurchase rate.
Six forecast no change in the reverse repurchase rate and one a
cut to 9.25 percent.  Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said Jan. 2 that Sri Lanka’s
central bank will strive to contain price pressures while
bolstering economic growth this year. Cabraal on Dec. 12
unexpectedly lowered borrowing costs for the first time since
2011, after two rate increases in 2012.  “The 25 basis-point rate cut in December to support growth
was a pre-emptive move, as inflation remains stubbornly high,”
Samantha Amerasinghe, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc in
Colombo, said before the decision.  Sri Lanka’s  inflation rate  of about 9 percent is among the
highest in a basket of 17 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by
Bloomberg, as a drought hurt farm output and officials let the
rupee weaken in 2012 to curb import demand and pare the trade
deficit.  “Inflation is projected to moderate from March 2013 and
reach mid-single digit levels thereafter,” the central bank said
in today’s statement. The nation expects increased capital
inflows this year, it said.  The rupee has fallen about 10 percent against the dollar in
the past year and slipped 0.1 percent at yesterday’s close. The
 Colombo All-Share Index (CSEALL)  of stocks advanced 1.1 percent.  The island’s $59 billion economy expanded 4.8 percent in
the third quarter, the slowest pace since 2009. Sri Lanka seeks
inflation in the mid-single digits, and the government’s
infrastructure drive will help boost expansion to 7.5 percent in
2013 from an estimated 6.5 percent in 2012, Cabraal said Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
