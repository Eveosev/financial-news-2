U.K. natural gas for within-day
delivery rose to an 11-month high as temperatures fell to the
lowest since February, boosting demand for the heating fuel.  Same-day gas  surged as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest
jump since April 2, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. The low temperature in  London  was minus 6 degrees
Celsius (21 Fahrenheit) today and will drop to minus 7 degrees
Jan. 25, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg show.  Tomorrow, snow will be “widespread through the morning,
continuing through the afternoon and evening,” the  Met Office 
said on its website. The maximum temperature in London will be
zero degrees while a southeasterly wind creates a “bitterly
cold” feeling, it said.  Gas for today added as much as 6.4 pence to 76 pence a
therm, the highest price since Feb. 10, and traded at 71.85
pence a therm at 5:26 p.m. London time.  Month-ahead gas  climbed
1.6 percent to 68.5 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.94
per million British thermal units and compares with $3.48 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Within-day gas on the  APX exchange , used by network manager
National Grid to buy or sell gas to ensure the system’s safe
operation, climbed as high as 1 pound a therm overnight, the
first time since January 2010.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow was predicted to
be 385 million cubic meters, compared with a seasonal norm of
309 million,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. The  delivery system 
will contain 370 million cubic meters of gas at the end of the
period, up from 349 million at the beginning, grid data show.  Gas Imports  Imports from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were at a rate of 113 million cubic meters a day after
reaching 138 million yesterday, the most since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in January 2012. Imports from  Belgium  were at
35 million cubic meters a day pace, the most since Dec. 10, data
from Interconnector U.K. Ltd. showed.  Statoil ASA (STL)  of Norway said gas production was reduced by
10.8 million cubic meters a day for one day.  A loss of production from the In Amenas gas field in
 Algeria  following an attack by militants will reduce deliveries
to  Europe  by as much as 9 billion cubic meters a year, an amount
that will probably be replaced with Russian gas, Thierry Bros, a
gas analyst at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said in an e-mailed
research report.  “We could see gas prices trending upwards in the coming
days. But we believe that unless the situation deteriorates more
than our hypothesis, NBP gas prices should be capped at 70 pence
a therm,” he said, referring to the National Balancing Point,
the U.K. gas-trading hub.  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
4:05 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 41 percent, nuclear 17
percent and wind 3.9 percent.  Electricity for tomorrow fell 0.5 percent to 53.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
