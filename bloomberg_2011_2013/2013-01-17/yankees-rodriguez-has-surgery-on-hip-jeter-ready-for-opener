New York  Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez yesterday underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left
hip that will probably rule him out for the first half of the
Major League Baseball season.  Shortstop  Derek Jeter , who broke his left ankle in the
American League Championship Series against Detroit on Oct. 13,
said he has been cleared to start baseball activity. The 38-
year-old said he expects to be ready for the season opener on
April 1, ESPN reported.  Rodriguez’s two-hour procedure went as planned and the 37-
year-old player may leave the hospital as soon as today to begin
a six-month rehabilitation,  the Yankees said  on their website
last night.  The player’s torn labrum, cartilage that surrounds the
socket of the hip joint, was reattached and the femoral head was
rounded to allow for a greater range of motion.  Rodriguez was diagnosed in November, a month after he went
3-for-25 with 12 strikeouts in the post-season against the
 Baltimore Orioles  and  Detroit Tigers .  Before the 2009 season, Rodriguez had his right hip
repaired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
