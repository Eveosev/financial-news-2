The  Swiss National Bank  expects a
2012 full-year profit of about 6 billion francs ($6.4 billion)
as the central bank benefited from foreign currency investments
and a rising gold price.  Foreign-currency holdings contributed 4.7 billion francs,
and valuation gains on its gold holdings added 1.4 billion
francs, the Zurich-based SNB said in a statement today, citing
an initial estimate. While the SNB said that consolidated profit
would be higher because of a contribution from the so-called
stabilization fund, that still compares to consolidated profit
of 13.5 billion francs in 2011. The bank will distribute 1
billion francs to cantons and the Swiss federation.  The SNB amassed record  foreign-currency reserves  as it
defends a franc cap introduced in September 2011 to ward off
investors seeking a haven from  Europe â€™s sovereign-debt crisis.
Holdings stood at 427.2 billion francs at the end of December,
up 68 percent from 254.2 billion francs a year earlier.  The SNB is a joint-stock company in which public
shareholders including cantons and regional banks have a stake
of about 55 percent. Private individuals hold the remainder.  The franc was little changed after the announcement,
trading at 1.2386 against the euro at 7:51 a.m. in Zurich.
Against the dollar, it traded at 93.13 centimes.  The SNB said it will publish the detailed full-year report
with definitive figures on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
