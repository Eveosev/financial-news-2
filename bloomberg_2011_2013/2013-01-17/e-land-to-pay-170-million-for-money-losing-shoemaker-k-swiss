E.Land World Ltd., a South Korean
apparel distributor, agreed to pay about $170 million for  K-
Swiss Inc. (KSWS)  to add the money-losing U.S.-based athletic
shoemaker’s brands to its portfolio.  K-Swiss stockholders will receive $4.75 in cash per share,
49 percent more than yesterday’s closing price on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the  Westlake Village , California-based shoemaker
and E-Land said yesterday in a statement.  K-Swiss sales have dropped by about 50 percent since 2005
and the shares have plunged 91 percent from the 2006 high as the
shoemaker’s all-white casual sneakers fell out of fashion and
the company failed to take advantage of growth in athletic
footwear demand. Revenue in the 12 months through September was
$231.3 million, compared with $508.6 million in calendar 2005.
Net losses from 2009, 2010 and 2011 totaled more than $160
million.  E.Land’s business “will provide K-Swiss with the resources
and scale to return to its former performance levels,” Steven Nichols, president of the shoemaker said in the statement
yesterday.  Goldman Sachs & Co. advised K-Swiss, while Morgan Stanley
advised E.Land World, according to the statement.  The deal gives K-Swiss an enterprise value of about $135
million, or 0.58 times revenue, compared with the 0.64 times
average for 18 athletic shoe, footwear and related apparel deals
over the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nichols Control  The company was founded by two Swiss brothers who
introduced leather tennis shoes in the U.S. in 1966. An
investment group led byNichols, also chairman of the K-Swiss
board, then purchased the company and took it public in 1990.
Nichols controls the company through his Class B shares, which
gave him 69 percent of total voting power as of Dec. 31, 2011,
according to company filings.  Closely held E.Land owns a range of apparel and sports
brands and distributes products for New Balance. The company
made a bid for shoemaker Collective Brands Inc. last year.  K-Swiss rose 48 percent to $4.71 at the close in  New York 
for the largest gain since becoming a public company. Through
yesterday, the shares had gained 5.6 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
