Malaysia’s ringgit rose, halting a
two-day loss, ahead of a report that’s forecast to show growth
in  China’s economy  accelerated, improving the outlook for Asian
exports.  Government bonds  declined.  Gross domestic product in China, the Southeast Asian
nation’s biggest overseas market, increased 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with 7.4 percent in
the previous period, according to the median estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before data tomorrow. The
Malaysian Institute of Economic Research said today it maintains
its prediction for a 5.1 percent rise in local GDP last year and
5.6 percent in 2013.  “Market players are expecting pretty strong Chinese
data,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “That’s going to
support risk appetite.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.0150 per dollar
as of 10:23 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0125 earlier, near the 3.0032 level
reached on Jan. 15 that was the strongest since March 9.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.15 percent.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised its forecast for most
Asian currencies in a research note released yesterday, to
reflect expectations the dollar will “remain soft” over 2013.
The lender predicts the ringgit will strengthen to 2.85 per
dollar by year-end, compared with an earlier estimate of 3.00.  Malaysian inflation may have quickened to 1.4 percent in
December from a year earlier, compared with 1.3 percent in the
previous month, a Bloomberg survey showed ahead of a Jan. 23
government report. MIER is predicting a rate of 1.7 percent for
the whole of 2012 and 2.5 percent for this year.  The yield on the 3.314 percent sovereign notes due October
2017 climbed five basis points to 3.26 percent, according to
prices from Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
