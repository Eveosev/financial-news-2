Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
country’s biggest lender by assets, dropped the most in almost
eight months on a technical signal that suggested a rally this
year was overdone.  KCB, as the lender is known, fell 5.1 percent to close at
32.75 shillings a share in the capital, Nairobi, its biggest
retreat since May 22.  The stock had climbed 16 percent this year before today,
closing at a record high of 34.5 shillings yesterday, leaving
its 14-day  relative strength index  at 91.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A reading above 70 means a security is
overvalued and will probably fall. KCB’s RSI was above 70 every
day this year until today, where it last stood at 65.5.  “Guys are taking profits after the shares gained so
much,” Faith Atiti, a research analyst at Nairobi-based NIC
Securities Ltd. said by telephone. “The market was expecting
the correction after the rally.”  The lender’s earnings in the nine months through September
surged 35 percent to 8.69 billion shillings ($100 million) as
income from loans grew, it said Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
