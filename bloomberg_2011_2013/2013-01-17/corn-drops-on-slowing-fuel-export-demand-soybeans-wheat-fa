Corn declined for the first time in
nine sessions after a government report showed slowing demand
for the grain to make fuel in the U.S., and exports tumbled.
Soybeans and wheat dropped.  Ethanol  production  fell last week to the lowest since the
government began reporting data in June 2010, and  inventories 
rose to the highest in four weeks, the Energy Department said
yesterday. Export sales of  corn  were 48 percent smaller than a
year earlier in the week ended Jan. 10, and  commitments  since
Sept. 1 were down 49 percent compared with the same date a year
ago.  “The slowdown in ethanol production will curb demand for
corn,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief market analyst for Rice Dairy LLC
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Corn exports remain
depressed.”  Corn futures for March delivery slid 0.9 percent to close
at $7.245 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
grain jumped 7.5 percent in the prior eight sessions, the
longest rally since December 2011.  Corn and soybeans also fell as rain overnight in  Argentina 
and forecasts for more in northern  Brazil  increased crop
potential, reducing the outlook for U.S. exports when harvesting
begins in South America next month,  Roy Huckabay , an executive
vice president for the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Soybean futures for March delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$14.3025 a bushel on the CBOT. Earlier, the price touched
$14.48, the highest since Dec. 19.  Wheat futures for March delivery slipped 0.5 percent to
$7.8125 a bushel in  Chicago , after gaining 5.4 percent the prior
four sessions. Yesterday, the price touched $7.91, the highest
since Dec. 26.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at a record $76.5
billion in 2011, with soybeans in second place at $35.8 billion,
government figures show. Wheat is the fourth-biggest crop,
behind hay, with a value of $14.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
