The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose to the strongest against the yen in more than four
years as the Japanese currency tumbled on bets policy makers
will work to push it down further to spur economic growth.  The Aussie dollar fell versus its U.S. counterpart after
Australian employers unexpectedly cut payrolls last month. New
Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, depreciated against the
greenback before data that may show  China ’s economic growth in
the fourth quarter was close to the slowest since  2009. China
is  Australia ’s largest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
biggest export destination.  “The key catalyst for the Aussie will be the outcome of
China’s numbers,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York, said yesterday
in a telephone interview.  Australia’s dollar climbed 1.4 percent to 94.79 yen
yesterday in New York trading and touched 95.02 yen, the
strongest level since August 2008. It fell 0.3 percent to
$1.0546.  The kiwi appreciated 1.1 percent to 75.16 yen and reached
75.83, the highest since September 2008. It declined 0.6 percent
to 83.63 U.S. cents.  The yen slid versus all of its 16 most-traded peers tracked
by Bloomberg after Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari said
his Jan. 15 comments that excessive weakening of the currency
was harmful were misinterpreted. Amari told reporters in  Tokyo 
yesterday the yen is still correcting from excessive
appreciation.  BOJ Agreement  The  Bank of Japan  and government officials reached basic
agreement on a joint statement calling for a 2 percent inflation
target, versus the current 1 percent goal, and additional funds
for purchasing assets, Nikkei reported without attribution. The
BOJ meets Jan. 21-22.  Gross domestic product  in China expanded 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to another
Bloomberg survey. It was 7.4 percent in the previous period, the
least in more than three years. GDP grew 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2011.  Employment in Australia fell by 5,500 jobs in December, the
government reported, compared with a forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey for a 4,000-position increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
