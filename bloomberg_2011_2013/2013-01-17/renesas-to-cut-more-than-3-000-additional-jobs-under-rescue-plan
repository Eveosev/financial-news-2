Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
ailing Japanese chipmaker, plans to cut more than 3,000
additional jobs as it prepares to raise at least 150 billion yen
($1.7 billion) from a government-backed fund and customers.  Renesas began talks with labor unions today and plans to
eliminate the positions through buyouts by Sept. 30, the
Kawasaki-based company said in a statement. No upper limit for
buyout applications has been set, and the impact on earnings
hasn’t been determined, Renesas said.  The reduction adds to about 7,500 positions cut through a
buyout program in October, taking the planned job losses to
about 25 percent of Renesas’s workforce. The supplier to  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  and Nintendo Co. agreed to sell new shares to a group led
by  Innovation Network Corp. of Japan  last month to raise funds
as  Japan ’s chipmakers struggle amid falling demand, a strong yen
and competition from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)   “The downside risk for Renesas shares may be limited for
now with this restructuring,” said Takashi Oba, a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities Co. “Renesas must start to show
evidence of a recovery, such as posting an operating profit, and
concentrate on its strengths.”  Renesas, which  employed  41,900 people as of September,  fell 
1 percent to 288 yen at 9:55 a.m. in Tokyo trading. The stock
was headed for the lowest close since Dec. 3. Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.5 percent.  More Funds  The chipmaker said last month that it may get an additional
50 billion yen of investment or financing from INCJ if more
funds are needed. A group of companies including  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Denso Corp. (6902) ,  Keihin Corp. (7251) ,  Panasonic
Corp. (6752) ,  Nikon Corp. (7731) ,  Yaskawa Electric Corp. (6506)  and  Canon Inc. (7751)  will
also invest in Renesas, the company said then.  Renesas plans to increase spending to develop more advanced
microcontrollers used in cars and televisions, after demand fell
for its system LSI chips, used for functions including
processing TV images. The microcontroller business accounted for
43 percent of Renesas’s sales last fiscal year.  Falling demand and prices for chips, along with a stronger
yen, caused Tokyo-based Elpida Memory Inc. to file for
 bankruptcy protection  in February before agreeing in July to be
acquired by Boise, Idaho-based  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)   Renesas has posted 177.6 billion yen in combined losses
since it was formed in 2010 through the merger of money-losing
chipmakers Renesas Technology Corp., a venture between  Hitachi
Ltd. (6501)  and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , and NEC Electronics Corp.  Forecast Cut  Last month, Renesas cut its revenue forecast for the year
ending March 31 to 820 billion yen from a previous estimate of
868 billion yen. The company maintained its net loss forecast of
150 billion yen, compared with a loss of 62.6 billion yen last
fiscal year.  Renesas had a 27 percent share of the global market for
microcontrollers in 2011, according to researcher IHS iSuppli.
It controlled 42 percent of the market for microcontrollers used
in cars to run systems including airbags and brakes. A lack of
the components after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in
Japan forced automakers to shut factories.  Renesas clinched loan contracts for about 200 billion yen
with lenders including  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309) , the
chipmaker said Sept. 28.  Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and  NEC Corp. (6701)  currently own a
combined 91 percent of Renesas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
