Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest maker of  wind turbines , may sell as many as 375 turbine
towers a year under a deal with a rival manufacturer.  Vestas will use as much as 25 percent of capacity at its
factory in Pueblo,  Colorado , for the order. The site can produce
almost 1,500 towers a year, Chief Operating Officer Jean-Marc Lechene said today, declining to confirm the 375 calculation.  Vestas is branching into tower manufacturing for external
customers to boost revenue after overcapacity among turbine
producers wiped out profit at the Danish company. Vestas and its
competitors have cut jobs and withdrawn from weaker markets to
reduce costs as wind-industry growth slows.  The tower agreement, announced yesterday, marks the first
time Aarhus-based Vestas has sold the support structures to a
competitor. The deal is with a single client, an American
manufacturer with multiple projects, Lechene said today by
telephone, declining to identify the client or disclose
financial terms. Vestas has also secured smaller deals for
metal-cast components with non-wind customers, he said.  “This is not at all part of our core plan,” Lechene said.
“It’s additional business which is the cherry on the cake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
