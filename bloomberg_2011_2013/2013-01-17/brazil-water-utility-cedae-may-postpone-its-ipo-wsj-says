Cia Estadual de Aguas & Esgotos, a
Brazilian water and sewage utility, may postpone its initial
public offering, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing two
people close to the situation.  Executives of the company will meet lawyers today to
discuss pushing back the proposed IPO, the Journal said in the
 article  without disclosing the sources.  Cedae, as the company is known, in October filed an
application with the local financial regulator Comissao de
Valores Mobiliarios for the 1.6 billion-real ($784 million)
share offering, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
