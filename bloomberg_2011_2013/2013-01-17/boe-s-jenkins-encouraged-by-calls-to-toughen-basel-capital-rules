U.S. and U.K. lawmakers are
increasingly calling for tougher global capital standards than
those included in the so-called Basel rules, said Robert Jenkins, a member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy
Committee.  Jenkins is “encouraged by the growing frequency of tougher
comments than in the past,” he told reporters at a conference
on financial regulation in  London  today.  “There are as many examples of people voicing concerns
that Basel III doesn’t go far enough as people worried it goes
too far,” Jenkins said. Those calling for tougher rules in the
U.S. and U.K. are “new on the scene. You see that in Congress
and in Parliament,” Jenkins said.  The FPC this week proposed powers to alter the amount of
capital banks hold against real-estate assets as well as
derivatives and bonds as it seeks to strengthen the financial
system. The committee, led by BOE Governor Mervyn King, is
currently operating on an interim basis as legislation passes
through Parliament.  Bank shares soared this month after the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, a global group of central bankers and
regulators, struck a deal to broaden the types of easy-to-sell
assets banks could hold to protect against future credit crises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
