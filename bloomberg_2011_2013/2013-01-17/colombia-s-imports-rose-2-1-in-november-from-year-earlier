Colombia’s imports rose 2.1 percent
to $5.17 billion in November compared with the same month of
2011, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  Colombia posted a $183.2 million trade deficit in November.
The trade surplus compares with a median forecast for a $137
million surplus in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  Spending on imports has been boosted by a 9.7 percent
appreciation in the Colombian peso last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
