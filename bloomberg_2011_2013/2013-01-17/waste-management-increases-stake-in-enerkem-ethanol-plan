  Enerkem Inc. (NKM) , a closely held
Canadian biofuel company, sold a stake in an ethanol plant it’s
building in Alberta to  Waste Management Inc. (WM)  and EB Investments
ULC for C$37 million ($37.5 million).  The total cost of the plant is expected to be about C$100
million, Marie-Hélène Labrie, a spokeswoman for Montreal-based
Enerkem, said today in an e-mail. The project in  Edmonton  is
also funded by C$23.4 million in government grants and will
convert garbage into about 10 million gallons of ethanol a year.  The facility will initially produce methanol, which will be
sold to  Methanex Corp. (MX) , until ethanol production begins in 2014,
Labrie said. EB Investments and Waste Management each invested
C$7.5 million in the project in December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
