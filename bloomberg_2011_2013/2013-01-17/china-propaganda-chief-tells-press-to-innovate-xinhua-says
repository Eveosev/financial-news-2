Liu Qibao, head of the Communist
Party of  China ’s publicity department, told the state press to
stay “innovative” and “improve” reporting styles to make
stories more palatable to the public, Xinhua News Agency said.  The People’s Daily should focus on editorials as they
showcase its ideological leanings, the official news agency
said, citing Liu as he toured the newspaper today. Editorials
should be “timely and relevant” and “help set the agenda in
the public opinion,” he said, as cited by Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
