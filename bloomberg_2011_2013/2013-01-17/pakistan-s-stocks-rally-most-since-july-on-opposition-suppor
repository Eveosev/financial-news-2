Pakistan’s (KSE100)  stocks rose the most in
more than six months as confidence in the government rose after
opposition parties rejected yesterday demands by a cleric for
the government’s sacking.  The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index gained 1.2
percent to 16,374.66 as of 11:58 p.m. in Karachi. The gauge was
poised for its biggest advance since July 2.  National Bank of
Pakistan (NBP) , the country’s biggest lender by assets, climbed 2.3
percent, the most since Nov. 30.  Oil & Gas Development Co. (OGDC) , the
nation’s biggest explorer, added 1.3 percent.  Opposition parties led by the  Pakistan  Muslim League-Nawaz
have refused to render support to Tahir-ul-Qadri, a cleric who
has gathered thousands of supporters on the streets in the
capital Islamabad calling for reforms.  “The announcement by the opposition parties yesterday has
rallied confidence among investors,” Faisal Bilwani, head of
international equity sales at Elixir Securities Pakistan Ltd. in
Karachi, said by phone. “The understanding between the
opposition and government is what is causing the rise.”  The KSE 100 Index tumbled the most in 17 months on Jan. 15
after the nation’s  Supreme Court  ordered the arrest of Prime
Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf amid allegations of graft. The
chairman of the anti-corruption agency told the chief justice
today there isn’t enough evidence to arrest Ashraf and others
accused of graft in awarding power contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
