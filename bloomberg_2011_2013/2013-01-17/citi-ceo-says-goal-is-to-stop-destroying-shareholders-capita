Citigroup Inc. (C)  Chief Executive
Officer Michael Corbat, who took over at the third-largest
 U.S. bank  in October, said one of his goals is to “stop
destroying our shareholders’ capital.”  Corbat, 52, was asked on a conference call with analysts
what he hopes to have achieved when he looks back on his
accomplishments five years from now.  “We’ve got to get to a point where we stop destroying our
shareholders’ capital,” said Corbat, who replaced Vikram Pandit
after the former CEO was ousted last year. “I’d say that would
certainly be at the top of our list. That we run a smart and
efficient business that’s good at its allocation of its
resources around its customer and client segments.”  Citigroup’s  shares  have declined 92 percent in the past six
years. The bank survived the financial crisis with help from
$45 billion of rescue funds from the U.S. government, which it
later repaid.  Citigroup trades at 67 percent of its book value and 81
percent of tangible book, it’s theoretical liquidation value.
The firm earned a 4 percent return on equity, a measure of how
well it invests shareholder money. That’s below the bank’s
estimated cost of equity of about 10 percent.  Corbat also said he hopes that Citigroup “served a social
purpose.”  He said the bank’s “primary focus” is on boosting the
stock price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
