Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of the
Food Lion supermarkets in the U.S., posted fourth-quarter
revenue in line with estimates and announced the closure of 34
stores under its Sweetbay banner.  Revenue for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 2.3 percent
to 5.76 billion euros ($7.66 billion), in line with the 5.79
billion-euro average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Excluding currency translation effects, revenue rose
0.3 percent.  Underlying operating profit for the full year fell about
17.5 percent, the midpoint of its own forecast of a drop of 15
percent to 20 percent. Delhaize had said in its most recent
guidance that it expected the 2012 decline at the bottom end of
the range.  The company said it will incur about 390 million euros in
one-time charges, mostly due to impairments at Belgrade-based
Maxi. About 300 million euros will be booked in the fourth
quarter and about 90 million euros in the first quarter.  The charges include about 130 million euros for store
closings at Sweetbay and about 15 million euros in management
settlement costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
