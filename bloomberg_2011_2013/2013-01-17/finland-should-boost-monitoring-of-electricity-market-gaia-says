Finland  needs to strengthen its
monitoring of the country’s concentrated power market, as heavy
manufacturing industries increasingly suffer from soaring
electricity prices, consultant Gaia Group Oy said.  Over the past six years, electricity traded in Finland has
cost 9 percent more on average than power in the  Nordic area  as
a whole, adding 350 million euros ($465 million) in costs for
energy-intensive industries last year, according to Iivo
Vehvilaeinen, leading consultant at Gaia in Helsinki.  This has added costs for Finland’s energy-intensive pulp,
chemicals and basic metals industries, which contribute twice
the European average to the economy, according to the
 International Energy Agency . The northern European country lacks
the oil and hydropower supplies of neighbors Russia and  Norway ,
while industries represent half of the country’s electricity
consumption, according to data from the Finnish Energy
Industries lobby group’s website.  “This begs the question whether market monitoring and
consumer protection need boosting,” since concentrated
ownership of power production capacity enables the biggest
generators to use strategic bidding to increase market prices,
he said by phone on Jan. 15.  From 2007 through last year, power bought and sold on Nord
Pool Spot AS’s energy exchange in Oslo cost as much as 6.29
euros a megawatt-hour more in Finland compared with the average
Nordic price, while the differential last year increased to a 5-
year high of 5.44 euros, from 2.25 euros a year earlier,
according to data from the exchange.  There is no immediate need to intensify market scrutiny in
Finland, Riku Huttunen, director general of Finland’s  Energy
Market Authority , which monitors power and natural gas markets,
said by phone from Helsinki yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
