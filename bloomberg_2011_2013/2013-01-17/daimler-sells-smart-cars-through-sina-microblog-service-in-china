Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
biggest luxury-vehicle maker, will sell a limited edition of its
Smart city car through  China ’s largest microblog service as it
reaches out to the country’s 564 million Internet users.  Daimler will offer 666 units of the two-door Smart car from
tomorrow on  Sina Corp. (SINA) ’s Twitter-like Weibo service. Buyers have
to register online and put down a 1,999  yuan  ($321) deposit for
the 128,888-yuan model, according to the Sina.com website.  Tying up with social networking services gives automakers
like Daimler an alternative avenue to reach consumers even as
they open more sales outlets in the world’s largest vehicle
market. The Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker sold 15,680 Smart
cars in China last year, a 45 percent increase from 2011,
according to the company.  Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said on Jan.
14 the company must turn around its struggling Chinese
operations to catch up with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi.  Mercedes fell further behind BMW and Audi in sales last
year as it grew more slowly in China than its two main rivals.
Daimler didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail request for
comment on the Smart promotion.  China added 51 million Internet users last year, giving it
more Web users than the population of any other country in the
world excluding India. Started in 2009, Sina Weibo has more than
368 million registered users, according to its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
