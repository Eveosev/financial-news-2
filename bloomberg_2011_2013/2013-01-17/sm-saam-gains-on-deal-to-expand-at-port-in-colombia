Sociedad Matriz SAAM SA (SMSAAM) , the port
operator spun off from the container shipping company  Cia. Sud
Americana de Vapores , rose after announcing a deal to expand
operations in Colombia.  SM SAAM rose 0.9 percent to 60.50 pesos at 4:47 p.m. in
Santiago. The shares, which tumbled after their initial public
offering in March, have climbed 21 percent from a record low in
September.  The Chilean port operator announced yesterday in a
statement it signed a deal with Abonos Colombianos SA, or
Abocol, and Compas to jointly operate the port of Buenavista in
Colombia and build a nearby logistics center. Both are located
in the Mamonal area near the city of Cartagena.  The deal will require an initial investment of $45 million,
the company said in the statement.  SM SAAM, which provides port services such as towing, was
formed in early 2012 from assets owned by CSAV after  Quinenco
SA (QUINENC) , the holding company of the billionaire Luksic family, gained
control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
