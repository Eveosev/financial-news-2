Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
biggest carmaker, said it is cutting the price of the all-
electric Leaf hatchback in the country to boost sales in the
model’s largest market.  Nissan will trim the current G, X and S grades of the car
by 280,000 yen ($3,165) starting in April, following price cuts
in the U.S. earlier this month, according to a statement by the
company today.  Nissan Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  has estimated
electric vehicles would account for at least 10 percent of
global auto sales by 2020, a view not shared by other large
carmakers. The push by carmakers including Nissan and  General
Motors Co. (GM)  to spur market for rechargeable vehicles has been
hampered by the higher costs of such models and the need for
more recharging stations.  After Japanese government incentives as much as 780,000
yen, prices for the G, X and S grades of the car will be 3
million, 2.6 million and 2.2 million yen, Nissan said. The
incentive is set to expire March 31.  Buyers who get the car before the April cut takes effect
will be reimbursed for the difference in price, Nissan said.  The  Japan ’s second-largest carmaker sold 11,115 units of
Leaf last year at home, 8 percent more than a year earlier. Leaf
sales in the U.S. rose 1.5 percent last year to 9,819, less than
half of Ghosn’s 20,000-unit target.  Nissan sold 26,973 Leafs in 2012 globally, a rise of 22
percent over 2011.  Toyota Motor Corp. is Japan’s largest carmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
