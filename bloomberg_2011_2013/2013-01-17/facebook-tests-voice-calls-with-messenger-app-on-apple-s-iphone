Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social network, is testing voice calls in the U.S.
on its Messenger application for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone as it seeks
to add more mobile services.  The company said in an e-mail that it’s extending a test
begun in Canada earlier this month. Callers can use the app to
make phone calls to friends over  data networks  instead of the
voice service provided by traditional phone companies.  “We started testing this in Canada the first week of the
year and today we’re extending that test to the U.S.,” Facebook
said. “We were able to expand the test so quickly because it
went well in  Canada  and we wanted to expand the audience.”  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is stepping up
its efforts in mobile to attract more consumers who use the
service via tablets and smartphones. About 60 percent of
Facebook’s more than 1 billion members used mobile devices to
access the service at the end of the third quarter, up from less
than half of them a year earlier, according to a  filing .  To make a call on the application, users tap on an “i”
and then choose the option for “free call.” The application
helps members quickly share messages with friends via mobile
devices, including features for scrolling through a list of
friends and checking on past notes from users.  Facebook slipped less than 1 percent to $29.85 today at the
close in New York.  The shares  have fallen 21 percent since the
initial public offering price of $38 in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
