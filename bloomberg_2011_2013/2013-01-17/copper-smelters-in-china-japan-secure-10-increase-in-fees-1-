Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s biggest
copper smelter, and  Japan ’s Pan Pacific Copper Co. said mining
companies will pay them at least a 10 percent increase in fees
to process the metal in 2013, climbing for a third year.  Jiangxi Copper settled fees with  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX)  and another miner it didn’t name at $70 a metric ton
and 7 cents per pound, Pan Qifang, secretary of the board for
the Guixi, Jiangxi province-based smelter, said today. Pan
Pacific agreed with several miners, whose names it didn’t
disclose, to increase the charges by 10 percent, said Shigeru Oi, senior executive officer for raw materials.  Mining companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Freeport
have been negotiating with smelters to set the charges for 2013.
The higher treatment and refining fees may boost revenue for
smelters including Pan Pacific, which forecast global supply of
the metal to outstrip demand by 199,000 tons in 2013 for the
first time in four years as mine output grows.  “The increase, which reflects market expectation of more
ore supply from later this year, will partly offset rising power
costs and the stronger yen for Japanese smelters,” said Kim Gyung Jung, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co. in
 Seoul .  Treatment fees are expressed in dollars per ton of
concentrate received and refining fees in cents per pound of
copper in the ore. The fees are deducted from the price paid by
smelters to mining companies for the raw material.  2012 Fees  Freeport and large smelters in China and Japan set the fees
in 2012 at $63.5 a ton and 6.35 cents a pound, while BHP and
some Chinese smelters agreed to $60 a ton and 6 cents a pound.
Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
rose 0.1 percent to $7,957.25 a ton at 4:24 p.m. in  Tokyo .  Fiona Martin, a Melbourne-based spokeswoman for BHP,
declined to comment. BHP owns Escondida in  Chile , the world’s
biggest copper mine. A call to  Eric Kinneberg , spokesman for
Phoenix-based Freeport, wasn’t answered outside of business
hours. Freeport operates the Grasberg mine in Indonesia.  Masashi Takahashi, a spokesman at  Sumitomo Metal Mining
Co. (5713) , Japan’s second-biggest copper smelter, and Toshiaki Yamada,
a spokesman at  Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Japan’s third-largest
producer, declined to comment.  Global copper supply will exceed demand by 330,000 tons in
2013, compared with a deficit of 320,000 tons in 2012, Deutsche
Bank said in a report on Jan. 8. Mine-supply growth is expected
to increase significantly in 2013, exceeding 8 percent, a rate
not witnessed for more than a decade, the bank said.  “The market will remain tight because the stock-to-
consumption ratio will stay at a low level amid concern over
labor disputes at some mines,” said Toshitaka Nakamura, senior
executive officer for marketing at Pan Pacific, which is a joint
venture between JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corp., a unit of  JX
Holdings Inc. , and  Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. (5706)  The company
projects the ratio at 1.4 months in 2013, compared with 1.3
months in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
