Mark Teixeira  of the New York
Yankees and David Wright of the New York Mets are among 27 Major
League Baseball players on the U.S. team for this year’s World
Baseball Classic.  R.A. Dickey of the Toronto Blue Jays, who won last season’s
National League Cy Young Award with the Mets, headlines an
American starting pitching rotation that also includes Derek
Holland of the Texas Rangers, Kris Medlen of the Atlanta Braves
and Ryan Vogelsong of the San Francisco Giants.  Three Most Valuable Player Award winners are also on the
U.S. roster -- Milwaukee Brewers outfielder  Ryan Braun ,
Minnesota Twins catcher  Joe Mauer  and Philadelphia Phillies
shortstop Jimmy Rollins. Others on the squad include second
baseman  Brandon Phillips  of the Cincinnati Reds and outfielders
Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins, Adam Jones of the
Baltimore Orioles and Shane Victorino of the Boston Red Sox.  The U.S. team will be led by former Yankees manager Joe
Torre and play first-round games in Phoenix from March 8-10.
They’re in a group that includes Canada, Mexico and Italy. The
WBC championship game is March 19 in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
