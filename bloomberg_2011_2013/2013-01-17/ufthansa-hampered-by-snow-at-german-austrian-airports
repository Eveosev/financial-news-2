Heavy snowfalls led to hundreds of
flight cancellations at Germany’s and  Austria ’s main airports,
curtailing service by carriers including  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) 
 Europe ’s second-biggest airline.  Vienna airport was closed for inbound flights from at least
1:20 p.m., with outbound traffic also hampered, the operator
said on its website, where it listed more than 160 flights as
scrapped. Munich airport cut about 10 percent of scheduled
services and said the proportion may rise to 20 percent by the
evening.  “We’ve cleared both of our runways three times already
today,” Edgar Engert, a Munich airport spokesman, said by
telephone. “We try to keep one in operation at all times, and
we are doing a lot of de-icing of planes.”  Fraport AG’s Frankfurt Airport, Europe’s third-busiest by
passenger numbers, reported 40 cancellations of flights,
primarily to the other two cities, out of a total 1,193 takeoffs
and landings scheduled today, according to Jana Schwab, a
spokeswoman. Munich airport,  Germany ’s second-busiest,
originally had 971 flights on its timetable.  Lufthansa was the most affected by the disruptions, as
Frankfurt and Munich are its main brand’s hubs and Vienna is the
base for its Austrian Airlines unit, with cancellations focused
on internal German or central and east European routes. Other
carriers with flights scrapped in Vienna included British
Airways, Turkish Airlines and Moscow-based OAO Aeroflot,
according to the airport’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
