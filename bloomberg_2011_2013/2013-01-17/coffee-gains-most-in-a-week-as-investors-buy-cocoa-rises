Arabica coffee gained the most in
four sessions on mounting concern that a crop disease will curb
output in Central America.  Orange juice  also rose, while sugar
fell.  Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica will have smaller
coffee crops this year after an outbreak of leaf rust, a fungus
that attacks foliage. In the week ended Jan. 8, money managers
and speculators cut bearish bets to 22,321 futures and options
from 23,153 a week earlier, government data showed. The
commodity, which sank 37 percent in 2012, has risen 8.1 percent
this year.  “We continue to make strides to higher prices on fears of
the leaf rust,”  Hector Galvan , a senior broker at RJO Futures
in  Chicago , said in an e-mail. “This may be the catalyst to
draw coffee out of its large downtrend should we see more bleak
news.”  Arabica coffee for March delivery jumped 1.6 percent to
settle at $1.555 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , the biggest gain since Jan. 11.  Also in New York, orange-juice futures for delivery in
March rose less than 0.1 percent to $1.1235 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
18.42 cents a pound on ICE, the fourth straight decline and the
longest slump since mid-October.  The sweetener is likely to fall to 17 cents in the second
quarter, with the average for the three-month period estimated
at 17.5 cents amid excess supplies,  Kona Haque , an analyst with
Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a conference call from London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
