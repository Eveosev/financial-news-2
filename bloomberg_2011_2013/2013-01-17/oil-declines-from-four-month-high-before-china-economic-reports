Oil headed for the longest weekly
rising streak in 14 months in  New York  after economic growth
accelerated in  China , the world’s second-biggest crude consumer.  West Texas Intermediate traded close to a four-month high
after gaining the most in two weeks yesterday. The  International
Energy Agency  raised forecasts for global oil demand this year
as demand rises in China and said the world oil market is
“tighter” than previously estimated. China’s gross domestic
product rose 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, compared with 7.4 percent in the previous period, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today in Beijing.  “I don’t think there will be a hard landing in China,”
said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management Ltd.
in Middelfart,  Denmark .  Crude for February delivery was at $95.36 a barrel, down 13
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:57 p.m. London time. The contract advanced 1.3 percent to
$95.49 yesterday. That was biggest gain since Jan. 2 and the
highest close since Sept. 17. Prices gained 1.9 percent this
week for a sixth straight advance, the longest run of gains
since November 2011.  Brent for March settlement slipped 32 cents to $110.78 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a premium of $14.99 to WTI
futures for the same month. The gap was $15.16 yesterday, the
narrowest closing level since July 24.  IEA Estimate  “All of a sudden, the market looks tighter than we
thought,” the Paris-based IEA said, boosting its 2013 global
demand forecast by 240,000 barrels a day. World consumption will
increase by 900,000 barrels a day, or 1 percent, this year to
average a record 90.8 million.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest exporter, reduced
production from its highest in 30 years, and inventories in
developed economies are contracting after accumulating in much
of 2012, according to the IEA.  China’s oil processing rose 3.7 percent last year to 467.9
million metric tons, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
report today. Refining in December increased 8.4 percent from a
year ago to a record 10.2 million barrels a day, beating the
previous high in November.  Brent Pipeline  The Brent pipeline system is pumping oil from all North Sea
platforms shut earlier this week, except Cormorant Alpha.  The pipeline, which carries about 10 percent of the U.K.’s
production, resumed partial pumping yesterday and now more crude
is flowing into it because most of the fields have resumed
activity, an official at Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. PJSC,
known as Taqa, said today by phone from the city of Aberdeen,
 Scotland . The official declined to say what the current flow
rate is.  WTI may rise next week on speculation that stronger
economic growth will boost fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Fourteen of 36 analysts and traders, or 39 percent,
forecast crude will increase through Jan. 25. Twelve
respondents, or 33 percent, predicted a drop. Ten said there
would be little change. Last week, 50 percent projected a gain.  Oil gained yesterday after Algerian forces raided a natural
gas plant to free workers seized by an al-Qaeda-linked group.
U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the nation should prepare
for “bad news ahead” in a broadcast interview yesterday.  The rally in New York may stall as a technical indicator
shows futures have risen too quickly for further gains to be
sustainable. The 14-day relative strength index closed yesterday
at 71.1, the highest since Feb. 27, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A reading above 70 signals a market is overbought
and will probably decline. The RSI is at 71.4 today.  WTI dropped 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened the glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI and America’s largest storage hub. That left it at an
average discount of $17.47 a barrel to Brent last year, compared
with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years through 2010.
London-traded Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, climbed 3.5 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
