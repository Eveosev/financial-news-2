Rubber declined for a fourth day to
the lowest in almost three weeks as stockpiles jumped to the
highest level in more than two years in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer of the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in June fell as much as 1 percent to
308.30 yen a kilogram ($3,495 a metric ton), the lowest level
since Dec. 28, on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and traded at
301.6 yen by 1:11 p.m. local time.  Natural rubber  inventories  climbed 1,824 tons to 101,482
tons last week, the highest level since March 2010, based on a
survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan
and Tianjin, according to data from the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.  “Hefty stockpiles in China are pressuring the market,”
said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.
Investors are waiting for China’s industrial production data
tomorrow to set direction for next week, Saito said.  China will release data tomorrow on fourth-quarter gross
domestic product, December industrial production and retail
sales and full-year fixed-asset investment. Economic growth
probably accelerated to 7.8 percent in the October-December
period from a year earlier, up from a three-year low in the
previous quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Rubber for delivery in May was down 0.2 percent at 25,440
 yuan  ($4,089) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board yesterday dropped for a third day, falling
2 percent to 99.20 baht ($3.32) a kilogram, according to the
Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
