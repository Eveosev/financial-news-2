Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  gained as much as
10 percent in Brussels trading as the brand repositioning at
Food Lion supermarkets, its biggest U.S. banner, boosted sales
volumes.  Delhaize shares gained as much as 3.25 euros to 35.20
euros, the highest since Aug. 22. The stock, the best-performing
in  Belgium ’s benchmark Bel20 Index this year, traded at 34.87
euros, or 9.1 percent higher, at 10:30 a.m. local time.  The repositioned Food Lion outlets generated sales and
volume growth in the fourth quarter on a comparable-store basis.
Further price cuts at Hannaford and the expansion of Bottom
Dollar Food helped volume at those banners, the company said
today in a statement.  “We remain determined to accelerate the transformation of
our business,” Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Olivier Beckers
said in the statement. “In 2013, our focus will be on further
strengthening our store brands, accelerating revenue growth,
maintaining strict cost control and generating free  cash flow .”  Group revenue for the three months ended Dec. 31 increased
2.3 percent to 5.76 billion euros ($7.66 billion), in line with
the 5.79 billion-euro average of seven analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding currency translation effects,
revenue rose 0.3 percent.  Underlying  operating profit  for the full year fell about
17.5 percent, in the middle of its own forecast of a drop of 15
percent to 20 percent, the company said. Delhaize had said it
expected the 2012 decline “at the bottom-end” of that range.  The company said it will incur about 390 million euros in
one-time charges, mostly due to impairments at Belgrade-based
Maxi. The charges also include writedowns at its Albanian
operations, which the company has an agreement to sell this
year. About 300 million euros of the charges will be booked in
the fourth quarter and about 90 million euros in the first
quarter.  The charges include 130 million euros for 34 store closings
at Sweetbay and 15 million euros in management settlement costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
