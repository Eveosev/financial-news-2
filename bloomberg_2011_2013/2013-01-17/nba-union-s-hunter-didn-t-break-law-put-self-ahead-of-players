Association Executive Director  Billy Hunter  didn’t do anything
illegal, though an outside review of union business found
he put personal interests ahead of the organization, 
failed to manage conflicts of interests and knowingly
didn’t disclose that his contract wasn’t properly approved.  The review was conducted by the New York law firm  Paul
Weiss , which concluded that NBA players should consider whether
Hunter should remain as the union’s executive director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
