The European Union sold spot carbon
permits for 2013 through 2020 at 5.36 euros ($7.16) a metric
ton, according to  data  from the European Energy Exchange AG,
which hosted the sale.  Spot permits for the third phase of the bloc’s emissions-
trading system were bid at 5.43 euros and offered at 5.51 euros
at 9:55 a.m. on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, the last
prices before the sale ended. The  differential  between the
midpoint of the bid-offer and the auction price was 11 euro
cents, the most since Nov. 16.  The exchange received bids totaling 8.2 million tons for
the 3.5 million permits it sold. The so-called bid ratio, which
measures demand in the auction against supply, was 2.32, an
increase of 2.7 percent from yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
