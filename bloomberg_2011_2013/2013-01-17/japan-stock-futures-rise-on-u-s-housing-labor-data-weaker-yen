Japanese  stock   futures  rose after
data on U.S. housing and jobless claims beat estimates and the
yen dropped to the lowest level since June 2010, buoying the
outlook for Japanese exporters. Australian equities gained.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
carmaker that gets a quarter of its sales in  North America , rose
3.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender,
advanced 2.9 percent on a Nikkei report the Bank of Japan is
preparing to ease monetary policy next week. Shares of Qantas
Airways Ltd. gained 0.5 percent in Sydney as it canceled one of
the 15 orders it has for Boeing Co.’s 787 aircraft, according to
a person familiar with the matter.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 10,860 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,630 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,850 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.2
percent.  “The yen has extended losses and the  U.S. economy  is
rebounding. Chances are Japanese stocks will resume gains after
a short-term correction,” said Toshiaki Iwasaki, an analyst at
Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Now that the government with no
economic policy is gone, you don’t want to underestimate the
market’s strength.”  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index added 0.6 percent in New York
yesterday, when data showed builders broke ground on more houses
than forecast in December and the number of Americans filing
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments fell more
than forecast last week.  The yen touched 90.13 per dollar yesterday, the lowest
level since June 2010. The currency also fell against all of its
16 major counterparts after Economy Minister Akira Amari said
his comments earlier this week that excessive weakening of the
yen was harmful had been misinterpreted.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3.8 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 2.7 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. The Asian benchmark trades at 14.1 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 12 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for February delivery advanced $1.25 to $95.49 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 17.  Chinese stocks climbed in New York for the first time in
three days on prospects the nation will report that Asia’s
biggest economy grew at a faster pace after a seven-quarter
slowdown. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. gained 0.1 percent to 101 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
