Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a miner of gold
in  Russia , rose the most in four months in  London  trading after

its iron-ore business.  The shares gained 8.9 percent to 403.3 pence by the close
in London, the steepest gain since Sep. 14. Gold output in 2012
rose 13 percent to 710,400 ounces, beating its 700,000-ounce
guidance. The company is seeking to produce 740,000 to 780,000

immediate delivery rose 7.1 percent to $1,675 an ounce last
year. The average price of the gold sold by the company was
$1,670 an ounce in 2012, a 3.3 percent rise from a year earlier.  Petropavlovsk earlier said it  IRC Ltd. (1029)  iron-ore unit plans
