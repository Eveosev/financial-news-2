Masdar, the renewable energy
company run by  Abu Dhabi ’s government, will begin a pilot
project to desalinate water using power from renewable sources
with the aim of building a full-scale plant by 2020.  The company will join with private partners in three test
plants to study new desalination technologies, Masdar Chief
Executive Officer Sultan Al-Jaber said today at a news
conference in Abu Dhabi.  Masdar and its partners will test different technologies at
the plants through 2015, with the aim of starting construction
on a commercial desalination facility in 2016, he said. The
full-scale facility may have capacity to treat 50 million to 100
million gallons of water a day.  Middle Eastern states including the  United Arab Emirates ,
of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, rely on treatment plants to
remove salt from seawater to make it drinkable.  Al Jaber  said
Masdar still needs to choose the pilot project partners and
would then develop estimates for the cost of the plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
