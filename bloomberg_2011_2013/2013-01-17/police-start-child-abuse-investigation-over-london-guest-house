London  police are investigating
possible child-abuse offenses dating back to the early 1980s at
a guest house in south-west London as the abuse scandal that
started with allegations about the late Jimmy Savile continues
to spread.  The probe of the Elm Guest House, which isn’t linked to the
Savile allegations, began with information passed to the police
by Labour politician  Tom Watson , the  Metropolitan Police Service 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The investigation isn’t
connected with current residents of the address, police said.  The focus on so-called historic abuse allegations began in
October when reports said Savile, a former television star at
the British Broadcasting Corp., molested woman and children
during his career. At least 10 people in the entertainment
industry have been arrested in the Operation Yewtree probe that
was created following the Savile scandal.  Watson, a member of parliament, didn’t immediately return a
call to his office seeking comment.  A police report last week said Savile, who died in 2011 at
the age of 84, committed more than 200 criminal sexual-abuse
offenses at the  BBC , in schools and in more than a dozen
hospitals, mental homes and a hospice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
