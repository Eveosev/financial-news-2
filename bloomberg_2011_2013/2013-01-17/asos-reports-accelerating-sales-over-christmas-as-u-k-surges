Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest online-
only fashion retailer, said Christmas sales accelerated as
reduced prices on its own-brand fashions lured young Britons.  Total retail sales rose 41 percent to 78.1 million pounds
($125 million) in December, the London-based retailer said. That
compares to growth of 30 percent in the first quarter. U.K.
sales rose 34 percent, beating the first quarter’s 24 percent
gain, while international revenues climbed 47 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson has been cutting
prices of its own-label products in the U.K. to lure cost-
conscious customers in their twenties, and increasing service
options like the “Complete the Look” function with suggested
outfit matches. The  retailer , with 23 million visitors to its
website a month, is also pushing internationally with territory
managers in the U.S.,  France  and  Germany .  “Our U.K. performance was particularly strong, which
continues to be driven by better conversion of traffic alongside
continued investment in both our proposition and pricing,”
Robertson said in the statement. “We remain positive in our
outlook for 2012/13.”  Asos shares climbed 1.5 percent in  London  trading yesterday
to 2,654 pence. The stock has fallen 1.4 percent so far this
year, after more than doubling in value last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
