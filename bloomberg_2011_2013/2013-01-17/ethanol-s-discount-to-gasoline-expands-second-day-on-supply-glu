Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded for a second day as a stockpile glut kept the biofuel
from matching a rally in futures for the motor fuel.  The  spread  ballooned 5.1 cents a day after the Energy
Information Administration said ethanol  stockpiles  last week
climbed 2.6 percent to 20.4 million barrels, the highest level
in four weeks, while  production  sank to 784,000 barrels a day,
the lowest level since the Energy Department’s statistical arm
began reporting data in June 2010.  “Stocks have been building,” said Will Babler, a broker
at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “The
production report was really negative. Not a good sign there.”  The grain-based additive was 42.94 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities,
the biggest one-day widening since Dec. 26. The spread was 37.84
cents yesterday.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.339 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have
advanced 9.2 percent in the past year.  February-delivery gasoline rose 4.7 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $2.7684 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as U.S.
economic data boosted optimism that fuel demand will increase.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 0.5 cent
to $2.415 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive was
unchanged at $2.385, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago increased 0.5 cent to $2.315 a gallon
and on the West Coast the additive jumped 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.46.  Corn Declines  Corn for March delivery slipped 6.75 cent, or 0.9 percent,
to $7.245 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  Aemetis Inc. (AMTX) , a U.S. ethanol producer, idled production at
its plant in Keyes,  California , citing “unprofitable market
conditions for corn ethanol,” and will upgrade the operation to
also make fuel from sorghum, it said today.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, said yesterday it idled output at ethanol mills in York
and Ravenna, Nebraska, until market conditions improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
