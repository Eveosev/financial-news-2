 European power for 2014 delivery
fell to a record as next-quarter and day-ahead electricity costs
slid even as sub-freezing weather boosted demand for heating.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, slid as much as 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
43.05 euros ($57.25) a megawatt-hour, a record for the contract,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. In  France , power
for 2014 slid 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 46 euros, the lowest
since Bloomberg started tracking the contract in January 2011.  “We are now halfway through the coldest spell of weather
in the winter to date, but one could be justified for ignoring
this fact by the look of energy commodity prices in  Europe ,”
Paolo Coghe, a Paris-based analyst at Societe General AG, said
in an e-mailed report. “Supply and demand fundamentals provide
little hope for marked improvements in the short-term.”  Next-quarter electricity in Germany dropped 0.4 percent to
39.10 euros while the French contract fell 0.6 percent to 39.50
euros a megawatt-hour at 11 a.m. in Berlin, broker data show.
Day-ahead power lost 4.2 percent in  Germany  to 51.25 euros and
declined 5 percent to 70.75 euros in France. Traders use near-
term prices to evaluate the price of future deliveries.  Low temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to decline to
minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 19 versus a 10-
year seasonal average of minus 2 degrees, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Minimum temperatures in
Paris are expected to fall to minus 10 degrees tomorrow,
compared with a 10-year average of 4 degrees.  Demand in France, Europe’s second-biggest power market, may
reach 92,100 megawatts tomorrow, according to a  forecast  on the
website of Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, the network
operator. That compares with 89,203 megawatts today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
