Oil advanced to the highest level in
four months in  New York  as a surprise drop in U.S. crude
inventories countered concern that the global economic recovery
may falter and curb fuel demand.  West Texas Intermediate advanced as much as 0.7 percent to
$94.87 a barrel, its highest intraday price since Sept. 19.
WTI’s discount to Brent futures narrowed to less than $15 a
barrel for the first time since July after the start of an
expanded pipeline that is set to pare a glut in the U.S.
Midwest. Crude supplies slid 951,000 barrels last week, Energy
Department data showed. They were forecast to increase by 2.2
million, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “We may see oil demand picking up in the U.S. and this
could support prices,” said Gerrit Zambo, an oil trader at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich, who predicts Brent may rise as
high as $120 a barrel this quarter. “But the supply situation
is comfortable.”  WTI for February delivery was at $94.73 a barrel, up 49
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
as of 1:26 p.m. London time. The contract climbed 96 cents to
$94.24 yesterday, the highest close since Sept. 18.  Brent for March settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange gained 56 cents to $110.24 a barrel. The
European benchmark’s premium to WTI earlier narrowed to $14.98,
the smallest gap July 25.  Cushing Glut  WTI dropped 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened a supply glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s largest
storage hub and the delivery point for New York contracts. That
left it at an average discount of $17.47 a barrel to Brent last
year, compared with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years
through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, advanced 3.5 percent last year.  Production of Forties crude, the  North Sea ’s most abundant
grade, will climb to 407,143 barrels a day in February, the
highest since March, a loading schedule obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  U.S. crude stockpiles fell to 360.3 million in the seven
days ended Jan. 11, the Energy Department report showed
yesterday. At the same time, supplies at Cushing climbed by 1.8
million barrels to a record 51.9 million  Gasoline inventories  increased for an eighth week, the
longest rising streak since March 2008, to 235 million barrels.
That was the highest level since February 2011. Distillate-fuel
supplies, including heating oil and diesel, advanced to 132.4
million, the highest since March, according to the data.  OPEC Production  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
waiting to see how the  European debt crisis  will be handled to
judge crude consumption, United Arab Emirates Oil Minister
Mohamed Al-Hamli said at the World Future Energy Summit in  Abu
Dhabi  yesterday. The group kept its 2013 global demand forecast
at 89.6 million barrels a day, up 760,000 from 2012.  Demand is “not in good shape,” Al-Hamli said as OPEC
released a report showing it reduced output to the lowest in
more than a year. The organization will next meet in May to
discuss output targets.  OPEC, which pumps about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
reduced output by 465,000 barrels a day in December to 30.4
million, the slowest rate since October 2011, it said yesterday
in its monthly report, citing secondary sources. That’s still
800,000 a day more than a daily average of 29.6 million that the
group estimates it will need to pump this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
