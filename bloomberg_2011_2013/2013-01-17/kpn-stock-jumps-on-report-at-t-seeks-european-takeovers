Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone
company partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMX) , rose to
the highest level in a month in Amsterdam after the Wall Street
Journal reported AT&T Inc. is looking at takeovers in Europe.  KPN gained 4.5 percent to 4.44 euros in Amsterdam trading
at double its average volume over the last three months. The
Hague-based KPN has  lost  about 49 percent in the past 12 months,
valuing it at 6.36 billion euros ($8.5 billion).  AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, is studying
takeover targets and a deal may be reached before the end of the
year, the Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified people
with knowledge of the matter. Carriers that Dallas-based AT&T is
considering include KPN and EE, the U.K. wireless venture
between  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , the people
said, according to the newspaper.  “We never comment on market rumors,” Stefan Simons, a
spokesman for KPN, said by telephone. AT&T spokeswoman Roberta
Thomson declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report.  KPN is 28 percent-owned by Mexico City-based  America Movil 
as part of a strategy by Slim, the world’s richest man, to move
into Europe, where the sovereign-debt crisis and recessions have
reduced phone company valuations. AT&T owns 9 percent of America
Movil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
