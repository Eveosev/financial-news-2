(Corrects billion to million in final paragraph.)  French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said the euro group should set out a “formal” and
“transparent” procedure for selecting its chairman.  “I have no reservations about any particular candidate,”
Moscovici told journalists in Paris, adding that the group of
finance ministers should be able to speak to candidates about
their vision of the job.  Moscovici said that the role isn’t ideally suited for the
French finance minister.  Moscovici also said that  France ’s 2013 budget set aside
about 600 million euros for special operations and that funds
for the nation’s intervention in Mali would come from that for
now. More funds will be found if needed, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
