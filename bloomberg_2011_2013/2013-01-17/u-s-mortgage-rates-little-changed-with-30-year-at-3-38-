U.S. mortgage rates were little
changed, keeping borrowing costs close to record lows as home
values climb after the worst slump since the Great Depression.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.38
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.4 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate held at 2.66 percent.  Low borrowing costs are spurring buyer demand while tight
inventories of properties on the market bolster prices. U.S.
home prices jumped 7.4 percent in November from a year earlier,
the ninth straight increase and the biggest gain since May 2006,
 Irvine , California-based data provider  CoreLogic (CLGX)  said this week.  “We still have a long way to go to return to 2005-2006
levels, but all signals currently point to a progressive
stabilization of the housing market and the positive trend in
home-price appreciation to continue into 2013,” Anand Nallathambi, CoreLogic’s president and chief executive officer,
said in a Jan. 15 statement.  U.S. housing starts climbed 12.1 percent in December from
the previous month to a 954,000 annual rate, the most since June
2008, Commerce Department data showed today.  Home-loan applications in the U.S. rose 15.2 percent in the
week ended Jan. 11, the most since the end of September,
following an 11.7 percent increase the previous week, the
Washington-based  Mortgage Bankers Association  said yesterday.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
