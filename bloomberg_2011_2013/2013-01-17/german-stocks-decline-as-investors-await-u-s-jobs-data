German stocks  climbed for a second
day as U.S. housing starts rose more than forecast in December,
while initial jobless claims in the world’s biggest economy fell
to the lowest level in five years.  HeidelbergCement AG rose 3.2 percent, for the largest gain
on the benchmark DAX Index.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  added 2.2 percent.
 SAP AG (SAP)  retreated 1.5 percent as Citigroup Inc. downgraded its
recommendation on the shares.  The DAX rose 0.6 percent to 7,735.46 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The measure has gained 1.6 percent so far
this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget to
prevent most scheduled tax increases and delay spending cuts.
The broader HDAX Index added 0.7 percent today.  “These are great numbers in U.S. housing,” Ion Marc Valahu, co-founder and fund manager at Clairinvest in Geneva,
wrote in a message. “Dips are being bought as the market
consolidates. In addition, the euro is way above the 1.20 floor
which tells me that  risk aversion  is reversing as investors have
more confidence in the  euro zone .”  The euro advanced toward a 10-month high against the dollar
as  Spain ’s borrowing costs fell at a 4.5 billion-euro ($6
billion) sale of bonds, underscoring demand for the region’s
higher-yielding assets.  The volume of shares changing hands on the  DAX (DAX)  was 3
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Housing  In the U.S., builders broke ground on more houses than
forecast in December, capping the best year for the industry
since 2008.  Starts climbed 12.1 percent last month to a 954,000 annual
rate, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of
economists and the most since June 2008, the Commerce Department
reported today in  Washington . For all of last year, construction
began on 780,000 homes, up from 608,800 in 2011 and also the
most since 2008.  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for
unemployment insurance payments fell more than forecast last
week. Applications for  jobless benefits  decreased by 37,000 to
335,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, the lowest level since the
period ended Jan. 19, 2008, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists forecast 369,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The  U.S. economy  picked up across much of the country last
month, boosted by auto and home sales, even as the outlook for
unemployment showed few signs of improvement, the  Federal
Reserve  said late yesterday in its Beige Book business survey.  HeidelbergCement Gains  HeidelbergCement, the world’s third-largest maker of the
building material, gained 3.2 percent to 47.23 euros.  ThyssenKrupp,  Germany ’s biggest steelmaker, added 2.2
percent to 18.40 euros. Salzgitter AG, the second-largest, rose
1.2 percent to 36.74 euros.  BASF SE advanced 1.2 percent to 73.20 euros. The world’s
biggest chemical maker got closer to pushing through its $900
million takeover of Norwegian drug-ingredient maker Pronova
BioPharma ASA as an improved offer won over two investors who
had initially rejected the deal.  Odin Forvaltning AS, which owns 4.7 percent of Pronova,
will tender its shares, even though the price isn’t as much as
it had wanted,  fund manager  Alexandra Morris said today. Her
comments echo those of Rolf Solgard, chief portfolio manager at
Nykredit Asset Management, which owns about 1 percent.  Infineon Technologies AG,  Europe ’s second-biggest
semiconductor manufacturer, climbed 2 percent to 6.72 euros.  BayWa AG advanced for an eight day, gaining 3.4 percent to
36.55 euros. Bankhaus Lampe raised its price estimate on the
distributor of farm products and building materials to 41 euros
a share from 40 euros on higher 2013 earnings expectations after
a real estate sale was partly moved from 2012 to this year.  SAP fell 1.5 percent to 58.13 euros. Citigroup downgraded
the shares to neutral from buy, saying that the mixed global IT
spending environment is starting to affect the largest maker of
enterprise software and it may not be able to match the level of
deals made last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
