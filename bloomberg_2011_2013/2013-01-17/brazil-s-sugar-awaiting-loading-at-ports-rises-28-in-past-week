(Corrects last week’s figure in second paragraph.)  The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at the main ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer,
climbed 28 percent over the past week, according to Williams
Servicos Maritimos Ltda., as demand slowed.  About 1.18 million metric tons of the sweetener was waiting
to be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio, Paranagua and Santos,
the country’s biggest port, figures e-mailed yesterday from the
Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compares with
918,433 tons a week earlier.  Brazil’s center south, the main growing region of the
world’s biggest producer, produced a record 34.1 million tons of
sugar in the 2012-13 season that started there in April,
industry group Unica said on Jan. 10. The next sugarcane crop
there may climb to a record of 580 million to 590 million tons
in 2013-14, Datagro Ltd. estimates.  “Given that the early forecasts for the center south crush
in 2013-14 are supporting the view that Brazil will churn out
even more sugar in the season starting in March, there is little
indication that the bearish sentiment could be broken any time
soon,” F.O. Licht GmbH said in a report dated Jan. 15.  Sugar prices fell 16 percent last year as global supplies
are forecast to outpace demand for a third year in 2012-13,
according to the London-based International Sugar Organization.
Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to 18.48 cents a
pound by 5:18 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
