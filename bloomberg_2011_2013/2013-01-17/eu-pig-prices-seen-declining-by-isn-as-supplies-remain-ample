Pig prices in the European Union
declined in the past week amid ample supplies and high livestock
weights, said industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in  Germany , the EU’s largest producer, fell to
1.596 euros ($2.14) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), compared with 1.626
euros a week earlier, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report 
on its website dated Jan. 15. Prices also declined in  Denmark 
while remaining little changed in France, where supply was
“well balanced,” according to the report.  In Germany, “the quantities, which remain large, make it
hard for the market to settle down,” ISN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
