Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Bing Internet
search engine will display more results that include information
from  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s social network.  Answers to queries on the Bing site will feature five times
more information gleaned from a user’s Facebook connections,
Microsoft said in a statement today. Earlier this week, Facebook
unveiled its own search service, which also relies on Bing to
deliver some results.  Microsoft, an investor in Facebook, competes with Google
Inc. in the search market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
