Fifth Third Bancorp. (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, said fourth-quarter profit rose 27 percent as the firm
booked a gain on a stake in  Vantiv Inc. (VNTV)   Net income jumped to $399 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $314 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, the Cincinnati-
based company said today in a statement. That compares with the
41-cent average  estimate  of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The net interest margin, the difference between what a bank
pays on deposits and charges for loans, declined to 3.49 percent
from 3.56 percent in the third quarter. The company expects the
margin to narrow to between 3.35 percent and 3.4 percent in
2013, according to a presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
