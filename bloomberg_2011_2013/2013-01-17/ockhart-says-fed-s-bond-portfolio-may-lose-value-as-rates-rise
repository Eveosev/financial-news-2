President  Dennis Lockhart  said that “there is always the
prospect the Fed would take losses in the market value of the
bonds” in its portfolio in an interest-rate increase.  “I’m comfortable that under most plausible scenarios those
are manageable,” Lockhart told reporters in New York today at
the Bloomberg Global Markets Summit hosted by Bloomberg Link.
“Remittances to the Treasury might have to go down for a couple
years but it is a manageable process in the interests of
normalization.”  Earlier, during a forum discussion at the summit, Lockhart
said he is asked by average Americans whether “this long period
of low  interest rates , isn’t it hurting people pretty
dramatically and by extension might hurt holders of bonds at
some stage?”  “The best answer I can give is that the low-rate policy is
designed to bring the economy back to life, to nurture a
recovery, to get the economy growing,” Lockhart said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
