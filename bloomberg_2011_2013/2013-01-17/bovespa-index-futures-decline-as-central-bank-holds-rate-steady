Bovespa-index futures dropped after
the central bank signaled it will keep borrowing costs at a
record low.  Multiplus SA, the frequent-flyer unit of Latam Airlines
Group SA’s  Brazil  subsidiary, may move after calling a
shareholder meeting to choose a chairman to replace Maurício
Rolim Amaro. Beef producer Marfrig Alimentos SA may be active
after selling $600 million of bonds maturing in July 2017.  Bovespa (IBOV)  futures slid 0.1 percent to 61,810 at 9:20 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The real declined 0.1 percent to 2.0409 per dollar.  The central bank board, led by Alexandre Tombini, kept the
benchmark  interest rate  at 7.25 percent for a second straight
meeting yesterday, matching the forecast of all 56 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The best strategy is to keep monetary
policy conditions unchanged for a “prolonged period,” policy
makers said in a statement accompanying the unanimous decision.  The central bank ended the steepest rate-cutting cycle
among the Group of 20 nations in November after adverse climate
in the U.S. and Brazil led to a jump in food prices.  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern that economic growth might
miss expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in
Brazil boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its gain
to 18 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 5.77 billion reais ($2.8 billion) in
stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday, which compares with a daily
average of 7.25 billion reais in 2012, according to data
compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
