Spanish 10-year bonds erased an
advance after the nation sold 4.5 billion euros of securities at
a sale.  The yield on the securities was little changed at 5.03
percent as of 9:48 a.m. London time, after earlier dropping as
much as three basis points to 4.995 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
