U.S. economy will boost demand amid shrinking supplies from
 Ghana , the world’s second-biggest grower.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
rose to the highest since October as better-than-expected U.S.
housing and labor reports bolstered growth prospects and equity
markets. From Oct. 1 to Jan. 3, purchases of cocoa from farmers
in Ghana totaled 485,000 metric tons, down 17 percent from the
same period a year earlier, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit
of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cocoa for March delivery

at 5:26 p.m.  London  time. Month-ahead gas climbed 1.6 percent to
68.5 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.94 per million Btu.  BASE METALS  Copper rose the most in two weeks as better-than-expected

percent to $95.49 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept.
