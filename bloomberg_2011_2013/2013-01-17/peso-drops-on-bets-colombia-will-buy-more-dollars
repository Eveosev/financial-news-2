Colombia’s currency rose the most in
three weeks amid speculation a  tax cut  will encourage foreign
investors to buy local debt and as companies exchanged dollars
for pesos to pay taxes.  The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 1,765.66 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close of trading in Bogota, the biggest jump since Dec.
28. It has gained 1.7 percent in the past month. The currency
reached an intraday high of 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest
since July 2011.  The government cut taxes on overseas investors’ earnings
from domestic securities to 14 percent from 33 percent as of
Jan. 1 to help boost demand and reduce borrowing costs, leading
to speculation foreign investment in the market will rise.  “The trend for the first half of the year is for a
stronger peso,” Felipe Campos, the head analyst at Alianza
Valores brokerage, said in a phone interview from Bogota. “You
have companies bringing in dollars to pay taxes in February, and
we’ll also see more and more foreigners” coming into the local
 debt market , he said.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters today
that he is concerned about the peso’s rally and the government
will use “all its ammunition” to stem gains, while ruling out
 capital controls  which he said aren’t effective enough. In a
Jan. 15 interview, Cardenas said he would like the central bank
to step up dollar purchases after bought a record $4.8 billion
in the  currency market  last year.  Central Bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said on RCN Radio
Jan. 15 that policy makers believe Colombia would benefit from a
weaker currency and reiterated that the bank will buy a minimum
of $20 million a day through at least the first quarter to curb
its advance.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.37 percent, according to the central bank. The
bond’s price dropped 0.177 centavo to 138.934 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
