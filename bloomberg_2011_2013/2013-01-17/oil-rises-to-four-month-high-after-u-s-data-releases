Oil advanced to a four-month high
after U.S. builders broke ground on more houses than forecast
and jobless claims dropped to a five-year low, bolstering
optimism for the economy.  Futures rose 1.3 percent as Commerce Department figures
showed housing  starts  climbed to the highest level since June
2008. Applications for  jobless benefits  fell to the least since
January 2008, the Labor Department said. Gains accelerated after
Algerian forces stormed a gas complex in the southern desert
where an al-Qaeda-linked group was holding hostages.  “The primary reason for today’s market moves are improving
economic conditions,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The news
from  Algeria  may be adding to the rally because of increasing
fears about threats to energy facilities.”  Crude oil for February delivery advanced $1.25 to $95.49 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Sept. 17. Prices are up 4 percent so far this
year. Volume was 52 percent above the 100-day average.  Brent oil for March settlement gained $1.42, or 1.3
percent, to $111.10 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The February contract expired yesterday. Volume
was 18 percent above the 100-day average.  The front-month European benchmark contract was at a $15.16
premium to March West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in
 New York  based on settlement prices, the narrowest spread since
July 24.  Housing Starts  Housing starts climbed 12.1 percent to a 954,000 annual
rate in December, the Commerce Department reported today in
 Washington . For all of last year, construction began on 780,000
homes, up from 608,800 in 2011 and also the most since 2008.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 37,000 to
335,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, the fewest since January
2008. Economists forecast 369,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “The economic numbers have been positive and the market is
reacting,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “These figures give us
reason to believe future oil demand will be stronger.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 0.8 percent each on the economic data.
The euro climbed as much as 0.7 percent against the dollar. The
common currency strengthened against all 16 counterparts after
 Spain ’s borrowing costs decreased at a 4.5 billion bond auction.
A stronger euro boosts the appeal of commodities as an
investment.  Algerian Firefight  Algerian security forces released some foreigners in the
struggle for the complex, the state-run Algerian Press Service
reported. As many as half of the hostages have been freed,
according to the report, which didn’t provide a casualty toll.
The attackers said yesterday they were holding 41 foreigners
abducted at the natural gas facility.  “The hostage drama in Algeria makes you wonder how many
oil facilities are vulnerable in North  Africa , especially in
neighboring  Libya ,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “This
should increase the security premium.”  Libya’s government has been struggling to rein in militias
and armed groups that have hampered rebuilding efforts since
Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and death in 2011. The country holds
Africa’s biggest proven oil reserves.  Futures advanced 1 percent in New York yesterday after a
report from the Energy Information Administration showed that
U.S. crude stockpiles fell 951,000 barrels to 360.3 million in
the seven days ended Jan. 11.  Fuel Stockpiles  Gasoline supplies  rose for an eighth week to 235 million
barrels, according to the data from the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category
including heating oil and diesel, advanced to 132.4 million.  “We had very good jobless numbers and the housing numbers
were very nice,” Lynch said. “This combined with the somewhat
bullish inventory numbers yesterday should have the market
exploring the upside for the near term.”  China ’s National Bureau of Statistics is projected to
report at 9 p.m. New York time that gross domestic product
expanded 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . That’s up from a three-year low of 7.4 percent
in the previous period.  The U.S. accounted for 21 percent of the world’s oil
consumption in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy. China, the second-biggest crude-consuming country,
was responsible for 11 percent of global demand.  OPEC Shipments  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will curb
its rise in shipments this month, tanker tracker Oil Movements
said. OPEC will export 23.64 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to Feb. 2, up 70,000 barrels from the previous period, the
Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. Shipments were to climb 210,000 barrels a day in the
four weeks to Jan. 26. The figures exclude Angola and Ecuador.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 660,276
contracts as of 3:15 p.m. Volume totaled 687,794 contracts
yesterday, 41 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.48 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
