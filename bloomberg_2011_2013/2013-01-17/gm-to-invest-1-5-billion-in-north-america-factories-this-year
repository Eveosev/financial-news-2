General Motors Co. (GM) , which plans to
introduce about 20 new vehicles in the U.S. this year, will
invest $1.5 billion in North America factories in 2013,  Mark Reuss , the company’s regional president, said yesterday.  GM is replacing 70 percent of its U.S. line up over a year
and a half, including 13 new Chevrolets this year. The Detroit-
based automaker is displaying the redesigned Silverado pickup
and Corvette sports car at the  North American International Auto
Show  in Detroit.  The Detroit-based automaker has announced investments of
more than $10.2 billion in North American factories since July
2009, Reuss said yesterday during a presentation at the
Automotive World News Congress in Detroit.  Meanwhile, GM has found ways to save “thousands of
dollars” in the cost of building the next generation Chevrolet
Volt through a vehicle platform designed specifically for
batteries, Reuss said.  “You can decrease the size of the battery pack, decrease
the size of the electric motors; get equivalent range with much
lower cost,” he told reporters yesterday after the
presentation. Reuss declined to say when the next version of the
car would come out.  The Volt was introduced in 2010. GM originally aimed to
sell 60,000 Volts worldwide last year before lowering the target
to 35,000. In the U.S., it sold 23,461 last year. GM hasn’t said
how many it sold worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
