Most Asian  shares  declined after the
regional benchmark touched a 17-month high this week. Japan’s
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  closed less than 0.1 percent higher
after swinging amid currency fluctuations.  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , a supplier of batteries for Boeing Co.’s
787 aircraft, slumped 5 percent in Tokyo after the Federal
Aviation Administration ordered airlines to prove the batteries
are safe.  Evergrande (3333)  Real Estate Group Ltd., China’s biggest
developer by sales volume, sank 7.1 percent in Hong Kong after
announcing a share sale.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-
largest mining company, said after the market close it will take
an impairment charge of about $14 billion.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.3 percent to 131.20 as
of 8:26 p.m. Tokyo time after rising as much as 0.6 percent and
falling as much as 0.6 percent. About five stocks dropped for
every four that gained on the measure. The gauge rallied 9.8
percent from Nov. 14 through yesterday as Japanese shares surged
on speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will pursue more
aggressive stimulus policies and reports showed signs of
economic recovery in the U.S. and China.  “We’re seeing some profit-taking following recent gains,”
said  Yoji Takeda , who oversees about $1.2 billion as Hong Kong-
based head of Asian equities at RBC Investment Management (Asia)
Ltd. “This profit-taking is temporary. Valuations have gotten a
little bit higher but are not yet expensive. The macroeconomic
backdraft is still supportive of equities.”  Nikkei, Yen  The Nikkei 225 rose less than 0.1 percent, erasing a
decline of as much as 1.6 percent in the final minute of trading
in Tokyo. The gauge had been heading for a two-day retreat of as
much as 4.1 percent, the biggest such drop since September 2011.  The yen fell 0.3 percent to 88.6 against the dollar as of
3:20 p.m. in Tokyo, after reversing earlier gains of as much as
0.3 percent. A stronger yen reduces the overseas earnings by
Japanese exporters when repatriated.  The Nikkei 225 advanced 22 percent through yesterday from
Nov. 14, when the announcement of elections fanned speculation a
new government would press the  Bank of Japan  for more monetary
easing to drive down the yen.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  declined 1.1 percent,
while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.1 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slid 0.2 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index added 0.4 percent.  Rio Impairment Charge  Rio Tinto slid 1.5 percent to A$64.60 in Sydney today. The

acquisitions he oversaw by about $14 billion.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , Australia’s third-largest
producer of iron ore, slid 4.2 percent to A$4.38 in Sydney after
prices for the metal fell. Iron ore, which surged 68 percent
since September, fell the most in 13 months yesterday, according
data from The Steel Index Ltd.  GS Yuasa dropped 5 percent to 305 yen in Tokyo. The company
said it may take months to complete its investigation into what
triggered the emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways Co.
Dreamliner. The company needs to find out whether yesterday’s
emergency was caused by an issue with the battery or if the
entire electrical system is at fault, its spokesman Hiroharu
Nakano said by phone today.  Evergrande slumped 7.1 percent to HK$4.32 in  Hong Kong 
after saying it’s seeking to place 1 billion shares at HK$4.35
each for working capital and to repay debt.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 14.1 times
estimated earnings, compared with 13.3 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. Most U.S.
