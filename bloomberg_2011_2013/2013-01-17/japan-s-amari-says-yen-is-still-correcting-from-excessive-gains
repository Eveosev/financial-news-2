Japanese Economy Minister Akira
Amari said the yen is still in the process of correcting from
excessive gains and that his remarks earlier this week on yen
weakness were misinterpreted.  “The media didn’t report my full remarks and that caused a
reaction in the markets,” Amari told reporters today in  Tokyo .  The yen rose the most since May versus the dollar on Jan.
15 after Amari said that excessive weakening in the yen could
have harmful effects on people’s livelihoods, indicating
possible limits on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign to drive
down the currency.  The currency snapped a two-day advance today, falling 0.3
percent to 88.60 as of 4:28 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
