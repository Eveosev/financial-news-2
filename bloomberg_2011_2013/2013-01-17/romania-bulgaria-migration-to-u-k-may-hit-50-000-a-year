Migration from  Romania  and Bulgaria
to the U.K. following the removal of border controls in 2014 may
hit 50,000 a year, a pressure group that pushes for controls on
cross-border movement of people said.  Migrationwatch  based its estimates on similarities between
the two countries now and  Poland  in 2004, when the British
government underestimated how many people would come to the U.K.
following the accession of the first eight eastern European
countries to the European Union. Bulgaria and Romania followed
in 2007. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said this week he
wasn’t publishing an estimate yet because he had no confidence
in the numbers his officials were giving him.  “It is not good enough to duck making an estimate of
immigration from Romania and  Bulgaria ,” Andrew Green, chairman
of Guildford, southern England-based Migrationwatch, said in a
statement. “It is likely to be on a scale that will have
significant consequences for housing and public services.  It
will also add further to the competition which young British
workers already face.”  The pressure group said the government should make it
harder for migrants to access welfare, to discourage them from
coming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
