Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
note yields higher for the first time in five days, as better-
than-forecast reports on housing starts and jobless claims added
to signs the economic recovery is strengthening.  Yields on the  benchmark security  climbed from the lowest
level in two weeks as the number of Americans filing first-time
claims for unemployment insurance payments fell more than
forecast last week to the lowest level in five years. Treasuries
were the most expensive in two weeks yesterday, according to a
model created by economists at the Fed.  “The data took over as the driver for the move higher in
rates,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader in  New York  at Societe
Generale SA, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries
with the Fed. “The economy has improved or shows moderate
growth across the board. The risk-on tone may continue for a
little bit.”  The 10-year  yield  climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield dropped to
1.80 percent yesterday, the least since Jan. 2. The 1.625
percent note maturing in November 2022 fell 17/32, or $5.31 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 23/32.  Yields on  30-year bonds  rose six basis points to 3.07
percent.  ‘Pretty Solid’  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.3 percent loss this
year, or minus 6.4 percent at an annual rate, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Sovereign bonds around the
world have dropped 0.1 percent in January, based on the data.  Treasury  trading volume  rose today to $329 billion, the
highest level since Jan. 10, according to ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . Daily volume
averaged $240 billion in 2012.  Housing starts climbed 12.1 percent last month to a 954,000
annual rate, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of
economists and the most since June 2008, the Commerce Department
reported today in  Washington . For all of last year, construction
began on 780,000 homes, up from 608,800 in 2011 and also the
most since 2008.  “The starts number is pretty solid -- the guts of the
report was constructive, driven by both single- and multi-family
space,” said Jacob Oubina, a senior U.S. economist at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the Fed. “It had to
elicit a reaction.”  Jobless Claims  Applications for  jobless benefits  decreased by 37,000 to
335,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, the lowest level since the
period ended Jan. 19, 2008, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists forecast 369,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A spokesman for the
agency said the figure may reflect challenges adjusting the data
for the pickup in claims that typically occurs in early January.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, dropped
to minus 0.77 percent yesterday in New York, the least since
Jan. 1. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Yields on the benchmark note will increase to 2.2 percent
by Dec. 31, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of financial companies.  TIPS Auction  German  government bonds  fell today, with two-year yields
rising seven basis points to 0.19 percent, the highest since
June, on speculation financial institutions will begin paying
back loans from the  European Central Bank , pushing up overnight
borrowing rates. Ten-year bund yields rose to 1.62 percent, the
highest level since Oct. 25.  The U.S. today announced it will sell $15 billion in 10-
year inflation-protected securities on Jan. 24. It previously
sold $13 billion of the securities on Nov. 21 at a yield of
negative 0.72 percent, compared with the record-low yield of
negative 0.75 percent at the September auction. The last six
note sales since January 2012 have drawn negative yields.  The Fed  purchased  $3.357 billion of Treasuries due from
February 2020 to November 2022 today as part of its monthly $85
billion in government and mortgage-debt purchases designed to
stimulate the economy.  Treasuries rose for a fourth day yesterday on speculation
political wrangling between President  Barack Obama  and
Republican lawmakers over the U.S. debt ceiling will curb
economic growth, fueling demand for safer assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
