Gasoline rose as U.S. economic data
boosted optimism that fuel demand will increase and reports of
35 hostages killed in  Algeria  pushed crude oil higher.  Futures gained as much as 1.5 percent as Labor Department
data show U.S. applications for jobless benefits fell by 37,000
to 335,000 last week, the least since January 2008. Mauritania’s
private ANI news agency reported that 35 hostages and 15
abductors were killed as Algerian security forces stormed a gas
complex where an al-Qaeda-linked group held foreign hostages.  “Obviously the market went through a geopolitical upset in
North Africa the year before last,”  Andrew Lebow , senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York, said by phone.
“Not that Algeria will turn into Libya, but any unrest in the
region is cause for worry.”  Gasoline for February delivery rose 4.23 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.7637 a gallon at 12:44 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was 2 percent above the 100-day
average.  February crude oil futures gained 1.7 percent to $95.80 a
barrel on the exchange.  Demand for the motor fuel rose 3.9 percent to 8.32 million
barrels a day. Consumption over the past four weeks was down 0.6
percent from the same period a year earlier.  “The demand numbers haven’t been particularly good in the
U.S., maybe the they’re hoping that looking forward demand picks
up,” Lebow said.  February-delivery heating oil rose 2.28 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.0219 a gallon on the Nymex, after climbing as
much as 1.2 percent in earlier trading. Volume was 6.3 percent
below the 100-day average.  ICE Gasoil  The fuel pared gains as February gasoil fell as much as 0.5
percent on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in  London  after
inventories of gasoil in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp trading
hub in Northwest Europe rose for a fifth consecutive week.  Supplies grew 4.1 percent to 2.22 million metric tons in
the week through today, according to PJK International BV.  When gasoil prices fall, it lowers demand for U.S. heating
oil exports to Europe, said Amrita Sen, chief oil market
strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consulting company
in London.  “They do seem to be following each other,” Sen said.
“The entire crude complex is pretty strong on geopolitical
news. There’s nothing bearish in heating oil news.”  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to
$3.292 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. It’s the sixth
day in a row the price of fuel for drivers has declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
