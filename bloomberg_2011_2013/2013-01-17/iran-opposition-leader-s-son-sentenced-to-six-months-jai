The son of Iranian opposition leader
 Mehdi Karrubi  has been sentenced to a suspended six-month prison
term,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing an unidentified person.  Mohammad Hossein Karrubi was sentenced by an Iranian
revolutionary court after being charged with “giving interviews
to the foreign media which had disturbed public opinion,” the
Tehran-based newspaper said.  The jail term is suspended for five years and will be
enforced if he repeats the crime, today’s report said.  Karrubi, who along with opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi ran in 2009 against President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and
lost amid fraud allegations, has been under house arrest for
nearly two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
