Angie’s List, the consumer-review
website, hired J. Mark Howell as Chief Operating Officer.  Howell previously served as president in North America for
a subsidiary of  Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) , Indianapolis-based Angie’s
List said today in a statement. He came to Ingram Micro through
the acquisition of BrightPoint Inc., where he served for 18
years in various senior management roles.  Founded in 1995 by Angie Hicks, the company charges
membership fees to access reviews of plumbers, electricians and
other service providers. Vendors can also pay to advertise on
the site.  In April, Scott Brenton resigned as COO. At the time, the
company said it planned to restructure the role of operations
chief and incorporate the responsibilities into other positions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
