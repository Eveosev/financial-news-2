The  law firm  McDermott Will & Emery
LLP agreed to be the anchor tenant for a 45-story  office tower 
that Hines and the real estate arm of Canada’s biggest pension-
fund manager are building in Chicago.  McDermott, with offices in 19 cities globally, will lease
225,000 square feet (20,900 square meters) in the planned
skyscraper, known as River Point, the law firm said today in an
e-mailed statement. The developers broke ground this week for
the building, which will be the city’s first such project since
the 2008 financial crisis, according to the statement.  “We received a very attractive package from the
developer,” Jeffrey Stone, co-chairman of the law firm, said in
a telephone interview. “We’re catching the market in a good
place at a good time.”  Demand for  office space  in the nation’s third-largest city
is climbing. Chicago’s office- vacancy  rate was 18.7 percent in
the fourth quarter, down from a high of 19.1 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, according to  Reis Inc. (REIS) , a New York-based
real estate research firm.  McDermott’s lease at 227 W. Monroe St. downtown expires in
2017, Stone said. The firm plans to move to River Point, which
is being built on the western bank of the Chicago River at Lake
Street, in late 2016 or early 2017, he said. He declined to
disclose terms of the agreement.  Hines, an international property investor based in Houston,
and Ivanhoe Cambridge, the Montreal-based real estate operation
of Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec , agreed in May to
develop the skyscraper with no tenants signed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
