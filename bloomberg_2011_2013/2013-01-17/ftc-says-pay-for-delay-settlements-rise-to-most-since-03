Patent dispute settlements including
so-called pay-for-delay deals between branded and generic drug
companies jumped to 40 in the year ended in September 2012 from
28 the previous year, The  U.S. Federal Trade Commission  said.  The agreements, the most since the agency began collecting
data in 2003, involved 31 different brand-name drugs with
combined sales of more than $8.3 billion, the FTC said today in
an e-mailed  statement .  Of the 40 settlements, almost half involved agreements by
the branded firm not to market a so-called authentic generic
that would compete with the generic company’s product, the FTC
said.  “This year’s report makes it clear that the problem of
pay-for-delay is getting worse, not better,” FTC Chairman  Jon Leibowitz  said in the statement. “Until this issue is resolved,
we will all suffer the consequences of delayed generic entry --
higher prices for consumers, businesses and the U.S. taxpayer.”  By delaying the entry of cheaper generics into the market,
pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion annually, the
FTC said.  The FTC has challenged several patent settlements in court,
contending that they are anticompetitive and violate U.S.
antitrust laws. One case, involving a generic testosterone
treatment called Androgel, is pending before the U.S. Supreme
Court. The agency also has supported legislation in Congress
that would restrict pay-for-delay settlements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
