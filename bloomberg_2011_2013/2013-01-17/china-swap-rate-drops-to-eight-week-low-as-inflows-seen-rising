China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
dropped to an eight-week low on speculation capital inflows will
quicken as the world’s second-biggest economy recovers, boosting
cash in the financial system.  Yuan   positions  at local banks accumulated from foreign-
exchange purchases increased 134.6 billion yuan ($21.6 billion)
in December, the biggest increase in 11 months, according to
data published on Jan. 15 by the People’s Bank of China. The
gauge may rise by 100 billion yuan in January, according to a
commentary today in the official China Securities Journal. An
official report tomorrow may show China’s growth quickened to
7.8 percent last quarter, from a three-year low of 7.4 percent
in the previous period, a Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  “The market is speculating that a pickup in growth
momentum will help attract more capital inflows,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co.,
the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “We still need to watch out
for possible cash shortages before the Lunar New Year Holiday.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, dropped three
basis points to 3.31 percent as of 10:46 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.29 percent
earlier, the lowest level since Nov. 26. Local markets will be
shut from Feb. 11 through Feb. 15 for the Lunar New Year
holiday.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.81 percent, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The PBOC added 10 billion yuan to the financial system via
14-day reverse-repo contracts today at a yield of 3.45 percent,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due August
2017 dropped two basis points to 3.23 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
