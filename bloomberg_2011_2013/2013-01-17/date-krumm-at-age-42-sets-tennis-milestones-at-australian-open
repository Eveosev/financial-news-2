Kimiko Date-Krumm is blazing a trail
for 40-and-older tennis players at the Australian Open and may
not stop anytime soon.  The 42-year-old from  Japan  yesterday became the second-
oldest woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tournament
by beating Shahar Peer of Israel 6-2, 7-5 at Melbourne Park.
Following her win, the Tokyo resident joked that she could play
for another five years.  “Not easy. I need new body,” she told reporters.  Date-Krumm, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in
1995, has been setting age records since coming out of
retirement in 2008. She became the oldest player to beat a top
10-ranked opponent in 2010. Later that year she got back into
the top 50 the month before she turned 40, becoming the oldest
to do so since Billie  Jean King  at age 40 in March 1984.  Her opening-round upset of No. 12 seed  Nadia Petrova  of
Russia three days ago made her the oldest woman to win a singles
match at the Australian Open, where she reached the 1994
semifinals, losing to eventual champion  Steffi Graf .  Yesterday’s victory put her only behind Renee Richards, who
was 45 years, 8 days old when she reached the third round of the
1979  U.S. Open , in terms of a run to the last 32 at a major.  She’ll next face an opponent half her age in 56th-ranked
Bojana Jovanovski of Serbia, who ousted 17th-seeded Lucie Safarova of the  Czech Republic .  Date-Krumm said that whenever she now speaks with Graf, the
winner of 22 Grand Slam singles titles encourages her to quit
playing and start a family. Graf, 43, has two children with
four-time Australian Open champion  Andre Agassi .  “When I see Steffi, she say to me, ‘You should stop now
and make the baby,”’ said Date-Krumm, who is married to German
racecar driver Michael Krumm.  While other ex-rivals from the 1990s offer her words of
encouragement, Date-Krumm said they often have another message.  “Everybody say to me, ‘You are crazy,”’ she said. “First
word is always, ‘you are crazy.’ But they support me a lot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
