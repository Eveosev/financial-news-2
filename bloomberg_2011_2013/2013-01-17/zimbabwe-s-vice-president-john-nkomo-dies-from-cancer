Zimbabwean Vice President John Nkomo, a senior member of President  Robert Mugabe ’s party, died
at the age of 78.  Nkomo succumbed to cancer at St Anne’s hospital in the
capital Harare, the state-controlled  Herald  newspaper reported.  “We have lost a revolutionary, a fighter of freedom, a
friend of the people,” Mugabe, 88, told reporters at his
residence in Harare. “He will be dearly missed by all of us.  Nkomo served as one of two deputy presidents since 2009,
spending three years before that as speaker of parliament. He
was imprisoned from 1966 to 1968 for opposing the then-Rhodesian
government under  Ian Smith .  Between 1980 and 1987, Nkomo held senior positions in
Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African People’s Union, until ZAPU and
Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union party combined to form
ZANU-PF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
