Bank of America Corp.  is in better
position than last year as it seeks to pass regulatory tests
that would allow the firm to increase dividends and resume share
buybacks, according to its chief executive officer.  “The capital is there,” CEO  Brian T. Moynihan  said today
during a conference call with analysts, without committing to
any increase. “We’ve got to get through the process.”  Investors and analysts have speculated that Bank of America
will boost its 1-cent quarterly  dividend  and start repurchasing
shares after building capital levels and passing Federal Reserve
stress tests later this year. The Charlotte, North Carolina-
based bank, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, slashed
the dividend during the 2008-2009 financial crisis as part of a
federal bailout. The funds have since been repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
