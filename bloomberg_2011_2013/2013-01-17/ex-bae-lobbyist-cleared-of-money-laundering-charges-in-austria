A former  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  lobbyist
was cleared by a Vienna court on money laundering charges tied
to allegations he bribed officials in eastern and central  Europe 
for weapons contracts.  Prosecutors didn’t present enough facts to convict Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly of money laundering, criminal-court
spokeswoman Christina Salzborn said today by telephone.  Mensdorff-Pouilly was found guilty on a lesser charge of
evidence tampering, which carries a conditional two-month
sentence that may be voided on appeal, Salzborn said.  U.K. prosecutors dropped similar charges against Mensdorff-
Pouilly in 2010 in a joint U.K. and U.S. settlement ending a
six-year-old bribery and fraud investigation against the
company.  Harald Schuster, a lawyer for Mensdorff-Pouilly, wasn’t
immediately available at his office for a call for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
