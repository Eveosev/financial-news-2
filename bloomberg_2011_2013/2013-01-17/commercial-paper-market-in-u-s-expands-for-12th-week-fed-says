The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  expanded for a 12th week as non-
financial short-term IOUs rose to the highest level in four
years.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
advanced $27.8 billion to $1.133 trillion outstanding in the
week ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its
website. That’s the longest stretch of increases since the
period ended July 25, 2007, and the most since the market
touched $1.147 trillion on Aug. 17, 2011.  “We’re seeing in general short-term business demand for
credit rise, and this seems to be an artifact of the inventory
building that we’ve seen over time,” Raymond Stone, an
economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton,
New Jersey, said in a telephone interview.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries. Business inventories in the U.S. rose in November at
the same pace as a month earlier as companies kept stockpiles in
line with improving demand.  Short-term IOUs issued by non-financial companies  climbed 
$5.7 billion to $220.5 billion, the highest level since the
period ended Jan. 7, 2009, the Fed said.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions 
increased $5.5 billion to $251.9 billion outstanding, the most
since July 2011, while the  amount issued by U.S.-based banks 
climbed $12.2 billion to $339.9 billion outstanding, the fourth
rise, according to the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
