West Texas Sour crude strengthened
for a second day as  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  and  Magellan
Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  prepared to expand pipeline capacity from
the Permian Basin to Houston.  WTS’s discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed $3.50 a barrel to $8.50 at 2:09 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the  smallest
margin  since Nov. 29. WTI in Midland gained $3 a barrel to $6.50
under WTI in Cushing.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark low-density, low-
sulfur crude on the  Gulf Coast , weakened 15 cents to a $16.20-a-
barrel premium to WTI at Cushing. Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s
premium to WTI also shrank 15 cents, to $16.30.  Mars Blend, a medium-gravity, high-sulfur crude from the
 Gulf of Mexico , was unchanged at a $12.50 premium to WTI.
Poseidon’s premium to WTI narrowed by 25 cents to $12.45 a
barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s weakened by 40 cents to $14.40. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium  widened 15 cents  to $12.25.  The differential between WTI and Brent widened by 16 cents
to $15.16 a barrel based on March settlement prices .  WTI’s discount to Brent has narrowed from $25.53 on Nov. 15
after  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  expanded
service Jan. 11 on the Seaway pipeline. It spans 500 miles (805
kilometers) from Cushing to Freeport, Texas.  Canadian Crude  Syncrude, a light synthetic oil processed from oil-sands
bitumen, weakened for a second day on light volume. It moved to
a 65-cent discount from a 15-cent premium to WTI yesterday,
according to data provided by Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.
The discount for Western Canada Select, a heavy bitumen blend,
strengthened by 50 cents to $36.50.  February trading in Canadian grades ends tomorrow, a few
business days before nominations are due for space on export
pipeline shipments to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
