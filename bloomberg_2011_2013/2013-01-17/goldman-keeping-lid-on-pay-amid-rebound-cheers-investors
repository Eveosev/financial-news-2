Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
securities firm that set a Wall Street compensation record in
2007, is now demonstrating how little it can pay.  The portion of revenue allotted for salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits was 38 percent in 2012, down from 42
percent a year earlier and the lowest since 2009, the company
said yesterday in a statement. The move helped the bank post a
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and pushed
return on equity to 10.7 percent for the year, up from 3.7
percent in 2011. The stock climbed the most in 10 months.  “It’s a better time to be an investor than when bonuses
are becoming ridiculous,” said Michael Vogelzang, chief
investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
billion including Goldman Sachs shares. “You’re seeing a
massive amount of overcapacity in the business and it’s
continuing to push down the price of labor.”  Goldman Sachs still may be one of few Wall Street firms
that pay employees more for 2012 because revenue surged 19
percent and it cut staff by 3 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, cut total compensation expense at
its corporate and investment bank 3 percent last year as revenue
at that division rose 1 percent. The pay expense was 33 percent
of revenue for the year, down from 34 percent in 2011.  ‘Operating Leverage’  Morgan Stanley, which is eliminating 1,600 jobs, will defer
100 percent of bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over
three years as it reins in costs, a person briefed on the matter
said earlier this week. Deutsche Bank AG is weighing 2012 bonus
cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in  Europe ,
while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
briefed on the matter said this week.  Anton Schutz, president of Rochester, New York-based Mendon
Capital Advisors, said control of expenses, which rose 1 percent
during 2012 even as revenue climbed 19 percent, is something
Goldman Sachs investors have craved.  “One of the things we’ve been looking for in this space
for a long time is operating leverage,” said Schutz, whose firm
has about $150 million under management including Goldman Sachs
stock. “That’s exciting for shareholders. I don’t think it’s so
good for employees unless they own a lot of stock.”  Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $143.50 by 10:52
a.m. in German trading after climbing 4.1 percent yesterday in
 New York  to $141.09, the biggest advance since March. The shares
have gained 11 percent this year on top of a 41 percent advance
in 2011.  Market Rebound  The bank derived about 70 percent of its revenue last year
from investments with the firm’s own money or trading with
clients. The performance of those businesses is often tied to
the rise or fall of asset prices.  A stock-market  rebound  and a $500 million profit from
selling a hedge-fund-administration unit helped revenue  recover 
from the lowest first half since 2005 as the company booked its
first annual revenue gain in three years. Revenue in Investing &
Lending, the segment that includes the firm’s stakes in stocks,
bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds, almost
tripled last year to $5.89 billion from $2.14 billion.  Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy &
Investment Group LLC, said he raised his estimates for Goldman
Sachs’s earnings per share through 2015 because he expects the
annual compensation ratio to hold below 40 percent. He kept a
neutral rating on the stock because he expects gains from
private-equity and debt holdings to be lower this year and
predicts regulations will limit trading revenue, according to a
research note yesterday.  Reinsurance Business  Goldman Sachs said yesterday that $1.08 billion of the
firm’s $8.2 billion of equity trading revenue was from the
bank’s reinsurance business, marking the first time that the
company disclosed revenue from that segment. The firm is
considering selling a majority stake in that unit, said Harvey M. Schwartz, who will replace Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 57, at the end of this month.  The bank still doesn’t have enough information on proposed
regulatory changes to give a target for future return on equity,
Schwartz, 48, said on a conference call with investors. The 10.7
percent figure for 2012 was “not particularly aspirational,”
he said. “We’d like to do better.”  Central bank policies have boosted asset prices, and that’s
likely to continue to contribute to higher profits at firms like
Goldman Sachs, said Boston Advisors’ Vogelzang. He said he
expects the bank’s return on equity to reach the “mid-teens.”  “The way we view the ROE target is this is a very cyclical
business, highly dependent on  capital markets ,” Vogelzang said.
“Our outlook for particularly the U.S. equity markets is quite
strong, and they’re going to be levered to that.”  Better Balance  Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has
undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-
2011. That helped reduce the compensation ratio, which was part
of an effort to strike a better balance between rewarding
employees and shareholders, Schwartz told analysts.  “This year we hope we got the balance right,” he said.  The bank employed 32,400 people as of Dec. 31, 900 fewer
than the end of 2011. It allocated $12.9 billion for
compensation, up from $12.2 billion in 2011. That averages
$399,506 per employee. While that’s up from $367,057 in 2011,
it’s 40 percent less than the $661,490 average for 2007.  That’s a reflection of how much the market has changed,
Vogelzang said.  “It’s a very interesting case study in the supply-demand
equation for high wage-earning, white-collar workers,” he said.
“We’ve certainly seen it in manufacturing, we’ve seen it in
lower-level services, but we’re now seeing it at places like
Goldman and  Morgan Stanley. (MS) ”  To contact the reporter on this story:
