Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA rose as Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Francois Ott bought shares in the central
European property developer, prompting speculation that he’s
fighting billionaire Radovan Vitek for control.  The stock climbed 3.9 percent to 67.80 koruna by 10:39 a.m.
in Prague, making it the best performer today in the  PX (PX)  index.
In Paris, its home market, Orco  added  2.3 percent to 2.64 euros.  Orco has gained 76 percent in the past three months after a
bond-for-equity swap cut indebtedness and sent the stock price
to a record low on Sept. 12, attracting new investors. Vitek,
owner of Czech Property Investments AS, who bought a 30 percent
stake, has proposed to become board member and cut the company’s
share capital by 51 percent without cancellation of shares at a
Feb. 4 shareholder meeting. Ott bought 8.4 percent last week,
raising his stake to 8.9 percent, Orco said yesterday.  “We see CEO Ott’s increased stake as part of a fight for
control over Orco,” analyst Josef Novotny at Erste Group Bank
AG’s Prague-based unit wrote in a report to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
