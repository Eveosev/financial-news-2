Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , a Chinese maker of
solar panels, supplied 61 megawatts of the modules to a power
plant built on a former military airfield in eastern  Germany .  Trina supplied about 252,000 modules to the Green Tower
venture that was installed on the former Preschen airfield in
the state of Brandenburg, the company said today in a statement.
The project, which stretches for more than a kilometer (0.6
mile), is able to generate enough power for about 17,000
households, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
