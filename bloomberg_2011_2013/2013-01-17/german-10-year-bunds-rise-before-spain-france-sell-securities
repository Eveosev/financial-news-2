German  government bonds  fell, with
two-year yields rising to the highest since June, on speculation
financial institutions will begin paying back loans from the
 European Central Bank , pushing up overnight borrowing rates.  Futures contracts on the three-month euro interbank offered
rate, or Euribor, dropped and securities from  Austria , France
and the Netherlands also slid. French 10-year bond yields rose
to the highest in more than two months as borrowing costs
increased at an auction. Repayments of loans taken from the
ECB’s Longer-Term Refinancing Operation will be possible from
the end of this month.  “There is some selling pressure in the short-dated core
notes and that’s driven primarily by speculation that banks will
pay back LTRO and drive overnight rates higher,” said Soeren Moerch, the head of government-bond trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) 
in Copenhagen. “The market is badly positioned for this and
that caused a bit of a selloff.”  Germany ’s two-year note yield rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 0.20 percent at 4:51 p.m.  London  time,
the highest since April 5. The zero percent security maturing in
December 2014 fell 0.135, or 1.35 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,336)
face amount, to 99.63.  The nation’s 10-year bund yield gained four basis points to
1.61 percent, after rising to 1.63 percent, the  highest  level
since Oct. 22.  Euribor Futures  The implied rate on Euribor futures contracts expiring in
December 2013 rose 10 basis points to 0.455 percent after
advancing by as much as 11 basis points, the biggest one-day
increase since March 16.  Three-month Euribor rose to 0.204 percent today, according
to data from the European Banking Federation. That’s up from a
record low of 0.181 percent in December. It climbed to a record
high of 5.393 percent in October 2008, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Frankfurt-based ECB lent financial institutions about 1
trillion euros for as much as three years via two LTROs in
December 2011 and February last year.  The loans were intended to ease financial tensions in the
market and to spur demand for higher-yielding assets such as
Italian, Portugal and Spanish bonds as the debt crisis pushed
borrowing costs in those countries to levels that threatened to
shut them out of  capital markets .  Loan Repayment  Banks in so-called core countries including Germany are
likely to be the first to repay the ECB loans, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  They are likely to repay between 126 billion euros and 167
billion euros, assuming that “50 to 66 percent of the take-up
of core banks is repaid,” Soniya Sadeesh, a strategist at the
bank in London, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “This need not
occur all on the first repayment date, and is more likely to be
an ongoing process over the year.”  France sold 7.98 billion euros in debt with yields rising
as receding concern that the euro will break up diminished
demand for safe-haven securities.  The Paris-based treasury sold 4.045 billion euros of five-
year debt at an average yield of 1.06 percent, compared with
1.01 percent for October 2018 securities on Dec. 6. It sold 2.35
billion euros of 2015 notes at an average yield of 0.24 percent
and 1.585 billion euros of 2017 securities at 0.74 percent. It
also sold 1.69 billion euros of inflation-protected securities.  France ’s 10-year yield rose five basis points to 2.18
percent, after reaching 2.19 percent, the highest since Nov. 7.  Spanish Sale  Spanish securities dropped even after the nation matched
its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros and borrowing costs fell
at its second bond sale of the year.  Spain allotted notes maturing in October 2015 notes at an
average yield of 2.713 percent, down from 3.358 percent at the
previous sale on Dec. 13. It auctioned securities due in January
2018 at 3.77 percent, versus 3.988 percent on Jan. 10, and bonds
maturing in July 2041 at 5.696 percent, compared with 5.893
percent when similar-maturity debt was sold on Dec. 13.  The yield on  Spain ’s 10-year bond rose 10 basis points to
5.12 percent, after falling to 5 percent.  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Belgium and Austria,
according to measures of 10-year or equivalent maturity debt,
the yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit
default swaps.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
month through yesterday and France’s declined 1.1 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds
returned 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
