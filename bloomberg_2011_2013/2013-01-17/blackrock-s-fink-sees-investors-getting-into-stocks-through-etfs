BlackRock (BLK)  Inc.’s Laurence D. Fink,
who leads the world’s biggest provider of exchange-traded funds,
said investors will continue to put money into passive stock
products rather than active funds as they get back into
equities.  “What we are seeing, and the industry overall, are still a
majority of flows moving more into passive,” Fink, chairman and
chief executive officer of New York-based BlackRock, said in a
telephone interview today.  BlackRock’s iShares unit, which manages $759 billion in
exchange-traded products and offers about 600 funds, is seeing
investor deposits heavily skewed toward equities, Fink said. The
firm’s stock ETFs drew $30.1 billion in the  fourth quarter ,
while investors removed $5.4 billion from active stock funds,
the firm said today in a statement.  The deposits helped lift assets at the world’s biggest
money manager, which posted a 24 percent increase in fourth-
quarter earnings to $690 million, or $3.93 a share, from $555
million, or $3.05, a year earlier. Assets rose to a record $3.79
trillion.  U.S. stock mutual funds attracted $14.8 billion in new
money last week, the most since at least 2007. Investors had
been avoiding domestic stock funds since the 2008 financial
crisis, missing out as the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index more than
doubled from a 12-year low in March 2009. Money instead flowed
to bond funds, which were perceived as safer.  Paring Bonds  Investors poured more than six times as much money into
BlackRock’s stock ETFs as they did into bond ETFs in the last
three months of 2012.  “I’m not here to say people are bullish and rerisking,”
Fink said. “If they’re not bearish on the world, but not
bullish, they probably have overallocation to bonds, and they’re
probably looking and re-orienting that.”  BlackRock’s shares rose 4.6 percent to $232.46 at 12:46
p.m. in  New York , the most since December 2011. The stock  gained 
19 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, compared with the
25 percent increase in the 20-member Standard & Poor’s index of
asset managers and custody banks.  U.S. economic growth in the first quarter may be harmed by
the bill U.S. lawmakers passed to avert spending cuts and tax
increases because it doesn’t address the  budget deficit , Fink
said. He said he still expects the economy to pick up in the
second half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
