TransForce Inc. (TFI)  rose the most in
almost six months after the transportation and logistics company
agreed to buy Velocity Express to expand its package delivery
business.  The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the
end of the month, will add about C$160 million ($162 million) in
annual revenue, Montreal-based TransForce said today in a
statement. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  The acquisition gives TransForce a network of more than 80
locations in the U.S. and  Canada , as well as 2,600 workers and
independent contractors. Revenue from TransForce’s package and
courier division rose to C$867 million in the first nine months
of 2012, equivalent to 37 percent of the company’s total sales.  TransForce  rose  4.4 percent to C$22.05 at the close in
Toronto, the stock’s biggest one-day gain since July 27.  “We view the Velocity acquisition positively as it
increases TransForce’s exposure to key markets,” Benoit Poirier, an analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. in  Montreal ,
said in a note to clients. The deal “represents a continuation
of TransForce’s strategy to solidify its position in the package
and courier market.”  Poirier advises investors to buy the shares.  Velocity Express is based in Stafford,  Texas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
