(Corrects second paragraph to show export sales were
highest since October 2010.)  Soybean futures rose to a four-week
high after the U.S. reported the biggest jump in export sales in
more than two years.  Sales in the  week  ended Jan. 10 jumped to 1.61 million
metric tons, the most since October 2010 and up from 321,800 a
week earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. The
purchases included 845,600 by  China . Prices had tumbled to a
six-month low on Jan. 11, as China canceled earlier export-sale
agreements.  “China is back buying U.S. soybeans after the drop in
prices,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler, Indiana, said in a telephone interview. “Not only are
Chinese crushers coming for U.S. soybeans, but the jump in
soybean-meal exports will keep U.S. crusher demand for soybeans
elevated. U.S. supplies are getting extremely tight.”  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$14.4025 a bushel at 8:22 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after reaching $14.48, the highest for a most-active contract
since Dec. 19. Before the export report, prices dropped 0.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
