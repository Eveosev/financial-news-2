The euro fell from near an 11-month
high against the dollar after reports showed Italian industrial
orders dropped and Spanish bad loans increased, adding to signs
the region’s economy will struggle to expand this year.  Europe ’s shared currency slipped from the highest in 20
month against the yen amid speculation its 4.7 percent gain this
year has been too rapid. The Swiss franc declined to the least
since May 2011 against the euro after a trade union called on
the nation’s central bank to change its cap on the currency.
South Africa’s rand dropped on concern labor protests will curb
exports. The pound slid for a sixth day against the dollar as
retail sales unexpectedly fell.  “The euro is giving back some of its gains,” said  Lutz Karpowitz , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “It went too high, too quickly. The economy is
still very weak. We don’t expect the euro strength to remain.”  The euro declined 0.2 percent to $1.3356 at 7:39 a.m.  New
York  time after appreciating to $1.3404 on Jan. 14, the
strongest since Feb. 29. Europe’s shared currency rose 0.1
percent to 120.35 yen, after reaching 120.71, the most since May
2011.  Japan ’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 90.03 per dollar.  Europe’s shared currency will fall to $1.29 by the end of
March, Commerzbank predicts.  Italian industrial orders fell 0.5 percent in November from
a month earlier, a report showed today. The euro-area economy
will contract 0.1 percent this year, according to analyst
predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. will expand 2
percent, according to a separate survey.  Price Swings  Currency  volatility  rose to a five-month high, increasing
the chance that price swings will wipe out profits. The JPMorgan
G7 Volatility Index, derived from premiums on foreign-exchange
options, rose to as much as 9.19 percent, the most since Aug. 2.  The franc appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.2457 per euro after
depreciating to 1.2569, the weakest level since May 20, 2011.  Switzerland’s currency headed for a 2.2 percent weekly
decline against the euro, the most since the five days ending
Sept. 9, 2011, when the Swiss National Bank imposed a cap
against the euro to block the franc’s appreciation.  The central bank limited the currency at 1.20 per euro to
protect exporters after investors, drawn to Switzerland’s lower
ratio of debt to gross domestic product than its euro-area
peers, pushed the exchange rate with the euro toward parity.
Demand for the refuge of Swiss francs eased at the start of this
year after European policy makers took steps to contain the
financial turmoil.  New Limit  “In recent days the Swiss franc has somewhat weakened
against the euro and today reached a rate of 1.25 francs,”
trade union Unia said in an e-mail. “Unia calls on the Swiss
National Bank to immediately set this rate as the new lower
limit and to defend it at all costs.”  Switzerland’s franc has tumbled 1.7 percent this year, the
second-steepest decline after the yen, which slid 3.8 percent,
among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 0.3 percent and
the euro climbed 1.7 percent.  In Britain, retail sales including fuel slipped 0.1 percent
from November, when they stagnated, the Office for National
Statistics said today. The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for an increase of 0.2 percent. Purchases
of household goods fell the most in almost three years.  “We obviously had very weak retail sales numbers,” said
Christian Lawrence, a London-based currency strategist at
Rabobank International. “It’s only if we get some headlines
coming out of the mouths of politicians that we’re likely to see
much of a sea change in sentiment” toward sterling, he said.  The rand dropped 1.1 percent to 8.8982 per dollar,
extending this week’s decline to 2 percent.  The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.5940 and dropped 0.3
percent to 83.85 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
