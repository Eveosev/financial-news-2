Hog futures climbed to a six-month
high on signs of increasing demand and shrinking supplies of
U.S. pork. Cattle prices dropped.  Wholesale  pork  climbed 0.6 percent to 84.25 cents a pound
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 11, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. U.S. pork  output  will total 5.725 billion
pounds (2.6 million metric tons) this quarter, down 8.3 percent
from the prior three months, the USDA estimates.  “The packer right now is scrambling for supplies all the
way into the summer,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “Part of that is due to this drop in pork production
that was projected by the government in the last USDA report.”  Hog futures for April settlement climbed 0.5 percent to
87.85 cents a pound at 9:55 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after reaching 88.5 cents, the highest for the most-
active contract since July 9.  Meatpackers processed 1.29 million hogs in the first three
days of this week, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier, USDA
figures show.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.32275 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement declined 0.5
percent to $1.47475 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
