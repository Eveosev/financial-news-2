Javier Martin-Artajo, who helped
supervise  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s derivatives bets that fueled
more than $6.2 billion in losses, settled a lawsuit brought by
the firm, a person with direct knowledge of the case said.  JPMorgan sued Martin-Artajo in a London court in October,
without detailing its complaint in filings, after his departure
from the bank. He had supervised Bruno Iksil, the JPMorgan
trader nicknamed the London Whale for market-moving wagers in
the unit responsible for the losses.  JPMorgan said last year it had ousted managers responsible
for the group’s loss and would claw back pay after discovering
evidence that traders, whom it didn’t identify, may have
intentionally tried to hide souring bets. The bank today said
Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s pay was cut in half
because he also bears responsibility for the blunders.  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for the New York-based
company, didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. Martin-
Artajo’s attorney, Greg Campbell, declined to comment on the
settlement’s terms. Reuters reported earlier today that the
claim had been settled.  The case is: JPMorgan Chase & Co. v. Mr. Javier Martin-
Artajo, High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division,
HQ12X04391.  To contact the reporter on this story:
