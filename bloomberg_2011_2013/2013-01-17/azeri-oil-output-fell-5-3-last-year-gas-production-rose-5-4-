Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , pumped less crude last year
as the BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field cut production.  The Caspian Sea nation produced 43 million metric tons of
oil, down 5.3 percent from 2011, the State Statistics Committee
said today on its  website . Production of marketable natural gas
rose 5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  Volumes from the ACG field, which accounted for 78 percent
of the countryâ€™s production in 2011, fell 12 percent in the
first half of last year. BP, which replaced regional managers
after President  Ilham Aliyev  accused it of making mistakes, has
promised to stabilize output this year, Aliyev said Jan. 15.  The largest oil producers in the former Soviet Union are
Russia and  Kazakhstan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
