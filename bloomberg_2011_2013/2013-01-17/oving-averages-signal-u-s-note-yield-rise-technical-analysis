Treasury 10-year notes, off to the
worst start in a decade, may fall further as the benchmark debt
yield’s 50- and 100-day moving averages are close to trading
above the security’s 200-day moving average.  The convergence of the measures of price momentum typically
suggests upward pressure on yields, said Thomas di Galoma, a
managing director at Navigate Advisors LLC, a brokerage for
institutional investors in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . The 50- and
100-day averages have risen to 1.719 percent and 1.711 percent
as the 200-day average has fallen to 1.718 percent.  “The technical indicators suggest, over the short term,
investors are cautious and more reluctant to extend out the
curve -- suggesting we could see more selling,” di Galoma said.
“The Fed is pumping a lot of liquidity in the system to pump up
risk assets, and they are succeeding to some extent.’  The  10-year yield  climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 12:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield dropped to
1.80 percent yesterday, the least since Jan. 2.  ‘‘Even if the Fed is successful in pumping up risk assets,
the economy isn’t going to come roaring back,” he said. “And
with all the uncertainty coming from  Washington , there is no
reason to believe that we will stray too far from this range.”  Ten-year notes have lost 0.7 percent this year, more than
double the 0.3 percent loss in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. The last
time the security started the year worse was 2003, when it lost
1.8 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
