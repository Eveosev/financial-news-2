Egypt  is looking for local and
foreign investors to participate in public-private partnerships
for infrastructure projects starting in April, Finance Minister
El Morsi Hegazi said in an e-mailed statement today.  The government is seeking investor interest in eight to 10
projects, including the development of the Safaga industrial
port on the Red Sea coast, three water desalination plants in
Sinai, the Red Sea and Matrouh provinces, and a railway line to
industrial zones in 10th of Ramadan City.  A new investment plan will be drawn up within eight weeks,
with a focus on developing the Suez Canal region, Hegazi said.
The current plan already includes 400 development projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
