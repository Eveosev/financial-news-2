Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.07 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.27 percent and averaging 0.14 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  announced yesterday
that in the ’’near future’’ it will do another series of
repurchase agreements with all counterparties, which are
temporary open market operations. The action, which follows a
similar one in August, doesn’t represent any change in monetary
policy and is a test of the Fed’s operational tools.  The central bank will also acquire $2.75 billion to $3.5
billion of Treasury notes due from February 2020 to November
2022 as part of its current quantitative easing program, aimed
at keeping long term borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
