The naira snapped a four-day retreat
against the dollar on speculation that  Nigeria ’s central bank
will hold  interest rates  at a record high as inflation stayed
above the regulator’s target.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slid 0.1
percent to 157.045 a dollar by 2:58 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira gained 3.9 percent last year, the
strongest performance among African currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s  inflation rate  eased to 12 percent in December,
from 12.3 percent a month earlier, the first decline in three
months as the effects of flooding that damaged agricultural
output began to recede. The bank’s target is below 10 percent.
 Core inflation , which excludes agricultural products, rose 13.7
percent in December from a year earlier, compared with 13.1
percent in the previous month, the nation’s statistics bureau
said today.  “These data indicate that underlying inflationary
pressures remain high in the economy and do not support monetary
easing anytime soon,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, Africa
strategists at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg, wrote in an e-
mailed note today.  The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee
kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 12 percent in its
meetings last year to curb inflation and support the naira.  Yields on naira debt due 2022 fell seven basis points to
11.37 percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 were
little changed at 3.741 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi weakened for a sixth day, declining 0.1
percent to 1.91 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
