Oil options volatility slipped while
the underlying futures rose as data on housing starts and a
jobless claims bolstered optimism for the  U.S. economy  and
petroleum demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.83 percent at 4:05 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 22.21 yesterday.  Crude oil for February delivery advanced $1.25 to $95.49 a
barrel on Nymex, the highest settlement since Sept. 17. The
March contract increased $1.26 to $95.94. Prices rose after a
Labor Department  report  showed applications for jobless benefits
fell to the least since January 2008.  Housing starts  climbed
12.1 percent to a 954,000 annual rate in December, the Commerce
Department said today.  “The tendency of crude oil is for volatility to drop when
prices go up,” said Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy
option broker at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $80 puts on volume of 3,174 contracts. They slipped 6
cents to 7 cents a barrel. The second-most active, with 2,693
lots exchanged, were March $90 puts, which slipped 30 cents to
64 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 58
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 61 percent of
volume.  March $80 puts were the most active options yesterday, with
8,958 contracts trading as they fell 3 cents to 13 cents a
barrel. March $85 puts slipped 12 cents to 35 cents a barrel on
7,572 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 36,315
