Huafeng Group Holdings Ltd. (364) , a Hong
Kong-based fabric processor, agreed to pay HK$2.49 billion ($321
million) to buy an oolong tea producer in  China  from people
connected to its controlling shareholder.  The company will pay for the purchase with HK$193.9 million
in cash, HK$1.68 billion in new shares and HK$614.8 million in 4
percent, 30-month convertible bonds, according to a statement to
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday.  Huafeng said on Dec. 12 that “difficulties in the textile
industry in China continue,” it may record a “substantial”
net loss for 2012 and it was seeking mergers and acquisitions in
order to diversify. The company last year allowed the proposed
purchase of a gold mine in China to lapse.  The targeted tea producer’s 2011 after-tax profit gained 53
percent from a year earlier to 194.3 million  yuan  ($31.2
million), according to yesterday’s statement. The sellers
include people who are connected to Huafeng’s controlling
shareholder Cai Zhenrong, according to the filing.  Shares in Huafeng, suspended yesterday, will resume trading
in Hong Kong today. The stock has gained 56 percent in the past
12 months, compared with a 19 percent gain in the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
