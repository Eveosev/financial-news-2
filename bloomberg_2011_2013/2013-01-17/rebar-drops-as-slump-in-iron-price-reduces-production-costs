Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a third day in  China  after the price of  iron ore  slumped,
reducing production costs for the alloy used for railways and
buildings.  Rebar for delivery in May dropped as much as 0.9 percent to
3,899 yuan ($627) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
It traded 3,909 yuan at the end of the morning trading session.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port, a benchmark for the raw
material, fell for a fifth straight day yesterday, dropping 4.9
percent to $145.40 a ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd. That
extended the loss to 8.3 percent after peaking $158.50 on Jan. 8,
the highest in more than a year.  “The pull-back in iron ore prices took away a key support
for rebar prices,” Wang Yangqing, analyst at Nanhua Futures Co.,
said by phone from Hangzhou. “There are no significant
fundamental changes to support a further rally, so the market is
forced to look at the weak physical market.”  Rebar inventory on Jan. 11 climbed 2.4 percent from a week
earlier to 5.8 million tons, according to Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. The average spot  price  for rebar was
little changed at 3,733  yuan  a ton, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
