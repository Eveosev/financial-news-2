Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is following the wrong
policy by asking countries to fight debt with austerity,
according to an interview with Weltwoche.  “ Chancellor Merkel  certainly is the dominant politician of
our time, very powerful, but also very capable,” Soros was
cited as telling the Swiss magazine. “Unfortunately, the
policies she advocates are wrong” as she is fighting the
European debt crisis by demanding a “shrinking of the economy
and of state budgets,” he said. “I believe that you only can
get out of extreme debt with growth.”  Soros also told the magazine that the attempt to maintain
the euro in its current form will destroy the European Union,
adding that “it is much more important to keep the EU and the
common market than the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
