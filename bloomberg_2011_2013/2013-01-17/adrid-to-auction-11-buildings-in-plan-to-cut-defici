Madrid’s regional  government  will
try to sell 11 buildings in an auction today, according to a
document obtained by Bloomberg News, part of a plan to sell 100
properties over three years to cut its deficit.  The buildings have combined space of 17,500 square meters
(188,000 square feet) and are valued at 32.5 million euros ($43
million), the document shows. If no bids are made, a second
auction will be held in two months at which the properties will
be offered at a 15 percent discount. If that fails to attract
buyers, the price is again cut by that amount in a final
auction. Most of the properties are office buildings.  “It’s normal for investors not to bid in the first round
as they want to take advantage of discounts in the second and
maybe third rounds,” Jose Luis Moreno Casas, the government
official who is overseeing the disposals.  Spanish regional governments control more than a third of
public spending and play a key role in cutting the national
deficit, part of the national government’s vow to meet the
conditions of a rescue package of as much as 100 billion euros
for the country’s banks.  Madrid  is one of seven Spanish regions on track to reduce
their budget deficits to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product
in 2012. The second-biggest economy after Catalonia,
contributing almost a fifth of output and growing faster than
the country as a whole in 2011, had debt equal to 9.5 percent of
GDP in the third quarter, compared with 15.9 percent for all of
Spain’s regions.  Proceeds of the sales will be used to provide for residents
and trim the Madrid region’s  budget  shortfall, which reached 2.2
percent of regional GDP in 2011.  The more valuable properties earmarked for today’s sale
include a 2,524 square-meter office building in Calle Jose
Abascal in Madrid’s upscale Chamberi district valued at about 10
million euros and a 2,250 square-meter office building in San
Martin Square, next to a 16th century convent, worth about 5.6
million euros, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
