Iron-ore  swaps gained the most in
two weeks as Chinese steel output advanced and the cost of
physical cargoes halted a plunge.  February contracts rose 3 percent to $138 a dry metric ton
as of 12:42 p.m. in  London , according to GFI Group Inc. That’s
heading for the biggest increase since Jan. 3, based on data
from SGX AsiaClear, the largest clearer of the derivatives.  Chinese crude steel output rose 2.3 percent in the first 10
days of January to 1.944 million tons daily, the official Xinhua
News Agency said today, citing the  China  Iron & Steel
Association. Iron ore with 62 percent iron content at the port
of Tianjin was unchanged at $145.40 a ton today after dropping
8.3 percent in five sessions, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “The fall was already priced in by the market,” Ben
Goggin, a broker of iron-ore swaps at ICAP Plc in London, said
by e-mail today. “Today the  spot market  was much quieter and
there was some positive news, and buyers came back into the
market.”  The benchmark price for physical iron ore jumped as much as
37 percent since December to a 14-month high on Jan. 8, Steel
Index data show. China will import 770 million tons in 2013, 3.6
percent more than last year, Li Xinchuang, president of China’s
Metallurgical Industry Planning & Research Institute, said at a
conference sponsored by Bloomberg Industries in  New York 
yesterday. That’s the slowest growth since 2010, customs data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
