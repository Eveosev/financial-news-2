Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the world’s
biggest zircon producer, will cut spending, suspend a mine and
reduce production and jobs to lower costs after reporting a 58
percent drop in fourth-quarter sales amid weak demand.  The company plans to idle the Eneabba mining operation in
Western Australia in March, which will result in 65 job cuts,
the Perth-based company said today in a statement. It will also
reduce operations at the Murray Basin mine, Hamilton mineral
separation plant and Virginia mining and mineral processing
plant.  “Market conditions remained relatively subdued throughout
the December quarter,” Iluka said in today’s statement.  The World Bank this week cut its growth outlook for  China ,
the world’s largest zircon consumer, to 8.4 percent this year
from 8.6 percent as investment slows. Iluka said today mineral
sands sales fell 58 percent in the fourth quarter after trimming
output on lower demand and prices. The company will detail its
reduced capital spending and further production cuts for 2013
when it reports its full-year financial result next month, it
said.  Iluka shares rose 7 percent to A$10.04 at 11:24 a.m. in
Sydney trading as the benchmark stock index rose 0.6 percent.  Sales of mineral sands in the three months ended Dec. 31
were A$182.5 million ($193 million) compared with A$434 million
a year earlier, the Perth-based company said in today’s
statement.  Sales of zircon, used to glaze ceramic tiles, fell 58
percent to 213,800 metric tons last year, exceeding the
company’s own reduced guidance of 205,000 tons in December.  Eneabba mine, which began operations in 1975, produced
25,000 tons of zircon last year, compared with Iluka’s total
zircon production of 343,200 tons in 2012. It also produced
140,000 tons of ilmenite, used in Iluka’s synthetic rutile
operations, and 25,000 tons of rutile, also used in ceramics.  “With recent challenging economic conditions globally,
demand for these products has reduced,” Steve Wickham, general
manager of Iluka’s Australian operations, said in a separate
statement. “As a mature ore body, Eneabba is more exposed to
these prevailing market conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
