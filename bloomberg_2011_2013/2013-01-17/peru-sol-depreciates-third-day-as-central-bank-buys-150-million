Peru ’s sol fell for a third day as
the central bank bought dollars to soak up supply from companies
exchanging greenbacks for the local currency to pay taxes.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.5485 per U.S. dollar
today, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
worst performance among the six most-actively traded Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank said on its website it bought $150 million
in the spot market today, taking its total purchases this week
to $950 million, the most in any four-day period since January
2008. Mining companies, which account for 60 percent of Peru’s
exports, are buying soles before an annual deadline for income
tax payments, according to Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru SAA.  The scale of the central bank’s interventions makes it
“very hard to predict where the currency will go over the
coming days and weeks,” Diaz said by phone from  Lima .  The central bank bought a record $13.9 billion last year to
slow the pace of sol appreciation as mining investment and
demand for government bonds spurs inflows. The sol closed at a
16-year high of 2.5390 on Jan 14.,  data  from Peru’s financial
regulator show.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.74 percent at 3:15 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
