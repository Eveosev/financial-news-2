Sometimes, while wandering the
streets, you find yourself part of a crowd inexplicably
attracted to something.  The experience comes to mind with the aerial-view paintings
at Marlborough Gallery. Juan Genoves, 81, portrays swarms of
people with blots of black for the heads, blots of color for the
torsos, and black again for the legs.  While the upper part of the bodies is almost three-
dimensional thanks to the large quantity of dried acrylic, the
lower part is flat, giving the scene an absurd sense of reality
when viewed from a distance.  The 2011 “Angostura” could be showing New York Marathon
runners as they cross a colorful Brooklyn Bridge. “Pantalla”
seems to capture crowds staring at  Ground Zero , shown as a gray
square.  The sold-out “Juan Genoves: Recent Paintings” is at 40
W. 57th St. through Feb. 11, 2012. Information: +1-212-541-4900;

geometry taken in different aesthetic directions.  In “Jensen/LeWitt: Systems and Transformation,” curated
by Pace founder and chairman Arne Glimcher, LeWitt’s minimalist
wooden sculptures are painted in spotless white and could be the
stylized versions of an architectural model. Jensen’s oils are
vibrant, filled with strong brushstrokes of color.  The 1986 “Structure with Three Towers” by LeWitt, a
multiplication of identical cubes forming a faultless white
sculpture, sits next to Jensen’s 1968 “Square XXI Growth,”
with its quilt-like, symmetrical colored squares.  LeWitt’s pyramids, though made with wood, have a sense of
weightlessness. Jensen’s 1975 “A la fin de l’automne” echoes
their triangular shape.  Prices range from $100,000 to $750,000. The show is at 32
E. 57th St. through Feb. 11, 2012. Information: +1-212-421-3292;

neutral city landscapes. His views of Istanbul, Malta, Naples
and  Venice , along with photographs by compatriots Luigi Ghirri,
Gabriele Basilico and Massimo Vitali, are part of “Una
Prospettiva Italiana” at Howard Greenberg Gallery.  Though the buildings and roofs portrayed by Castella could
belong to any city, the connoisseur will recognize Naples’s
palace of Capodimonte, now a museum housing part of the
celebrated Farnese collection as well as masterpieces by Raphael
and Titian, among others.  The striking “Venezia, Giudecca,” odd one out among
Castella’s prints, is reminiscent of Canaletto’s truthful
portrayals of the floating city. Dated this year, it recalls his
older works, according to Angela Madesani, curator of the show.  Prices range from $8,000 to $39,700. The show is at 41 E.
57th St. through March 13. Information: +1-212-334-0010;
