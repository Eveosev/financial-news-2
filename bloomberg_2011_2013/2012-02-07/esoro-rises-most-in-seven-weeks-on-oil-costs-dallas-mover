Tesoro Corp ., the largest independent
refiner on the U.S. West Coast, rose the most in seven weeks
after the gap between oil costs and fuel prices widened.  Tesoro  increased  4.8 percent to $27.04 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain among the four members of the  Standard &
Poor’s  refiners index and the company’s largest rise since Dec.
20. The San Antonio-based refiner has gained 16 percent this
year.  The crack spread, the difference between oil costs and the
price at which companies sell fuel,  rose  nearly a third to
$28.54 in the past two weeks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The discount for crude produced near its North Dakota
refinery will boost Tesoro’s profits, said Mark Gilman, a New
York-based analyst at Benchmark Co. LLC.  “That’s what’s driving the market,” Gilman, who rates
Tesoro a “buy” and doesn’t own shares, said in a phone
interview today.  Independent refiners don’t explore for or produce oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
