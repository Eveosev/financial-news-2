China must implement commitments made
to the Group of 20 nations and allow freer trading of its
currency, Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said.  “China committed to move more rapidly toward a market-
determined exchange rate system, enhance exchange rate
flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and refrain from
competitive devaluation of its currency” at a November G-20
meeting in France, Harper said, according to the transcript of
an interview last week with Xinhua news agency.   “There has been a modest appreciation in the yuan against
the  U.S. dollar ” since November, Harper said. “It is important
for the credibility of China’s policymakers and the
G-20 that China follows through on its commitments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
