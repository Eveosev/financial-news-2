Siemens AG  has been sued in  Austria 
by about 200 former employees over cuts in their pension
payments, Handelsblatt reported today, citing one of the
plaintiffs.  The former employees sued after their benefits were cut by
25 percent since 2004 while pensions paid in Germany weren’t
reduced, the newspaper said. A first suit over the issue was
dismissed last year, according to Handelsblatt.  Siemens’ press office didn’t immediately return calls
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
