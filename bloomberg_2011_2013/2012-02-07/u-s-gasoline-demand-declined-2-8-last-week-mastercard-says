U.S. gasoline demand slid 2.8 percent
last week and was more than 5 percent below year-earlier levels
for the third straight week,  MasterCard Inc.  said.  Drivers bought 8.27 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the seven days ended Feb. 3, a four-week low, according to
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report.  Gasoline demand slipped below year-earlier levels for a
23rd consecutive time, declining 5.3 percent from 2011 after
previous declines of 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent.  Gasoline use over the previous four weeks was 4.9 percent
below the 2011 period, the 46th consecutive decline in that
measure. MasterCard’s data goes back to July 2004.  The average pump price rose 8 cents to $3.47 a gallon,
after being unchanged the prior two weeks. Prices were 12
percent above a year earlier. The biggest regional gain was on
the  Gulf Coast , which saw prices jump 11 cents in a week.  “Gasoline prices rose noticeably this past week after
taking a pause through most of January,” John Gamel, a gasoline
analyst and director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse,
said in the report.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc.  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
