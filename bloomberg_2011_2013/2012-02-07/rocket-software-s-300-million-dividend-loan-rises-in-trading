Rocket Software Inc.’s $300 million
 term loan  to fund a dividend to Court Square Capital Partners
rose in initial trading, according to data provider Markit Group
Ltd.  The six-year debt first exchanged hands at 99.88 cents on
the dollar, according to Markit. The financing for the developer
of  business software  was sold to investors at 98 cents on the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG arranged the financing for the
Newton, Massachusetts-based company, the data show. The loan
pays interest at 5.5 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent floor on the
benchmark.  Court Square, a New York-based private-equity firm,
acquired Rocket Software for an undisclosed amount in September
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
