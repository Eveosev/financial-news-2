Ireland’s state-backed banks issued
fewer bonds in the past three weeks under a program to generate
collateral that’s eligible for European Central Bank funding.  Irish banks started issuing three-month, government-
guaranteed notes last January that they kept to use as loan
security instead of selling to investors. The country was forced
to accept an international bailout 15 months ago as the end of a
decade-long property boom locked its banks out of public debt
markets.  Bank of Ireland Plc  and Irish Life & Permanent Plc issued
13 billion euros ($17 billion) of self-held, or own-use, bonds
since Jan. 19, according to the  National Treasury Management
Agency  in Dublin. The issues refinance maturing notes and don’t
represent an increase in funding, spokesmen for both lenders
said.  Allied Irish Bank Plc  said it didn’t issue any securities.  The banks’ issuance of self-held bonds declined 26 percent
from the last round of deals in October and November, according
to NTMA data. The notes are “eligible collateral for euro-
system market operations once they are guaranteed by the
government,” according to the  Central Bank of Ireland .  Irish banks’ reliance on ECB funding declined 4.3 percent
to 67.1 billion euros in the final three months of last year,
the lowest level since August 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
