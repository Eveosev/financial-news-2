Canadian natural gas fell on
speculation that colder weather in the U.S. won’t be enough to
erode an abundance of the fuel in underground storage.  Alberta  gas fell 2.6 percent. Demand for heat in the
Northeast will average 4 percent above normal through Feb. 14,
said Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives. U.S.
stockpiles stood at 2.966 billion cubic feet as of Jan. 27, 25
percent above the five-year average  Energy Department  data Show.  “The bump we’re seeing in U.S. temperatures has helped,”
said  Martin King , senior commodities analyst at FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. in Calgary. “If it only lasts four or five days
it’s too little, too late.”  Alberta gas for March delivery fell 5.5 cents to C$2.10 a
gigajoule ($2 per million British thermal units) at 11:15 a.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
lost 27 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 8.4 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.466 per million
Btu at 11:45 a.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 98 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.45 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 552 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.89 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.98
billion cubic feet at 10:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
