Asian stocks were little changed as
investors watched negotiations in  Athens , where Greek
politicians are struggling to meet conditions for a bailout,
reviving concern the debt-stricken nation may default.   The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed less than 0.1 percent
to 124.93 as 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo .  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average fell 0.2 percent, retreating from a three-month high.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
