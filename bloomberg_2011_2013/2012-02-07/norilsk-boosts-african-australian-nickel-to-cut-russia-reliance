OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , the largest
producer of the metal, plans to increase nickel-concentrate
output in  South Africa  and Australia to curb dependence on
Russian mines.  Norilsk intends to raise  production  at its South African
Nkomati project by 58 percent this year from 5,815 metric tons
last year, while output at Australia’s Lake Johnston mine may
jump fivefold to 8,400 tons, Roman Panov, the head of Norilsk’s
overseas operations, said today in a  statement .  The Moscow-based company, with 80 percent of its nickel
production north of the Arctic Circle, is seeking to expand
outside Russia as ore grades decline at its main site. Most of
the metals concentrate it mines in Africa and  Australia  is
processed at its NN Harjavalta plant in Finland.  The company is preparing to start its Honeymoon Well
project in Australia, with a designed capacity of 40,000 tons of
nickel a year, and is working to expand resources at its Tati
Nickel project in Botswana, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
