Cold weather may come to the U.S.
Northeast including  New York  next week, boosting demand for
natural gas and heating oil to warm homes and businesses,
forecasts show.  Temperatures may fall from 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3
to 5.6 Celsius) below normal in the New York area to as much as
18 degrees below normal in northern Maine, according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  “The big story this morning is the strengthening of this
weekend’s Northeast cold push and the longer duration into early
next week,” said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy
demand for heating and cooling. Natural gas for March delivery
rose 1.7 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.567 per million British
thermal units at 7:06 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier, futures touched $2.611, the most since Jan. 31.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The cold will be enough to push energy demand for heating
in the Northeast and from Ohio Valley to Midwest to normal
levels, Salmon said.  High temperatures in New York will be in the 40s through
much of this week and fall to the 30s by the weekend, according
to the  National Weather Service .  Milder Outlook  Milder air will return to the region late next week after
the cold weather retreats, Rogers predicted.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers said the East Coast
may have average temperatures of about 3 degrees above normal
from Feb. 17 to Feb. 21. Also in that timeframe, average
temperatures in the western U.S. will fall to about 5 degrees
below normal.  The normal average temperature in New York on Feb. 7 is 34
degrees, according to MDA EarthSat in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . It
is about 30 in  Boston ; 35 in Philadelphia; 46 in Atlanta; 26 in
Chicago; 49 in Dallas; 43 in Seattle; and 55 in Burbank,
 California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
