Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open between 0.06 percent and
0.1 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.07 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.11 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.11 percent.  The central bank will sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion of
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from July 2012
to January 2015. The sale is part of the Fed’s program to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs
further and counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
