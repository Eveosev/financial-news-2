China ’s decision to reduce dividend
payouts from three of its four largest banks will help avoid
“massive” capital raising by lenders this year, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  “The more they retain, the less need they will have to go
out to the market,” Christine Kuo, a senior credit officer for
financial institutions at the ratings company, told reporters in
 Hong Kong  today. “We should see that as a more efficient way to
address their capital needs.”  China’s five biggest banks have raised about $120 billion
from equity and bond sales over the past three years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, while paying out as much as half
of their profits rather than retaining earnings as capital.  Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the state-backed
shareholder in China’s biggest banks, said Feb. 3 that the
lenders will lower their dividend payouts to shore up capital.  Dividends will be cut by 5 percentage points to 35 percent
of 2011 profit at  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. ,
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , Huijin
said in a  statement  on its website. The ratio for  Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  will be unchanged at 35 percent, the holding
company said.  ICBC, Construction Bank and  Bank of China  paid out about 40
percent of their 2010 profits as dividends, compared with 44
percent in 2009 and about 50 percent in 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
