Libya  produced 1.36 million barrels a
day of crude on Feb. 4, up from a daily average of 1.12 million
barrels in January, the state-run National Oil Corp. said.  The country pumped a combined 1.42 million barrels of crude
plus condensate on that day, up from an average of 1.18 million
barrels a day in January, the NOC said in  releases posted on its
website . The holder of the largest oil reserves in  Africa  has
the capacity to produce 1.79 million barrels, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It also produced 2.01 billion cubic feet
of natural gas.  Libya is restoring crude production after most output was
stopped during fighting last year that led to the ouster of
 Muammar Qaddafi  in October.  The nation will return its crude production to pre-conflict
levels in the third quarter and is seeking to raise output to 2
million barrels a day in three to five years, Oil Minister
Abdul-Rahman Ben Yezza said Dec. 14 in Vienna while attending a
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Libya exported 32.29 million barrels of crude in January,
the NOC said. Its Zawiya, Sarir and Tobruk refineries consumed
4.35 million barrels last month or about 140,000 barrels a day.
The countryâ€™s five plants have processing capacities totaling
400,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
