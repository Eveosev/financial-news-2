A measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend to one another fell to the lowest in more
than four months as European policy makers pump funds into the
economy, money markets show.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, dropped to 74
basis points at 11:40 a.m. in  London , the lowest since Oct. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 76
yesterday.  Borrowing costs have been driven lower after the  European
Central Bank  gave financial firms a record 489 billion euros
($639 billion) of three-year loans in its so-called longer-term
refinancing operation in December. The Frankfurt-based ECB holds
a second auction of cheap funding on Feb. 28.  “There’s an expectation that the Euribor-OIS will continue
to grind in a bit,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho
Securities Ltd. in London. “It reflects the easing of tensions
in financial markets and comes back to the much-improved funding
position of European banks following the ECB’s provision of
long-term funds.”  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 70 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate in London, from
minus 73 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The cost
dropped to 69 below Euribor last week, the lowest since Aug. 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at minus 60
basis points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank, placing 503 billion euros with the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday from 511 billion euros on Feb. 3.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 1.086 percent, from 1.094 percent.
One-week Euribor dropped to 0.382 percent from 0.384 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
