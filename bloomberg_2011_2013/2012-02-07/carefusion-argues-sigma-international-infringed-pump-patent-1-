CareFusion Corp . asked a jury to find
that Sigma International General Medical Apparatus LLC infringed
one of its patents used in intravenous infusion pumps and owes
as much as $171 million in damages.  An attorney for CareFusion said in his closing argument
today in federal court in  San Diego  that the Sigma Spectrum pump
uses technology that infringes CareFusion’s U.S. Patent
6,347,553. CareFusion seeks compensation including lost profits
on the sales of its competing infusion pumps, lost sales of
related products and services and a royalty on the remaining
sales of the Sigma Spectrum pumps, according to court filings.  “The damages must be adequate to compensate CareFusion for
this infringement,” CareFusion attorney John Allcock told
jurors. “We are asking you to put CareFusion in the same
financial condition had this patent not been infringed.”  Sigma has denied infringing the patent and disputed
testimony by CareFusion’s financial expert witness on damages.
Sigma’s financial expert testified that if the jury decides the
patent was infringed, damages should be no more than $859,590.  Sigma’s attorney, Michael Bettinger, said in his closing
today that CareFusion is fighting over a patent it doesn’t use
in an attempt to increase the company’s market share of infusion
pumps.  ‘Strategic Purposes’  “This patent is being used for strategic purposes,”
Bettinger said. “They don’t use the technology.”  The ‘553 patent relates to a force-sensor assembly for
infusion pumps used in the health-care industry, according to
court filings. Both companies manufacture and sell infusion
pumps, which control the amount and rate of the flow of fluid
and drugs administered to a patient through intravenous tubes.  CareFusion, based in San Diego, also contends that Medina,
New York-based Sigma has induced others to infringe the patent.
Sigma denies that claim as well, according to court filings.  U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw is presiding over the
trial. Jury deliberations are scheduled to begin tomorrow.  The case is CareFusion 303 Inc. v. Sigma International,
3:10-cv-0442, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 California  (San Diego).  To contact the reporter on this story:
