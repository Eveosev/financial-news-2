Portugal  may have to follow  Greece 
and impose losses on sovereign bondholders as the debt burden in
some euro-area nations is “simply unmanageable,” according to
F&C Asset Management Plc  “The market clearly is concerned about private-sector
involvement in terms of Portugal,” Paul Niven, head of multi-
asset investments at F&C, where he manages 20 billion pounds
($32 billion) directly, said at an event in Lisbon today. “The
market doesn’t believe that Portugal can either cut or grow its
way out of its problems. I think they are probably right.”  Greece’s government is embroiled in a political battle over
new budget cuts that creditors are demanding in return for a
second bailout involving bondholder losses. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  is trying to secure a deal to avoid defaulting on a
14.5 billion-euro ($19 billion) bond payment due March 20.  Even if a deal is agreed in Greece, “we are going to be
revisiting these issues on an ongoing basis because growth in
the periphery is not there,” Niven said. “So the debt burden,
unless there is much more significant writedowns of debt, the
burden is simply unmanageable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
