Coca-Cola Co. , the world’s largest
soft-drink maker, will see its spending on commodities increase
this year because of higher costs for sweeteners and juices,
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said.  Costs will increase between $350 million and $450 million,
compared with a rise of $800 million in 2011, when the Atlanta-
based company spent more on sweeteners, juices, metals and
plastics, Fayard said today during an earnings conference call
with analysts and investors.  Coca-Cola makes Minute Maid and Simply Orange juices.
Before today, orange-juice futures were up 17 percent in the
past year, reaching a record $2.2695 a pound on Jan. 26 on ICE
Futures in New York. While raw-sugar futures are down 25 percent
from a year ago, last year’s average of 26.73 cents a pound was
the highest since  1980 and more than double the average of
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
