Exchange All-Share Index  slid 0.4 percent to 20,792.75 at the

Africa, excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Kakuzi Ltd.  (KKZI KN), a Kenyan tea and fruit producer,
advanced 4.2 percent to 75 shillings, the highest level since
Nov. 16, after announcing Del Monte Kenya Ltd. withdrew a 109
million-shilling ($1.3 million) repayment claim against the
company.  Kenya Airways Ltd.  (KNAL KN), sub-Saharan  Africa ’s third-
biggest airline by passenger numbers, fell for a second day,
dropping 1.3 percent to 18.65 shillings, the lowest level since
Dec. 6, before a planned rights offer.  “It appears people think a rights issue is going to be
dilutive and are reducing their positions ahead of the
announcement and maybe buy back when they know the level of
dilution,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
