The ruble appreciated for a fourth
day against the dollar as Urals crude topped $117 a barrel,
bolstering the outlook for the currency of the world’s biggest
energy exporter.  The Russian currency added 1 percent to 29.8250 by the
close in Moscow, its strongest since Oct. 28. The ruble was
little changed at 39.3450 per euro and strengthened 0.5 percent
to 34.1090 versus the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Urals,  Russia ’s main export blend, headed for its strongest
closing price since May, adding 1.4 percent to $117.86 a barrel
and outweighing investor concern Europe’s debt crisis will drag
on, hurting growth in Russia’s biggest trade partner. Greek
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  plans to discuss the
implementation of additional fiscal measures needed to secure a
second European Union-led bailout with the nation’s political
leaders today.  “It’s mainly driven by the oil price,” Carolin Hecht, a
Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank AG, said by e-mail.
“If you look at how the oil price developed in recent days, you
would actually have expected the ruble to appreciate a lot more
than it has, so it’s most likely the central bank that is
keeping its appreciation in check.”  Urals has gained 6.5 percent over the past week as a cold
snap in  Europe  drove fuel demand, while the ruble has
strengthened 1.7 percent against the basket over the same
period. Bank Rossii buys and sells international currencies to
manage the ruble within a floating corridor against the basket.  Keep Intervening  A level between 34.70 and 33.87 against the basket at the
corridor’s current level indicates the regulator is buying $50
million to $150 million a day to slow the ruble’s appreciation,
according to VTB Capital’s estimates.  “The central bank will keep intervening, and the ruble
will have a hard time breaching the 34 mark” against the
basket, Commerzbank’s Hecht said.  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 30.21 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 30.4085
yesterday. Russia’s 2020 dollar bonds rose, pushing the yield
down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.277
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
