South African gold and foreign-
currency reserves rose the most in almost two years in January
after the government sold bonds abroad.  Gross reserves  gained 5.3 percent to $51.5 billion from the
previous month, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its
 website  today. Net reserves increased to $49 billion from $47.9
billion in December.  South Africa  sold $1.5 billion of 12-year bonds on Jan. 9
to repay maturing debt and for general purposes, according to a
statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. That’s helping to bolster reserves, underpinning the
rand’s strength after the currency gained 6.5 percent against
the dollar this year.  “The improvement in South Africa’s reserves should be of
benefit to the currency over the longer term as a stronger
reserves position should help to reduce the currency’s
volatility,” Nomvuyo Guma, a currency strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in a e-mailed note to
clients today.  The rand was at 7.5776 against the dollar as of 8:48 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 7.5688 before the data was released.  Reserves were also boosted last month by a weaker dollar
and higher gold price, the central bank said. The dollar dropped
against all 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg last month,
driving the value of the bank’s holdings of euro, yen and other
foreign currencies higher.  Gold reserves, which account for about 14 percent of gross
holdings at the central bank, rose $719 million to $6.991
billion, the bank said. The price of gold climbed 11 percent to
as high as $1,739.07 an ounce.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts
was for gross reserves to increase to $49.94 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
