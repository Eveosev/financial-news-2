President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
campaign said it will return donations from the American family
of fugitive Juan Jose Rojas Cardona, a casino owner in Mexico
who the New York Times said skipped bail in the U.S. in 1994 and
is suspected by the State Department of arranging an
assassination in Mexico.  “More than 1.3 million Americans have donated to the
campaign and we constantly review those contributions for any
issues,”  Ben LaBolt , press secretary for Obama for America,
said today in a statement. “On the basis of the questions that
have been raised, we will return the contributions from these
individuals and from any other donors they brought to the
campaign.”  Juan Rojas Cardona’s brothers, Carlos Rojas Cardona and
Alberto Rojas Cardona, each gave $30,800 to the  Democratic
National Committee , the maximum allowed under federal law,
according to campaign filings. In total, they bundled donations
of about $200,000 for Obama’s re-election effort, mostly from
other family members.  The New York Times, which first reported the returned
contributions, said Juan Rojas Cardona, also known as Pepe, had
been charged with fraud in Iowa and drug-smuggling in New
Mexico. He disappeared while on bail in 1994 and later surfaced
in Mexico, the newspaper said. A State Department cable in 2009
said he was suspected of orchestrating a business rival’s
killing, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
