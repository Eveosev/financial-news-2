Burundi’s franc weakened this year as
a result of a shortage of foreign currency caused by reduced
flows from donors and increased trade on the black market,
central bank Governor Gaspard Sindayigaya said.  The currency of the East African nation fell to 1,410
today, Sindayigaya said in a speech at a conference today in
Bujumbura, the capital. The franc traded at 1,361.50 on Dec. 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Donors have decreased their help to the country,” he
said. Sindayigaya said in an interview last month that East
Africans living abroad are sending less money back to their home
countries as the crisis in the euro region slows global growth.  Burundi, a coffee and tea-exporter, is the third-least
developed nation on the United Nations’ Human Development Index,
which measures indicators including education and income, behind
Niger and the  Democratic Republic  of Congo. Economic growth is
expected to accelerate to 4.8 percent this year from an
estimated 4.2 percent last year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  The central bank has put unspecified strategies in place to
prevent the franc weakening further, Sindayigaya said, without
providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
