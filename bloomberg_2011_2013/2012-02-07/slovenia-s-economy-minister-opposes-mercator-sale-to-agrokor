Radovan Zerjav, Slovenia’s candidate
for the post of Economy Minister in the new government, opposes
the sale of store chain  Mercator Poslovni Sistem  d.d. to its
Croatian rival Agrokor d.d., Finance newspaper  reported , citing
Zerjav.  “We want such an important company to remain in Slovenian
hands,” Zerjav was quoted  as saying today as he presented his
program to a parliamentary committee in the capital Ljubljana.
“The state has to be interested in such matters because the
sale of Mercator could have a big impact on our  food industry .”  The sale of Mercator by a group of Slovenian banks and
investors to the Zagreb-based Agrokor was postponed in December
due to increased opposition from Slovenian officials and the
Mercator management. Agrokor offered 221 euros ($292) per share
for the majority of the Slovenian retailer and said it’s offer
is valid until the end of the month.  Lawmakers are set to vote on the new Cabinet led by Janez
Jansa on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
