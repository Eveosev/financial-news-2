Italian and Spanish bonds fell as
Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  prepared to meet the
nation’s political leaders today to discuss additional austerity
needed to get a second European Union-led bailout.  Italy’s two-year yields climbed from near an eight-month 
low  as European stocks slid, sapping demand for the region’s
assets. Leaders of the three political parties supporting
Papademos’s government will meet the premier today in  Athens  to
debate the budget cuts required by the nation’s creditors.
 Germany ’s bonds declined, snapping a gain from yesterday. The
Netherlands sold 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of 10-year debt.  “The main driver behind the cautious sentiment was again
the lack of progress in  Greece  concerning both the private
sector involvement negotiation and the second bailout package,”
Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in
Dusseldorf, wrote in an e-mailed note.  The Italian two-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.03 percent at 2:23 p.m. London time after
falling to 2.90 percent on Feb. 3, the lowest since June 8. The
2.25 percent note due November 2013 dropped 0.95, or 95 euro
cents per 1,000-euro ($1,318) face amount, to 98.74.  Spain ’s
two-year yield climbed five basis points to 2.62 percent.  Greek politicians are seeking to obtain a 130 billion-euro
rescue from the European Union and a deal with private creditors
to prevent an economic collapse as early as next month. While
they already agreed to make further cuts this year equal to 1.5
percent of gross domestic product, they have yet to close gaps
over measures demanded by creditors.  ‘Sluggish Pace’  “The Greek negotiations are continuing at a sluggish pace,
with still no agreement in sight,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “This is causing a bit of nervousness in risk
markets.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds widened one basis point to 3.75
percentage points. The spread between Spanish and German 10-year
yields increased four basis points to 3.17 percentage points.  Germany’s 10-year bond yield rose four basis points to 1.93
percent, after earlier falling to 1.86 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares dropped for a second
day, losing 0.6 percent.  Greece sold 812.5 million euros of 26-week bills today at a
yield of 4.86 percent, according to the Public Debt Management
Agency in Athens. The compares with a yield of 4.90 percent at
the previous auction on Jan. 10. Investors bid for 2.72 times
the securities sold, from 2.80 times last month.  The Netherlands auctioned 2.25 percent bonds due in July
2022 at an average yield of 2.359 percent, the State Treasury
Agency said. The nation’s 10-year yield increased five basis
points to 2.26 percent.  Germany’s bonds have gained 12 percent in the past year as
the European debt crisis worsened, according to indexes compiled
by the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. Spanish debt returned 6.8 percent, and Greek
securities tumbled 65 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
