Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. , the seller of life insurance and property-casualty
coverage, reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates and said commercial pricing improved. Shares gained
1.7 percent in late trading.  Profit, excluding some investment results, was 69 cents a
share, according to a statement today from Hartford. That beat
the 60-cent estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee , 57, is  cutting jobs  and
buying back stock to boost returns for shareholders. Hartford,
which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name and
counts  John Paulson ’s hedge fund as its largest shareholder, is
getting higher rates from businesses that buy the company’s
property-and-casualty coverage, McGee said in the statement.  “P&C Commercial pricing continued to firm, and margins
improved across the board,” McGee said.  Hartford’s book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose to $47.25 a share from $46.72 at the end of
September. The insurer advanced to $19.45 at 5:16 p.m. in New
York. The company has gained 18 percent since Dec. 31 after
falling 39 percent last year. Results were released after
regular trading today.  Net income  declined to $127 million, or 24 cents a share,
from $619 million, or $1.24, a year earlier after the company
underestimated claims costs in its workers’ compensation
business. The reserves against losses in that business
“continue to be problematic,”  Jay Gelb , an analyst with
Barclays Plc, said last month in a research report.  Capital Losses  Net realized capital losses widened to $386 million from
$89 million in the same period a year earlier. Net investment
income slipped 8.4 percent to $998 million on results from
limited partnerships and alternative assets, a group of holdings
that typically refers to private equity and hedge funds.  Hartford added to reserves by $57 million on 2011 policies
and $64 million on contracts from prior years. In December, the
company projected the fourth-quarter addition would be $75
million to $80 million on policies sold in 2011 and $60 million
to $65 million on contracts from prior years.  Annual profit fell 61 percent to $662 million in 2011 on
costs from natural disasters, including  Hurricane Irene , and
asbestos liabilities.  Paulson’s fund held a stake of more than 8 percent as of
Sept. 30, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Allianz SE,
 Germany ’s biggest insurer, has a stake of more than 5 percent
after injecting capital into Hartford at the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008.  Bailout Repaid  McGee, hired in 2009 after a career at Bank of America
Corp.,  sold stock  and debt in 2010 to repay Hartford’s $3.4
billion government rescue. The insurer, which posted losses of
more than $4 billion in the five quarters prior to McGee’s
arrival, reported net income of $535 million in the nine months
ended Sept. 30. Hartford may repurchase $500 million of shares,
the company said in August.  Hartford sells savings products and life insurance policies
that compete with the offerings of firms like MetLife Inc. and
Prudential Financial Inc. Hartford’s rivals in the property-
casualty market include Travelers Cos. and Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.’s car-insurance unit Geico Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
