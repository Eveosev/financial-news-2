Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s
biggest lender, said fourth-quarter profit rose 10 percent as
job cuts helped curtail expenses.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
advanced to 3.75 billion reais ($2.17 billion), or 83 centavos a
share, from 3.4 billion reais, or 75 centavos, a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. That
matched the  average  estimate for adjusted profit in a Bloomberg
survey of eight analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal cut personnel
expenses 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous
three-month period as total employees declined by 1,427 to
104,542. Loans expanded 19 percent from the fourth quarter of
2010 to 397 billion reais, compared with 23 percent growth in
the third quarter and 21 percent a year earlier.  “Itau’s efficiency-improvement initiatives are likely to
provide it with greater capabilities to support return on
equity,” Roberto Attuch and Fabio Zagatti, analysts at Barclays
Plc in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a research note today. “Itau did
manage to tightly control expenses throughout 2011.”  Itau said it’s offering as much as 11.8 billion reais to
buy out the minority shareholders of Redecard SA, Brazil’s
second biggest card-payment processor, less than five years
after Redecard and its shareholders, including Itau, raised 4.07
billion reais in an initial public offering.  Default rate  The average default rate for payments at least 90 days
overdue climbed to 4.9 percent at the end of December from 4.7
percent in the third quarter and 4.2 percent a year earlier,
Itau said. Total assets increased 13 percent to 851.3 billion
reais, the company said.  Itau’s default rate may rise to 5 percent by mid-year
before declining, Setubal told reporters today in Sao Paulo.
Interest-rate cuts will accelerate  Brazil ’s economic growth this
year, helping to reduce defaults, he said.  Brazil’s  economy  expanded at the fastest pace in 19 months
in November. The central bank said this month its adjusted
economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product,
rose 1.15 percent in November from October, reversing a three-
month contraction. The central bank reduced its benchmark rate
to 10.5 percent from 12.5 percent in July.  Itau Unibanco rose almost 1 percent to 36.40 reais in Sao
Paulo trading today, matching the gain for the benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
