The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, reversing an
earlier decline, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed one basis point to 322 basis points at 11:30
a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 5.5
basis points to 556.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings rose 1.25 basis points to 129.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased two basis points to 195 and the
subordinated index was one higher at 337.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
