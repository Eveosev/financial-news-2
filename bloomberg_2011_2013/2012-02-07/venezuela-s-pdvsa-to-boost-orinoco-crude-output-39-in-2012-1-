Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the state
oil company, plans to boost oil production in the heavy crude
fields of the Orinoco belt by 39 percent in 2012 to 1.6 million
barrels a day, company president  Rafael Ramirez  said today.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, will invest
$236 million through 2018 on infrastructure needed to develop
the heavy crude reserves, Ramirez said today in eastern
 Venezuela , according to an e-mailed statement.  “We currently produce 1.15 million barrels a day in the
Orinoco belt, and this year we will reach 1.6 million barrels a
day with an intensive drilling campaign,” Ramirez said in the
statement.  PDVSA is expanding limited infrastructure in the region,
one of the largest oil reserves in the world, so that the
company can meet its production goals, said Ramirez, who also
serves as the country’s oil minister. PDVSA will add 12,000
workers this year to areas where production increases are
planned and will expand its workforce by 100,000 people over the
next six years, the minister said.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said in December that the
South American country would increase its total production to
3.5 million barrels a day from current daily levels of 3 million
barrels. Venezuela produced 2.37 million barrels a day in
December, oil cartel OPEC said in its January  Oil Market Report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
