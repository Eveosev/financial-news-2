Intercontinental Exchange Inc. said
93,400 metric tons of low-sulfur gasoil were delivered for the
first time against its new futures contract in January.  Low-sulfur gasoil futures, which began trading on Sept. 19,
had an average daily volume of 451 contracts last month and open
interest was at 5,178 as of yesterday, the bourse said in an e-
mailed statement.  The amount of gasoil delivered against the higher-sulfur
contract, which is the benchmark for heating oil, diesel and jet
fuel in  Europe , was 167,000 tons last month. That contract is
the worldâ€™s largest for a refined product with 65.8 million lots
traded last year, according to ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
