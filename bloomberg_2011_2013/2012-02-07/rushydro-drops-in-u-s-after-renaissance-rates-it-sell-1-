OAO RusHydro  slipped to the lowest
level this month in U.S. trading after  Renaissance Capital  rated
the stock a “sell” in new coverage.  American depositary receipts of  Russia ’s largest hydropower
producer dropped 0.5 percent to $3.88 in New York, the lowest
level since Jan. 31, based on closing prices.  Moscow-based brokerage Renaissance set a  3.1 U.S.-cent
target price for Moscow-traded shares of RusHydro, according to
a report by analysts including Derek Weaving in  London  and
Vladimir Sklyar in the Russian capital e-mailed today. The  stock 
fell 1.3 percent on Russia’s Micex Index to 1.16 rubles, or 3.9
cents.  The report cited “bleak prospect for minority
shareholders,” adding that the company sells it output at
“below-market” prices. Rushydro’s expansion plans “seem to
lack rigorous financial justification,” the analysts wrote.  IFC Metropol cut the “fair value” price for RusHydro to 5
cents by the end of 2012, from 7.9 cents, on speculation Russian
electricity prices will rise less than earlier forecast, Moscow-
based analyst Konstantin Reyli wrote in the report e-mailed
yesterday. Metropol reiterated its “buy” recommendation on
RusHydro’s Micex stock.  RusHydro approved plans in October 2010 to invest 103.6
billion rubles ($3.47 billion) for technical upgrades of its
existing power plants and construction of new projects
throughout the country in 2012.  Investment is expected to total 95.6 billion rubles in
2013, according to a  program  posted on the company’s website.
RusHydro plans to borrow 40.3 billion rubles to finance part of
its investment plan in 2012, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
