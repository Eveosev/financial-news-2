Romania’s central bank warned local
commercial banks to avoid paying  interest rates  that are too
high as they battle to attract deposits to make up for dwindling
support from their parent institutions abroad.  Interest rates of about 7 percent for lei deposits and
about 4 percent for euro deposits “are a mistake’’ and
contradict the path of the monetary policy, central bank
Governor Mugur Isarescu said in a speech in Bucharest today.  “As a supervisory board, you start to think about where
will they place this money,’’ Isarescu said. “We told banks
that the deposit fight they were planning to start at the
beginning of the year is wrong and they need to place their
money intelligently.’’  Isarescu said he expects significant changes in bank
balance sheets starting this year as the focus shifts to
attracting local resources instead of funding from their
parents. Some banks may also reduce lending because of a lack of
resources, Isarescu said, adding that the bank is taking
measures to lower borrowing costs, “which are still too high.’’  Erste Group Bank AG, BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA,
Raiffeisen Bank International AG and UniCredit SpA have units in
 Romania . Banca Transilvania  SA and state-owned CEC are major
domestic banks. Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG kept its
Romanian unit when it agreed to sell most of its eastern
European business to OAO Sberbank in September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
