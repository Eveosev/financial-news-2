Satcon Technology Corp.  rose the most
in almost two decades after agreeing to a manufacturing
partnership to supply solar-plant equipment to a unit of  China 
Electronics Corp.  Satcon climbed 51 percent to 85 cents at the close in New
York, the biggest gain for the Boston-based company since Nov.
13, 1992.  China Electronics’ Great Wall Computer Co. agreed to an
initial purchase of 60 megawatts of Satcon inverters by April,
Satcon said today in a statement. Satcon’s contract manufacturer
in China, Exelstor, will also work with Great Wall to target
cost reductions for the product.  Last month, Satcon said it would cut 140 jobs, or about 35
percent of its workforce, and close a factory in  Canada  that
makes power inverters for solar plants. Inverters convert
electricity from solar cells for use on electric grids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
