Caterpillar Japan Ltd. , a unit of the
worldâ€™s biggest construction-equipment maker, said it plans to
produce a record number of excavators this year as the nation
rebuilds infrastructure following its worst earthquake.  The venture between Peoria, Illinois-based  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  may boost production by 20
percent at its Akashi plant in western  Japan , spokesman Mutsumi
Miyanaga said today by telephone. Output at the Sagamihara plant
near Tokyo that produces bulldozers and wheel-loaders will
probably increase by 15 percent, he said, without giving actual
production figures.  Caterpillar and rivals  Komatsu Ltd.  and Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. are boosting production in Japan to
help rebuild areas devastated by the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami. Construction machinery makers increased sales by 32
percent in the October-to-December quarter, according to a Jan.
31 presentation by Tokyo-based Komatsu. Sales from  Southeast
Asia  gained 25 percent in the period, it said.  Caterpillar Japan will reconfigure three production lines
at the Akashi plant to increase monthly excavator capacity to
2,000 units from 1,500 units, the Nikkei newspaper reported
today, without saying where it obtained the information.  In 2008, Caterpillar took control of the Japanese venture,
which was founded in November 1963. Caterpillar Japan has 5,630
group employees, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
