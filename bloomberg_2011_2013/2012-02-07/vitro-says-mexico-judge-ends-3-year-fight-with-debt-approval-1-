Mexican glassmaker  Vitro SAB  said a
judge in Monterrey gave final approval to restructure $1.5
billion of defaulted debt over the objections of U.S. creditors.  The approval by Judge Sandra Lopez concludes a three-year
legal battle in  Mexico  that began when the nation’s largest
glassmaker defaulted on debt, including $1.2 billion of U.S.
bonds. Lopez let $1.9 billion of intercompany loans that Vitro
created after the default be included in the vote, which ended
up 74 percent in favor of the refinancing plan.  U.S. noteholders, including Elliott Management Corp.,
opposed the plan in Mexican and U.S. courts, arguing that the
inclusion of intercompany debt let Vitro dictate restructuring
terms. Vitro failed to make its debt payments in February 2009
after construction and auto glass sales plunged during the
U.S.’s worst recession since the 1930s. The San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico-based company also incurred $340 million of
derivative losses in bad bets on natural gas and currencies.  The refinancing plan, which was presented by a court-
appointed arbitrator and based on Vitro’s proposal, swaps the
defaulted debt for $814.6 million of new bonds maturing in 2019
with an interest rate of 8 percent and $95.8 million of debt
convertible to shares with an interest rate of 12 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
