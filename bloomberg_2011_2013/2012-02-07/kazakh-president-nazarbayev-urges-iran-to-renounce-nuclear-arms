Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev 
urged the Iranian regime to follow his country’s lead and swear
off nuclear arms.  “I call on the Iranian leadership once again to follow the
Kazakh example,” Nazarbayev said in a speech today in Berlin.
He said he’d discussed the issue with Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with whom he has “close” relations.  The Kazakh leader said he told Ahmadinejad that peaceful
nuclear research could draw in new investors and technology. He
urged the conflicting parties over Iran’s program to resolve
differences through talks. “That would be the right step,” he
said. Kazakhstan renounced its nuclear program in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
