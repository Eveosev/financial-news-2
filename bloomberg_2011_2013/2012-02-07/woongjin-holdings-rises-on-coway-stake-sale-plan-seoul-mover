Woongjin Holdings Co.  jumped to a
three-month high in Seoul trading after saying it’s considering
selling its stake in  South Korea ’s biggest maker of water
purifiers to raise funds to support its solar business.  Woongjin, the holding company for the unlisted Woongjin
Group,  rallied  15 percent to 7,250 won at the close on the Korea
Exchange, rising by the daily limit for a second day while the
benchmark Kospi index added 0.4 percent. The stock closed at the
highest level since Oct. 27.  The potential sale of the 28.4 percent  stake  in water
purifier maker  Woongjin Coway Co.  would be used to foster growth
in polysilicon making for solar cells and to strengthen finances
across the group, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The holding is valued at 831 billion won ($743
million), based on today’s closing price on the Korea Exchange.  “The stake sale appears to be aimed at repaying debts and
supporting other group units,” Lee Hoon, an analyst with Korea
Investment & Securities Co., wrote in a report today. “The sale
of the Coway stake is a very aggressive attempt to restructure
its business portfolio.”  Shares of Woongjin Holdings have fallen 32 percent in the
past year, compared with a 4.8 percent drop in the Kospi index.
Woongjin Coway shares fell 4.8 percent today to 38,000 won in
 Seoul .  The Woongjin Group has businesses ranging from chemicals
and polysilicon manufacturing to publishing and finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
