Gabon will reduce the exports of Rabi
Light crude for March to two cargoes from three this month, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Two shipments of 650,000 barrels each will be exported next
month, according to the plan.  Rabi Light has a density of 35.1 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 0.11 percent,
according to Total SA, the operator of the field. It is of
similar quality to Nigerian benchmark  Qua Iboe  crude.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
