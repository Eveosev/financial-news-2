Singapore ’s commercial crimes rose
last year as victims fell prey to lottery and Internet love
scams, more counterfeit products were sold and failures to
deliver on goods and services increased.  Commercial crimes climbed 2 percent to 3,879, the Singapore
police force said in a statement today. The overall number of
crimes declined 5.3 percent to 31,404, the police said.  Robbery, housebreaking and murder cases dropped, helping
Singapore cut its overall crime rate to the lowest in 20 years
even as commercial scams rose, according to the police. The
nation has one of the world’s  lowest crime rates , according to a
2010 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes.  People who received phone calls of false lottery wins were
cheated of S$6.4 million ($5.1 million), a 68 percent increase
from 2010, according to the statement. Those who were befriended
on the Internet were conned out of S$2.3 million, more than
doubling from S$824,000 a year earlier.  Crimes within the city’s two casino resorts, opened in the
first half of 2010, rose 12 percent to 520 cases last year,
Hoong Wee Teck, senior assistant police commissioner, said at a
briefing in Singapore today.  Convictions for money-laundering climbed to 25 last year
from 18 in 2010, Ng Guat Ting, director of public affairs, said
at the briefing.  Singapore will consider a “tougher penalty regime” and
boost enforcement against money-laundering and terrorist
financing, the central bank said in October. The city-state will
also tighten laws on  tax evasion , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
