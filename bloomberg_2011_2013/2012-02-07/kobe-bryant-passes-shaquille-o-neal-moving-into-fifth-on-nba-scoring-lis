Kobe Bryant  passed former teammate
and frequent rival  Shaquille O’Neal  to move into fifth place on
the  National Basketball Association ’s career scoring list.  Bryant, 33, reached the milestone in his hometown of
Philadelphia, scoring 28 points in the  Los Angeles Lakers ’ 95-90
loss to the  Philadelphia 76ers . Bryant entered last night’s game
23 points shy of O’Neal’s career total of 28,596  and scored 24
of the Lakers’ first 40 points to pass him on the scoring list
with 5:07 left in the first half.  “To say it’s an honor is an understatement,” Bryant told
reporters after the game. “It’s a lot of basketball. I’ve been
very, very fortunate to have such a good career.”  Bryant had four points in the second half, pushing his
total to 28,601 points over 16 NBA seasons, all with the Lakers.
He hit 8 of 14 shots in the first half, and missed 10 of 12
after halftime as the Lakers were outscored 49-40.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  is the league’s scoring leader with
38,387 points, followed by Karl Malone (36,928),  Michael Jordan 
(32,292) and Wilt Chamberlain (31,419).  O’Neal congratulated Bryant in a  Twitter post , calling him
the “greatest Laker ever” and thanking him for making them the
franchise’s greatest one-two punch.  Bryant and O’Neal had a sometimes acrimonious yet
successful stint as teammates, winning three straight NBA
championships in Los Angeles from 2000-2002. Often bickering
publicly about who should be the team’s offensive catalyst,
O’Neal demanded a trade in 2004 after the Lakers said their
offseason priority was to re-sign Bryant.  ‘Bit More Significant’  O’Neal, who retired last June after 19 seasons, was sent to
the  Miami Heat , with whom he won a fourth title in 2006. Bryant
eventually topped O’Neal by winning championships with the
Lakers in 2009 and 2010.  “Because of our history, all the playoff battles we’ve
been in and the duo we were able to form, it does make it a
little bit more significant,” Bryant said of the milestone.  With the Lakers at 14-11 and in second place in the Pacific
Division behind the  Los Angeles  Clippers, Bryant has taken on a
bigger scoring role this season than in the recent past. He
leads the NBA with a 29.4 point-per-game average, which would be
his best output since winning the scoring title with a 31.6
average for the 2006-07 season. He also led the league the
previous season at 35.4 points per game, and for his career he’s
averaged 25.4 points per contest.  Bryant was sent to the Lakers in a draft-day trade after
being selected 13th by the Charlotte Hornets out of Lower Merion
High School in the suburbs of Philadelphia.  Abdul-Jabbar’s Record  A 13-time All-Star who was selected as the NBA’s Most
Valuable Player for the 2007-08 season, Bryant entered this
campaign with 27,868 points, averaging 1,858 per campaign. If he
continues at that rate, he’d pass Abdul-Jabbar as a 38-year-old
late in the 2016-17 season.  The NBA’s  career scoring list  does not include points from
the now-defunct American Basketball Association. If ABA points
were counted, Julius Erving (30,026) and Moses Malone (29,580)
still would be ahead of Bryant, according to Basketball-
Reference.com.  Kevin Garnett  of the  Boston Celtics , ranked 19th on the
career list with 23,637 points, has the next highest total to
Bryant among active NBA players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
