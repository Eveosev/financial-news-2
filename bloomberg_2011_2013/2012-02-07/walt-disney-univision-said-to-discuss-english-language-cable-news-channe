Walt Disney Co ., owner of the ABC
broadcast network, is in talks with  Univision Communications
Inc . to create an English-language 24-hour cable-news channel,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  Disney, based in  Burbank ,  California , would oversee
advertising sales and distribution for the venture, said the
people, who sought anonymity because an agreement hasn’t been
reached. The channel would draw newsgathering resources from ABC
News and Univision, the largest U.S. Spanish-language
broadcaster, they said.  The discussions have been under way for at least six months
and are ongoing, said the people. The channel would be based in
Miami and start service before the November presidential
election, they said.  A venture would provide Disney, which reports first-quarter
results today after markets close, with a cable-news presence,
and advance Univision Chief Executive Officer Randy Falco’s goal
of building new channels. Falco is interested in starting
English-language service in sports and news, he told the Wall
Street Journal in October.  Closely held Univision, based in  New York , is starting a
Spanish-language telenovela network this month on  Dish Network
Corp .’s satellite-TV system. Spanish-language sports and news
channels will follow by midyear, according to Monica Talan, a
spokeswoman.  Disney added 1.2 percent to $40.46 yesterday in New York
and has gained 7.9 percent this year.  The Journal reported Univision’s discussions with Disney
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
