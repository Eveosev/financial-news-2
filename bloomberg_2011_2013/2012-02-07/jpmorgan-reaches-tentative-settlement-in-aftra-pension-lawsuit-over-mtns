JPMorgan Chase & Co.  reached an
“agreement in principal” to settle a class action suit
claiming losses from the bank’s securities lending program.  The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represented a class of all investors in a group of structured
debt securities. The settlement was to be announced on the
plaintiffs’ website, according to a statement provided today by
Stephanie Cirkovich, a spokeswoman for the federal court in
 Manhattan .  “The parties are drafting a formal settlement agreement,
to be submitted to the court for approval within approximately
three weeks,” according to the statement. “The settlement
terms will remain confidential until the agreement is submitted
to the court. The settlement is subject to the court’s approval
and to certain other conditions.”  The funds claim they lost money that New York-based
JPMorgan invested for them in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008.  The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees’ Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the Manhattan and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System.  John Johmann, a JPMorgan Chase spokesman, didn’t return a
message seeking comment on the announced settlement.  The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
