Poland ’s central bank raising
 interest rates  would be an “emergency tool,” while the chance
of rate cuts this year is decreasing,  Nordea Bank AB  said.  Statements by central bankers including Andrzej Kazmierczak,  Adam Glapinski  and Jerzy Hausner suggesting the
chance of raising borrowing costs reflect their focus on
inflation, while a strengthening zloty will probably help
moderate price increases, Piotr Bujak, Nordea’s chief economist
for Poland, wrote in a research note today.  “A rate hike in Poland could be considered only as an
emergency tool -- in case the euro-area debt crisis gets out of
control,” Bujak wrote. “The real choice in Poland is between
keeping rates on hold and rates reduction.” The “stronger than
expected resilience of the Polish economy to the crisis abroad
implies a lower probability of rate cuts this year.”  All 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg  expect  the
benchmark seven-day interest rate to remain unchanged at 4.5
percent for an eighth month tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
