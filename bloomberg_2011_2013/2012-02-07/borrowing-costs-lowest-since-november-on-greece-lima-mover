Peru ’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars fell to their lowest since November as Greece made
progress on measures to secure international aid, fueling demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 200 at 3:33 p.m. in Lima, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the narrowest since Nov. 15. The
spread has narrowed 16 basis points this year.  Greece’s government and international creditors are working
on the final draft of an agreement on budget and structural
measures needed to free up a second aid package, a Greek
official said. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose to almost
a two-week high.  There is increased confidence among investors that “ Greece 
won’t default on its debt and will be able to contain the
sovereign crisis, and that growth will slowly come back through
the U.S. and  China ,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin
America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal.  The yield on Peru’s 6.55 percent bond due March 2037 rose
two basis points to 4.8 percent. The security’s price fell 0.25
cent to 125.35 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
