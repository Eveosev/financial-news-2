Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said he won’t
convene the group to discuss  Greece  before Feb. 9.  “I haven’t yet called a meeting of the eurogroup for this
week because I can only do this once I see that the conditions
are in place to bring about a solution on private-sector
involvement and so that the second Greek program can be
implemented,” Juncker said on RTL radio today.  “Only when I see that all these elements are coming
together can I call a eurogroup meeting,” he said. “This is
certainly not before Thursday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
