Egypt ’s former president,  Hosni Mubarak , failed to attend a hearing session today for the first
time since his trial began on Aug. 3 due to “bad weather
conditions,” the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Mubarak, who is charged with conspiracy to kill
protesters, appropriating land illegally for himself and his
family and selling gas to Israel at below-market prices, has
been flown in on a helicopter, from a hospital in the Red Sea
resort of  Sharm el-Sheikh  where he is detained, to attend every
session. He is then wheeled into court on a hospital bed. The
news agency didn’t give any details on the weather conditions.  Mubarak is due to be transferred to Tora prison, following
pressure from the newly elected parliament and protesters. His
sons Jamal and Alaa, who are also charged with corruption, were
moved there on Feb. 6, according to Mena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
