New Zealand ’s economic outlook has
deteriorated since the pre-election update was published in
November amid an escalation of  Europe ’s debt crisis, the
Treasury Department said.  The outlook is not near a downside scenario included in the
November update “but the risk of something as bad as it
occurring has risen,” the department said in a  report  on its
website. The report doesn’t contain detailed forecasts, which
will be published Feb. 16.  Europe’s crisis may curb global sentiment and demand for
New Zealand’s exports, which make up 30 percent of the economy.
The recovery is being slowed by an increase in household saving
and a delay in the acceleration of rebuilding in earthquake
damaged Christchurch until late 2012 rather than mid-2012, the
Treasury said.  The economy probably expanded 0.6 percent in the three
months ended Dec. 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
