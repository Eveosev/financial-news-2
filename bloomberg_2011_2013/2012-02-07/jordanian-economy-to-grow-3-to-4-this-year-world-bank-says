Jordan ’s economy may grow between 3
percent and 4 percent this year, said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, one
of three managing directors at the  World Bank .  “I am not expecting up to the 5 percent growth, but
something between 3 and 4 percent,” Indrawati told reporters in
Amman late yesterday.  The World Bank approved last month a $250 million loan to
Jordan to aid the nation in overcoming economic difficulties.
Jordan’s economy was hurt by increasing food and fuel prices as
tourism dropped 16 percent, remittances from expatriates fell 3
percent and foreign direct investment declined 32 percent last
year due to regional unrest, the World Bank said in a Jan. 26
statement.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
relies on foreign investment and grants to support its budget
and current-account deficits. The government has increased
public salaries and subsidies since pro-reform protests broke
out as part of last year’s regional turmoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
