New York Knicks All-Star forward
Carmelo Anthony will miss one to two weeks after straining his
right groin in the first quarter of last night’s 99-88 victory
against the  Utah Jazz .  Anthony’s status was announced today at practice, Knicks
spokesman Jonathan Supranowitz said in an e-mail. The team is 0-
3 this season without the 27-year-old forward.  Anthony was injured running the floor in the first quarter
at Madison Square Garden. The four-time National Basketball
Association All-Star was evaluated by trainers on the sideline
before going to the locker room, and didn’t return to the game.  Acquired by the Knicks from the Denver Nuggets midway
through last season, Anthony leads the team in points (22.3),
assists (4.2) and turnovers (3.0) per game. New York is 10-15,
10th in the 15-team Eastern Conference.  The Knicks, who play at the  Washington Wizards  tomorrow,
also played last night without six-time All-Star forward Amar’e Stoudemire, who is with his family in  Florida  following the
death of his older brother, Hazell. There is no timetable for
Stoudemire’s return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
