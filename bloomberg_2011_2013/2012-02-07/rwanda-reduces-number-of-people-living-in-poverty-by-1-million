Rwanda reduced the number of people
living in poverty by more than 1 million over the past five
years under a poverty-reduction program, Finance and Economic
Planning Minister John Rwangombwa said.  The  poverty rate  dropped to 45 percent of the East African
nation’s 10.7 million people, compared with 57 percent in 2007,
Rwangombwa told reporters yesterday in Kigali, the capital.  “We are determined to redouble our efforts so that this
great progress continues unabated,” he said.  Rwangombwa will announce later today the second phase of
the country’s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy, which sets targets for the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
