French Socialist Francois Hollande
widened his lead against  Nicolas Sarkozy  in a BVA poll testing
voter preferences in the two-round presidential vote that begins
in April, Le Parisian reported.  Hollande would defeat Sarkozy, who has yet to announce he’s
seeking re-election, by 58 percent to 42 percent in the May 6
runoff, the BVA survey for the French daily showed. That’s up
from 57-43 last month. Hollande would win the first round with
34 percent, up 6 points from January, over 26 percent for
Sarkozy, whose standing advanced 2 points.  BVA surveyed 968 people on Feb. 3-4. No margin of error was
provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
