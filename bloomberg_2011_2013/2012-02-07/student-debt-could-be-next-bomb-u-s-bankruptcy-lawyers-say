Almost half of U.S. bankruptcy
attorneys representing consumers say that potential clients with
student-loan debt have “significantly increased” over the past
three to four years, a survey found.  The  National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys ,
a group that represents consumer debtors and their lawyers,
released a survey today of 860 bankruptcy attorneys in the U.S
who are members of the organization.  Federal and private student-loan debt is approaching $1
trillion and surpassed credit-card debt for the first time in
2010, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, a
college grant and loan website. The borrowing represents a
threat reminiscent of the mortgage crisis, the attorneys group
said in a statement. Under U.S. law, student-loan debt -- unlike
credit-card borrowings -- can rarely be discharged in  bankruptcy
court .  “Take it from those of us on the frontline of economic
distress in America,” William E. Brewer, Jr., president of the
group, said in a statement. “This could very well be the next
debt bomb for the  U.S. economy .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
