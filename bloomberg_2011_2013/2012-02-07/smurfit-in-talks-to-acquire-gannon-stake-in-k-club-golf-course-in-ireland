Michael Smurfit, one of Ireland’s
richest men and former chairman of  Smurfit Kappa Group Plc. (SKG) ,
is in talks to acquire Gerry Gannon’s stake in Ireland’s K-Club
golf course, according to a spokeswoman for Smurfit.  Smurfit bought the development with Gannon in 2005. The
Ryder Cup was held the next year at the Straffan, Kildare-based
course, west of Dublin.  Some of the loans associated with the resort are controlled
by the Dublin-based National Asset Management Agency, a person
familiar with the matter said. An agreement to sell the stake is
close to being reached, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the process isn’t yet complete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
