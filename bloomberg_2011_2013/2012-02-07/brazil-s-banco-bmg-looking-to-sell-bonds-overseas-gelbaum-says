Banco BMG SA , the Brazilian lender
that collects payments via payroll deductions, is considering
selling bonds overseas.  Sales this year by Brazilian companies such as Banco
Bradesco SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Banco Santander Brasil
SA have shown “positive” signs of investor demand, Ricardo Gelbaum, executive financial director for Belo Horizonte-based
BMG, said in a telephone interview.  “We are looking for the opportunity,” he said. “We know
that institutional and retail investors have a lot of cash.”  Gelbaum said the bank may look to sell international debt
after releasing financial statements in two to three weeks. The
bank last sold debt overseas in a benchmark offering in April
2011, issuing $300 million of securities, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on the bonds due in 2018 have tumbled 143 basis
points, or 1.43 percentage point, this year to 10.15 percent.  BMG has hired Banco Bradesco SA to manage a 1 billion reais
($580 million) program to sell local, longer-term debt known as
letras financeiras in public offerings, Gelbaum said. BMG is
still monitoring market conditions to determine the best timing
for that sale, Gelbaum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
