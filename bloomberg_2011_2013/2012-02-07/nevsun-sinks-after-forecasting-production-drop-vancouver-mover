Nevsun Resources Ltd. (NSU) , which mines
gold in the African country of Eritrea, plunged the most since
September 2004 today after saying production may fall 50 percent
this year.  Nevsun, which operates the Bisha mine, tumbled 31  percent 
in Toronto after the Vancouver-based company forecast production
of 190,000 to 210,000 ounces, compared with the 379,000 ounces
mined in 2011. The shares dropped C$1.94 to C$4.40, the lowest
close since August 2010.  The company said it found its March 2011 estimate of its
resources to be too optimistic. It has delayed its revision of
the estimates for the entire project, originally scheduled for
late this quarter, to the second or third quarter.  “Gold production guidance for 2012 is basically half of
what was expected,” Steven Green, an analyst at Toronto-
Dominion Bank, wrote in a note to clients. “The reason for the
lowered guidance is an apparent overstatement in the reserve
estimate of both tonnage and grade -- which is a major
negative.”  Nevsun surged 22 percent from Oct. 27, when it reported a
copper discovery next to the mine, to yesterday. The Bisha
deposit consists of a  layer of gold oxide  above layers of zinc
and copper. The company says it expects to begin mining base
metals next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
