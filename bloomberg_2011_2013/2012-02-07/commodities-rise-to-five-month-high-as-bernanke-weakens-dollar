Commodities rose to the highest level
in more than five months as the dollar declined after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that the U.S. jobs market
is far from healthy.  The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index  of 24 commodities gained
0.8 percent to 673.99 at 1:20 p.m. in  New York , the highest
level since Aug. 31.  Oil futures advanced as much as 2.3 percent after
Bernanke’s comments sent the  dollar  to its lowest level against
the euro since Dec. 12, making assets priced in the U.S.
currency more attractive. Bernanke said in testimony prepared
for the Senate Budget Committee that the U.S. has a long way to
go before the jobs market operates “normally.” Gold, aluminum
and copper also advanced.  “There’s general improvement in risk sentiment and strong
weakness in the dollar,” said Nic Johnson, who helps manage
about $30 billion in commodities at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,  California . “Equities are
higher, commodities are higher, so people are generally putting
on risk.”  Oil for March delivery rose $1.47, or 1.5 percent, to
$98.38 a barrel at 1:22 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
after falling to $95.84 a barrel. Prices have slipped 0.5
percent this year.  “Bernanke made some pretty bearish statements and the
dollar tanked,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork
Group in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “Once the dollar dropped you
saw WTI rebound.”  Gold Gains  Gold climbed for the first time in three sessions as the
dollar weakened, increasing demand for the precious metals as an
alternative investment.  “The dollar’s decline is pushing gold higher,” Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,
 Oregon , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1,735.50 an ounce at 10:43 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices dropped 2 percent in the previous two sessions. Before
today, the metal was up 10 percent in 2012.  Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$3.8695 a pound at 12:24 p.m. on the Comex. Earlier, the metal
fell as much as 1.8 percent.  Aluminum rose $32, or 1.4 percent, to $2,255 a ton on the
London Metal Exchange. Heating oil gained as much as 1.6 percent
to $3.2208 a gallon in New York, the highest price since May 3.  “Over the past two and a half years, the  U.S. economy  has
been gradually recovering from the recent deep recession,”
Bernanke said today. “While conditions have certainly improved
over this period, the pace of the recovery has been
frustratingly slow, particularly from the perspective of the
millions of workers who remain unemployed or underemployed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
