Sanoma Oyj , a Finnish publishing and
broadcasting company, slid the most in six months after
proposing the lowest dividend since 2003.  Sanoma fell as much as 6.5 percent, the most since August
8. The share declined 0.26 euros, or 2.3 percent, to 11.20 euros
at 11:26 a.m. in the Finnish capital. Helsinki-based Sanoma has
lost 36 percent of its value in the last year, compared with 24
percent for the OMX Helsinki All-Share Index.  Sanoma proposed a payout of 0.60 euros a share, compared
with 1.1 euros a share a year earlier, missing the 0.80 euros a
share  estimate  by Bloomberg. The company forecast full-year
sales to grow “slightly,” mostly from the television and
magazine properties acquired last year in the Netherlands and
 Belgium . Print advertising sales in  Finland  declined 4.9 percent
in the quarter.  Priorities for the next three years include “streamlining
operating expenses and continuing to dispose of non-core
assets” to “ensure financial flexibility,” Chief Executive
Officer Harri-Pekka Kaukonen said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
