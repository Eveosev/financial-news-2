MasterCard Inc. , the second-biggest
payments network, doubled its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a
share after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates.  Investors who own the Class A and Class B stock as of April
9 will be paid on May 9, according to a statement today from
MasterCard. The last time MasterCard said it was raising the
dividend was in February 2007.  MasterCard, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ajay Banga ,
surged 66 percent last year to the fourth-best performance in
the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index . The Purchase, New York-based
firm has been boosted by a global shift from cash and
checks to electronic payments.  Net income  for the fourth quarter increased to $514
million, or $4.03 a share, from $415 million, or $3.17, a year
earlier. MasterCard’s total profit for 2011 increased 3.3
percent.  MasterCard advanced $1.86 to $393.17 at 12:07 p.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
