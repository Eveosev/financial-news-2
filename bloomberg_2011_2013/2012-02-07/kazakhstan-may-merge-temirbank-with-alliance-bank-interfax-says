Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund
 Samruk-Kazyna  is discussing a possible merger of state-
controlled lenders  AO Temirbank  and  AO Alliance Bank , said
 Yelena Bakhmutova , the fund’s deputy chief.  Samruk-Kazyna, which holds government stakes in the banks,
is considering options to “boost the lenders’ effectiveness,
including the possibility of their functioning as a united
financial institution,” Bakhmutova said in an interview with
the Interfax news service in comments confirmed by the Astana-
based fund’s press service.  Temirbank, Alliance Bank and  BTA Bank , the country’s
biggest at the time, were brought under state control in 2009,
when credit markets froze and Kazakhstan’s property bubble
burst. The banks issued new bonds and offered shares and cash to
creditors in 2010 after writing off and extending payments on
some of their debt. BTA is seeking to restructure its debt for
the second time.  “Talks with Alliance and Temirbank creditors must be held
before any decisions are made,” Bakhmutova said.  The government owns 81.48 percent of ordinary shares in
BTA, 67 percent in Alliance and 79.9 percent in Temirbank,
according to the  Kazakhstan  Stock Exchange  website .  Samruk-Kazyna abandoned the possible sale of Temirbank
because of the low chances of finding a buyer amid difficulties
faced by leading financial companies, Bakhmutova said.  Kazakh state officials held talks on selling a stake in
Alliance to the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
in April last year, which would have made it the first of the
country’s defaulted banks to attract an international
institutional investor, people familiar with the talks said at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
