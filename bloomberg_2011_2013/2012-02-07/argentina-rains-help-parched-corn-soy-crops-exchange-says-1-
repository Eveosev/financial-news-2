Downpours in  Argentina  are improving
the condition of drought-hit corn and soybean crops in the
Pampas agricultural zone, a climatologist for the  Rosario
Cereals Exchange  said by telephone today.  The rains will continue for most of the week, benefiting
corn and soybean crops, Jose Luis Aiello said. The damage caused
by dry weather is irreversible in some areas, he said.  “This is going to improve the situation of late season
corn crops,” Aiello said. “And the soybeans that were recently
planted are going to be better.”  The weather pattern known as La Nina has brought hot, dry
weather to Argentina,  Brazil  and  Mexico , scorching recently
planted crops. The drought in Argentina is similar to one last
year in the U.S. that caused corn production to miss forecasts
by about 10 percent, Rick Tolman, chief executive officer of the
National Corn Growers Association, said Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
