France ’s state-owned fund for
strategic investments, or FSI, is close to a deal to buy  Areva
SA ’s 26 percent stake in nickel miner  Eramet (ERA)  SA.  FSI, which began exclusive talks with Areva in December,
expects to complete the deal “within the next few weeks,”
Jean-Yves Gilet, the head of FSI, told reporters at a briefing
in Paris today.  Eramet  has a market value of 3.4 billion euros, valuing the
26 percent stake at about 884 million euros.  The state fund is currently holding talks with Eramet’s
controlling shareholder, the Duval family, which has a
shareholder pact with Areva, Gilet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
