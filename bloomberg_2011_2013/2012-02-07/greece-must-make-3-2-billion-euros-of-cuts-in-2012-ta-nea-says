Greece  must cut spending by 3.2
billion euros ($4.2 billion) this year to get approval from the
European Union, the European Central Bank and the  International
Monetary Fund  for a new financing package,  Ta Nea  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The so-called troika and the Greek government have agreed
on cuts of about 2.5 billion euros so far; another 700 million
euros have still to be determined, the newspaper said.  The Greek government has so far agreed to cut health and
pharmaceutical spending by 1.1 billion euros, defense by 300
million euros and state investments by 400 million euros.
Another 665 million euros will be cut from subsidies and other
costs, Ta Nea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
