Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ASTX) , a
drugmaker that specializes in cancer therapies, fell the most in
almost eight years after U.S. regulators said the company’s only
approved treatment didn’t show a benefit for an expanded use.  Astex, based in Dublin,  California ,  fell  22 percent to
$2.19 at the close in New York, the biggest single-day decline
since April 2004.  Astex licenses Dacogen, approved for a  condition  that often
leads to leukemia, to Tokyo-based  Eisai Co. (4523)  The  Food and Drug
Administration  said Dacogen “failed to demonstrate benefit
based on statistical interpretation” for patients 65 years old
and older who have acute myelogenous leukemia, a form of blood
cancer. An agency advisory panel is scheduled to review the drug
on Feb. 9.  “The wording in the press release may telegraph to
investors a more rigorous interpretation by the FDA,” said
George Zavoico, an analyst with McNicoll Lewis & Vlak LLC in New
York. “Eisai needs to say, ‘Look, the result is really
significant if you give us a little bit of leeway. This will be
the first drug available for an unmet clinical need.’’  Eisai reported Dacogen  sales  of $190 million in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2011.  A recent study of the drug shows more positive results,
said Timothy Enns, a spokesman for Astex.  ‘‘It appears that the results are clinically meaningful but
that’s exactly the question the FDA will put to the panel and
we’ll see what happens,” Enns said. “It’s not a slam dunk from
a regulatory perspective, you obviously have to go through the
process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
