Job openings in the U.S. increased in
December by the most in almost a year, showing employers are
gaining confidence the economy will keep growing in 2012.  The  number  of positions waiting to be filled climbed by
258,000, the biggest gain since February 2011, to 3.38 million,
the Labor Department said today in  Washington . Excluding
government agencies, openings at  private employers  climbed to
the highest level since August 2008.  More openings mean companies may be looking beyond the
European financial crisis and are making plans to expand this
year as sales grow. Payrolls increased by 243,000 workers last
month after a 203,000 gain in December, and the jobless rate
fell to 8.3 percent, a three-year low, Labor Department figures
showed on Feb. 3.  “The labor market is gaining traction,” said Henry Mo, an
economist at Credit Suisse in  New York . “The overall economy is
doing well considering we have had a lot of drawbacks from
overseas, including the European debt crisis.”  Openings in December rose by 8.3 percent from the prior
month’s 3.12 million. The number of openings was just short of
September’s reading, which was the highest since August 2008.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke today repeated
that the job market is still far from healthy, and called on
lawmakers to reduce the long-term  budget deficit .  Bernanke’s View  “We still have a long way to go before the labor market
can be said to be operating normally,” Bernanke said in
testimony prepared for the Senate Budget Committee that is
identical to remarks he gave on Feb. 2 to the House Budget
panel. “Particularly troubling is the unusually high level of
long-term unemployment.”  About 5.5 million Americans haven’t worked for 27 weeks or
more and are still looking -- making up 42.9 percent of the
total unemployed pool, according to Labor Department data.  Stocks climbed today as  Greece ’s government made progress
on measure to secure international aid. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,346.06 at 11:25 a.m. in New
York.  Treasury securities  fell, sending the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note up to 1.97 percent from 1.91 percent late
yesterday.  Elsewhere today,  France ’s trade deficit widened to a record
in 2011, underlining a drop in competitiveness that President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  wants to counter with a cut in corporate payroll
taxes. The shortfall swelled to 69.6 billion euros ($91 billion)
last year from 51.5 billion euros in 2010, the trade ministry in
Paris said.  Australia  unexpectedly kept  interest rates  unchanged as two
cuts late last year helped the economy weather Europe’s debt
crisis.  Openings Rate  The rate of U.S. job openings climbed to 2.5 percent from
2.3 percent in November. Professional and business services
showed the biggest jump in jobs available, followed by retailers
and manufacturers. Government agencies sought  Among companies expanding payrolls is  Tibco Software Inc .
The  Palo Alto , California-based company plans to hire 500 people
in the U.S. this year as the economy improves and  Europe  works
out its debt crisis, Vivek Ranadive, chief executive officer of
the Palo company said in an interview.  “We are hiring quite rapidly now, all in sales and
service,” Ranadive said last month at the  World Economic Forum ’s
annual conference in Davos,  Switzerland . “It’s a good time to
hire.” The company makes software that enables companies to link
internal operations, business partners and customers.  Unemployed per Opening  Compared with the 13.1 million Americans who were
unemployed in December, today’s figures indicate there were
about 3.9 people vying for every opening, down from 4.3 in
November and the fewest since December 2008.  Nonetheless, the readings are still up from about 1.8 when
the 18-month recession began in December 2007.  Employers took on 4.05 million workers in December, down
from 4.13 million the previous month, today’s report showed.  Total job cuts, including retirements and those who left
their job voluntarily, decreased to 3.91 million in December
from 3.99 million a month before. Firings dropped to 1.64
million from 1.72 million in November.  The firings data corroborate figures on first-time claims
for jobless benefits. The number of people collecting
unemployment insurance payments averaged 376,200 a week in
December, down from 396,300 the prior month, according to other
Labor Department statistics.  In the 12 months ended in December, the economy created a
net 1.4 million jobs, representing 48.4 million hires and 47
million separations, today’s report showed.  “The recovery is speeding up,” President  Barack Obama  said
at a fire station in Arlington,  Virginia , last week after the
monthly employment report. “And we’ve got to do everything
in our power to keep it going.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
