Spain ’s government will watch to
ensure that mergers sparked by a real estate cleanup are viable,
an Economy Ministry official said.  Investors may be skeptical about mergers in which a bank
that has received  public aid  buys another, said the official,
who asked not to be identified in line with ministry policy.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos announced Feb. 2 new rules
imposing 50 billion euros ($65.5 billion) of charges in the form
of provisions and capital on the country’s banks to force them
to adjust for the loss of value in the real estate they piled up
during Spain’s property crash. The government will give banks
that agree to merge an extra year to fulfill the requirements as
part of a drive to accelerate consolidation between lenders.  Rodrigo Rato ,  chairman  of Bankia SA, Spain’s third-biggest
banking group whose parent company has received aid from the
government’s bank rescue fund, said yesterday that the company
was interested in acquiring Unnim, a Catalan lender taken over
by the government, Cinco Dias reported today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
