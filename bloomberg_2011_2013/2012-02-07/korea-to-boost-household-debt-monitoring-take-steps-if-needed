South Korea ’s financial regulator will
boost monitoring of household debt growth and take additional
steps if needed, the  Financial Services Commission  said today in
a report to parliament.  The Financial Supervisory Service, a privately funded agency
that enforces FSC policies, may increase monitoring of  household
debt  growth stemming from non-bank lenders, it said in a
separate parliamentary report today. The FSS may also raise its
loan-loss provision guidance for the lenders, which include
insurers and credit card companies, and tighten their asset-to-
lending ratio, it said.  South Korea’s central bank has held its  policy rate  at 3.25
percent, the highest in more than three years, for seven
straight months through January in an effort to curb household
borrowing amid waning growth. The nation’s economy expanded at
the slowest pace in two years in the final quarter of 2011 as
exports and consumer consumption declined, the  Bank of Korea 
said on Jan. 26.  The regulators aim to keep household growth in line with the
expansion of South Korea’s real economy, the reports said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
