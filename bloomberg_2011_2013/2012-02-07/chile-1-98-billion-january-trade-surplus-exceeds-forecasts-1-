Chile , the world’s leading copper
producer, had a wider-than-forecast trade surplus of $1.98
billion in January as exports of the metal increased.  Imports climbed 18 percent to $5.66 billion from a year ago
and exports rose 11 percent to $7.64 billion, including $4.17
billion in copper, the central bank said in a report posted on
its website today. The median estimate of 11 economists  surveyed
by Bloomberg  was for a $1.15 billion surplus.  The surplus will narrow in 2012 compared with last year as
imports rise and metal prices decline, according to central bank
forecasts. Domestic production can’t meet surging demand,
Alfredo Coutino, Latin America director at Moody’s Analytics,
wrote yesterday.  “The economy seems to be entering the second phase of
overheating, when the excess demand is no longer satisfied by
national production but rather by price increases and imports,”
he wrote in an e-mailed report. “This explains not only the
upward inflation trend but also the acceleration of imports as a
ratio of GDP.”  Chile’s peso fell 0.4 percent to 481.85 per  U.S. dollar  at
9 a.m. Santiago time from 480.05 yesterday.  Gross domestic product expanded an estimated 6.3 percent
last year and will grow between 4 percent and 5 percent in 2012
as the global slowdown damps demand for exports, acting Finance
Minister Julio Dittborn told reporters in Santiago yesterday.  Inflation  surged to 4.4 percent in December, breaching the
upper limit of the central bank target on gains in food and
drink prices as well as utilities, transport and education, the
National Statistics Institute said in a Jan. 6 report.  Chilean wages increased 6.3 percent in December from the
previous year and 1.2 percent from November, which was the
fastest gain since December 2008, the National Statistics
Institute said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
