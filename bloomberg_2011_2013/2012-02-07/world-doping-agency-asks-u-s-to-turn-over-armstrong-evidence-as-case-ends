The  World Anti-Doping Agency  wants
U.S. authorities to quickly turn over evidence collected in an
investigation of  Lance Armstrong  to help fight doping in
cycling.  WADA President John Fahey said the “significant” evidence
gathered in the probe of the seven-time Tour de France champion
and his teammates would be “very, very helpful” to
organizations continuing their own investigations.  “The U.S. anti-doping organization is keen to get hold of
that evidence and would like to see that happen,” Fahey told
reporters today in Lausanne, Switzerland. “Because there well
could be some very relevant information there that will assist
the fight against doping, particularly in the United States.”  U.S. federal prosecutors last week ended the investigation
without filing charges against Armstrong, who won the Tour every
year from 1999 to 2005 after surviving testicular cancer.  Armstrong, 40, has denied using banned performance-
enhancing drugs. He retired from professional cycling in
February 2011 to focus on his cancer charity.  WADA Secretary General David Howman said the sharing of
evidence could act as a deterrent to cyclists thinking of doping
ahead of this summer’s  Olympic Games .  “It is important that happens as quickly as possible just
in case there are
athletes who might be looking at going to London,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
