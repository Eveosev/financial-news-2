Petroleo Brasileiro SA ,  Latin
America ’s largest company by market value, will hold off selling
dollar bonds until 2013 to avoid flooding the market after last
week’s record $7 billion sale, said its chief financial officer.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
will wait until late 2012 before possibly selling more bonds in
euros, CFO Almir Barbassa said in a telephone interview today
from  Rio de Janeiro . The company will study selling debt in yen
this year, he said.  “We just did a large operation in the European market,”
Barbassa said. “We’re not going to do a small operation. To
return it has to be a big one, so we need to create the
conditions.”  Petrobras,  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil producer, plans to
borrow as much as $18 billion a year through 2015, mainly from
international markets, to more than double production by 2020
and develop the largest oil discoveries in the Americas in more
than three decades.  The company’s Feb. 1 sale of dollar debt matched  SABMiller
Plc ’s $7 billion offering last month as the largest dollar-
denominated corporate  bond issue  this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Petrobras issued 700 million pounds ($1.1 billion) of bonds
due 2026 on Dec. 5, four days after selling 1.85 billion euros
($2.4 billion) of debt maturing in 2018 and 2022 to help finance
its five-year $224.7 billion investment plan.  Petrobras gained 3 percent to 25.60 reais at 6:07 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . The stock has climbed 19 percent this year, more than
the 16 percent increase in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
