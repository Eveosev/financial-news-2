AS Tallinna Vesi ,  Estonia ’s biggest
water utility, said the Tallinn Administrative Court kept
suspended the fulfillment of a competition authority order
imposing a 29 percent cut in the company’s tariff mechanism.  The suspension will last until the court delivers a ruling
on tariffs, the company said in a regulatory statement today.
The court hasn’t yet set dates for the start of proceedings to
review the company’s complaint against the order, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
