Banco BTG Pactual SA, the Brazilian
bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves , agreed to buy  Chile ’s
brokerage firm Celfin Capital SA for $600 million, said a person
familiar with the matter.  The announcement will be made tomorrow, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the deal isn’t public.
The acquisition talks began in August, Santiago-based Celfin
said then in an e-mailed statement.  Gordon Lee, BTG Pactual’s country specialist and strategist
for  Mexico , said last month that the lender would pick up 13
analysts in the deal. BTG Pactual currently has 28 analysts
covering  Latin America  companies. Lee was hired from UBS AG in
January to strengthen Latin American equity coverage.  Brazilian banks are seeking to expand in Latin America as
the region’s growth accelerates.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  has
announced plans to hire 37 people in Colombia and said it won a
license to operate in Mexico.  BTG Pactual declined to comment today. Celfin Chairman Juan Andres Camus didn’t return a phone message left with his
assistant. Final terms will be disclosed once contracts have
been signed, Celfin said in an e-mail.  Exame magazine’s Faria Lima blog reported earlier on the
agreement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
