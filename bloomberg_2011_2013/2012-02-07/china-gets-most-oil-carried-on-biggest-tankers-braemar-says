China  is the biggest recipient of oil
hauled on the largest tankers, said Braemar Seascope Ltd.  Forty percent of very large crude carriers booked for
single voyages discharged their cargoes in China last month,
twice as many as in 2005, the London-based shipbroker said today
in an e-mailed report. Braemar included Taiwan in its
calculations with China, the world’s second-largest consumer of
crude after the U.S.  “As Chinese refiners will probably add over 6 million
barrels a day of domestic refinery capacity in the next five
years, their presence in the VLCC spot market is likely to
increase further as China makes efforts to secure its energy
supplies,” Braemar Seascope research director  Mark Williams 
said in the report.  A VLCC can haul 2 million barrels of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
