Unum Group  dropped  the most  in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after the company reported a fourth-
quarter loss tied to group long-term care coverage and said it
was retreating from the business.  The insurer fell 5.7 percent to $22.31 at 9:57 a.m. in New
York, the most since November. Unum swung to a $425.4 million
 loss  in the period ended Dec. 31 on a charge tied to a review of
long-term care coverage and will halt new sales of the policies,
Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Unum said late yesterday.  Insurers including CNO Financial Group Inc. have been
burned by coverage sold in the past when they underestimated the
number of claims, the cost of care or the life expectancy of
their clients. Lower  interest rates  have also pressured the
business, limiting investment income on funds set aside for
claims. MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, said Nov.
11, 2010 it would retreat from long-term care coverage.  “The rate environment is a serious headwind,” said John Nadel, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., in a note to
investors after results were released. Nadel said Unum had
highlighted the prospects for the business at an investor
meeting in late 2010 “following at least one major competitor’s
exit.”  Long-term care policies provide coverage to help pay for
home-health aides or residence in a nursing home or assisted-
living facility. Unum also sells disability coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
