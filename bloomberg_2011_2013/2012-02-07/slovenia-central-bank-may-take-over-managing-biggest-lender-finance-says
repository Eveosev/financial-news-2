Slovenia’s central bank is
considering taking over the management of Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. to stabilize the country’s biggest bank, Finance newspaper
reported without saying where it got the information.  NLB contributed more than half to the 400 million euros
($526 million) of losses of the Slovenian banking industry last
year, the Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  Banka Slovenije  declined to immediately comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.  NLB, which wants to raise 400 million euros of equity
capital by mid-June, is looking for the new chief executive
officer after Bozo Jasovic resigned in December over the bank’s
planned sale of its holding in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem  d.d. to
Croatia’s Agrokor d.d.  To contact the reporter on this story:
