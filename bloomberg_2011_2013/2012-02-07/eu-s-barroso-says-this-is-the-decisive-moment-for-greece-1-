European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said this is the “decisive moment” for Greece and an
agreement on a debt swap and second rescue package is close.  “We want Greece to remain in the euro,” Barroso said in
Brussels today, after EU Digital Affairs Commissioner  Neelie Kroes  told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that there would be
“absolutely no man overboard” if a country exited the euro.  “Maybe my wording isn’t entirely felicitous,” Kroes told
De Volkskrant. “What is a man overboard? It’s being said that
if you allow one country to exit or ask it to exit, then the
whole structure collapses. But that just isn’t true.”  When asked about Kroes’s comments, commission spokesman
Olivier Bailly said the EU’s position on  Greece  “has not
changed and is very clear: we want Greece to remain in the euro
area.”  Bailly said the commission is “fully confident that the
euro with survive the storm and come out of the crisis
stronger.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
