The euro fluctuated against the
dollar amid speculation Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and
coalition party leaders will fail to agree on terms required for
a bailout.  The Dollar Index rose from its weakest level in two months
on demand for a refuge as Greek political leaders were locked in
discussions with Papademos on the 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) bailout. The yen fell against the majority of its major
peers as Japan’s current-account surplus slid to a 15-year low
in 2011. Brazil’s real rallied even as the central bank bought
dollars in the forwards market.  “There’s a bit of fatigue setting in and the markets are a
little bit less reactive than they’ve been,” said Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in  Stamford , Connecticut. “The euro continues to
be reasonably well bid. The market came to realize that ‘haven’t
made a decision’ is not bad.”  Europe ’s shared currency was little changed at $1.3260 at 5
p.m. New York time after reaching $1.3289, the most since Dec.
12. The euro was 0.4 percent stronger at 102.16 yen after
earlier touching 102.45, the strongest level since Dec. 21. The
yen weakened 0.4 percent to 77.04 per dollar.  Greece’s Papademos negotiated with political leaders in
 Athens  after delaying the gathering for a second time in as many
days. Greece will pledge permanent spending cuts, including
lower pension payments and a 20 percent reduction in the minimum
wage, as the economy contracts this year at a faster pace than
originally estimated, according to the draft of a new financing
deal with the European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  Sovereign-Debt Crisis  Euro-area finance ministers are due to gather tomorrow in
an emergency meeting in Brussels.  The euro has fallen 3.5 percent over the past three months,
the worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis damped demand for the currency.
The dollar fell 1.2 percent in the period and the yen was little
changed.  Brazil’s real rallied even as the central bank intervened
in the  currency market  for the second time in under a week at
1.7339 reais. The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.7206 per dollar.  The yen dropped after the  Finance Ministry  in  Tokyo  said
Japan’s current-account surplus shrank 44 percent in 2011 from
the previous year to 9.63 trillion yen ($125 billion), the
lowest since 1996.  Japan ’s trade surplus makes the currency
attractive as a haven because it means the nation doesn’t have
to rely on overseas lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
