Equatorial Guinea  will export three
cargoes of Aseng crude next month, compared with one for
February, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The March program comprises two 650,000 barrel cargoes and
one shipment of 950,000 barrels, according to the plan.  Aseng is a medium, sweet, or low-sulfur, blend similar to
 Angola â€™s Girassol grade. Production started in November,
according to  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , the operator of the field.
Glencore International Plc is the marketer for the grade.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
