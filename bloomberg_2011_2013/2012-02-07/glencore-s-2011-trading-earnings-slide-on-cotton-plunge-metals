Glencore International Plc ’s
marketing unit said earnings before interest and tax dropped 18
percent last year, driven down by losses from cotton trading.  Adjusted Ebit from marketing fell to $1.91 billion from
$2.34 billion, the world’s largest publicly traded commodity
supplier said today in a presentation. Its agricultural business
posted an $8 million loss, compared with profit of $659 million
a year earlier, while metal-trading earnings dropped 11 percent.  “Agricultural products marketing results were
significantly impacted by the unprecedented cotton market
environment,” Glencore said. “The extreme volatility produced
an outcome of ineffective hedging and high levels of physical
contractual non-performance by suppliers and customers.”  Glencore, based in Baar,  Switzerland , suffered a decline in
demand for cotton last year as slowing economic growth eroded
consumption and farmers boosted output. Cotton in  New York  sank
37 percent in 2011, the biggest annual slump since 2004. It
tumbled as low as 84.35 cents a pound in December after peaking
at $2.19 in March. Cotton for this March was down 0.3 percent at
96.02 cents a pound by 5:37 a.m. in New York.  “It was an extremely difficult year with prices reaching
record levels only to collapse afterwards,” said Keith Flury,
an analyst at Rabobank International. “Many businesses found
themselves holding high-priced cotton when the market price had
dropped significantly, resulting in heavy losses.”  Earnings from metals marketing totaled $1.24 billion, while
profit from energy products jumped 55 percent to $697 million.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six main industrial
metals dropped 22 percent last year. Glencore today agreed to
buy Xstrata Plc in a deal that values the target at 39.1 billion
pounds ($62 billion), according to a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
