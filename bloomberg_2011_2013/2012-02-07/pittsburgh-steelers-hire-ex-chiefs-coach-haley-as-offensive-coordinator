The Pittsburgh Steelers hired former
Kansas City Chiefs coach Todd Haley as offensive coordinator,
bringing back a former ballboy whose father played on the team.  Haley, 44, succeeds Bruce Arians, who left the Steelers and
took the same position with the  Indianapolis Colts .  Haley had a 19-26 record in two-plus National Football
League seasons as Chiefs’ coach before being fired in December.
He was previously  Arizona ’s offensive coordinator from 2007-08
and helped the Cardinals reach the Super Bowl following the 2008
season.  Haley’s father, Dick, played 3 1/2 seasons with the
Steelers and was Pittsburgh’s director of player personnel from
1971 to 1990, helping build four Super Bowl-winning teams.  “My father has so many fond memories both from his playing
days and his time in the personnel department with the team,”
Haley said. “I look forward to helping bring more championships
to Pittsburgh.”  The Steelers, who have won a record six  Super Bowl  titles,
went 12-4 last season before losing to the  Denver Broncos  in the
first round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
