The U.S. government probably will
lower its estimate of the recently-harvested cotton crop for a
fourth straight month after drought hurt production in  Texas , a
Bloomberg News survey of eight analysts showed.  Estimates for production, exports and inventories for the
marketing year ending July 31 are listed below in millions of
bales, each weighing 480 pounds (218 kilograms). The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  will update its forecasts at 8:30 a.m.
on Feb. 9 in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
