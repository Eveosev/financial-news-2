U.S. stocks erased losses, while
Treasuries fell and the euro strengthened, as  Greece ’s
government made progress on measures to secure international
aid. Crude oil led gains in commodities.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up less than 0.1
percent to 1,344.89 at 11:01 a.m. in  New York  after slipping as
much as 0.6 percent earlier. Ten-year Treasury yields increased
six basis points to 1.97 percent and the euro advanced 1 percent
to $1.3255. Oil rallied 2 percent to $98.83 a barrel.  Greece’s government and international creditors are working
on the final draft of an agreement on budget and structural
measures needed to free up a second aid package, a Greek
official said. The document is being drafted at a meeting
between Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos and representatives
of Greece’s creditors and will be discussed by political leaders
later in the day, the government official told reporters in
 Athens  today on customary condition of anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
