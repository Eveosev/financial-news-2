Oil rose to its highest in more than
a week in  New York  after a report showed U.S. stockpiles shrank,
signaling increased demand in the world’s biggest crude
consumer.  West Texas Intermediate futures climbed to $99.88 a barrel,
the highest since Jan. 31.  Crude inventories  fell 4.5 million
barrels in the seven days ended Feb. 3, the first drop in three
weeks, the American Petroleum Institute said after yesterday’s
settlement. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast
today’s Energy Department report would show  supplies rose  2.5
million barrels.  “Inventories decreasing are adding to the supply concerns
in the market,” said Sintje Boie, an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in
Hamburg. “Demand is quite strong because of the winter season.
There are already supply worries from  Iran ’s threat to stop
exports to  Europe .”  Crude for March delivery advanced as much as $1.47, or 1.5
percent, to $99.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $99.83 at 1:54 p.m. London
time. Yesterday, it increased $1.50 to $98.41, the highest
settlement since Jan. 31. Prices are up 15 percent from a year
ago.  Brent oil for March settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose for a seventh day, the longest run
of advances since August. The European benchmark gained as much
as 64 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $116.87 a barrel and was at a
premium of $16.71 to West Texas grade, down for a second day.
The spread closed at $19.02 on Feb. 6, the widest settlement
level in three months, and rose as high as $20.70 yesterday, the
most since Oct. 25.  Price Outlook  WTI will average $100.40 a barrel this year, according to a
forecast from the Energy Department. That’s 15 cents higher than
the January estimate, it said yesterday in its monthly Short-
Term Energy Outlook.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 4.4 million barrels last
week, the  American Petroleum Institute  report showed. Supplies
probably gained 875,000 barrels in today’s government report,
according to the  median estimate  of 10 analysts in the Bloomberg
News survey. Distillate-fuel inventories, including diesel and
heating oil, climbed 386,000 barrels compared with a projection
for an 875,000-barrel decline.  Crude imports dropped 12 percent to 7.8 million barrels a
day last week, the lowest since May 20, the API said. The daily
intake of products declined 10 percent to 1.5 million barrels,
the slowest rate since Jan. 6.  Bollinger Band  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  “The API data provided momentum for the price gains,”
said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in
Sydney. “Front-month prices for West Texas are in a trend-
channel pattern, with the range broadly between about $95.50 on
the downside and $100.50 on the upside.”  Oil in New York has technical resistance along the middle
Bollinger Band on the daily chart, about $99.19 a barrel today,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Investors tend to sell
contracts as prices approach resistance. Futures slipped below
the lower band yesterday before settling higher, signaling a
rebound from chart support.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended selling WTI contracts
for delivery in May and buying those for June. Rising
inventories at the U.S. storage hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma , will
put pressure on short-term prices, the bank said in a report
yesterday.  Crude stockpiles at  Cushing , which typically drive price
differences between monthly contracts, have increased 2.8
percent this year to 30.1 million barrels, according to the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
