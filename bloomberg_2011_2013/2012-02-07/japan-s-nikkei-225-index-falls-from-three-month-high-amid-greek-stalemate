     Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) --　the  Topix Index  reached a five-month
high after  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  raised its forecast and shipping
lines climbed as cargo rates rebounded. Gains were limited as
 Greece  struggled to secure a bailout.  Japan Tobacco, the world’s second-largest listed cigarette
maker, rose 5.5 percent as sales recovered faster than expected
after the March earthquake.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. , Japan’s
third-largest shipper by market value, advanced 1.3 percent.
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its sales in
 Europe , fell 0.2 percent.  The Topix rose 0.4 percent to 772.77 as of the 3 p.m. close
of trading in  Tokyo , its highest since Sept. 1. The benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.1 percent to 8,917.52,
retreating from a three-month high.  “Investors like the fact there haven’t been any surprises
in earnings data,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. “Both negative and
positive reports about earnings fell within expectations, which
is boosting confidence in the market.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The gauge was little changed in  New York 
yesterday as European leaders stepped up pressure on Greek
politicians to accept additional austerity cuts needed to secure
a 130 billion-euro ($170 billion) bailout, saying time was
running out.  Greek Stalemate  Greek interim Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  plans to
confer with international lenders. A gathering of Greece’s
political leaders was delayed by a day until today as they
struggled for a unified response.  “The market is nervous about the outcome of negotiations
over Greece’s debt haircut,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Canon slid 0.2 percent to 3,395 yen. Nippon Sheet Glass Co.,
which gets nearly 40 percent of its sales in Europe, fell 2.3
percent to 128 yen.  Among stocks that advanced,  Japan  Tobacco gained 5.5
percent to 406,500 yen after it said full-year revenue would
rise 4.4 percent to 2.54 trillion yen ($33 billion).  Earnings Season  Of 1,002 companies listed on the Topix that  have reported
earnings  since Jan. 9, 204 have missed analysts’ estimates while
94 beat expectations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing  Co. lead declines on the
Nikkei. The maker of chip equipment sank 7.1 percent to 587 yen
after cutting its full-year net income forecast 35 percent to
6.5 billion yen, citing drops in the value of fixed assets and
investment securities.  Shipping companies gained after the Baltic Dry Index, a
gauge of cargo rates, rose 0.2 percent yesterday, its first
advance since Dec. 12. Kawasaki Kisen climbed 1.3 percent to 157
yen. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s top shipping line by sales, rose
2.4 percent to 218 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. gained 2.2
percent to 329 yen.  The Topix has added 6.1 percent this year after plunging 19
percent last year on optimism U.S. economy is recovering and
 China  may ease its monetary policy further to spur growth.
That’s pushed the price of companies on the measure to 0.93
times estimated  book value , up from 0.85 in November, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  fell 2.1 percent to 20.52,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
