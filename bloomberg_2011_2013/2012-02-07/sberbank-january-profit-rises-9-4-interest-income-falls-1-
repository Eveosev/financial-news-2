OAO Sberbank ,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, said profit increased 9.4 percent in January to 29.2
billion rubles ($971 million) from a year earlier.  Net interest income, which climbed 28 percent since last
year, dropped 7.5 percent in January. Bad loans were little
changed at 3.35 percent of total lending as of Feb. 1, compared
with the start of the year, the Moscow-based bank said today on
its  website .  “Net interest margin and overall revenues were slightly
disappointing,” Jason Hurwitz, a senior analyst at  Alfa Bank 
who rates the shares “overweight,” said by phone today. “We
saw similar drops in revenues last January.”  Sberbank’s shares dropped as much as 1.1 percent in Moscow
by 12:35 p.m. and last traded 0.2 percent lower at 93.68 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
