Brazil  may become the world’s fourth
largest installer of wind farms in 2012, up from 11th last year,
as some developed nations cut subsidies for renewable energy.  South America’s largest economy may build wind farms with
as much as 2,000 megawatts of capacity this year, trailing
China, the U.S., and India,  Steve Sawyer , secretary general of
the Brussels-based industry lobby group Global Wind Energy
Council, said today in a telephone interview.  Stagnant economic growth and a boom in installations for
clean energy projects has led Germany, Spain and France to trim
support for renewables, which may contribute to a drop in new
wind farms, Sawyer said.  “Brazil has a tremendous combination of high wind speeds
and stability that Europeans would die for,” Saywer said. “It
provides an opportunity for growing the industry without
supports.”  Brazil may have 9,000 megawatts of projects online by 2016
compared with about 1,500 megawatts currently, making it the
world’s sixth largest producer of  wind energy  behind China, the
U.S., Germany, India and Spain, Sawyer said.  “They will be vying for that sixth slot with the U.K.,
France, Italy and Canada,” he said.  The world installed 41,236 megawatts of wind farms last
year with about 44 percent of that built in China, GWEC said
today in a  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
