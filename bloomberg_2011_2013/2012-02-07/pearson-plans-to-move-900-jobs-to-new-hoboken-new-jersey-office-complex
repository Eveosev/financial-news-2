Pearson Plc , the owner of the
Financial Times, will relocate 900 jobs to a waterfront
development in Hoboken,  New Jersey , rather than moving some
operations to  New York .  The London-based company’s Pearson Education will keep more
than 1,600 jobs in New Jersey, Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno
said in a statement today. The unit will occupy more than
200,000 square feet (18,600 square meters) on five floors at the
Waterfront Corporate Center III building, being built by SJP
Properties of Parsippany, New Jersey, Pearson said in a separate
statement.  Pearson had planned to relocate to New York its operations
in the New Jersey towns of  Upper Saddle River  and Old Tappan,
Guadagno said. The company will receive an Urban Transit Hub Tax
Credit of as much as $66 million over 10 years for keeping 900
jobs in  northern New Jersey , according to the lieutenant
governor. The company also must maintain at least 1,666 jobs in
the state each year to qualify for the benefit.  Waterfront Corporate Center III is a 520,000-square-foot
building on Hoboken’s River Street, one of three structures with
about 1.5 million square feet of space. Occupants of the other
buildings include publisher  John Wiley & Sons Inc.  and insurance
brokerage  Marsh & McClennan Cos. , according to SJP’s  website.
