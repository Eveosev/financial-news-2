A total of $93.9 million was wagered
on the  New York Giants ’  Super Bowl  victory at Nevada’s 184
sports books, the second most in history.  The Giants beat the  New England  Patriots 21-17 in the
 National Football League ’s championship game two days ago,
scoring the winning touchdown with 57 seconds left at Lucas Oil
Stadium in Indianapolis. The Giants were three-point underdogs.  Nevada’s sports books, most of which are located in  Las
Vegas  and Reno, won $5.06 million on Super Bowl wagers,
according to figures released by the state’s  Gaming Control
Board . The sports books have made a profit on the Super Bowl in
20 of the past 22 years.  This year’s Super Bowl handle in Nevada increased for the
third straight year and fell just short of the record $94.5
million bet in 2006, when the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the
 Seattle  Seahawks 21-10.  It surpassed the $87.5 million total for the  Green Bay
Packers ’ 31-25 win against Pittsburgh last year and the $92.1
million bet on the 2008 Super Bowl, when the Giants upset the
Patriots 17-14 as 12-point underdogs to end New England’s
pursuit of a perfect season.  The Giants’ previous win against the Patriots is the last
time Nevada’s sports books have lost money on the Super Bowl.  While approximately 52 percent of bets were on the Giants,
Nevada’s sports books were big winners on the over/under and on
proposition bets, said RJ Bell, the founder of Las Vegas-based
handicapping information website Pregame.com.  Projected Point Total  The majority of wagers were on the game surpassing the
projected point total of 53, as the Patriots and Giants had
averaged a combined 56.7 points during the regular season.
Sports books also take a commission on all bets, including the
popular so-called prop bets, such as which quarterback would
pass for more yards or whether a team would score in the final 3
1/2 minutes of the game.  “Props overall were a big winner for sports books, as they
nearly always are due to their high commissions,” Bell said in
an e-mail.  While Super Bowl betting topped $90 million for the fifth
time in  Nevada , it amounted to less than 1 percent of the
worldwide wagering action on the game, said Bell. He estimated
that more than $10 billion overall was bet on the Giants’ win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
