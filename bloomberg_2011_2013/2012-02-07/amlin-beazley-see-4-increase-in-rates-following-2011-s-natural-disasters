Amlin Plc  and  Beazley Plc (BEZ) , Lloyd’s
of London insurers, said premium rates during the January policy
renewal period increased as much as 4 percent after the most
costly year for natural disasters on record.  Amlin said revenue so far this year climbed 19 percent to
746.4 million pounds after “a notable uplift in reinsurance
rates,” the London-based firm said today in a statement.
Beazley’s renewal rates increased by between 2 percent and 4
percent Chief Executive Officer Andrew Horton said.  “We’re expecting rates to turn from where they have
been,” Horton said today in a telephone interview. “It’s a
slow and gentle turn, but at least it’s turning.”  Earthquakes in Japan and  New Zealand , windstorms in the
U.S. and flooding in Thailand cost insurers about $105 billion
last year, making it the industry’s most expensive year on
record, surpassing the $101 billion paid out in 2005, when
 Hurricane Katrina  struck  New Orleans , according to  Munich Re .
Losses erode insurers’ capital reserves, forcing them to put up
prices to compensate.  “The Jan. 1 renewal growth looks strong,” Joy Ferneyhough, a London-based analyst at Espirito Santo Investment
Bank, wrote in a note to clients today, referring to Amlin’s
statement. “Both Hannover and Munich Re also spoke of very
strong catastrophe renewals in their calls last week.”  Hannover Re , the world’s fourth-biggest reinsurer, said
rates rose 6 percent for policies renewed in January.  Hardy Talks  The steepest rate increases came in Beazley’s property
reinsurance products, Horton said. The firm is expecting rates
overall to increase by 1 to 2 percent this year following a 1
percent rise in 2011 and a 2 percent fall in 2010, he said.  Beazley’s pretax profit for 2011 dropped 75 percent to
$62.7 million in 2011. That missed the $70.4 million median
 estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Takeover negotiations with Lloyd’s rival  Hardy Underwriting
Bermuda Ltd.  are “ongoing” and any bid would be made using the
firm’s $200 million of surplus capital and $225 million credit
facility, Horton said. Beazley previously had offers for the
firm rejected in 2010.  Amlin, the biggest Lloyd’s insurer by market value, said
losses from the Thai floods will be between 50 million pounds
and 70 million pounds. The bulk of the loss will lie in its
property and catastrophe reinsurance account, it said.  The firm expects to pay out less than 10 million pounds,
net of reinsurance, for the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster
last month.  Amlin rose 0.9 percent to 340 pence as of 8:12 a.m. in
 London  trading, while Beazley dropped 1.9 percent to 141.3
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
