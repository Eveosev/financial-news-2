Google Inc ., the biggest maker of
smartphone software, didn’t offer concessions to allay potential
European Commission concerns over its plan to buy  Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc . for $12.5 billion.  Google didn’t submit remedies by last night’s deadline,
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission in Brussels,
said in a phone interview. The regulator will rule on the deal
by Feb. 13, Colombani said. The commission can either clear the
deal or open an in-depth probe lasting about 90 working days.  Regulatory reviews mean the purchase by Google is likely to
close in 2012, Motorola said in November.  Mountain View ,
California-based Google plans to use Motorola Mobility’s more
than 17,000 patents to protect supporters of its Android
software in licensing and legal disputes with rivals such as
 Apple Inc . and also move into the hardware business.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, declined to
comment on the EU antitrust review.  Motorola Mobility  shares  declined 0.7 percent to $38.55 at
10.40 a.m. in New York trading, after falling as much as 1.5
percent. Google retreated 0.4 percent to $606.82 after falling
as much as 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
