Chinese equities traded in the U.S.
rose, led by  Renren Inc. (RENN)  and  China Unicom (CHU)  ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., as
the prospect of a deal to secure Greece its second bailout
bolstered the appeal of riskier, emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. climbed 0.2 percent to 104.44 yesterday in
New York. Renren, owner of a Chinese social networking website
similar to Facebook Inc.’s, jumped as much as 9.4 percent as
analysts predicted that fourth-quarter sales to be reported as
early as this week will be higher than company estimates.
Wireless operator China Unicom gained as Nomura International
Hong Kong Ltd. reiterated its “buy” rating on the stock.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  will meet with the
leaders of the three parties supporting his government today on
austerity measures needed to secure a second European Union aid
package, said a spokeswoman at the premier’s office who declined
to be named. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reiterated its view that
China is the strongest equity market in Asia.  “With the Greek resolution closer, we are seeing people
move out of safe-haven assets like Treasuries into more risky
assets like stocks,”  Dave Lutz , head of exchange-traded funds
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, said by phone
yesterday. “You’ll see emerging-market stocks outperforming
developed markets if they get this Greek resolution done.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell for a second day,
slipping 0.4 percent to $39.72.  Options on the 25-company ETF are diverging from the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as investors try and lock in gains
from the biggest January rally since 2006. The fund jumped 11
percent last month and is up 14 percent in 2012.  Calls and Puts  Calls and puts on the 25-company iShares FTSE China fund
cost 79 percent more than 30-day SPDR  S&P 500 (SPX)  ETF Trust options
yesterday. That’s the highest premium since April 2010, when
the  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index began a 25 percent drop through
July 2010, and almost double the one-year average. Hong Kong’s
HSI Volatility Index is 29 percent above the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index, near a six-month high.   Renren, based in Beijing, advanced 6.3 percent to $5.23,
snapping a two-day decline.  Fourth-quarter sales rose  to $33.5
million, exceeding the company’s estimate of $31 million to $33
million issued on Nov. 10, according to the average forecast of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company may report its
financial results around Feb. 10, an estimate derived by
Bloomberg based on previous reporting history.  ‘Buy’ Rating  American depositary receipts of  China Unicom (762) , each
representing 10 common shares in the company, advanced 4.3
percent to $18.22, the most in more than two months. Danny Chu,
an analyst at Nomura,  maintained  a 12-month price target of
HK$19.50 ($2.51) on the stock yesterday and retained a “buy”
recommendation. Twenty one analysts out of 38 rate China Unicom,
the nation’s second-largest wireless operator, a “buy” while
10 rate the stock “hold.”  The  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent to 1,347.05, while the
Shanghai Composite dropped 1.7 percent to 2,291.91.  Changyou.com Inc. (CYOU) , the online gaming unit of Chinese
Internet portal operator Sohu.com Inc., climbed 3.6 percent to
$26.22 after 10 analysts reiterated “buy” recommendations on
the shares yesterday.  Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (SHI) , a unit of China’s
largest oil refiner, advanced to a three-month high after the
nation raised domestic fuel tariffs for the first time in 10
months to spur production by refiners.  Retail gasoline and diesel prices rise 300  yuan  ($47.58) a
metric ton from today, the National Development and Reform
Commission, the nation’s top planning agency, said on its
website yesterday.  Crude Climbs  Sinopec Shanghai’s ADRs gained 2.4 percent to $39.08, the
highest level since Nov. 8. PetroChina Co., China’s biggest oil
producer, added 0.7 percent to a nine-month high of $150 in New
York.  Oil for March delivery advanced 1.5 percent to settle at
$98.41 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest
one-day advance in three weeks.  Sina Corp. (SINA) , whose Twitter-like Weibo service in China has
250 million registered users, fell to the lowest level in more
than a week in U.S. trading on a report that Chinese microblog
users in Beijing are being required to use their real names in
postings.  Sina, based in Shanghai, slid 6.6 percent to $65.43, the
most in a month. The stock has jumped 26 percent this year.  ‘Less Attractive’  Operators of so-called microblog platforms will block posts
from users who haven’t registered their real names by March 16,
Caijing Magazine reported on its website yesterday, citing an
unidentified official with the Beijing municipal government.  “Sina’s value as an online platform to advertisers will be
less attractive because use of Weibo service may decline if
people need to use real names even for linking to others’
postings,” said Echo He, a senior analyst at Maxim Group LLC in
New York, who rates Sina shares as a “sell.” “Sina’s stock
valuation is already high compared with other major Internet
names in China, like Baidu.”  Sina is  trading  at 59 times its estimated earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares a ratio
of 31 for  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , China’s biggest online search engine, and
23 for  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , the nation’s largest Internet
company by market value.  Baidu’s ADRs fell 1.4 percent to $129.49 yesterday, while
Tencent’s slipped 0.3 percent to $23.79, a more-than one-week
low.  The yuan strengthened 0.1 percent to 6.3049 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  The currency has weakened 0.2 percent this year, after
rising 4.7 percent in 2011.  Donald Kohn , a former vice chairman
of the  Federal Reserve , said “the Chinese will need to allow
the  exchange rate  to fluctuate” during a panel discussion at
the Brookings Institution in Washington yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
