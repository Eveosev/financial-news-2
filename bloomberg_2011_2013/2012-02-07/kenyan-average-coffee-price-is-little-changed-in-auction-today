Kenyan coffee prices were little
changed at an auction today, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all coffee sold fell to $280.34 a
bag, from $280.87 last week, the Nairobi-based exchange said in
an e-mailed statement. Sales rose 20 percent to 7,896 bags,
worth $2.69 million, and supplies increased by 1.9 percent to
27,406, compared to last week’s auction.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade dropped to
$377.27 for a 50-kilogram (110 pound) bag, compared to $405.73 a
week earlier, the exchange said. Supplies of the grade fell 13
percent to 4,574 bags from 5,267 bags, while sales fell 55
percent to 261 bags from 584 bags.  Kenya harvests most of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is collected from April to
June. The nation, whose output fell 13 percent in the year ended
Sept. 30, hasn’t made a forecast for this year, Isaac Muchomba,
secretary for Kenya Coffee Traders Association, said in an
interview today.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S. dollars
for a 50-kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
