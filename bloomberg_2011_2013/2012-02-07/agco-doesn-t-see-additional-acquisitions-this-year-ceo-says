Agco Corp. , the world’s third-largest
farm machinery maker, doesn’t expect more acquisitions in 2012
after making its biggest purchase ever last year.  “We have nothing in the pipeline,” Martin Richenhagen,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Duluth, Georgia-
based company, said in a phone interview today. “There are not
too many targets available,” and Agco is focused on integrating
GSI Holdings, purchased last year for $940 million, he said.  Agco bought GSI in December to expand into production of
silos and equipment for raising poultry and hogs. The company
also announced plans last year to buy an 80 percent stake in
Chinese equipment maker Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co. and a 60
percent stake in  Brazil ’s Santal Equipamentos, which
manufactures sugar cane harvesters.  Fourth-quarter net income more than tripled to $285.3
million, or $2.90 a share, from $85.2 million, or 87 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today. Excluding acquisition
costs and a tax gain, per-share profit was $1.44, topping the
$1.33 average of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 16 percent in the quarter to $2.52 billion from
$2.17 billion as demand increased in  Europe  and  North America .  Deere & Co., based in Moline, Illinois, and Amsterdam-based
CNH Global NV are the two largest farm-equipment makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
