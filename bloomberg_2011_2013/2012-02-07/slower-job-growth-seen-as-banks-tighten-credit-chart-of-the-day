Companies are poised to create jobs
more slowly later this year because bankers have become less
inclined to lend them money, according to Tobias Levkovich,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Levkovich drew this
conclusion: by looking at the percentage of banks that are
tightening credit to larger companies. The figures come from a
quarterly survey of senior loan officers by the  Federal Reserve .  Banks that made loans harder to get during last year’s
fourth quarter exceeded those easing credit by 5.4 percentage
points, according to survey results released last week. It was
the first time in nine quarters that U.S. lenders leaned toward
stricter criteria.  Changes in lending standards precede shifts in job creation
by about three quarters, Levkovich wrote in a Feb. 3 report. The
New York-based strategist determined the time lag by comparing
the survey data to year-over-year percentage changes in the
number of employees other than farm workers.  “Investors should expect a significant slowing of job
growth in the months ahead,” he wrote. Last month, the  U.S.
economy  added 243,000 jobs. The increase was the biggest since
April and helped reduce the  unemployment rate  to 8.3 percent,
the lowest since February 2009.  Capital spending  may suffer as well, he added, because
credit tends to tighten three quarters before the expenditures
slump. Businesses have increased outlays for eight consecutive
quarters, according to  data  compiled by the Commerce Department
and cited in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
