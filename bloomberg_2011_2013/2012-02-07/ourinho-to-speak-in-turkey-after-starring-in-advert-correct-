(Corrects spelling of Mourinho’s name.)  Real Madrid soccer team coach  Jose
Mourinho  will speak at two conferences in Istanbul and Ankara on
“successful leadership” upon the invitation of Turkish
homebuilder  Sinpas Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS , for which
he has done work in the past.  Mourinho’s speeches will be on Feb. 27 and Feb. 28, Sinpas
said in an e-mailed statement today. Mourinho previously
appeared in television and radio adverts for Sinpas, which
claims buying its apartments are better than investing in gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
