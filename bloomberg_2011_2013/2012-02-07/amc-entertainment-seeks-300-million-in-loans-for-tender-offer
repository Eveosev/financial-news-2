AMC Entertainment Inc., owner of the
second-largest U.S. movie-theater chain, is seeking $300 million
in term loans to fund a tender offer and to repay outstanding
debt.  The new loans will mature in 2018, the Kansas City,
Missouri-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  AMC plans to commence a cash tender offer to purchase as
much as $160 million of its outstanding $300 million 8 percent
senior subordinated notes due 2014, according to the filing.  Moody’s Investors Service rated the proposed term loan Ba2,
saying in a report today that “the transaction favorably
extends the maturity profile and could result in a modest
reduction in interest expense.”  AMC has leverage, or debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, of 8 times, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
