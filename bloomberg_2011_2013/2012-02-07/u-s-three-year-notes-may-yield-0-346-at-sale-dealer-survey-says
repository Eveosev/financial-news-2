The Treasury Department’s $32 billion
sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 0.346 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The amount being offered is unchanged from the previous 16
sales of the maturity. The notes, which mature in February 2015,
yielded 0.333 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time. Last month’s auction of three-year notes
drew a yield of 0.370 percent and the record low of 0.334
percent was set Sept. 12.  The Jan. 10 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.73, the highest since at least 1993, when the government began
releasing the data. It compared with an average of 3.35 for the
past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 38.5 percent of the notes at the
January offering, compared with 39.1 percent of the notes at the
December sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 37.4
percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 5.3 percent of
the notes at the last sale, versus 7 percent at the December
offering, and an average of 11.2 percent for the past 10
auctions.  Three-year notes returned 3.4 percent last year, compared
with a gain of 9.8 percent for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury is selling $72 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $24 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year debt on Feb. 9. This week’s
auctions will raise $22.4 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total $49.6 billion.  The amount of marketable securities outstanding  rose  to
$10.07 trillion as of Jan. 31, up from $9.94 trillion at the end
of last year.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
