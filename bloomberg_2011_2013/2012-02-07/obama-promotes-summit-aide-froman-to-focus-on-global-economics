Mike Froman, President  Barack Obama ’s
liaison at international summits, has been promoted to assistant
to the president for international economic affairs, signaling
an increased administration attention to the crisis in Europe
and the challenge posed by  China , according to an administration
official.  Froman is currently a deputy on both the National Economic
Committee and the National Security Council. He will continue in
those roles while directly reporting to the president in his new
responsibilities, according to the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity before the change was official announced.  Froman also will continue coordinating international
summits for the president and is preparing the Group of 20
leader’s meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
