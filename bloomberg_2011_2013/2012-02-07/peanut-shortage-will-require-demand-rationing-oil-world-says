World production of peanuts is
forecast to slip 0.7 percent in 2011-12 after drought reduced
the crop in the U.S. and  Senegal , causing a shortfall that will
require global demand rationing this season, Oil World said.  The harvest of peanuts, or groundnuts, is forecast to
decline to 24.8 million metric tons from 25 million tons, on top
of “relatively low” carryover stocks, the Hamburg-based
oilseed researcher said today in a report.  U.S. prices for  peanuts , crushed to make cooking oil and
used in Unilever’s Skippy peanut butter and Mars Inc.’s Snickers
bars, jumped 49 percent in the past 12 months to 33.7 cents per
pound in the week ended Jan. 27, government data show.  Peanut
butter  retail prices jumped 8.6 percent to $2.43 a pound in
December from a month earlier, the highest in records dating to
1984, according to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .  “A severe shortage of groundnuts has developed in recent
months for both direct food use and crushing,” Oil World wrote.
“World demand will need to be rationed this season after
growing steadily in recent years.”  Rotterdam groundnut prices were “firm” at $2,800 a ton on
the basis of cost, insurance and freight on Feb. 2, up from
$1,580 a ton in January 2011, Oil World said.  Peanut  production in Senegal is forecast to slump to
450,000 tons in 2011-12 from 840,000 tons a year earlier, while
the U.S. harvest is estimated at 1.24 million tons from 1.41
million tons the previous year, Oil World said.  Indian Crop  India ’s crop of peanuts is forecast to drop to 3.95 million
tons from 4.09 million tons, according to Oil World. The
country’s exports of the oilseed will slide to 390,000 tons from
517,000 tons, it said.  China ’s groundnut harvest is estimated at 10.5 million tons
from 10 million tons, while exports are forecast to gain to
310,000 tons from 307,000 tons in the season through October as
domestic consumption climbs.  “In China, the rapid growth of groundnut demand has
outpaced domestic production in recent years,” Oil World said.
“It took strong price signals from the world market to reverse
the downtrend of Chinese exports in the last quarter of 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
