Balfour Beatty Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest building company, sought a court order blocking a strike
by construction workers over pay.  A London hearing today was adjourned until 2 p.m. in a
clash over whether a vote held by the Unite union on the strike
was legal.  Members of Unite employed by Balfour Beatty Engineering
Services voted two to one in favor of a strike, the union said
on its  website  on Feb. 2. Unite claims a new employment deal
will lead to pay cuts of as much as 30 percent and worse terms
for construction staff.  Strike action at the company may affect U.K. infrastructure
projects including Crossrail, a London train line, and new power
stations, Unite said.  At a Feb. 2 court hearing, Balfour Beatty’s lawyer Bruce
Carr accused Unite of orchestrating illegal strikes in the past.
There have been “unlawful occasions of industrial action for
which we say Unite is responsible,” he said.  Unite spokeswoman Liane Groves didn’t immediately comment
today. Balfour Beatty spokeswoman Marjorie Hooper didn’t
immediately respond to a call requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
