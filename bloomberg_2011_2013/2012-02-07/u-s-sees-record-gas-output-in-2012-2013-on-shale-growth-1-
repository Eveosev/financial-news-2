The U.S. boosted estimates for
natural gas production this year and in 2013 on increased output
from shale reserves.  Marketed gas output will average 67.64 billion cubic feet a
day this year, up from 66.15 billion last year, the Energy
Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook ,
released today in  Washington . The department had pegged 2012
output at 67.34 billion in its January report.  Production in 2013 was estimated at 68.52 billion cubic
feet a day, up from 68.04 billion estimated last month.  Gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , will
average $3.35 per million British thermal units this year, down
from the previous estimate of $3.53, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  U.S. gas output grew at a record 4.8 billion cubic feet a
day last year, “driven in large part by increases in shale gas
production,” the department said in the report. Gains in 2012
and 2013 will “occur at a much lower rate than in 2011 as low
prices reduce new drilling plans.”  U.S. stockpiles may end the winter heating season on March
31 at more than 2 trillion cubic feet and set records at the end
of October 2012 and 2013, the report showed. The agency
 estimates  inventories will peak at 3.983 trillion cubic feet in
October and 4 trillion a year later.  “Working natural gas inventories continue to set new
seasonal record highs as the unusually warm winter has
contributed to much lower-than-normal inventory draws,”
according to the EIA, Energy Department’s the statistical arm.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 8.7 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $2.463 per million Btu at 1:14 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Gas is down 18 percent this year and dipped
to a 10-year low of $2.231 on Jan. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
