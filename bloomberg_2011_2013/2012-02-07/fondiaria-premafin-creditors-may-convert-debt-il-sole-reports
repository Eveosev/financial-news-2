Fondiaria-SAI SpA  and  Premafin
Finanziaria SpA (PF) ’s bank creditors may convert loans into equity
as part of a plan approved last month to merge the companies
with  Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) ,  Il Sole 24 Ore  said.  Banks, including  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Mediobanca SpA (MB) , may swap
as much as 200 million euros ($263 million) of Premafin’s total
debt of 340 million euros, the newspaper reported without saying
how it got the information. Mediobanca may also convert part of
the 1 billion euros of loans given to Fondiaria, according to Il
Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
