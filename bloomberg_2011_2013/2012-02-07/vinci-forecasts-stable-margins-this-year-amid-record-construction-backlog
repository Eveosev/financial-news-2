Vinci SA ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
reported 2011 profit that met analysts’ estimates and predicted
that it will maintain operating margins this year as a record
backlog offsets an economic slowdown in Europe.  Net income rose to 1.90 billion euros ($2.52 billion) in
2011 from 1.78 billion euros a year earlier, the company, based
in the Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, said in a statement
today. Profit was in line with the 1.91 billion-euro average of
13 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “With greater uncertainty surrounding prospects for
economic growth in Europe, there could be a downturn in orders
in some segments and geographical areas during the year,” Vinci
said. “Business should be at least flat in 2012,” and the
company targets “the maintenance of its operating margins at
the good levels achieved in 2011.”  The sovereign-debt crisis confronting countries using the
euro may lead to a recession in Europe this year and exacerbate
an economic slowdown in  emerging markets , according to World
Bank estimates.  Vinci’s revenue climbed 11 percent to 37 billion euros in
2011, helped by the  acquisitions  in 2010 of engineering company
Cegelec, facility-management provider Faceo and some quarries
from Anglo American Plc’s Tarmac division, as well as by traffic
and toll increases at the group’s highways. The backlog rose
18 percent from a year earlier to a record 30.6 billion euros as
of Dec. 31.  Net debt fell to 12.6 billion euros at the end of 2011 from
13.1 billion euros a year earlier. The French company plans to
raise the  dividend  to 1.77 euros a share from 1.67 euros a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
