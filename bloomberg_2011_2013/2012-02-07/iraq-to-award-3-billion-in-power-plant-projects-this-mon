Iraq will award seven contracts this
month with a combined value of $3 billion to build 7,000
megawatts of electricity generation, part of a three-year plan
to expand power capacity, an Electricity Ministry official said.  Companies from Iran,  Europe , Egypt and  South Korea  are
bidding for the orders, said Kosay Sattar, the ministry’s
director general of planning.  “Within two weeks, we anticipate we will hand over the
sites to the winners,” he said today in an interview in Doha,
Qatar, where he was attending a conference. The ministry has
signed contracts with  General Electric Co.  and  Siemens AG  for
the equipment needed to produce the plants, he said.  Iraq is building power plants after sanctions and war
reduced electricity capacity and caused blackouts. The country
will invest about $15 billion by 2015 to increase capacity by
20,000 megawatts to about 27,000 megawatts, Sattar said.  Contracts have already been signed for the remainder of the
expansion, which includes 13,000 megawatts of gas-fired plants
and 7,000 megawatts of thermal  power plants , he said. The
government is financing the project without borrowing, according
to Sattar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
