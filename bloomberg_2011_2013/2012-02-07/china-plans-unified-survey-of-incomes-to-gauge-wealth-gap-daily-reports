China  will carry out a comprehensive
survey of urban and rural salaries that may help better gauge
its income gap, the China Daily reported today, citing Xie
Hongguang, a deputy head of the  National Bureau of Statistics .  The survey will cover 140,000 households in urban and rural
areas, and results will be published in 2013, Xie was quoted  as
saying . A press official at the bureau, who declined to be
identified because of agency rules, confirmed the report.  Inaccurate information and fragmented efforts in the past
have hindered government attempts to produce a nationwide Gini
coefficient, which measures the income gap, according to the
head of the statistics bureau, Ma Jiantang. The  World Bank  said
China’s Gini coefficient reached 0.47 in 2009, exceeding the 0.4
mark used as a predictor for social unrest.  The index stood at 0.3897 for China’s rural households last
year, Ma said at a  press briefing  on Jan. 17. The bureau didn’t
disclose an urban coefficient because it couldn’t obtain
accurate information from high-income urban families, Ma said.  The urban disposable income stood at 21,810 yuan ($3,458)
in 2011, more than triple the level of the rural cash income,
according to the bureau’s latest data. The index may have
climbed from less than 0.3 a quarter century ago, Li Shi,
professor of economics, School of Economics and Business at
Beijing Normal University, estimated in March last year.  The index stood at 0.48 in 2010 for  Singapore , according
official data, while  Hong Kong  recorded the biggest wealth
disparity in  Asia , with a Gini coefficient of 0.53 in 2008,
according to data compiled by the  United Nations . A measure of 0
means all money is evenly distributed; 1 means one person has it
all.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
