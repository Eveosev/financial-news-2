Yemen’s political parties began a
campaign today to urge citizens to vote in the Feb. 21
presidential election.  Abdurabu Mansur Hadi, the interim leader and vice
president, has been endorsed by all parties represented in
parliament and will be elected to replace outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Because he is the only candidate, there are
fears of a low turnout.  “Your vote protects Yemen,” read a giant poster in the
capital, Sana’a. “February 21 is the day for change,” read
another.  Hadi will run Yemen for two years before parliamentary
elections. During that time, a new constitution will be drafted
and army forces restructured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
