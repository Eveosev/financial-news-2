Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , a unit of
the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker, had its biggest
two-day drop in more than a year after Citigroup Inc. cut the
stock’s rating to “sell” citing stronger competition.  The seller of Fair & Lovely lotions, Ponds creams and Knorr
soups fell as much as 2.3 percent in Mumbai trading, extending
its decline in the past two sessions to 5.8 percent, the most
intraday since January 2011. The  stock  traded down 2 percent at
379.35 rupees as of 11:36 a.m. local time and was the  second-
biggest loser  on the benchmark Sensex.  Sales of Hindustan Unilever’s personal care products grew
14 percent in the quarter ended December 31, the company said in
a statement yesterday. That growth was weaker than some analysts
had estimated amid a slowing Indian economy.  “With this kind of growth rate, profitability will also be
under pressure,” said Naveen Trivedi, an analyst with
Infinity.com Financial Securities Ltd. in Mumbai, who said he
had expected growth of 18.5 percent in personal care sales.
“Overall consumer demand was low in the quarter.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India in January cut its growth
forecast for  Asia ’s third-largest economy to 7 percent in the
year through March from the 7.6 percent predicted in October.  Hindustan’s Unilever’s net income rose 18 percent to 7.54
billion rupees, beating analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
