Deutsche Lufthansa AG  will deepen the
integration of its brands in a savings drive aimed at boosting
annual earnings by 1.5 billion-euro ($2 billion) by 2014.  The cost cuts will come through increased synergies and
restructuring among brands that include cargo, engineering and
catering, and are necessary to finance future fleet investment,
 Europe ’s second-biggest airline said today in a statement.  The profit-improvement plan -- named SCORE, or Synergies,
Costs, Organization, Revenues, Execution -- follows on from a
package that saved 1 billion euros between 2008 and 2011.
Cologne, Germany-based Lufthansa has already trimmed capacity
growth for the current 12 months to 3 percent from a planned 9
percent after saying Sept. 20 that 2011 operating profit would
fall short of the previous year’s 876 million euros.  “It’s the right step, and if successfully implemented will
be a major move forward on the road toward achieving long-term
profitability targets,” said Hartmut Moers, an analyst at WestLB
in Dusseldorf, who recommends buying the airline’s shares.  Lufthansa fell as much as 2.5 percent and traded 1.2
percent lower at 11.05 euros as of 3:45 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  The integration of purchasing capabilities is among the
planned synergies, Lufthansa Cargo head Karl Ulrich Garnadt said
last week. Stefan Lauer, head of group airlines, said in an
internal newsletter that if Lufthansa can’t improve its margin
beyond 3 percent it will become a “second division” carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
