Brazil ’s real fell for a second day
on speculation the central bank will continue to intervene to
contain the currency’s gains.  The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.7276 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:43 a.m. in Sao Paulo, from 1.7257 yesterday.  Policy makers bought dollars in the foreign-exchange market
for a second day yesterday, paying an average of 1.7170 reais
each for an unspecified amount. The central bank bought dollars
in the forwards market on Feb. 3, the first transaction of that
type since July.  “The central bank is the only buyer of all the dollars
that are entering the country,” Alfredo Barbutti, an economist
at Liquidez DTVM Ltda., said by phone from  Sao Paulo . The bank’s
actions make investors more cautious about betting on the real’s
depreciation, Barbutti said.  Yields on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract due
in January 2013 slid two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 9.48 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
