Chimei Innolux Corp .,  Taiwan ’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, is negotiating with
banks for syndicated loans worth about NT$200 billion ($6.8
billion), Chief Financial Officer Eddie Chen said today.  Most of the  loans  will be denominated in Taiwan dollars and
the rest in U.S. currency, Chen said. Chimei Innolux, based in
Miaoli, Taiwan, paid the interest on a loan due last month and
has included the unpaid principal of about NT$5 billion to NT$6
billion in the current loan talks, he said.  “There’s a lot of issues still under discussion,” Chen
said in a phone interview today. “The timetable is also part of
the process of negotiation.”  A consortium of banks may sign a loan with Chimei Innolux
as early as next month, Susan Chang, chairwoman of state-owned
Taiwan Financial Holdings Co., said today in comments broadcast
on Unique TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
