Overseas  investors  bought a net  11
billion rupees  ($226.9 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
raising their investment in the equities this year to 173.1
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 35.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
24.1 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They sold a net 1.33 billion rupees
of bonds, paring total inflow into debt this year to 161.7
billion rupees, the data  show .  The flows helped the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index
post its best January gain since 1994 and fueled the rupee’s
record monthly advance. They invested 421 billion rupees in
bonds last year.  Foreigners have invested 4.617 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.369 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. Investments in debt increased after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government raised the cap on foreign
ownership of local currency bonds by 20 percent to $60 billion
in November to stem a slide in the rupee. The currency tumbled
16 percent in 2011,  Asia ’s worst performer.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
