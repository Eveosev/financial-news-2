U.S. stocks advanced, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to its highest level since May 2008, as
 Greece  made progress on measures to secure international aid.  Seven out of 10  groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained, helping the measure rebound from an earlier decline.
 McDonald’s Corp. , the world’s biggest restaurant chain, added
1.4 percent ahead of its sales report.  Yum! Brands Inc. , owner
of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, climbed 2.6 percent
as earnings surged 30 percent.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
biggest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, increased 5.2 percent as profit beat  estimates .  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,347.05 at 4 p.m. New York
time, wiping out an earlier decline of as much as 0.6 percent.
The Dow advanced 33.07 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,878.20.  “We need to see some real austerity from Greece," Hank Smith , chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in
Radnor,  Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. His firm
manages about $6.5 billion. "When we see that, we will have
more confidence that  Europe  is serious about growth. I have
confidence that we’ll get some sort of resolution that allows
for additional funding."  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  postponed a meeting
with heads of the political parties supporting his caretaker
government a second time in as many days as the government and
international creditors haggled over terms to secure a second
aid package. Papademos will meet with the leaders in Athens
tomorrow, instead of tonight as previously scheduled, a
spokeswoman for his office said. In the U.S.,  consumer borrowing 
rose more than forecast in December.  Earnings Season  Today’s gain put the S&P 500 about 1.2 percent away from
its peak nine months ago, which would send it to the highest
level since June 2008. The index rose 7.1 percent this year amid
better-than-expected economic data and corporate profits.
 Earnings  beat projections at 68 percent of the 280 companies in
the  S&P 500  that reported quarterly results since Jan. 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 Consumer Services Index had the biggest advance
among 24 industries, rising 0.9 percent.  McDonald’s  added 1.4 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$100.91. It may say tomorrow that sales at global stores open at
least 13 months gained 5.8 percent in January, according to the
average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Yum  gained 2.6 percent to $64.85. The company, with about
18,800 restaurants outside the U.S., said fourth-quarter sales
at stores open at least 12 months grew 21 percent in  China . Yum
said it opened a record 656 stores last year in the Asian
nation, where it gets more than 40 percent of its  revenue .  Coca-Cola  Coca-Cola Co.  advanced 0.8 percent to $68.55. The largest
soft-drink maker reported fourth-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates as teas and juices boosted sales in  Asia .  Anadarko climbed 5.2 percent to $87.21. Output rose 12
percent to the equivalent of  683,000 barrels of oil  a day during
the last three months of 2011, The Woodlands, Texas-based
company said. Sales volumes climbed to 63 million barrels at an
average price of $104.82 a barrel of oil and condensate, more
than the $98 estimate from Raymond James & Associates Inc.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.  rose 0.7 percent to $75.51.
The iron-ore producer yesterday sold for 6.4 times its cash from
operations, after deducting capital expenses, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was less than every other metals or
mining company in the U.S. or  Canada  exceeding $5 billion in
market value, and a 70 percent discount to the median.  Takeover Target  With Glencore International Plc and Xstrata Plc agreeing to
merge to create a $90 billion global mining company, Cliffs may
attract interest from BHP Billiton Ltd. or Rio Tinto Group,
Lutetia Capital said. An acquirer could pay a 30 percent premium
and still get Cliffs for less than any comparable publicly
traded mining company versus its  free cash flow , the data show.  "There could be more vertical integration” after Glencore
and Xstrata, Mark Keller, chief executive officer of Confluence
Investment Management in  St. Louis , which manages $1 billion
including shares of Cliffs, said in a telephone interview. As a
result, “the first-rate mid-sized companies like Cliffs I think
potentially become takeover targets,” he said.  Becton Dickinson & Co. slipped 3.8 percent to $77.51. The
maker of medical devices and supplies cut its forecast for 2012
to no more than $5.70 a share, below an earlier projection of as
much as $5.85 and the average analyst estimate of $5.80.  Walgreen Co. , the largest U.S. drugstore chain, slumped 2.4
percent to $33.46. Citigroup cut its recommendation for the
shares to “sell” from “neutral.”  Bull Market  A potential retreat in U.S. stocks will set the stage for
the S&P 500 to approach 1,370, the level where the current  bull
market  ran out of steam last year, according to analysts who
study charts to predict market moves.  The S&P 500 had gained for five weeks through Feb. 3, the
longest streak in a year, sending its 14-day  relative strength
index , which measures the degree that gains and losses outpace
each other, to the highest level since February 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We need to pause, rest, consolidate in order to stay
healthy,” Carter Worth, New York-based chief market technician
at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in a note yesterday. “Any such
consolidation would cure the market from a tad unhealthy right
back to very healthy, and would be the perfect ‘setup’ for a
breakout-type move to new 52-week highs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
