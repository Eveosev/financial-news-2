A retreat in U.S. stocks will set the
stage for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to approach 1,370, the
level where the current  bull market  ran out of steam last year,
according to analysts who study charts to predict market moves.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,344.33 yesterday on concern over  Europe ’s debt
crisis as German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said time was running
out for  Greece  to accept conditions for a bailout. The S&P 500
had gained for five weeks, the longest streak in a year, sending
its 14-day  relative strength index , which measures the degree
that gains and losses outpace each other, to the highest level
since February 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We need to pause, rest, consolidate in order to stay
healthy,” Carter Worth, New York-based chief market technician
at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in a note yesterday. “Any such
consolidation would cure the market from a tad unhealthy right
back to very healthy, and would be the perfect ‘setup’ for a
breakout-type move to new 52-week highs.”  The  S&P 500  peaked at 1,370.58 intraday in May as concern
about Europe’s debt crisis interrupted a rally that pushed the
index up 103 percent from a 12-year low. The benchmark gauge
slumped 19 percent between April 29 and Oct. 3 as Europe was
forced to bail out Greece while Congress and the administration
of President  Barack Obama  struggled over deficit cuts.  Best Return  The index has since rebounded 22 percent on better-than-
expected economic data and corporate earnings, generating the
best return for any similar period since November 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Its RSI reached 73.6 last week, the data show. Some
technical analysts consider RSI readings above 70 a sign that
stocks have risen too far, too fast. The proportion of New York
Stock Exchange stocks trading above their  200-day averages  rose
to 68 percent, the most since May, according to the data.  “The persistency of both price appreciation and breadth
since the beginning of the year suggests the next pullback will
be a precursor to another attack on the 2011 highs,” Instinet
Inc. said in a Feb. 3 note co-written by John Schlitz, chief
U.S. market technician at New York-based company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
