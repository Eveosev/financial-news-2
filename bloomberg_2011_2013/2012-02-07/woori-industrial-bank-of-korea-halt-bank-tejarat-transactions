Woori Finance Holdings Co. ’s banking
unit and  Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  halted transactions with Bank
Tejarat as of Jan. 23 following U.S. Treasury Department
sanctions against the Iranian Bank,  South Korea ’s Knowledge
Economy Ministry said.  Seoul-based Woori Bank and IBK stopped offering credit and
wire transfers of cash after Jan. 23 and the ministry will
prepare measures to help local companies that may have
difficulties as a result of the  Iran  trade sanctions, it said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The Treasury Department last month targeted Bank Tejarat,
Iran’s third-largest bank, for providing financial services to
the country’s banks and companies that are under international
sanctions for involvement in Iran’s nuclear and missile
proliferation. Financial institutions anywhere in the world that
do business with the bank risk being cut off themselves from the
U.S. financial system.  Woori Bank said it stopped businesses with the Iranian
lender via an e-mailed response to a Bloomberg News query. No
one at Industrial Bank of  Korea  was available for comment and it
didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Asia Economic Daily earlier reported the banks’ move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
