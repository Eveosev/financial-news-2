Corn dropped for a second day as a
survey showed that farmers in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower, will plant the most acres since 1944, offsetting crop
losses from a drought in  South America .  Corn for March delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.40 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. It traded at
$6.4275 at 3:43 p.m. in  Singapore .  Farmers in the U.S., also the largest shipper, will
probably increase planting to 94.329 million acres (38.2 million
hectares) this year, up 2.6 percent from a year ago, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  “The market expects U.S. corn plantings to increase
substantially,”  Michael Pitts , commodity sales director at
National Australia Bank Ltd., said in Sydney today. “We’ll see
a production increase in the new crop. That has a certain
offsetting benefit to losses” in South America, he said.  Corn output in  Argentina , the world’s second-largest
shipper, will probably reach 22.25 million metric tons, smaller
than the 26 million tons predicted by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  last month, after a drought caused by the La Nina
phenomenon parched crops, a separate Bloomberg survey showed.  In Brazil, the fourth-biggest exporter, production will
probably be 59.61 million tons, compared with USDA’s forecast of
61 million tons, according to the survey. The agency is set to
release its latest global supply outlook on Feb. 9 in  Washington .  Soybeans Drop  Soybeans declined for the first time in six days, snapping
the longest winning streak since Dec. 27, as analysts expected
acreage in the U.S., the largest grower and exporter, to rise
0.4 percent to 75.309 million acres, the fifth-most ever.  The March-delivery contract dropped 0.2 percent to $12.30 a
bushel, erasing an earlier gain of 0.5 percent.  The USDA may lower its output forecast for  Brazil , the
second-largest producer after the U.S., to 71.76 million tons
from a January estimate of 74 million tons, according to the
average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
harvest in Argentina, the third-largest, may be lowered to 48.58
million tons from 50.5 million tons, the survey shows.  Wheat for March delivery declined 0.2 percent to $6.67 a
bushel, after advancing 1.2 percent yesterday on speculation
that cold weather in France, Germany and Ukraine will damage
dormant crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
