Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-
largest mining company, and partners approved a $3.4 billion
expansion of its  iron ore  operations in  Western Australia  as
part of a plan to boost output by more than 50 percent.  Rio will spend $2.2 billion to extend the life of the
Nammuldi iron ore mine in the state’s Pilbara region to increase
output capacity to 283 million metric tons a year, the London-
based company said today in a statement. A further $1.2 billion
will be invested on initial work for port and rail at Cape
Lambert, needed to boost capacity to 353 million tons, it said.  “We are bringing new iron ore production on stream at a
time when demand from Asian markets is forecast to grow strongly,
while industry supply growth remains constrained,”  Sam Walsh ,
Rio’s iron ore and Australia chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  Rio Tinto ’s goal to increase the size of its iron
ore operations in Western Australia by more than 50 percent is
“on track,” he said.  Production capacity of 283 million tons will be reached in
the second half of 2013, Rio said today. The Nammuldi expansion
will deliver first iron ore in the third quarter of 2014, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
