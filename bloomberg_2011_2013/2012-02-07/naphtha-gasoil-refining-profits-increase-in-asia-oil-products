Asia naphtha’s premium to  Brent crude 
widened by the most in almost three weeks. Gasoil’s crack spread
rose, signaling more profit for refiners making the distillate
fuel. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought gasoline in  Singapore .  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $124.20 a metric ton at 3 p.m. Singapore time from $97.58
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread, a measure of profit from making the petrochemical
feedstock, gained 27 percent today, the most since Jan. 18.  Shell, the biggest reported buyer of 95-RON gasoline in
Singapore last month, purchased 50,000 barrels from PetroChina
Co. at $127.50 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders who monitored transactions on the Platts window.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 90 cents to $19.35 a barrel at 2:13 p.m. Singapore
time, based on data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
 crack spread , a measure of refining profit, widened the most
since Dec. 16.  Jet fuel  fell 20 cents to 50 cents a barrel below gasoil,
the biggest discount so far this month PVM data showed. This
 regrade  has been negative since Jan. 16, indicating it is
unprofitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil increased 22 cents to $2.62 a barrel below Dubai
crude at 2:13 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. The
 discount  narrowed for a second day, signaling reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke   fuel oil  to  380-centistoke 
grade declined 75 cents to $8.50 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  is the narrowest since Nov. 3, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, advanced more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Tenders  Litasco SA bought 40,000 tons of diesel with a maximum
sulfur content of 1 percent for February loading from Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. at about 50 cents a barrel below Middle East
benchmark prices, two traders said.  Refinery News  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. said five people are missing
after a cave-in at an undersea tunnel at its Mizushima refinery
in western  Japan , The accident won’t affect pipelines and output
from the Mizushima A and B plants, which have a combined
capacity of 365,000 barrels a day.  Caltex  Australia  Ltd. will conduct maintenance at its
Kurnell refinery in Australia for one month in the second half
of the year, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. It
is also planning work on a crude unit at its Lytton refinery for
about a month in the first half of the year. The Kurnell plant

can process 109,000 barrels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
