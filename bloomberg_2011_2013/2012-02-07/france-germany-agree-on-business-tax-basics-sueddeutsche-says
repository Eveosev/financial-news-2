France and  Germany  have agreed on
basic principles for more standardizing of business taxes in
both countries, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The aim of a joint agreement will be to reduce levels of
bureaucracy, to cut businessesâ€™ operating costs and to decrease
double taxation, thereby increasing competitiveness,
Sueddeutsche said.  A detailed blueprint will be drawn up from the basic
agreement by Jan. 2013, and implemented legislatively in the
following months, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
