Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. lawmakers risk slowing the economic rebound
if they let tax cuts expire on Jan. 1, 2013, without
“compensating action.”  “There will be a very sharp change in the stance of the
federal government, which by itself -- with no compensating
action -- would slow the recovery,” Bernanke said in testimony
to the Senate Budget Committee today.  “As we get closer to Jan. 1, and Congress has not given a
clear road map for how it plans to proceed, that would certainly
affect planning business decisions, household decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
