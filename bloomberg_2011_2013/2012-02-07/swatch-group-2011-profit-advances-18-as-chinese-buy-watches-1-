Swatch Group AG , the largest maker of
Swiss watches, reported an 18 percent gain in 2011 profit as
Chinese consumers bought more Omega and Breguet timepieces.  Net income rose to 1.27 billion Swiss francs ($1.4 billion)
from 1.07 billion francs a year earlier, the Biel-based company
said in a statement today. The average of 15 analysts’  estimates 
gathered by Bloomberg was 1.28 billion francs. Revenue rose 11
percent to 6.76 billion francs.  Swatch is tapping growth in the Greater China region, where
rising incomes are fueling demand for  luxury goods . Swiss watch
exports climbed 19 percent last year to a record 19.3 billion
francs, with consumers in Asia accounting for more than half of
the timepieces sold. Growth will probably continue in  2012 ,
though “this is more and more challenging due to the high
benchmark,” the company said.  “Revenue was a bit light of expectations, but watches are
going great guns and the outlook was solid enough,” said Jon
Cox, head of Swiss research at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich.  A strong franc, which cuts the value of sales generated in
dollars and euros, reduced revenue by about 700 million francs.  Watches and Jewelry  Sales of watches and jewelry climbed 14 percent to 5.95
billion francs. The operating margin narrowed to 22.7 percent
from 23.9 percent a year earlier because of higher prices for
gold and diamonds. The unit had “double-digit” growth in
January.  Revenue from the unit that makes components and watch
mechanisms rose 34 percent to 1.97 billion francs. Production
“bottlenecks” remain even though the company expanded its
manufacturing capacity, Swatch said. Sales at the electronics
systems business declined 23 percent to 334 million francs, hurt
by the strong franc and a “weakening in certain key markets.”  Swatch proposed a 15 percent dividend increase to 5.75
francs per bearer share and 1.15 francs per registered share.  Swiss watch exports will probably rise to another record in
2012, though growth may slow to a “single-digit” pace, Jean-
Daniel Pasche, the head of the trade group, said in a Jan. 18
interview. While the market in  Asia  will continue to expand,
growth in  Europe  will be “very low,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
