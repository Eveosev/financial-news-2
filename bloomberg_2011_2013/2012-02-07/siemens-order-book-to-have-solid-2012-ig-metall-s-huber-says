Siemens AG ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, will have a “solid year” because of a
record order book, according to the manufacturer’s top labor
representative, who is pushing for higher industry wages.  Siemens already has half of its sales “in the bag” for
fiscal 2012, safeguarding the company from slower economic
growth, Berthold Huber, the head of the  IG Metall  labor union
and a member of Siemens’s supervisory board, said at a press
conference in Frankfurt today.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  predicts revenue at
the Munich-based company will rise “moderately” this year,
excluding potential acquisitions, while order growth will
 outpace  sales and net income from continuing operations will
total about 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion). Siemens’s order
backlog reached a record 102 billion euros as of Dec. 31. The
company’s fiscal year ends Sept. 30.  The European economy will undergo a “mild” contraction in
coming quarters, Loescher said on Jan. 24.  IG Metall is advising its regional wage-negotiating groups
to demand an increase of as much as 6.5 percent for workers in
the metals and electronics industries in  Germany . The demands
coincide with plans by Siemens, one of the country’s largest
employers, to eliminate jobs to improve profitability at various
businesses, including its Osram lighting unit, the diagnostics
division and a networks venture with  Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V)   To contact the reporters on this story:
