Google Inc. , seeking to get more of
its desktop-computer software onto mobile devices, introduced a
test version of its Chrome Web browser for the latest Android
operating system.  The browser, first unveiled in 2008, will be available on
tablets and mobile phones using the company’s “Ice Cream
Sandwich” Android software, Sundar Pichai, a senior vice
president in charge of Chrome and applications, said in  a blog
posting . The company aims to improve the speed of mobile
browsing by preloading top search results and enabling users to
get the same tabs and bookmarks they have on their desktops.  “Chrome for Android is designed from the ground up for
mobile devices,” Pichai said. The software is “focused on
speed and simplicity, but it also features seamless sign-in and
sync so you can take your personalized Web browsing experience
with you wherever you go, across devices.”  Google’s Android software has taken the lead in the market
for smartphone operating system, topping  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone and
 Microsoft Corp. ’s mobile software. Android handsets accounted
for 48 percent of the U.S. smartphone market in the fourth
quarter, while the iPhone had 43 percent, according to  NPD Group
Inc.  Almost three in five first-time smartphone buyers chose
Android, NPD said.  Shares of  Mountain View , California-based  Google  fell less
than 1 percent to $606.77 today. The shares have declined 6.1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
