The Australian dollar rose against
the greenback and the yen after the  Reserve Bank  unexpectedly
left the cash rate target unchanged at 4.25 percent.  The so-called Aussie climbed 0.7 percent to $1.0803 as of
2:34 p.m. in Sydney, compared with $1.0705 before the decision.
It gained 0.9 percent to 82.80 yen, versus 82.20 before the RBA
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
