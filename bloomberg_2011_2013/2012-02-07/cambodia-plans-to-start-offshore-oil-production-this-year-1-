Cambodia plans to start oil 
production in the offshore Block A by the end of this year, said
Deputy Prime Minister Sok An.  The country is reviewing the field operator  Chevron Corp. (CVX) â€™s
offshore production license this year, Sok An said at an energy
conference in Bangkok today. The company found oil and gas in
waters off the country in 2005, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
