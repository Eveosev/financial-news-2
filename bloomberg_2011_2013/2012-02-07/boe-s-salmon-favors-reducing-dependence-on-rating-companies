Bank of England  Chief Cashier Chris Salmon said it would be better for investors to have access to
more detailed information on the financial industry so they can
reduce their reliance on ratings companies.  “Investors need to be presented with a range of
information, which allows them to build their own picture of a
firm,” Salmon, executive director of banking services, said in
a speech in London today. “Some of these may be less
sophisticated investors than others, but if we are to reduce the
dependence on  ratings agencies , more data must in general be a
good thing.”  Salmon also said that regulators need to make financial
institutions safer and ensure resolution regimes are “fit for
purpose” to remove the need for government bailouts of banks.
The Bank of England has recommended that banks build up capital
buffers and publish leverage ratios from the start of 2013,
ahead of the Basel III timetables.  Responding to the argument that planned financial reforms
are “too ambitious,” Salmon said it’s better to have a long
transition period rather than “water down the reform so that
change can be implemented more quickly.”  “Scaling back our ambitions for the reforms, for example
by blurring capital definitions as some have suggested recently,
or weakening the thrust of the new liquidity requirements, would
involve sacrificing long-term gains and missing the great
opportunity that we currently have to refashion the financial
system,” he said. “Sticking to the task, and delivering the
intent of planning changes is a key challenge facing the
official sector, here and overseas, over forthcoming years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
