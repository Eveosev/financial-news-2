Poland ’s  WIG20 Index  fell 1.1 percent
to 2,363.23 at 3:13 p.m. in Warsaw, its first decline in nine
days.  The following are among the most active equities on the
Warsaw market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Distribution Corp.  (CDC PW), jumped 2.5
percent to 18.3 zloty, the most in almost two months as Poland’s
second-largest vodka producer said its board is reviewing a
proposal from Russian Standard Corp. to raise its stake in the
company.  Grupa Lotos SA  (LTS PW), climbed 1.8 percent to 27.11
zloty, the highest since Nov. 22, after Poland’s Treasury
Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski was quoted as saying by Puls
Biznesu he isn’t ruling out the sale of a controlling stake in
the country’s second-biggest oil refiner to a domestic buyer
after failing to evoke interest from foreign investors.  PKN Orlen SA , (PKN PW) Poland’s biggest refiner, and
 Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , (PGN PW) the
country’s dominant gas company, can’t be ruled out as potential
buyers, Budzanowski said, according to Puls. PKN Orlen lost 1.8
percent to 38.58 zloty and PGNiG fell 1.9 percent to 3.68 zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA  (KGH PW), Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, declined 2.9 percent to 138.8 zloty, the lowest
in a week, as copper fell after Chinese officials said the
country’s industrial output will probably slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
