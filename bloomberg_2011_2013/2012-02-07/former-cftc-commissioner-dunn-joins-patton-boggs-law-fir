Michael V. Dunn, former member of the
U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission , has joined  Patton
Boggs LLP , a Washington law and lobbying firm.  Dunn is a senior policy adviser at  Patton Boggs , the firm
announced today. He was a CFTC commissioner for about seven
years before stepping down on Oct. 24. The CFTC, the main U.S.
derivatives regulator, is leading efforts to complete Dodd-Frank
Act rules by 2013.  “Regulatory agencies should be accessible to the
businesses and industries they regulate,” Dunn said in a
statement released by the firm. “I am excited to join the firm,
and I look forward to helping clients navigate complex
regulatory processes and agencies.”  Patton Boggs represents the Depository Trust and Clearing
Corp., which collects data on derivatives transactions, and the
 Wholesale Markets Brokers’Association, Americas , an association
of derivatives trading venues, among other clients, according to
U.S. Senate records.  Dodd-Frank, the financial-rule overhaul enacted in 2010, is
intended to reduce risk and boost transparency in the swaps
market after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008
credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
