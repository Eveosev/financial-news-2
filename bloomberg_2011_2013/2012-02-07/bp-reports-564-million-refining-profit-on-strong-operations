BP Plc ,  Europe ’s second largest oil
company, said “strong operations” at its refineries allowed
the company to report a profit in the fourth quarter in the face
of lower margins.  BP replacement cost profit before interest and tax in
refining and marketing fell to $564 million in the quarter, down
from $964 million in the same period last year, the company said
today in a statement.  The refinery utilization was “well above the industry
average,” BP said. “Our result benefited from an improved
contribution from supply and trading relative to the fourth-
quarter loss in 2010 and our ability to access West Texas
Intermediate-priced crude grades in the U.S.”  Refining margins from processing oil into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel on the U.S. Gulf coast fell 22 percent to
$7.16 a barrel in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
according to BP data.  The refining industry “had the perfect storm” after fuel
demand dropped in the U.S. and Europe in the last quarter, Royal
Dutch Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said last
week. Shell had a loss of $278 million from its refining and
marketing operations, compared with a profit of $482 million a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
