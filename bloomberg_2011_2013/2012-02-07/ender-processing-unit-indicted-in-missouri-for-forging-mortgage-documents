Docx LLC, a unit of  Lender Processing
Services Inc ., was charged in  Missouri  with forgery and making a
false declaration related to mortgage documents it processed.  A Boone County grand jury handed down the 136-count
indictment against Docx and founder Lorraine Brown alleging that
a person whose name appears on 68 notarized deeds of release
didn’t actually sign the paperwork, Missouri Attorney General
Chris Koster said in a statement yesterday.  “When you sign your name to a legal document, it
matters,” Koster said. “Mass-producing fraudulent signatures
on millions of real estate documents across America constitutes
forgery.”  Lender Processing, based in Jacksonville,  Florida , says
about half of all U.S. mortgages by dollar volume are serviced
using its loan-servicing platform.  Michelle Kersch, a Lender Processing spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the indictment. The indictment was reported earlier in the New
York Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
