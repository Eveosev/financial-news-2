Glencore International Plc’s proposed
combination with  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  has “a huge amount of logic,”
said Ian Henderson, a  fund manager  at JPMorgan Asset Management,
who helps manage $8 billion in assets including Xstrata shares.  Henderson has yet to decide on Glencore’s offer for Xstrata
shares, he said in a telephone interview from Cape Town today.  “I don’t think it’s an automatic tick in the box saying
this is a marriage made in heaven.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
