Bellway Plc , the U.K. homebuilder
focused on homes for first-time buyers, said its profit margin
may rise to more than 10 percent in the six months through
January after selling more houses at higher prices.  The operating profit margin “is set to reach double
digits” in the fiscal first half, the Newcastle, England-based
company said in a statement today. Bellway reported a margin of
8.5 percent for the financial year ended July 31.  “This rate of improvement has now slowed,” the company
said in the statement. “Although the operating margin should
continue to grow, it will do so at a more sustainable pace.”  Homebuilders are boosting margins by building houses rather
than apartments and building on land acquired after prices fell
in the 2009 recession. The U.K. government will introduce a
mortgage guarantee program later this year to enable borrowers
to buy a new home with a down payment of as little as 5 percent
of the property’s purchase price.  Bellway sold 2,455 homes in the period, up 5 percent from a
year earlier. The average selling price increased by 8.7 percent
to 183,000 pounds ($289,300). The company expects the growth
rate to slow in the fiscal second half.  The company is scheduled to report fiscal first-half
 earnings  on March 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
