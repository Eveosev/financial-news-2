Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said while he doubts investments related to fossil fuels present
potential threats to the U.K.’s future financial stability,
“there is clearly scope for further evaluation of these
issues,” the Financial Times reported, citing a letter from
King to a group of 20 investors, including Climate Change
Capital founder James Cameron and Conservative Party lawmaker
Zac Goldsmith.  King’s letter was written in response to the group’s
warning last month of the “potentially major” problem such
investments could pose.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
