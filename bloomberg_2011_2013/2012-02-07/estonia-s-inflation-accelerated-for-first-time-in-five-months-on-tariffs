Estonian  inflation  accelerated for
the first time in five months in January because of tariff
increases for electricity and heating and higher fuel costs.  The inflation rate rose to 4.5 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 16-month low of 3.7 percent in December, the
statistics office in the capital, Tallinn, said today on its
website. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts was for 4.1 percent growth. Prices rose 0.7 percent
from the previous month.  The  Finance Ministry  said last month it expected inflation
to accelerate “temporarily” in January after the national gas
company AS Eesti Gaas and power utility AS Eesti Energia both
announced plans to raise rates from the start of the year.  Estonia, the newest member of the euro region, had the
second-fastest average inflation in the 27-member European Union
behind  Romania  in the 12 months to December, according to
Eurostat, the EU statistics agency. Price growth has been
boosted by higher global food and fuel costs as well as
Estonia’s economic growth accelerating to the fastest pace in
the EU last year.  Electricity prices rose 4.4 percent last month from
December, while heating costs increased 2.9 percent and gas
prices jumped 10.6 percent, according to the statistics office.  Average annual inflation may slow to 3.2 percent this year
from a three-year high of 5 percent last year as global price
pressures ease, Swedbank AB forecast Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
