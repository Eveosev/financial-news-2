Royal Jordanian Airlines  will suspend
flights to five destinations starting in March because of
regional turmoil and higher fuel prices, the state-run Petra
news agency reported.  The Amman-based airline will halt flights to Brussels,
Munich in  Germany , Al Ain in the  United Arab Emirates  and two
other destinations in the Gulf to be announced soon, Petra
reported, citing Royal Jordanian Chief Executive Officer Hussein Dabbas. The airline also decided to reduce the number of flights
to Rome, Vienna, Zurich, Geneva, Amsterdam,  Kuala Lumpur  and
Khartoum, he said.  Royal Jordanian canceled 1,300 flights in 2011 and more
than 460 flights scheduled in the first quarter of this year due
to a drop in the number of passengers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
