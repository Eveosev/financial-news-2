Egypt ’s  Muslim Brotherhood , whose
members control the largest voting bloc in the country’s newly
elected parliament, said it rejects calls by political activists
for civil disobedience on Feb. 11.  Groups including the  April 6 Youth Movement , which led
protests that ousted President Hosni Mubarak a year ago, are
calling for people to stay home on Feb. 11 to demand the
transfer of power to civilians from the country’s ruling
military council. The planned day of  strike action  marks the
first anniversary of Mubarak’s departure.  The call for civil disobedience means halting railways,
transportation, factories, schools and stopping tax and
utilities payments, compounding the country’s economic slump,
Mahmoud Hussein, the Muslim Brotherhood’s secretary general said
in an e-mailed statement today. The group “rejects this call,”
he said.  The ruling  Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  has ignored
protester demands since a mass protest on Jan. 25 to hold early
presidential elections, now scheduled for mid-June, or transfer
executive powers to parliament. Calls for the council to step
down intensified after more than 70 people were killed last week
at a soccer match when crowds invaded the football field,
sparking clashes between protesters and police in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
