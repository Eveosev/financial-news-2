South Africa ’s unemployment rate
declined to 23.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest level
since June 2009, adding to the recovery in  Africa ’s biggest
economy.  The jobless rate fell from 25 percent in the previous three
months, Statistics South Africa said in a report released today
in  Pretoria , the capital. South Africa has the highest
unemployment rate of 61 nations tracked by Bloomberg.  The number of people working rose 179,000 to 13.5 million
as factories and retailers added jobs, the agency said. A boost
in  manufacturing , the second-biggest industry, may help support
the economy, which grew at its slowest pace in about two years
in the third quarter.  “This a natural recovery from the big slump in 2009,
2010,” Dennis Dykes, chief economist at Johannesburg-based
 Nedbank Group Ltd. , said by phone. “We still have a ways to go
to catch up.”  The  median estimate  of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for the jobless rate to drop to 24.8 percent.  The economy grew an annualized 1.4 percent in the third
quarter as manufacturing and mining contracted, threatening the
government’s goal to create 5 million jobs by 2020. Gross
domestic product needs to expand 7 percent a year for the next
10 years to cut the jobless rate to a target of 14 percent,
according to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.  Growth Forecasts  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its estimate for
economic expansion this year to 2.5 percent from 3.6 percent.
The economy may grow by less than 3 percent in 2012, Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said on Jan. 26, lower than a previous
estimate of 3.4 percent. The statistics agency is scheduled to
release fourth-quarter economic growth data on Feb. 28.  The number of unemployed people fell by 198,000 to 4.24
million in the fourth quarter from the previous three months,
Statistics South Africa said. Compared with a year earlier,
107,000 more people are unemployed, it said.  “We do see a glimpse of hope,” Kefiloe Masiteng, deputy
director-general at Statistics South Africa, told reporters in
Pretoria today.  Factories added 52,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, while
mining created 3,000 jobs, the agency said. The wholesale and
retail industry employed 48,000 more people compared with the
third quarter as the lowest  interest rates  in 30 years helped
boost  consumer spending .  South Africa’s central bank left its benchmark rate at 5.5
percent on Jan. 18 even as inflation stayed outside its 3
percent to 6 percent target band for a second month in December.  The rand was little changed at 7.5532 against the dollar as
of 12:05 p.m. in Johannesburg, while the yield on the benchmark
government bond due in 2015 dropped 2 basis points to 6.49
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
