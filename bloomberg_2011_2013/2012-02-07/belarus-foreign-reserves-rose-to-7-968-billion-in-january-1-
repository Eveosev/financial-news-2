Belarus’s foreign-currency and gold
reserves advanced to $7.968 billion as of Feb. 1, an increase of
0.7 percent from a month earlier, according to the country’s
central bank.  “The growth of foreign-currency and gold reserves in
January 2012 was facilitated by the increase of  gold prices  in
the international precious metals market, as well as by the
positive balance of sales and purchases of foreign currency at
the Belarusian Currency and Stock Exchange,” the Natsionalnyi
Bank Respubliki Belarus said on its  website  today.  The value of monetary gold in reserves increased 25.5
percent to $2.4 billion in January while foreign-currency
reserves declined for the first time since November 2011,
falling 15.9 percent to $3.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
