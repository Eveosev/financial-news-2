(Corrects bank name in first, fourth paragraphs.)  Former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  was indicted by a Milan judge in a wiretapping case
related to a battle for control of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
SpA, Ansa newswire reported today.  Judge Maria Grazia Domanico decided that the trial will
start on March 15, Ansa said. Berlusconi lawyer Niccolo Ghedini
described the indictment as “incredible,” adding that “this
umpteenth trial will end up in nothing as all the other ones,”
the newswire added.  Milan prosecutors requested that Berlusconi be tried for
allegedly leaking transcripts of wiretapped phone calls to Il
Giornale, a newspaper owned by his brother Paolo, to discredit a
political rival, according to a September statement by
prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati.  The transcripts refer to calls between Piero Fassino, who
formerly headed the Democrats of the Left, and a banker seeking
support for a takeover bid for Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in
2006. Fassino was recorded during a bidding war for the bank
between  Spain ’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and  Italy ’s
Compagnia Assicuratrice Unipol SpA.  Berlusconi currently faces three other trials in Milan on
charges of bribery, use of under-age prostitutes and abuse of
power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
