Treasuries fell as speculation  Greece 
is closer to receiving international funding reduced the haven
appeal of  government securities  as the U.S. sold $32 billion of
three-year notes.  U.S. 10-year yield reached almost a two-week high after
reports that Greek officials are working on the final draft of
the document listing the budget and structural measures. The
three-year securities drew a yield of 0.347 percent, compared
with a forecast of 0.346 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers, which
purchased the largest share of the sale since 2009.  “Better sentiment around Greece and soft performance from
the three-year note auction has caused the market to dip,” said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which oversees $12 billion in Fixed
income assets. “The cheapening we’ve seen should allow for
better auctions for the rest of the week. And no one is going to
completely believe the European situation is fixed until they
see it on paper.”  The  yield  on the current three-year note rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.34 percent at 5:11 p.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  increased seven
basis points to 1.97 percent, after touching the highest since
Jan. 25. The 2 percent securities maturing in November 2021 fell
19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 7/32.  Auction Details  The auction’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of notes offered, was 3.30,
versus an average of 3.35 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 27.7 percent of the notes, the least
since February 2011 and compared with an average of 37.4 percent
for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.5 percent of
the notes at the sale, versus an average of 11.2 percent for the
past 10 auctions.  Primary dealers bought 63.8 percent of the offering, the
largest proportion since January 2009.  “Some of the foreign and domestic buy-side demand did not
materialize as expected,” said  Anthony Cronin , a trader at
Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the primary dealers that
are required to bid at Treasury auctions.  Dealer Holdings  The 21 firms that act as the central bank’s counterparties
in open market transactions  held  $8.2 billion of notes with
maturities of between three and six years as of Jan. 25, up from
a $6.1 billion bet against the securities as of Jan. 18, Fed
data show. The dealers held $53.4 billion of notes due in three
years or less, up $13.1 billion in the same period, the data
show.  The Treasury is selling $24 billion of 10-year debt
tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 9. This week’s
auctions will raise $22.4 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total $49.6 billion.  The amount of marketable securities outstanding  rose  to
$10.07 trillion as of Jan. 31, up from $9.94 trillion at the end
of last year.  Three-year notes have returned 0.18 percent this year,
compared with a loss of 0.05 percent for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures
price swings based on options, closed yesterday at 72.3, at
almost the lowest since July 2007 and less than the five-year
average of 111.8.  Trading Levels  Treasury market volume dropped yesterday to the lowest
since Jan. 9. About $176 billion of Treasuries changed hands
through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker, below
the one-year average of $277 billion.  Greek officials are working on the document required to
receive international funding, a government official said. The
official, who declined to be named, said the document would be
discussed by political party leaders supporting the government
of interim Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  at a meeting later in
the day. The official spoke to reporters in  Athens .  “Maybe things are getting slightly better in  Europe ,”
said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital
Markets Americas Inc., a primary dealer. “Rates started to move
slightly higher.”  Jobs Data  U.S. government bonds tumbled on Feb. 3, pushing yields up
10 basis points, after the Labor Department said employers added
243,000 jobs in January. The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was 140,000. The jobless rate fell to 8.3
percent, the least in three years.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  repeated today that the job
market is still far from healthy after signs of economic
improvement over the past year, and he called on lawmakers to
reduce the long-term  budget deficit .  “We still have a long way to go before the labor market
can be said to be operating normally,” Bernanke said in
testimony prepared for the Senate Budget Committee that is
identical to remarks he gave on Feb. 2 to the House Budget
panel.  Bernanke said after a two-day policy meeting Jan. 24-25
that the central bank is considering additional asset purchases
to boost growth after extending its pledge to keep  interest
rates  low through at least late 2014.  The central bank sold $1.3 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, or TIPS, maturing from July 2012 to
January 2015 today under a program known as ‘Operation Twist,’
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  The Fed is  replacing  $400 billion of shorter-maturity
Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term debt to cap
borrowing costs and spur the economy under a program it plans to
conclude in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
