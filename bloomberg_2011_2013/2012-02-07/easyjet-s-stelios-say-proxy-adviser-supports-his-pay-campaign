EasyJet Plc  founder Stelios Haji Ioannou said proxy adviser  Glass Lewis  & Co. backs his campaign
to rein in executive pay at Europe’s second-largest discount
airline.  Executives should stop using EasyJet as a “personal
piggybank,” he said in a statement today released by his
 EasyGroup Holdings Ltd . Stelios, who prefers to be known by his
first name, has been in dispute with management for more than
three years, after calling for slower growth in 2008.  “The directors must now stop using this ‘heads I win,
tails you lose’ calculation for their bonuses,” Stelios said in
the statement.  Stelios, 44, controls about 38 percent of Luton, U.K.-based
EasyJet’s stock. He stepped down from its board in May 2010.  EasyJet fell 2.2 percent to 461.5 pence today in  London .
The  shares  have gained 17 percent in the past 12 months.  Glass Lewis , an independent research company that advises
investors on how to vote at company meetings, said in a report
published yesterday that it had “strong reservations” about
supporting EasyJet’s incentive plan because it relied on a
single metric to determine compensation.  The company is “confident that EasyJet’s board will have
the endorsement of shareholders” at its annual meeting,  Paul Moore , a spokesman for the airline, said by telephone.  The meeting is scheduled for Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
