Actavis Group HF and Merck & Co.
Inc.’s Schering-Plough were among five companies that paid a
total of $25.2 million to settle claims that they overcharged
 Louisiana  for drugs for low-income patients.  The two companies and  Boehringer Ingelheim  GmbH, Dey Pharma
LP and  GlaxoSmithKline Plc  resolved civil claims that they
inflated drug prices to get larger reimbursements from the
state’s Medicaid program, Louisiana Attorney General James “Buddy” Caldwell said today in an e-mailed statement. The
state claimed the companies misreported average wholesale prices
for the drugs.  Louisiana has sued more than 100 drug companies, accusing
them of fraud and violating the state’s unfair trade practices
and consumer protection law. The statement didn’t specify the
amount that each company is paying.  Representatives of GlaxoSmithKline, Actavis, Boehringer
Ingelheim and Dey Pharma didn’t immediately return phone calls.
 Ron Rogers , a spokesman for Merck, didn’t have an immediate
comment.  Actavis is a unit of Novator EHF, an Icelandic investment
firm. Dey Pharma is owned by  Mylan Inc.   To contact the reporter on this story:
