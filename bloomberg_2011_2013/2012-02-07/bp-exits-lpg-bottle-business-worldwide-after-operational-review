BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-largest oil
company, will exit its liquefied petroleum gas bottle- and tank-
filling businesses worldwide after reviewing the operations last
year.  The company plans to exit ventures in Portugal, the U.K.,
Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, China and South
Africa, “as well as its non refinery-integrated wholesale
business” by the end of 2013, it said today in a  statement . BP
has just begun the sale process and hasn’t received any offers
yet,  Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman, said by phone. LPG bottles
are designed for fueling houses or camper-vans.  BP will also sell LPG storage terminals, bottle-filling
plants, logistical and some other assets. It will continue
fueling cars with LPG in  Europe  and maintain wholesale outlets
to support its refinery operations, the company said.  London-based BP declined to comment on the value of the
proposed spinoff. It plans to sell assets worth $38 billion by
the end of next year, it said today in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
