The European Commission advised the
 Croatian government  that a tax on mobile-phone services is
against EU rules,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported, citing Ryan Heath,
a spokesman for the commission.  A 6 percent tax on revenue generated by mobile services was
reintroduced on Feb. 1. It is expected to raise about 300
million kuna ($173 million) each year. Croatia is expected to
become the blocâ€™s 28th member in July 2013  To contact the reporter on this story:
