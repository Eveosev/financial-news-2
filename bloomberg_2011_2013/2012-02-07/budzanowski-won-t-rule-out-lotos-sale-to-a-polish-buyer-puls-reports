Poland ’s Treasury doesn’t rule out
the sale of a controlling stake in Gdansk-based  Grupa Lotos SA ,
the country’s second-largest oil refiner, to a domestic buyer
after failing to interest a foreign investor in the company,
Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski was quoted today as saying
in Puls Biznesu newspaper.  PKN Orlen  SA, Poland’s biggest refiner, and  Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA , the country’s dominant gas
company, can’t be ruled out as potential buyers, Budzanowski
said, according to Puls.  “Lotos needs a strategic investor, and given the lack of
foreign interest we’re left with the choice of picking a company
from the domestic fuels industry,” the newspaper quoted
Budzanowski as saying. “While we don’t aim to monopolize the
fuels market in Poland, there aren’t many local candidates, so
the options for consolidation are limited.”  The government will need to change its strategy for the oil
and power sectors in Poland, including lifting a cap on the
amount of Lotos shares it can sell, and examine its legal
position before modifying plans for disposing of the state’s
majority stake in Lotos, Budzanowski said, according to Puls.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
