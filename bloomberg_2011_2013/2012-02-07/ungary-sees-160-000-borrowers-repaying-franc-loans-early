Hungary  anticipates 160,000 borrowers
will repay their foreign-currency mortgages at below market
rates by the government deadline at the end of this month.  Almost 142,000 households used the plan by the end of
January to repay 776 billion forint ($3.5 billion), equal to
1.07 trillion forint at market rates, the country’s financial
market authority, known as  Pszaf , said in an e-mailed statement
today. That repayment leaves banks with a pretax loss of 298
billion forint. A further 19,052 loans with a market value of
145 billion forint are being processed.  Hungary, where households are struggling to repay their
loans as the forint weakened, passed legislation in September
allowing the early repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at
more than 25 percent below prevailing market rates with banks
assuming the loss. Households that prove they have the financial
means to repay their mortgages have until the end of this month
to get rid of their loans.  Hungarians repaid 19 percent of total outstanding foreign-
currency credit under the plan, Pszaf said. About 96 percent of
the repaid loans were denominated in Swiss francs, according to
the watchdog.  Foreign-Currency Loans  Hungarians borrowed in currencies including Swiss francs,
euros and Japanese yen mostly from 2003 to 2008, taking
advantage of lower  interest rates . The forint’s decline since
2008 raised installment payments, the principal and delinquency
rates on such loans.  The forint weakened 36.4 percent against the Swiss franc
and 13 percent versus the euro from mid-2008.  Local lenders expected total losses of 210 billion forint
from the plan, Mihaly Patai, head of the Bank Association, said
on Feb. 2.  OTP Bank Nyrt ., Hungary’s largest lender, competes mostly
with units of international banks including  Erste Group Bank AG ,
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG ,  UniCredit  SpA, Bayerische
Landesbank AG, KBC Groep NV, and   Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA.  Financial institutions provided 36,980 forint-denominated
loans for almost 207 billion forint to customers wishing to
refinance foreign-currency mortgages, according to the
statement.  The government of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  and local
banks agreed in December to share costs for forgiving some loans
and taking on currency risks for others in the next five years.
Under the plan, banks will take losses of as much as 600 billion
forint and the government will assume 300 billion forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
