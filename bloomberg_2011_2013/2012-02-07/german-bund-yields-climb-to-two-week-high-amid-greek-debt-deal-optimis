German bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest in almost two weeks, as a Greek official
said the government and its creditors were working on the final
draft of an agreement to ensure another aid package.  Bunds dropped for the fourth time in five days on
speculation the agreement will be approved at a meeting between
Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and the leaders of other
political parties today, damping demand for the region’s safest
assets. Dutch bonds declined after the nation auctioned 6
billion euros ($7.9 billion) of 10-year debt.  “Optimism that Greece might be reaching a deal has
improved sentiment and weighs on safe-haven securities such as
bunds and Dutch bonds,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “There is a clear risk-on trade in place this afternoon
with some decent flows into the periphery too.”  The German 10-year yield climbed eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 5 p.m. London time,
after rising to 1.97 percent, the highest level since Jan. 25.
The 2 percent bond due January 2022 dropped 0.685, or 6.85 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.32. The two-year yield rose
four basis points to 0.22 percent.  While the Greek prime minister and party chiefs have agreed
to make further cuts this year equal to 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product, they have yet to close gaps over measures
demanded by creditors for a 130 billion-euro rescue.  Greek Auction  Greece  sold 812.5 million euros of 26-week bills today at a
yield of 4.86 percent, according to the Public Debt Management
Agency. That compares with a yield of 4.90 percent at the
previous auction on Jan. 10. Investors bid for 2.72 times the
securities sold, from 2.80 times last month.  The Netherlands auctioned 2.25 percent bonds due in July
2022 at an average yield of 2.359 percent, the State Treasury
Agency said. The nation’s 10-year yield increased six basis
points to 2.27 percent.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped three basis points to
5.59 percent after earlier rising as much as 10 basis points.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds shrank 11 basis points to 3.63
percentage points, the lowest close since Oct. 14. The spread
between Spanish and German 10-year yields narrowed three basis
points to 3.1 percentage points.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its main  refinancing
rate  at a record low 1 percent on Feb. 9, according to the
median estimate of 57 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Two
analysts forecast policy makers will lower the rate to 0.75
percent, the survey shows.  Germany’s bonds have returned 12 percent in the past year
as the European debt crisis worsened, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Italian debt was little changed and
Greek securities tumbled 65 percent, the indexes show.  Germany  is scheduled to sell an additional 4 billion euros
of five-year notes tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
