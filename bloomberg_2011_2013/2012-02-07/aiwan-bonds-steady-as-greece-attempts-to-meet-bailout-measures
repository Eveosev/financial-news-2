Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened as
foreign investors added to holdings of local stocks on optimism
the island’s economic growth is intact.  Government bonds  dropped.  Global funds bought $220 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold today, according to exchange data. The island’s
statistics bureau forecast last week the economy will grow 3.91
percent in 2012, compared with a 4 percent expansion last year.
The local currency has rallied 2.4 percent against the dollar
this year.  “There’ve been foreign investors coming into Taiwan’s
markets trying to profit from the  Taiwan dollar ’s appreciation,”
said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc.
in Taipei.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.570
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$29.415 on Feb. 4, the strongest level since
Sept. 13.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.936
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  Benchmark  30-year  yields were steady at 1.87 percent before
a NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) sale of securities of that
maturity tomorrow. The debt will yield 1.865 percent, according
to the median estimate of bond traders in a Bloomberg survey.  “The result of tomorrow’s bond sale largely depends on the
appetite of insurers, who are the biggest buyers of long
bonds,” Hsing said.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.398 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
