The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:32 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index  gained 0.2 percent to 13,974.80, while the
Colcap Index was little changed at 1,641.56.  Interconexion Electrica SA  (ISA CB),  Latin America ’s
biggest power line operator known as ISA, fell 1.8 percent to
11,100 pesos.  The company said it has met all legal requirements for its
Autopistas de la Montana concession, according to a regulatory
filing. The company said it has not been notified of any
investigation into the contract after local press reports said
the attorney general’s office found “inconsistencies” in the
contract, the filing said.  Isagen SA  (ISAGEN CB), the state-run power producer, rose
1.6 percent to 2,185 pesos, a three-month high.  The company has completed environmental requirements
requested by Colombia’s environmental regulator and is awaiting
approval to begin operating a project that will increase output
at its Trasvase Manso power plant, the company said in a
statement published late yesterday on the website of  Colombia ’s
securities regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
