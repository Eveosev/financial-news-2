South Korea ’s economy faces
“downside risks” and may grow more slowly in the first half
than its long-term trend, the  Bank of Korea  said.  Price pressures will likely persist on elevated inflation
expectations and unstable oil costs, the central bank also said
in a report to the National Assembly today.  Consumer price gains 
moderated to 3.4 percent in January largely due to a high year-
earlier base, it said.  Growth may gradually pick up pace in the second half of
this year on improving global conditions, the Bank of Korea
said. Policy makers have kept benchmark interest rates unchanged
after three increases in the first half of 2011, largely due to
risks from Europe’s debt crisis, a slowdown in major economies,
and global financial market instability, the central bank said.  External uncertainty, weak consumer and business sentiment,
and high  household debt  are weighing on growth, and downside
risks are greater than upside risks, the central bank said.  South Korea’s economy grew 3.6 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
