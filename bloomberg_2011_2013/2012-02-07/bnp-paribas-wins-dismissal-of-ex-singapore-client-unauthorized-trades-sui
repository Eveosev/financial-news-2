BNP Paribas SA ’s wealth management
unit won dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Nitine Jantilal, a
former client who claimed the bank made unauthorized trades
leading to a shortfall in his account.  Jantilal sued the bank in 2009 over allegations that a
S$1.1 million ($883,000) reduction in his account was due to the
bank’s breaches. The Indian national had made two of his
relatives co-signatories of his account and claimed he was
unaware of trades based on instructions from them, Singapore
High Court Judge Choo Han Teck said in a ruling today.  Jantilal “assumed the risk of making his relatives
authorized signatories. He cannot now say that he did not
authorize them,” Judge Choo said.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  “executed the
specific asset transactions and swap transactions with the
proper authority.”  The decline in asset value in Jantilal’s account was due to
trades made by his authorized signatories and market
fluctuations, according to the ruling.  K. Muralidharan Pillai represented the bank.  The case is Nitine Jantilal v. BNP Paribas Wealth
Management S1048/2009 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
