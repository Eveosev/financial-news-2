European fixed-income investors will
direct more money to corporate bond funds in 2012 as they seek
higher yields, according to a Fitch Ratings survey.  “Fifty-eight percent of investors said they expect funds
to turn to corporate credit in 2012 in search of carry,” said
Monica Insoll, a managing director in Fitch’s credit market
research group in  London . “Only a small minority of 6 percent
anticipate inflows into government bond funds -- a flight to
quality.”  Investor optimism about the ability of euro-region
governments to resolve the sovereign debt crisis will also
probably boost flows into European corporate bond funds, Fitch
said. Investors pulled 33 billion euros from euro bond funds in
2011, the ratings company said.  Fitch’s quarterly European Senior Fixed Income Investor
Survey polled debt managers overseeing about $7.1 trillion of
assets in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
