Ethanol futures advanced a second day
in  Chicago  on concern that negative margins will prompt
producers to temper output.  Futures jumped to the highest price in more than three
weeks on concern that distillers of the fuel, losing as much as
12 cents on every gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, will reduce  production  with record inventories.  “Margins have been hit hard by the recent oversupply of
ethanol inventory, but some fresh concerns that producers may
reduce production in response set off a surprise rally,” said
Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 1.8 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.211 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since Jan. 11. Prices are down 7.8
percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol  stockpiles  swelled 5.8 percent to a record 20.9
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 27, according to Energy
Department data.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
