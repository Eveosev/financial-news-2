Siemens AG  attempted a second
takeover bid of German automation-software maker  IBS AG  that
values the target at about 44.85 million euros ($59.44 million),
almost five years after its first overture was rejected.  Siemens is offering 6.1 euros in cash for each share of IBS
that it doesn’t already own, the Munich-based company said in a
statement today. That’s 33 percent more than IBS’s closing share
price today. IBS management backs the bid, and Siemens has
signed an accord with owners of 51 percent of the stock.  Europe ’s largest engineering company failed to gain control
of IBS in June 2007 when Siemens fell short of the minimum 75
percent backing from shareholders necessary for the takeover to
succeed. Siemens said today’s it’s striving for the same
acceptance threshold, and has secured backing from 64 percent of
all IBS shareholders. Siemens already owns 8 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
