Encana Corp ., Canada’s largest
natural gas producer, said the head of its Canadian operations
resigned.  Michael Graham, who was president of the company’s Canadian
division since 2006, quit effective immediately, Alan Boras, a
company spokesman, said in a telephone interview today.  Boras declined to say why Graham is leaving. Graham has
worked at Encana or its predecessor since 1986, according to a
company biography.  Mike McAllister, who is senior vice president of Encana’s
Canadian operations, will replace Graham, Boras said.  Encana spun off its oil-sands business  Cenovus Energy Inc .
in December 2009 while natural gas was in the midst of a four-
year decline. Oil has climbed about 25 percent since 2009, while
the price of gas has dropped more than 50 percent as production
in the U.S. surged.  Canada  accounted for 36 percent of the company’s revenue in
2010.  Encana fell 1.8 percent to C$19.83 at the close in Toronto.
The stock has declined 37 percent in the past 12 months, making
it the fourth-worst performer on the MSCI Canada/Energy Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
