UBS AG ,  Switzerland ’s biggest lender,
cut its 2011 bonus pool by 40 percent and investment bank chief
Carsten Kengeter waived any variable pay entitlement as his
division posted a second consecutive quarterly loss.  The bonus pool, including pay deferred into future years,
fell to 2.57 billion Swiss francs ($2.8 billion), from 4.25
billion francs in 2010, the Zurich-based bank said today. The
pool at UBS’s investment bank is down 60 percent.  “I don’t see how compensation should stay the same or go
up if profitability of the banking industry is going south,”
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  told reporters in Zurich
today. “We’re trying to strive for a situation in which both
the shareholder and employee can have a win-win situation.”  While many of the world’s largest lenders, including
Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., are curbing pay as
they grapple with shrinking revenue, UBS’s cuts are among the
deepest. The dwindling bonus pool, down from 4.8 billion francs
awarded in 2009 when UBS reported a 2.74 billion-franc loss,
means the bank risks losing staff, said Matthew Czepliewicz, an
analyst at Collins Stewart Hawkpoint Plc in  London .  “UBS is a bit ahead of the industry on reducing pay,”
said Czepliewicz. “They don’t have much choice given how high
compensation was as a proportion of revenue.”  Share-Based Awards  UBS plans to supplement lower bonuses with about 300
million francs in special-plan awards to key employees of the
investment bank in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Tom Naratil
said. These share-based awards will vest after three years and
will include stricter forfeiture clauses than existing stock-
based compensation, he said.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s biggest bank, said last week it
shrank its 2011 bonus pool by 17 percent, while deferring a
larger portion of the awards into future years. Lazard Ltd., the
largest independent merger adviser, said yesterday it cut
discretionary bonuses for 2011 by about 20 percent. Credit
Suisse Group AG, the second-biggest Swiss bank, plans to pay
part of bonuses to senior employees in bonds made from
derivatives.  UBS is shrinking its investment bank as stricter  capital
requirements  and the European sovereign debt crisis hurt
profitability. The company plans to cut risk-weighted assets at
the division by almost half under the Basel III rules, and
reduce the number of employees to about 16,000 from 17,256 at
the end of December.  Fourth-Quarter Loss  The securities unit reported a fourth-quarter pretax loss
of 256 million francs earlier today, after a loss of 650 million
francs in the third quarter when it lost $2.3 billion because of
unauthorized trading. UBS’s net income fell 44% to 4.23 billion
francs in 2011, after fourth-quarter profit declined to 393
million francs from 1.66 billion francs in the year-earlier
period.  Kengeter volunteered to waive any variable compensation the
bank’s board might have awarded him following the discovery of
the trading loss in September, Ermotti told reporters today.  Kengeter’s base salary was just 874,626 francs out of total
compensation of 9.32 million francs in 2010, according to a
report on UBS’s website. The balance included bonuses and
deferred cash payments. The bank usually decides on variable
bonuses in January.  Ermotti declined to say what he plans to do about his own
compensation.  About 707 million francs of UBS’s 2011 bonus pool will be
deferred into future years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
