Zelezara Smederevo, the Serbian steel
plant the government bought back last week from  U.S. Steel
Corp. , will suspend production for at least 10 days, the state
 Tanjug  newswire reported, citing general manager.  The unprofitable steelworks, already working at less than
half of its annual capacity of 2.2 million tons of steel, is not
getting the coke and ore it needs because heavy snowfall and
freezing temperatures are disrupting traffic along the Danube
river, the report quoted Vukoica Scekic as saying.  U.S. Steel sold the plant for $1 and the government took it
back saying it would have to subsidize production to prevent the
loss of some 5,400 jobs there.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
