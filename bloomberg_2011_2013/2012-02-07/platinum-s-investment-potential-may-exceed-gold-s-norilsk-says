Platinum group metals’ investment
potential may exceed gold’s and could be underestimated by
investors, said  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , the world’s biggest
palladium producer.  “PGMs have investment potential comparable or even greater
than gold,” Roman Panov, Norilsk’s international assets
director, said in a speech at the Investing in African Mining
Indaba in  Cape Town  today.  About 35 percent of global annual gold output is
accumulated as investment compared with only 8 percent for
platinum and 14 percent for palladium. Exchange-traded funds for
PGMs, which started in 2007, “have become the dominating
investment vehicle for physical PGM,” he said. Platinum,
palladium and rhodium are PGMs.  Palladium has rallied 24 percent from a one-year low in
October while platinum has increased 16 percent this year. The
metals are used in devices that capture noxious gases in
vehicles and to make jewelry.  On-ground stocks of PGMs are much lower than those for
gold, Panov said. If the production is halted, existing platinum
stockpiles could last seven months and palladium 16 months,
while there’s enough gold to meet demand for 22 years, Panov
said.  Platinum demand will rebound strongly in 2013, “matched to
a lesser extent by an increase in supply,” Panov said. The
advance in demand should push the platinum market back into a
deficit, driving prices higher, he said.  Palladium may have a deficit of about 355,000 ounces in
2012 and 517,000 ounces in 2013, he said.  Price Increases  Palladium will probably climb to $2,100 per ounce by 2017
“while upside for platinum price is 50 percent,” he said.  Platinum retreated 0.3 percent to $1,621.25 an ounce by
2:53 p.m. in  London  while palladium for March delivery lost 1.1
percent to $698.25 an ounce. Gold rose for the first time in
three days, adding 0.5 percent to $1,728.98 an ounce.  Norilsk, which is also the largest nickel producer, is
considering buying platinum assets in  South Africa  to increase
production of PGMs during the next decade, Reuters reported,
citing Panov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
