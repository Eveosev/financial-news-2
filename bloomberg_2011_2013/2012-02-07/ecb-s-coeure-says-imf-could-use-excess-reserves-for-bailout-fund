European Central Bank Executive Board
member Benoit Coeure said global excess currency reserves should
be deployed via the  International Monetary Fund  to bail out
countries facing payments crises.  “The IMF could borrow global excess reserves and use them
to support program countries that are suffering from liquidity
shortages under strict conditionality,” Coeure said, according
to a text of a speech delivered in Frankfurt yesterday and
released today by the ECB. “It would be advisable to use some
of these excess reserves to stabilize the international monetary
system, while  Europe  is enhancing its firewall.”  After European leaders pledged in December to boost
contributions to the IMF by 200 billion euros ($263 billion) as
a bulwark against a worsening of the two-year-old sovereign debt
crisis, the fund’s managing director,  Christine Lagarde , said
she hoped other countries would “do their part.”  “According to estimates, U.S.  government bonds  of around
$2.1 trillion and overall reserves of $6.5 trillion are held by
emerging market economies,” Coeure said. “However, standard
methods to quantify the optimal level of reserves suggest that
the current level of reserves would not be justified purely for
precautionary motives.”  Coeure, who joined the board of the ECB last month, added
that as “significant progress” had been made in combating the
sovereign debt crisis, euro-area government bonds “will be
viewed once again as risk free.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
