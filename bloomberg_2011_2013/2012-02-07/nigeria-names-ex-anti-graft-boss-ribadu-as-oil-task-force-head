Nigeria named  Nuhu Ribadu , a former
anti-corruption chief, as head of a special oil-revenue  task
force  set up to “enhance probity and accountability” in
Africa’s top crude producer, Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison- Madueke said.  The task force will “determine and verify all petroleum
upstream and downstream revenue due and payable to the
government” and take steps to recover debts, Alison-Madueke
said today in an e-mailed statement from Abuja, the capital.  Alison-Madueke last month set up panels to investigate
management and controls in government companies, including the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., to help end
corruption and speed changes in Nigeria’s oil industry.  Ribadu was taken off the  Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission  by President Umaru Yar’Adua and dismissed from the
 Nigeria  Police in 2008 after he rejected a new posting and
demotion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
