OAO Sberbank ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, rose in  New York  to the highest in six months after
reporting its profit increased 9.4 percent in January from a
year earlier.  Sberbank’s American depositary receipts advanced 2.2
percent to $12.79 at 3:11 p.m. in New York, the highest price
since Aug. 9. The  shares  fell 0.4 percent on the Micex exchange
in Moscow today, closing at 93.48 rubles, or $3.13. One ADR
equals four ordinary shares.  Net income rose to 29.2 billion rubles ($971 million), the
Moscow-based bank said today on its  website . Net interest income
climbed 28 percent on a year-on-year basis. Bad loans were
little changed at 3.35 percent of total lending as of Feb. 1,
compared with the start of the year, Sberbank said.  Sberbank is  Alfa Bank ’s “top sector pick” among Russian
banks, Moscow-based analysts Jason Hurwitz and Eldar Vaganov
said today in an e-mailed report from Alfa Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
