Yields on Mexican peso-denominated
bonds rose to a three-week high as Greek leaders struggled to
reach consensus on reforms demanded by creditors for a bailout,
paring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The yield on the debt due in 2024 rose eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.40 percent, the highest since
Jan. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the securities fell 0.86 centavo to 131.48 centavos per peso.  Greece ’s leaders have yet to reach consensus over cuts
required for a bailout as unions called a strike to protest.
German industrial output unexpectedly dropped the most in three
years in December as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on confidence
and the global economic slowdown damped demand. Production fell
2.9 percent from November, when it stagnated, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said today.  “Markets are nervous again about Greece,”  Rafael Camarena , a Mexico City-based economist at Banco Santander SA,
said by phone. “We have seen a very significant rally in the
bonds recently. It’s been reversing a bit in the prior days, but
today in particular. This is Greece and significant
uncertainty.”  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  postponed a meeting
with heads of the political parties supporting his caretaker
government a second time in as many days as the government and
international creditors haggled over terms to secure a second
aid package.  Mexico sold all 6 billion pesos of 28-day Cetes and 7
billion pesos of the 91-day securities it offered today, the
central bank said on its website. It also sold all 8.5 billion
pesos in 182-day bills and 9.5 billion pesos of 364-day Cetes it
auctioned today, the bank said.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 12.6750 per  U.S. dollar , from
12.6683 yesterday. The peso has gained 10 percent this year, the
most among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
