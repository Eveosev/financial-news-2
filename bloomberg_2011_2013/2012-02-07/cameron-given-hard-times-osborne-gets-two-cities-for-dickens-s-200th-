U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
marking the 200th anniversary of author Charles Dickens’s birth
today, was given an austerity-themed gift by Culture Secretary
Jeremy Hunt, a copy of the novelist’s classic “Hard Times.”  Hunt, who presented a Dickens book to each member of the
Cabinet, also gave Cameron a second novel: “Great
Expectations.” Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne,
wrestling with relations between members of the European single
currency and  London ’s finance industry, received “A Tale Of Two
Cities,” set during the French Revolution.  Cameron and Osborne are aiming to rid Britain of a  budget
deficit  equal to 9 percent of gross domestic product by 2017.
The 147 billion-pound ($233 billion) austerity program will cost
more than 700,000 government jobs. The Dickens anniversary is a
major cultural theme this year in Britain and was also marked
today by a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey.  Among other Cabinet members, Foreign Secretary  William Hague  got “The Uncommercial Traveler,” Business Secretary
Vince Cable was given “A Christmas Carol,” and George Young,
leader of the House of Commons, got “Bleak House.”  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal
Democrat junior partners in the coalition, was given “Oliver
Twist,” the tale of a boy who asked for more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
