Indorama Ventures Pcl ,  Thailand â€™s
largest polyester producer, agreed to buy the ethylene-producing
units of Texas-based Old World Industries Ltd. for $795 million.  The company will acquire Old World Industries 1 Ltd. and
Old World Transportation Ltd., owners of the single largest U.S.
production facility for ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol,
Bangkok-based Indorama said in a regulatory filing.  Mono ethylene glycol is one of the key components, together
with purified terephthalic acid, in the manufacture of
polyethylene terephthalate and polyester fibers and yarns, which
Indorama produces, the company said. Clear Lake, Texas-based Old
World has the capacity to produce 435,000 metric tons of
ethylene products a year, Indorama said.  The acquisition will be financed in part by new credit
facilities provided by Siam Commercial Bank Pcl and internal
cash, Indorama said in a separate statement on its website.
Evercore Partners and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  advised Indorama on the
deal, Indorama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
