Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. equity exchange operator, said it’s boosting power,
capacity and speed for electronic traders willing to pay for the
fastest access to its markets.  The New York-based exchange announced two services for
clients who place their computer servers in Nasdaq OMX’s data
center. The so-called Super Cab plan offers customers as much as
17 kilowatts of power. The 40G service will cut latency, or the
time to trade, by an average of 7 microseconds compared with the
current 10G program, Nasdaq OMX said.  Market operators such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Boerse AG are boosting the services they offer to
increase the use of co-location, in which customers place
servers near the exchange’s systems that match buy and sell
orders. The setup allows firms to reduce the time it takes to
receive an execution or confirm that their order was canceled.  Nasdaq OMX posted fourth-quarter earnings last week that
 beat  projections as revenue  climbed . Earnings were 63 cents a
share excluding some items such as debt refinancing and a charge
for an investment in Dubai Financial Market, topping the 61-cent
 average estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
