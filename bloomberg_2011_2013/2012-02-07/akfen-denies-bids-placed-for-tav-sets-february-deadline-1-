Vinci SA  of  France , Carlyle Group LP
and the Qatar Investment Authority didn’t place bids for Turkish
airport operator  TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS , said Hamdi Akin,
the chairman of TAV’s owner  Akfen Holding AS , denying earlier
media reports.  “At the moment there are no such bids and the news is
incorrect,” Akin said in an interview in Istanbul today.
“There are no such names.”  Akfen and partner Tepe will receive bids for TAV on Feb. 17
or Feb. 21, Akin said. They hired Credit Suisse for a possible 
sale of a stake in September.  Akfen fell 0.4 percent to 8.96 liras at 11:25 a.m. in
Istanbul, reversing earlier gains and sliding for the first day
in five. TAV declined 0.7 percent to 8.42 liras, dropping for a 
second day. TAV climbed to the highest since 2007 on Feb. 3, on 
bets that the sale of a stake in TAV to one of the three reported 
bidders would prompt an offer to buy the shares of remaining 
investors.  Vinci SA (DG) , Carlyle and QIA are the leading bidders for a 36
percent stake in TAV, Reuters reported on Feb. 3, citing three
people it didn’t identify.  Six companies, including  Aeroports de Paris , are interested
in buying TAV, Vatan newspaper reported on Dec. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
