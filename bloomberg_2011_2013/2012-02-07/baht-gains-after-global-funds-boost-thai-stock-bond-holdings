Thailand ’s baht approached an eight-
week high after international investors raised their holdings of
the nation’s assets on optimism growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
second-biggest economy will improve.  Global funds bought $71 million more Thai equities than
they sold yesterday and were net purchasers of government debt
worth $181 million, according to data from the stock exchange
and the Thai Bond Market  Association . The $319 billion economy
will grow 4.6 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier estimate
of 4.2 percent, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday. Greek
leaders will discuss today additional measures needed to secure
a European Union-led rescue package.  “Fund inflows are supporting the baht,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in  Tokyo . “But sentiment has been quite fragile as talks over
 Greece  aren’t settled yet.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 30.91 per dollar as of 3:08
p.m. in Bangkok and reached 30.86 earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It hit an eight-week high of 30.84 on
Feb. 3. The currency may stay at about 31 this week, Nishihama
said.  Thai exports may increase by between 1 percent and 5
percent in the first quarter as factories recover from last
year’s floods and demand continues to grow, the state-run Export
Promotion Department said.  Overseas sales , which account for
about two-thirds of the economy, declined 2.1 percent in
December from a year earlier, a third monthly drop, according to
central bank data released last week.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was unchanged at 3.12 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
