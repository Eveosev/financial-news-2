French government ministers and
ruling party lawmakers walked out of a  National Assembly  session
after an opposition member said recent comments by Interior
Minister Claude Gueant echoed Nazi ideology.  “You bring us back to the European ideologies that created
concentration camps,”  Serge Letchimy , an independent affiliated
with the Socialist Party, told Gueant in the chamber today.
Letchimy cited “Nazi” ideology as ruling lawmakers and
ministers stood up and left the assembly in a loud protest. The
weekly question time was subsequently suspended.  Gueant, who was President Nicolas Sarkozy’s chief of staff
until last year, told a student conference last week that
“contrary to what the relativism of the left says, for us all
civilizations are not equal.”  Gueant also said that “those that defend liberty, equality
and fraternity, seem to us superior to those that accept
tyranny, the subservience of women, social and ethnic hatred,”
according Agence France-Presse.  Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said that “some comparisons
shame those who say them,” according to a statement he issued
after the spat today. “The martyrdom of World War II victims
cannot be overused for partisanship.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
