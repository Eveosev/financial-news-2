AFC Ajax NV (AJAX)  can’t appoint Louis van Gaal and Martin Sturkenboom as directors at the Dutch  soccer
club  because the supervisory board didn’t allow member Johan Cruijff to participate in the decision, a Dutch court said..  “By keeping Johan Cruijff deliberately outside of the
decision making process on the appointments of Van Gaal and
Sturkenboom, the other board members have acted in an
unacceptable manner,” the Amsterdam district court said in a
statement on its website today.  Last November board members led by Chairman Steven ten Have
proposed naming Van Gaal as chairman after they couldn’t agree
with Cruijff on an appointment. Previously, the club adopted
Cruijff’s plan to focus on developing talented individual
players, and hired former stars Dennis Bergkamp, Jaap Stam and
Marc Overmars to help with training.  The future of the supervisory board is on the agenda of a
Feb. 10 extraordinary shareholders meeting, where a vote of
confidence on the panel is scheduled. Ajax shareholders can
dismiss the supervisory board, which will then trigger outside
appointments by an Amsterdam court.  Ajax may decide to cancel the extraordinary shareholders
meeting within the next two days, according to a statement by
lawyer Peter Wakkie on the club’s website. The club may then
follow with a procedure to include Cruijff in a proposal to
reappoint Van Gaal and Sturkenboom, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
