Cyprus Airways Ltd. described media
reports that it’s about to stop flying as “scaremongering” and
said it will continue operating.  “Such scaremongering is unfounded, lacks seriousness and
may probably serve other agendas,” the state-run company said
in an e-mailed statement today. “It also causes confusion and
uncertainty among passengers intending to travel with the
company”.  The airline, which  posted  losses of29.3 million euros
($38.4 million) for the first half of 2011, said it is in talks
with its shareholders, including the Cypriot government which
owes 70 percent, to secure its viability and to attract a
“credible strategic investor”.  Cyprus Airways recorded net income of 215,000 euros in
2010, after receiving a 20 million euros compensation package
from the Cypriot government for extra costs incurred as a result
of  Turkey ’s ban on Cypriot traffic. It underwent restructuring a
year ago in an attempt to save 40 million euros annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
