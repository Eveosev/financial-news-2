Iran’s parliament may summon
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  to answer questions about his
alleged economic and political mismanagement, the state-run  Fars 
news agency reported.  The move, which underscores a power struggle in recent
years between the president and his critics inside the
government, comes ahead of the March 2 parliamentary elections.  Lawmakers will question Ahmadinejad for his attempt to
minimize the role of parliament, Fars said. They will also probe
charges that Ahmadinejad has belittled government officials, not
properly implemented an aid package and failed to respond
promptly to demands from Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ,
according to Fars, which published a list of the questions.  Ahmadinejad will have a month to appear before parliament
once the summons is sent, Mohammad Reza Bahonar,  Iran ’s deputy
parliamentary speaker, said in the Fars report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
