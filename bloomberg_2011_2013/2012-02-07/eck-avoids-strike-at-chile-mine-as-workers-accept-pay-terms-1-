Workers at  Teck Resources Ltd.’s 
Quebrada Blanca copper mine in  Chile  agreed to new wage terms,
averting a strike that was scheduled to start as soon as today.  The union will revise a final document before the accord is
ratified, union leader Jorge Flores said by telephone. More than
85 percent of workers voted in favor of the new terms, he said.  Global copper supply was disrupted last year by strikes in
Chile, Indonesia and  Peru . Teck produces about 1.6 percent of
Chile’s output of the metal. The South American nation accounts
for about a third of the world’s copper.  At its Andacollo mine, Vancouver-based Teck reached a wage
accord with workers last month.  Contract workers at BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida copper
mine in Chile are considering voting on a strike, union leader
Jorge Marin said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Copper for March delivery retreated 0.5 percent to $3.846 a
pound by 10:52 a.m. on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
