The U.S. moved to support financial
experts from the  International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  to
assist Myanmar in rebuilding its economy as it rewards the
former military dictatorship for taking steps toward democracy.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  signed a partial waiver
yesterday to lift the restrictions on global financial
institutions imposed under the Trafficking Victims Protection
Act, according to a statement. It will allow the U.S. to support
assessment missions and limited technical assistance provided by
the IMF and World Bank, it said.  “Assessments by international financial institutions will
provide critical means to gain a greater understanding of
Burma’s economic situation, particularly its severe poverty
alleviation needs and capacity gaps,” the State Department said
in the  statement , referring to the country by its former name.  Myanmar was listed last year among nations that do not
comply with minimum standards in combating human trafficking in
an annual State Department report along with 22 other countries
including  North Korea , Iran and Yemen. Under U.S. law, the
president can determine to withhold aid and development
assistance to the worst offenders.  President Barack Obama delegated that authority to Clinton
on Feb. 3, according to the State Department statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
