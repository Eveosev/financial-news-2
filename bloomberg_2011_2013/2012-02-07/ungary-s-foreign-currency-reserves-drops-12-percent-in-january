Hungary’s foreign currency reserves
dropped 12 percent in January from December, according to
central bank data published on its website today.  Foreign currency reserves fell to 31.1 billion euros ($40.7
billion) at the end of January from 35.1 billion euros at the
end of December, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said. Total reserves
dropped to 37.3 billion euros from 37.8 billion euros in the
same period as an increase in “other reserve assets” tempered
the drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
