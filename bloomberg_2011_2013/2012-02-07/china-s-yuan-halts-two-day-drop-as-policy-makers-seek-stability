The yuan snapped a two-day drop on
speculation policy makers will seek stability in the currency
before Chinese Vice President  Xi Jinping  visits the U.S. next
week.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  steady at
6.3116 per dollar. The yuan, which advanced 4.7 percent in 2011,
is little changed this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. U.S. lawmakers including Democratic Senator  Charles
Schumer  of New York have said that an undervalued yuan gives
Chinese exporters an unfair advantage over their American
counterparts.  “Ahead of Xi’s visit to the U.S., the currency issue may
emerge again,” said Teck Kin Suan, an economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “But China is seeking
stability because of the global turmoil. We’re going to see
appreciation, but the pace of gains won’t be as strong as last
year’s.”  The yuan advanced 0.07 percent to 6.3078 per dollar as of
10:59 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on
either side of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.3014. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.05
percent to 6.2756, a 0.5 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
