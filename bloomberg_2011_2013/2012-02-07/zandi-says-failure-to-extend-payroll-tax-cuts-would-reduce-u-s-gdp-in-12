Mark Zandi , chief economist at
Moody’s Analytics Inc., will tell lawmakers that failure to
extend the payroll-tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits
would “deliver a significant blow” to the  U.S. economy .  Economic growth in the U.S. will be reduced by 0.7
percentage point in 2012 if both programs aren’t extended
through year-end, Zandi said in remarks to be delivered to the
Joint Economic Committee of Congress today. If the programs are
extended, the world’s largest economy will expand by 2.6
percent, he said.  “A self-sustaining economic expansion is close at hand,
but only if policy makers do not pull their support from the
economy too quickly,” Zandi said in prepared remarks. “Not
extending these programs would deliver a significant blow to the
still-tentative economy.”  Congress is deciding whether to prolong a two-percentage
point reduction in the payroll tax and unemployment insurance
that covers those out of work for up to 99 weeks before both
expire at the end of the month. Lawmakers agreed to extend the
benefits for two months past a Dec. 31 expiration because they
couldn’t agree on how to finance the provisions for 12 months.  The impact on the labor market “will also be meaningful,”
costing more 500,000 jobs and raising the  unemployment rate  by
at least 0.3 percentage point by year-end, Zandi calculated. The
jobless rate was 8.3 percent in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
