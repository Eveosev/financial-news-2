Senate Finance Committee Chairman  Max Baucus  said Senate Democrats will “soon” offer a proposal to
 House Republicans  on revisions to the U.S.  unemployment 
insurance system.  Baucus, a Montana Democrat, said the proposed changes would
address the number of weeks that someone could receive benefits,
along with House proposals to let states give drug tests to
recipients or require them to work toward a high school
equivalency diploma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
