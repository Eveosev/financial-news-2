Five people are missing after a cave-
in at an undersea tunnel at its Mizushima refinery in western
 Japan , JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. said.  One person escaped after the shaft started filling with
seawater, said a company official who asked to remain
unidentified, citing internal policy. The tunnel is under
construction to build a pipeline for naphtha and other
petrochemical products, the official said.  The accident will not affect existing pipelines and the
output of the Mizushima A and B plants, which have a combined
capacity of 365,000 barrels a day, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
