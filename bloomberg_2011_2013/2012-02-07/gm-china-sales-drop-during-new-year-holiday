General Motors Co. , the world’s
biggest automaker, reported its first drop in  China  sales in six
months as purchases slowed during the weeklong Lunar New Year
holiday.  Deliveries to Chinese dealers fell 8 percent to 246,654
vehicles in January, from 268,071 a year earlier, the Detroit-
based company said in a statement today. This year’s holiday
extended from Jan. 23 to Jan. 29 and marked the start of the
year of the dragon.  “People and workers are leaving for their hometowns,
families are going on holiday,” said Namrita Chow, Shanghai-
based analyst at IHS Automotive. “This reduces the number of
people looking to buy cars.”  GM, which regained its global sales crown from  Toyota Motor
Corp.  last year, is counting on the world’s biggest vehicle
market to help protect its lead as Japanese carmakers rebound
from a year of natural disasters. The Detroit-based company
plans to focus on expanding its luxury car brand Cadillac and
its sport-utility vehicle lineup in China to double deliveries
in the country by 2015.  The Lunar holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas in the
U.S., is among the biggest selling periods in China and parts of
 Asia . Chinese consumers spend more at home and at overseas
vacation spots such as  Hong Kong  and Macau.  Holiday Sales  Holiday retail sales on the mainland grew 16 percent to 470
billion yuan ($75 billion), according to data from the Ministry
of Commerce, the slowest pace since the 2009 financial crisis
and three percentage points below last year’s increase.  Chevrolet sales fell 20 percent from a year earlier to
54,399 units. Deliveries of Wuling vehicles, commonly used for
transporting both people and goods, dropped to 106,573 from
123,920. Buick sales rose to 71,056 units from 70,441 a year
earlier, while sales at the luxury Cadillac brand rose to 2,987
from 2,530 units.  China’s overall vehicle sales will probably increase 8
percent this year, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers. Deliveries slowed to 2.5 percent in
2011 from the 32 percent rate in 2010, after the government
withdrew a two-year package of tax breaks and rebates that
helped the country overtake the U.S.  Vehicle sales growth in China last year lagged behind the
U.S. for the first time in at least 14 years, according to
figures from the Chinese industry group and U.S. researcher
Autodata Corp.  Product Lineup  GM, which received a $50 billion bailout from the U.S.
government in 2009, sold an average of one car or truck every 12
seconds in the world’s largest car market last year as it
started a five-year rollout of more than 60 new and upgraded
models in China.  The carmaker’s deliveries to Chinese dealers rose by 8.3
percent to 2.55 million vehicles in 2011. That compares with the
29 percent increase it reported in 2010.  GM aims to double deliveries in the country to 5 million by
2015,  Kevin Wale , the automaker’s China president, said on Dec.
21. He forecast that Chinese auto demand may expand 7 percent to
10 percent in 2012, led by demand for passenger cars, with sales
of commercial vehicles probably growing 5 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
