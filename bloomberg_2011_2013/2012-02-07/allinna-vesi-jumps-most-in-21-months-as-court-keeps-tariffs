AS Tallinna Vesi ,  Estonia ’s biggest
water utility, rose the most in 21 months after a court kept
suspended an order by the competition authority to cut the
company’s tariffs until a final ruling.  The stock rose as much as 7.1 percent, the biggest increase
since April 2010, trading 7 percent higher at 7.17 euros at
11:20 a.m. in Tallinn. Tallinna Vesi has lost 20.6 percent in
the last 12 months, compared with a 38 percent loss for its
eastern European peers, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Tallinn Administrative Court yesterday kept suspended
the fulfillment of a competition authority order imposing a 29
percent cut in the company’s tariff mechanism, Tallinna Vesi
said in a statement earlier today. The suspension will last
until the court delivers a ruling on tariffs. No dates have been
set yet for the start of proceedings to review the company’s
complaint.  The Tallinn-based company, 35 percent-owned by Warrington,
England-based United Utilities Plc, filed a complaint last June,
saying the Competition Board’s decision to reject the company’s
application to raise tariffs violates the terms of a
privatization agreement signed in 2001, including a tariff plan
through 2015. The Competition Board said last May the tariff
increase application can’t be approved because the company’s
profitability is “unreasonable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
