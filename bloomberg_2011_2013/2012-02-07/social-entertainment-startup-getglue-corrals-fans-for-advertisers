     Last summer, Home Box Office worked with a New York
startup called GetGlue on an online campaign to promote the
cable network’s vampire series, "True Blood." From late May
through June, fans who visited a page that GetGlue created
could unlock digital stickers and win real bottles of Tru
Blood, a carbonated blood-orange drink that looks not unlike
what the characters drink in the show. Fans on the page could
also chat with one another about the forthcoming premiere and
learn about related programming.  HBO  didn’t pay GetGlue for the promotion, but both
companies benefited from the more than 1.5 million visits. The
GetGlue page for "True Blood" sparked excitement using “swag
that’s special to a ‘super fan,’” says Sabrina Caluori, vice
president of social media & performance marketing for HBO. And
HBO promoted GetGlue to the nearly 10 million fans on the
show's Facebook page, driving traffic and boosting credibility
for the nascent venture. "The nature of the relationship is to
share with fans what you're watching," says 39-year-old
founder and Chief Executive Officer  Alex Iskold. "Networks
love that it's essentially free and effective marketing for
them."  As more and more individuals chat online about
books, movies, video games, and television shows, established
players such as Facebook and a handful of technology startups
like GetGlue are working on ways to corral their conversations
and connect them with advertisers. In September, Facebook
introduced a feature that broadcasts what its users are
reading, watching, and listening to across the Web. GetGlue
goes a step further by creating dedicated pages on which
friends and fans can chat about a specific show or book or
band, even suggesting related items that could be of interest.
(Enjoy "True Blood?" Try the Charlaine Harris books the show
is based on -- or an additional HBO series, "Rome.")  Users access GetGlue via its website, its mobile app, or
any of the more than 30 major TV network or cable apps and
websites that carry GetGlue code. The code allows GetGlue
users to "check in" by clicking a button that posts what they
are consuming ("I'm watching 'True Blood'" or "I'm reading
'The Help'") in GetGlue and other social networks. GetGlue's
interface features a real-time stream of friends'
activities, along with separate conversations from the fans of
shows that users have checked into. Incentives for checking in
include becoming a show's “guru” -- a distinction awarded to
users from fellow users for the quality of their comments and
replies -- as well as access to exclusive content and
autographed paraphernalia from the shows’ stars.  GetGlue gets paid for certain promotions, such as one
launched in September with PepsiCo Beverages, in which the
drink maker essentially bought advertising space (name and
logo) on virtual promotions for the Fox singing competition
show, "The X Factor." "We wanted to create a solid integration
for the brand in the show in the social world," says Andrea
Harrison, Pepsi’s director of digital engagement.  This September, 35-person GetGlue inked its biggest deal
yet, enabling DirecTV’s 30 million subscribers to check in to
shows and movies they're watching. Iskold says GetGlue's more
than 2 million users checked in more than 100 million times in
2011. He plans to hire up to 15 additional employees by 2013
to build new features.  "[GetGlue] really held their ground in the check-in
space,” says Elizabeth Shaw, an analyst for Forrester
Research. She notes that the availability of new marketing
options from other players means GetGlue is “going to start
feeling the heat." Still, Iskold -- a software engineer who
previously started two tech companies, one of which IBM bought
for an undisclosed amount -- expects over $1 million in
revenue in 2012. In early January, GetGlue received a $12
million round of venture capital funding, bringing total
external investment to $24 million. Iskold says the company is
at least 18 months from turning a profit.  Jesse Redniss, senior vice president of digital for USA
Networks, began working with GetGlue in 2010. "While we were
trying to harness the social conversation leading up
to, during, and after our shows, we started seeing that a good
portion of those conversations were actually stemming from
users who were checked in to GetGlue," says Redniss. "You
really take notice of a small, rabid fan base being able to
move the needle that much."  When Iskold used $6 million to launch GetGlue in late
2009, he was betting that the kind of enthusiasm people share
at the office water cooler would flourish online. "We live in
the age of social networking, but I still don't know what TV
shows my friends are watching or what books they're reading,"
says Iskold. "How do we make this really easy to know what
your friends are consuming? That was my inspiration for
starting GetGlue. [For] literally everyone I meet, there's at
least one show, there's at least one book or movie or piece of
music they are passionate about," says Iskold.  To contact the reporter on this story: Steve Cooper at
