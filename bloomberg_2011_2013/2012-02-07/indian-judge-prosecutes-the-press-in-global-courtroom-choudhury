If you believe yourself interested in Indian affairs, and haven't heard of Justice Markandey Katju, this means that -- there is no charitable way of saying it -- there is something negligent or insincere about your commitment. This is because, for at least three months now,  the good justice , recently retired from the  Supreme Court  of India, has been trying to reach all Indians, and further, all those in touch with Indian opinion. He has been telling them what stage of history India has reached, what is wrong with the fourth estate,  what the purpose of art is , how the ancients and the philosophers of the Enlightenment lived,  what the guiding principles of the citizenry should be , and who the writers worth reading are. He has published heroically long essays in newspapers, prepared a lecture for every invitation to deliver one, and appeared repeatedly in television debates. Recently, he started his  own blog , where he publishes tracts on the history of  India , the country's languages, women's emancipation and the caste system. Last week,  he debuted on Twitter , where his feed is accompanied by a photograph of him in his judicial robes. What explains this sudden, unstoppable eruption of this 65-year-old comet across the sky? Early last October,  Katju was appointed  chairman of the  Press Council of India , a quasi-judicial body that serves as a watchdog on the press and is by convention headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The council attends to complaints against the press, but only has the powers to censure a periodical for journalistic misdemeanors, not to penalize. Within a month of assuming office, though, Katju let it be known that he was going to interpret his responsibilities in the broadest possible way -- and that he was not simply going to wait for complaints to come in, but instead would treat his own views as actionable. In a piece published widely in Indian newspapers in November, he launched a long and stinging attack on what he saw as the decadence of the Indian media and its dereliction of journalistic ideals. Comparing the task of the Indian press with that played by the press in the European Enlightenment,  he wrote : There's much to admire about this argument and its wide-angle view of the task of journalism, even if any historian would find impossibly naive Katju's views about "the honourable path which the print media in Europe in the Age of Enlightenment was following," and any journalist would bristle at the patronizing language of "80 per cent people who are doing wrong things can be made good people by patient persuasion." The essay created a stir both among the public and journalists, especially since Katju declared at the same time, in a  television interview  with Karan Thapar, that he believed the majority of journalists to be of a very poor intellectual level. Often, failure undoes a man; in India, though, success frequently has the same effect. Katju has thrown himself enthusiastically yet peevishly into every debate on which he possesses an opinion, as if in love with the sound of his own voice and his new public profile. His remarks appear almost daily in the Indian press, which -- like any other press -- loves a colorful quote. What began as an intellectually coherent argument has now become a global diatribe, as if the world were not much more than an especially large courtroom to be preached to and instructed. The thoughts that now emerge from Justice Katju (as he likes to call himself, despite his retirement) aren't always well-judged or welcome. Indeed, their sententiousness, verbosity, and pedantry -- consider the parenthetical at the end of this citation, "Really, the Lady doth protest too much! (Shakespeare: Hamlet)" -- invite more derision than respect. Responding, for instance, to criticisms from newspaper editors who disputed his  demand for greater powers , the good justice revealed a special password to the door of his approbation: Did it now? There is rich humor to be found in that "At that time I mentioned the name of Zola...", as if no period of 10 minutes ever passes in Katju's life without him thinking of the French novelist. And just as amusing is the mingled candor and pompousness of, "I earlier did not have a very high opinion of him..." After  the fracas over the non-appearance of Salman Rushdie  at the recent Jaipur Literary Festival,  Katju turned up again  to pronounce on the matter ("I am submitting five points for consideration on the topic.") The piece is worth reading, if only for an insight into the unconscious egotism of a certain kind of Indian intellectual (almost always male). Katju mixes up the issue of individual liberty with that of a writer's quality, and further, offers up his own puzzlement before Rushdie's texts as definitive evidence of their general unreadability.  Self-published on his website , the piece is an illustration of why every writer needs an editor -- or conversely, how the absence of an editor reveals a writer in his truest colors. In that these perorations are shoved down the throats of Indian readers only because of Katju's position as chairman of the Press Council, they point to nothing so much as a gross misuse by the justice of his powers, exactly the sin of which he accuses the Indian media.  In a piece on the website of the media watchdog The Hoot , Archana Venkat spelled out the criticisms to be made of Katju: An even more entertaining perspective on the retired judge's diagnoses and hypotheses was offered by Deepanjana Pal in the Sunday Guardian, in a piece called " Justice Katju, The Performance Artist ": Chairman of the Press Council in October, "performance art project" by February -- the travails of Katju on his campaign of universal reform seem just as extreme as those being suffered by India in this "very painful and agonising period." We may end in a manner that would find favor with Justice Katju, by quoting a canonical writer from anywhere between the sixteenth and the mid-nineteeth centuries: "He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument." (Shakespeare, "Love's Labor's Lost.") (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)
