Sunoco Inc. , the Philadelphia-based
company that is exiting refining, rose for a second straight day
after announcing plans to boost its dividend and buy back as
much as 19.9 percent of its shares.  Sunoco increased 2 percent to $40.60 at 4:01 p.m. in  New
York  and has risen 6 percent since announcing Feb. 2 the share-
buying plan and an increase in its quarterly dividend to 20
cents a share from 15 cents. The shares have risen 19 percent
this year.  Chief Executive Officer Lynn Elsenhans’ push to close or
sell the company’s last two Pennsylvania-based refineries and
focus on its logistics business has improved the company’s
strategic position, Thomas Coleman and  Steven Wood , two analysts
at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a Feb. 3 report.  “With these steps, we view Sunoco as better-positioned
from a leverage and operating perspective to focus on and
support its core business,” Coleman and Wood said.  Elsenhans announced her departure Feb. 2. Chief Financial
Officer Brian P. MacDonald, 46, will take over as chief
executive and chairman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
