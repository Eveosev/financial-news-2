Arseus NV , the Belgian supplier of
ingredients to compounding pharmacies, reported a 25 percent
jump in net income for 2011, boosted by a 35 percent increase in
sales from its Fagron compounding business.  Net income rose to 28.1 million euros ($36.9 million) from
22.4 million euros a year earlier, Waregem, Belgium-based Arseus
said today in a statement. Revenue climbed 16 percent to 492.3
million euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and one-time items, or Rebitda, rose 21 percent.  The company met its own forecast for revenue and
profitability growth, though the results missed its forecast for
organic sales, which exclude acquisitions. The company predicts
“healthy organic growth” this year with profitability
increasing faster than revenue.  “Arseus posted strong 2011 numbers which were broadly in
line with expectations,” Jan De Kerpel, an analyst at KBC
Securities NV in Brussels who rates the stock “buy,” wrote in
a note. “Rebitda and net profit increased much stronger than
sales growth, thus organic growth lagged. Fagron maintained its
strong margins.”  The company increased its gross dividend 14 percent to 50
cents a share.  Arseus shares rose as much as 4 percent to 11.44 euros in
Brussels. The stock traded at 11.19 euros, or 1.7 percent
higher, at 10:13 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
