Heating oil surged to the highest
level since May as colder weather in  Europe  boosted gasoil
futures.  Futures gained as front-month gasoil’s premium to the
second-month contract, a price structure known as backwardation,
increased to the widest in almost a month amid colder weather in
Europe that has increased demand for home-heating fuel.  “Because of the cold weather in Europe, the thought is
that some of our heating oil would get displaced to Europe,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
Chicago.  March-delivery heating oil rose 2.36 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $3.1943 a gallon at 11:13 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $3.2208, the highest intraday level
since May 3.  February gasoil rose $8 to $996.25 a metric ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . The contract traded at as
much as $2.25 a metric ton more than March, the biggest spread
since Jan. 12. The difference was $1 as of 11:14 a.m. in  New
York .  “You’ve probably got a squeeze going on over there with
the cold weather,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Heating oil’s premium to March gasoline rose to 25.66 cents
from 24.28, the widest difference since Jan. 17.  Europe Colder  “With the latest activity data indicating an economic
upturn and, more importantly, colder temperatures in Europe,
demand is likely to drive prompt distillate prices higher,”
 Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP
Paribas SA in London, said in an e-mailed report today.  Futures pared gains after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the U.S. still has “a long way to go before the
labor market can be said to be operating normally.”  Gasoline for March delivery gained 0.98 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.9377 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.48 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were
11 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
