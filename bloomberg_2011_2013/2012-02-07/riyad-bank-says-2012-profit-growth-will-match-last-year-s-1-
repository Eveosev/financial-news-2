Riyad Bank ,  Saudi Arabia ’s third-
largest lender by market value, anticipates that 2012 profit
will increase as much as last year, boosted by  government
spending , Senior Vice President Hisham al-Abdali said.  “Net income this year may grow around the same figure of
last year and lending may accelerate 10 to 13 percent,” al-
Abdali said in an interview in Riyadh today. “This year will be
good, even better, thanks to the record budget.”  Saudi Arabian banks are benefiting from a pick-up in
lending as the Arab world’s biggest economy invests in
infrastructure and industrial projects. Lending to private
enterprises climbed 11 percent to 858.4 billion riyals ($229
billion) at the end of last year from 775.8 billion riyals in
December 2010, according to central bank  data .  The government forecast a budget surplus of 12 billion
riyals this year after  King Abdullah  announced a $130 billion
spending plan in 2011 to build homes and reduce unemployment.  Riyad Bank (RIBL) ’s net income rose 11 percent last year to 3.15
billion riyals from 2010, according to data on  Bloomberg .  The Riyadh-based bank’s outstanding loans to small-and-
medium businesses may climb 30 percent to 50 percent this year,
from 1.5 billion riyals at the end of December, said al-Abdali,
who is also the bank’s commercial banking manager. The lender’s
market share in SME lending rose to 30 percent last year from 25
percent a year earlier, he said.  Riyad Bank’s   shares  closed 0.4 percent higher at 24 riyals
in Riyadh today. The  stock  gained 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
