Kenya ’s shilling strengthened to its
highest in more than nine months on lower dollar demand and
speculation of U.S. currency inflows from tea exporters.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent and traded 0.3 percent higher at 83.40
per dollar as of 12:14 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. A close at
this level would be the highest since May 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling is gaining on account of low dollar demand
and expectations of dollar inflows from tea sales,” Duncan Kinuthia a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened for the first time in four
days, appreciating as much as 0.5 percent and trading 0.2
percent higher at 1,592.50 as of 12:13 p.m.  “Government authorities have been changing dollars to
shillings as donors begin releasing money for budgetary
support,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce, ABSA Group’s local unit, said today by phone from  Dar
es Salaam , the commercial capital.  Development partners have released over 90 percent of the
funds they committed to support the country’s 2011/2012 budget,
Filberto Ceriani Sebregondi, head of European Union delegation
to Tanzania, said. Donors committed about $500 million in
general budget support, Sebregondi said in a statement posted on
the delegation’s website dated Jan. 30.  The Ugandan shilling appreciated for a second day, trading
0.2 percent higher at 2,310 per dollar as of 10:55 a.m.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in Dar es Salaam.
