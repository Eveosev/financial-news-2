Freight rates for Capesize ships may
have bottomed because demand for the carriers of  iron ore  and
coal is strengthening, said DNB Bank ASA.  Rates for Capesizes on the Brazil-to- China  iron-ore  route 
rose for a fourth session yesterday after 23 declines in a row,
according to data from the Baltic Exchange in  London . Rents for
the ships gained on the Australia-to-China voyage after reaching
the lowest level since May on Feb. 3.  “The iron-ore majors came into the market yesterday, and
with more fresh cargo, it’s hard to ignore the feeling that the
market has bottomed, which will increase owners’ bargaining
power,” Nicolay Dyvik, an Oslo-based analyst at DNB Equity
Research, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Still, average daily Capesize  rates  slid for a 30th session
yesterday, declining 0.7 percent to $5,214, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in London. The ships are losing $7,342 a day on
the  Asia-to-Europe  route, the worst return since at least 1999,
exchange data show.  The  Baltic Dry Index , a broader gauge of raw-materials
shipping costs that includes smaller vessels, rose yesterday for
the first time since Dec. 12. Ship owners dropped anchor rather
than accept unprofitable rates,  Natasha Boyden , an analyst at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said in a report yesterday.  Australia and Brazil are the world’s two biggest exporters
of iron ore, a steelmaking raw material. China is the largest
global steel producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
