The European Union has an 11 billion-
euro ($14.6 billion) hole in its finances caused by more demand
for structural aid than expected, the Financial Times
Deutschland  reported , citing an interview with Budget
Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski.  Lewandowski held EU member states responsible, since they
increased the budget by only 1.86 percent for 2012 in comparison
with the previous year, less than inflation, the FTD said. The
European Commission has a budget of 129 billion euros for grants
and subsidies this year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
