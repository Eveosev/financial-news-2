Germany’s opposition  Social
Democratic Party  may allow a stalled German-Swiss  tax treaty  to
go into effect under certain conditions, the  Rheinische Post 
newspaper said, citing an SPD state minister it didn’t name.  The governments of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hamburg and Baden-
Wuerttemberg, where the SPD is in power, would no longer block
the treaty in the upper house of parliament if the Berlin-based
federal government can convince  Switzerland  to start reporting
German tax dodgers retroactively from the autumn of this year,
the newspaper cited the minister as saying. The treaty is to
take effect on Jan. 1, 2013, it said.  Support from the three states would be enough to let the
law pass even if the SPD-led government of North Rhine-
Westphalia, which insists on more far-reaching changes,
continues to resist backing it, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
