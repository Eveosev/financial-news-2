German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler plans to examine whether European Union environmental
rules can be suspended for some time to accelerate the expansion
of the countryâ€™s power grid, the  Welt am Sonntag  newspaper said,
citing an interview.  Restricting the legal means of stopping power-line
installations would also be a sensible contribution to speeding
grid expansion, the newspaper cited Roesler as saying.
Procedures must be accelerated to ensure that government energy
policy goals can be reached, Roesler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
