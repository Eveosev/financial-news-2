India’s rupee and the  Thai baht 
dropped the most among Asian currencies this week as some
investors deemed policy makers in Europe and the U.S. aren’t
doing enough to revive global economic growth.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled on
Aug. 2 that the monetary authority intends to join forces with
governments to buy bonds to ease the crisis, while conceding
that Germany has reservations. The  Federal Reserve  a day earlier
stopped short of suggesting it’s about to embark on a third
round of asset purchases.  “The market’s move has a lot to do with the ECB,”  Philip Wee , a senior currency economist in Singapore at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., said yesterday. “It’s been a week of hope that
central banks can come up with something. There was definitely
disappointment.”  The rupee dropped 0.7 percent to 55.755 per dollar this
week in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
baht fell 0.1 percent to 31.56, the most since the five days
ended June 22. Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 9,468.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index (DXY)  was at 115.52
yesterday, compared with 115.21 on July 27. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against the currencies of its six
major trading partners, dropped 0.4 percent this week.  China Manufacturing  Taiwan’s dollar, South Korea’s won and Malaysia’s ringgit
trimmed weekly gains after reports showed manufacturing and
services in China grew at a slower pace in July than the
previous month, damping the outlook for exports to the world’s
second-largest economy.  Taiwan’s currency dropped 0.1 percent yesterday to
NT$30.002 per dollar and was up 0.3 percent from July 27,
according to prices from Gretai Securities Market. The won
declined 0.3 percent to 1,134.85 for a five-day gain of 0.3
percent and the ringgit fell 0.1 percent to 3.1279, paring its
weekly advance to 0.9 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “China’s condition remains sluggish,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “It’s hard to be
aggressively buying Asian currencies until China recovers.”  Government reports in  South Korea  this week showed factory
output shrank in June from May, and a slump in exports worsened
in July. In Indonesia, overseas sales dropped 16.4 percent in
June, the biggest decrease since September 2009, resulting in a
trade shortfall of 1.3 billion, official data showed Aug. 1.  “There will be no meaningful improvement in the  trade
balance  without a rebound in commodity prices, which is unlikely
in the near term,” said Eugene Leow, an economist at DBS Group
in Singapore. “The global situation is still dicey, so capital
flows to finance the current-account deficit will be volatile.”  Elsewhere, the  Philippine peso  advanced 0.1 percent this
week to 41.855 per dollar. China’s  yuan  gained 0.1 percent to
6.3727 and was down 0.08 percent yesterday. Vietnam’s dong was
little changed at 20,858 from July 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
