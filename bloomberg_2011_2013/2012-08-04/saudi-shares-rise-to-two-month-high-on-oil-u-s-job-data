Shares in  Saudi Arabia (SASEIDX) , the Arab
world’s biggest stock market, climbed to a two-month high after
oil prices rose and U.S. employment climbed more than economists
anticipated.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker known as Sabic, advanced to the highest
level since July 3.  Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. (YANSAB) , a Sabic
unit, reached the highest value since May 23. Al-Rajhi Bank, the
kingdom’s biggest by market value, rose the most in a month.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.9 percent to 6,951.66,
the highest since May 30, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The
measure has risen 8.3 percent this year. U.S. stocks capped four
weeks of gains yesterday, giving the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  the longest rally since October, after the Labor
Department said employers added 163,000 workers in July,
exceeding the 100,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Oil surged 4.9 percent, the most since June 29.  “Given the positive sentiment in global markets and
resultant lift in crude prices, we expect the Saudi market to
react similarly,” Asim Bukhtiar, head of research at Riyad
Capital, said in response to e-mailed questions.  Sabic gained 1.1 percent to 90.75 riyals, while Yanbu
National advanced 2.8 percent to 47.50 riyals. Al-Rajhi
increased 1.4 percent to 73.75 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
