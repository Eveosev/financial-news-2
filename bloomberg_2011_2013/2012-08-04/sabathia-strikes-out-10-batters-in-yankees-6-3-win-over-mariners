C.C. Sabathia pitched his 35th career
complete game to record his 11th victory this season as the  New
York Yankees  defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-3 in a Major League
Baseball contest.  Sabathia (11-3) allowed three runs on three hits while
striking out the Mariners’ first 10 batters last night for the
American League East-leading Yankees (62-43), who have a 1-0
advantage in the three-game series at Yankee Stadium.  “I know today they came out really aggressive,” Sabathia
told reporters. “They do have a lot of lefties in their lineup,
and that tends to work in my advantage.”  Sabathia threw 72 strikes in 103 pitches in his second
complete game this season.  “He did a good job of keeping everybody off balance,”
said Casper Wells, who hit a home run as the Mariners’ 11th
batter off Sabathia in the fourth inning. “He was throwing a
lot of sliders. A lot of guys said they couldn’t pick up the
slider that well, and he changes speeds on the slider, too. I
know I had a couple of bad swings on them.”  Curtis Granderson  hit a two-run single in the third inning
to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead.  Eric Chavez  added a two-run
homer in the sixth off Seattle starter  Kevin Millwood . Robinson Cano and  Raul Ibanez  each hit run-scoring singles in the
seventh.  Yankee batters have hit home runs in 21 straight home
games, two games shy of the franchise record of 23 games set in
1963 from June 13 to July 24. Chavez joins eight teammates --
Cano, Granderson, Ibanez, Andruw Jones,  Russell Martin , Alex
Rodriguez, Nick Swisher and  Mark Teixeira  -- with at least 10
home runs, the most players in the majors.  Teixeira went 1-for-4 with a single in his return to the
lineup after missing two games with a sore wrist.  Casper Wells hit a solo home run in the fourth inning and
Dustin Ackley drove in two runs with his homer in the ninth for
the Mariners, who are in a last place in the four-team AL West
with a 50-58 record, 13 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers.  Millwood (4-9) gave up four runs on nine hits in six
innings for the loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
