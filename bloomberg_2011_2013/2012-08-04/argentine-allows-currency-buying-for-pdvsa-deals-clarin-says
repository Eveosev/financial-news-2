Argentina’s central bank authorized
local companies doing business with  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  to
buy U.S. currency, daily newspaper  Clarin  reported.  Companies will be able to buy dollars at the official
exchange rate when exporting machinery to Venezuela’s state oil
company known as Pdvsa, Clarin said.  Argentina’s  YPF SA (YPFD)  and Pdvsa yesterday signed an accord
aimed at jointly developing oil and gas projects, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
