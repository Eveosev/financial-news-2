The U.S. set a world record in
winning the women’s 400-meter medley relay, giving 17-year-old
Missy Franklin her fourth gold medal of the  Olympic Games .  The team, which also included Rebecca Soni, 25, Dana
Vollmer, 24, and Allison Schmitt, 22, swam the event in 3
minutes, 52.05 seconds.  Australia  finished second and Japan took
the bronze.  Franklin, Soni, Vollmer and Schmitt have won eight
individual gold medals between them in  London . Franklin won the
200-meter backstroke in a world-record time on Aug. 3 after also
claiming the gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke and the 800-
meter freestyle relay.  Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands finished in sixth
place in the relay, moments after exiting the pool following her
victory in the women’s 50-meter freestyle in an Olympic record
time of 24.05 seconds.  The records came shortly after  China ’s Sun Yang won his
second gold of the games, setting his own world record in the
men’s 1,500-meter freestyle. The 20-year-old took the men’s 400-
meter freestyle last weekend. He broke his previous world record
with today’s swim of 14:31.02.  To contact the reporters on this story:
