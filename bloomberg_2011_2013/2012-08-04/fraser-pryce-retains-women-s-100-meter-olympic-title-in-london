Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce of  Jamaica 
retained her 100-meter title, beating world champion Carmelita Jeter of the U.S. yesterday at  London ’s Olympic Stadium.  Fraser-Pryce, 25, who led a Jamaican one-two-three at the
Beijing games four years ago, clocked 10.75 seconds. Jeter,
dressed all in red, came back from a poor start to finish in
10.78, a season’s best for her. Veronica Campbell-Brown ran
10.81 to take bronze for Jamaica.  Fraser-Pryce, the first woman to retain the Olympic title
since American Gail Devers in 1996, led from the start, rising
quickly and building a gap before the 32-year-old Jeter, the
second-fastest woman of all time, came surging back. The
American’s efforts weren’t enough to prevent the Jamaican from
crossing first.  “The mission isn’t yet over,” Fraser-Pryce said. “I’ve
got the 200 which I have to run next.”  Fraser-Pryce, who served a six-month doping ban in 2010
after using medication for a toothache that contained a banned
substance, looked open-mouthed at the arena scoreboard before
dropping to her knees and placing both hands over her face.  Today, her countrymen Asafa Powell, Yohan Blake and
reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder Usain Bolt run
in the men’s 100 meters.  The silver is Jeter’s first Olympic medal after she failed
to make the games in 2008. A year later she ran 10.64 seconds at
a meet in  Shanghai . Only world record holder Florence Griffith Joyner has run quicker.  British Treble  In the heptathlon, Britain’s Jessica Ennis clinched the
title by winning the last of seven events, the 800 meters to
finish with 6,955 points, 327 more than silver medalist Tatyana
Chernova of  Russia .  “I am so shocked,” Ennis, 26, said. “I’m going to savor
the moment. The crowd helped me. I can’t believe I’ve done it.”  Greg Rutherford became the first British Olympic long jump
champion since Lynn Davies in 1964 with a leap of 8.31 meters
(27.3 feet).  Mo Farah then capped the British night by beating his
training partner Galen Rupp, 26, of the U.S. by half a second in
the 10,000 meters.  Farah swept past  Ethiopia ’s Tariku Bekele, 25, and got to
the front for the first time with four laps to go before surging
further ahead in the final stages to win in 27 minutes, 30.42
seconds. He slapped his head four times before bowing in prayer.  “My legs were getting tired and the crowd gave me a
boost,” Farah said. “My training partner coming second is
unbelievable.”  The 29-year-old, who was born in  Somalia , came to the U.K.
as a refugee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
