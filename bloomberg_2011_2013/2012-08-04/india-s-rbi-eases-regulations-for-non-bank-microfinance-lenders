India ’s central bank eased norms for
non-bank microfinance companies, removing a cap on lending rates
and relaxing risk-provision standards, after some lenders found
it difficult to meet existing regulations.  Non-bank microlenders must keep their average loan rates
within a year at a fixed margin over average borrowing costs,
the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a statement placed on its
website late yesterday, scrapping an earlier limit of 26 percent.
The maximum difference over funding costs shouldn’t exceed 10
percent for large microfinance firms and 12 percent for the rest,
according to the monetary authority.  The RBI also allowed the companies to include risk buffers
provided against advances in the southern Andhra Pradesh state,
which curtailed debt and waived loans to arrest a spate of
farmer suicides, in their so-called net owned funds. The
inclusion of such provisions should be gradually reduced over a
five-year period, according to the statement.  Net owned funds of a non-bank company include its equity
capital, reserves and money raised from asset sales, according
to the RBI.  New non-bank microfinance firms must have a minimum of 50
million rupees ($896,861) in funds, except those in the nation’s
northeast region, which need only 20 million rupees, according
to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
