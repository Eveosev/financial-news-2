Michael Phelps ’s Olympic career ended
yesterday with an 18th gold medal as  Jamaica ’s Shelly-Ann
Fraser-Pryce defended her 100-meter title and Britain won three
track and field events.  Phelps was part of the victorious U.S. team in the 400-
meter relay, the final swimming event of the  London  Games. In
addition to extending his record gold tally, the 27-year-old
finishes as the most decorated Olympic athlete with 22 medals.  “I’ve been able to do all the things I wanted to
accomplish,” Phelps, who’s said he plans to retire after his
fourth Olympics, told reporters. “I’ve done things no one else
has ever done and that’s what I wanted to do.”  In track and field, Fraser-Pryce held off a late challenge
from world champion Carmelita Jeter to become the first woman to
defend the 100-meter title since American Gail Devers in 1996.
Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford also won in track
and field as Britain captured six golds on the day.  The U.S. leads the  medal standings  with 26 golds and 54 in
total.  China  is second with 25 golds among its 53 medals, with
Britain climbing to third with 14 gold medals and 29 in total.  “What a night for British athletics, three golds out of a
possible three,” said Rutherford, 25.  Sprint Showdown  Medals will be awarded in 23 Olympic events today,
including the men’s 100 meters featuring defending champion and
world record holder Usain Bolt.  Roger Federer  also plays
Britain’s  Andy Murray  in men’s tennis, a rematch of the
Wimbledon final the Swiss player won last month.  Phelps teamed with Matthew Grevers, Brendan Hansen and
Nathan Adrian as the U.S. ended with 16 golds and 30 total
medals in swimming. The Americans also set a world record in
winning the women’s 400-meter relay, giving 17-year-old Missy Franklin her fourth gold medal.  Fraser-Pryce, 25, led from the start in the 100, holding
off Jeter to win in 10.75 seconds. Jamaica’s Veronica Campbell- Brown took the bronze.  Ennis clinched the heptathlon title by winning the last of
seven events, the 800 meters, before a sold-out crowd at
the Olympic Stadium. She finished with 6,955 points, 327 more
than silver medalist Tatyana Chernova of  Russia .  “I am so shocked,” said Ennis, 26. “I’m going to savor
the moment. The crowd helped me. I can’t believe I’ve done it.”  Long Jump  Rutherford became the first British Olympic long jump champ
since Lynn Davies in 1964 with a leap of 8.31 meters (27.3 feet).
Farah, 29, then capped the British night by beating his training
partner Galen Rupp of the U.S. by half a second in the 10,000
meters.  Britain also broke the world record in winning the women’s
cycling team pursuit and earned two golds in rowing.  China won five gold medals yesterday, led by swimmer Sun
Yang’s world record in the men’s 1,500-meter freestyle.  Wimbledon champion  Serena Williams  defeated Russia’s Maria Sharapova 6-0, 6-1 to add the women’s singles gold medal to her
14 tennis Grand Slam titles. Mike and  Bob Bryan  then gave the
U.S. a second tennis gold by winning the men’s doubles.  “I didn’t think it could have been better than winning
Wimbledon, but you can see how happy I am,” Williams, 30, said.
“I’ve won everything.”  Bolt, world champion Yohan Blake and American Tyson Gay won
their heats yesterday to advance to today’s 100-meter semifinals.
The final will also be run tonight.  South Africa ’s  Oscar Pistorius  became the first amputee
runner to compete in a games, reaching the semifinals of the 400
meters. The 25-year-old, who uses J-shaped carbon-fiber blades,
ran 45.44 seconds to qualify in 16th place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
