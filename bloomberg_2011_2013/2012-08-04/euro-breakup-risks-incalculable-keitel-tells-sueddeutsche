A breakup of the euro region would
pose “incalculable risks” for  Europe ’s economic and political
stability, Hans-Peter Keitel, president of Germany’s BDI
industry federation, told the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  Euro critics don’t sufficiently appreciate the advantages
of interdependence in Europe, the newspaper cited Keitel, whose
lobby group represents more than 100,000 companies with more
than 8 million workers, as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
