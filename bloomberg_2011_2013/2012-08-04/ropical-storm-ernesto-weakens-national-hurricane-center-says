Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth
named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, weakened and isnâ€™t
expected to change much in terms of intensity for the rest of
the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The weather system, which weakened to maximum sustained
winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour from 60 mph earlier,
is moving west-northwest at 18 mph, the Miami-based center said
in its latest advisory.  The storm is about 295 miles south-southeast of  Santo
Domingo ,  Dominican Republic , and about 590 miles east-southeast
of Kingston, Jamaica, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
