European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  laid the foundations last week to provide “all the
liquidity that is needed” even if the bank decides not to
intervene immediately,  Giuseppe Vegas , head of Italy’s market
regulator Consob, told daily Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview.  This should give the region’s governments “the necessary
time” to pass economic reforms, Vegas told the newspaper.
The market initially misunderstood Draghi’s remarks, he said.  Recent yield spread levels between Italian bonds and German
bunds are “unjustified” and mainly due to external contagion,
Vegas said, according to Il Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
