At least 45 people were killed and 40
more were wounded in a suicide bombing carried out yesterday by
al-Qaeda in the southern Yemeni province of Abyan, the Yemeni
Defense Ministry said on its website, citing unidentified local
officials.  A suicide bomber blew himself up at a gathering organized
by Abdullatif al-Said, according to the ministry’s website,
citing Abyan Governor Jamal al-Akil. Al-Said, who said in June
he had been an al-Qaeda sympathizer, fought that month with the
Yemeni army to drive al-Qaeda militants from cities they had
controlled for more than a year.  Two of his brothers were killed in the attack, al-Akil
said. Al-Said survived, Saba reported in a text message.  Al-Said had organized the gathering as a memorial after the
death of his nephew. The attack came after four al-Qaeda
militants were killed earlier in the day during an air strike in
the southeastern province of Hadramaut, Saba reported.  The al-Masdar independent website said the militants were
killed by a drone while driving in Hadramaut’s al-Aatan
district.  To contact the reporter on this story:
