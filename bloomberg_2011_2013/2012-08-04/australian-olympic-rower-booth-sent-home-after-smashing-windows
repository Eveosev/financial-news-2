Australian Olympic rower Josh Booth
has been sent home after smashing windows in a town on the
outskirts of  London  during a night out drinking, officials said.  “His actions were not consistent with the values that are
held high as a member of the Australian Olympic team and as a
result of his actions Josh will be discharged from the Olympic
team and he’ll be required to return back to  Australia ,” Nick
Green, the team’s chef de mission, said in a prepared statement
to reporters in London yesterday broadcast on television.  Booth, 21, was arrested by police outside London early on
Aug. 2 on suspicion of criminal damage. He was taken to Staines
Police Station, police said, and then to St. Peter’s Hospital in
Chertsey for medical treatment after bumping his head. Booth was
in Australia’s men’s eight, which finished last in the Aug. 1
final at Dorney Lake in Eton outside of London.  “The damage I caused was not motivated by any malicious
intent to steal or to destroy, but was rather an emotional
outburst, an inappropriate expression of my disappointment and
frustrations with our result in a very close and hard-fought
final,” Booth said in a prepared statement to reporters.  No charges will be leveled against Booth after he offered
to pay for the damage caused.  To contact the reporter on this story:
