German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said it would be illegal in  Germany  to grant a
banking license to the European Stability Mechanism, the future
permanent euro-area bailout fund,  Focus  magazine reported,
citing an interview.  Shared liability for public debt in Europe would burden
Germany with unlimited risks, a prospect that would violate the
country’s constitution, Westerwelle said. Europe needs to boost
its competitiveness and the entire euro region needs effective
economic policy changes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
