Britain broke its own world record in
beating the U.S. in the final of the women’s cycling 3,000-meter
team pursuit at the London Olympics.  The British team of Dani King, 21; Laura Trott, 20; and
Joanna Rowsell, 23, crossed the finish line in 3 minutes, 14.051
seconds at the Velodrome. Canada won the bronze medal.  The defending world champions posed with the  Union Jack 
after the race in front of a home crowd of 6,000. The trio broke
their record of 3:14.682 set in qualifying yesterday.  “We didn’t expect a world record in every round,” Trott
told reporters.  Britain has 11 gold and 26 total medals to rank third in
the standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
