Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
is responsible for deciding the policy of the country’s
coalition government,  Real News  cited Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos as saying in an interview published in advance for
tomorrow’s edition of the Athens-based newspaper.  The meetings of leaders of the parties supporting the
coalition are intended for monitoring the evolution of  Greece ’s
international aid agreement and not for guardianship of the
government, thus the prime minister decides policy, Real News
cited Avramopoulos as saying.  Samaras, head of the center-right New Democracy party,
formed the coalition following elections in June with the
socialist Pasok party led by  Evangelos Venizelos  and the smaller
Democratic Left headed by Fotis Kouvelis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
