 Fraport AG, the operator of
Frankfurt airport, will charge more for take-offs and landings
of loud planes from next year while making operation of less
noisy aircraft cheaper,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported, citing a
spokesman for Hesse state Economy Minister Florian Rentsch.  Fraport already takes decibels into account when charging
airlines and now seeks to further increase incentives to use
less noisy airplanes, the newspaper said. The new rules will
increase costs for operators of Boeing 747 airplanes and benefit
companies flying Airbus A380, the newspaper said, providing an
example.  To contact the reporter on this story:
