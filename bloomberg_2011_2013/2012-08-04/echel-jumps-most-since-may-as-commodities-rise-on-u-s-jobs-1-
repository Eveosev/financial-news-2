OAO Mechel,  Russia ’s biggest maker of
coking coal for steelmakers, gained the most in 11 weeks in New
York trading after better-than-expected U.S. payrolls sent
commodities higher.  The American depositary receipts surged 9.7 percent to
$6.80 in New York, the most since May 21. The company’s Moscow
 stock  rose 2.7 percent to 215.70 rubles, or $6.75. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. increased 3.5 percent to 92.20.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw materials
advanced 2.1 percent to 300.69 as crude oil surged the most in a
month. U.S. Labor Department figures showed payrolls increased
163,000 in July, compared with the 100,000 median estimate of 89
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Mechel (MTLR)  said on July 30
that it increased production of coal by 7 percent in the first
half of 2012 to 13.4 million tons.  “Market euphoria is driving Mechel higher,” Andrey Tretelnikov, an analyst at Rye Man & Gor Securities, said by
phone from Moscow today. “The company has reported a very
strong set of operating results earlier this week. The stock has
every reason to rise, driven by optimism on the outlook for
commodity demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
