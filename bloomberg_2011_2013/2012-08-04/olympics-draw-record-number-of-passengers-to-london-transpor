London ’s Underground railway carried
a record number of passengers on Aug. 2, as Olympic spectators 
joined commuters and tourists to test the city’s subway system.  A record 4.31 million passengers traveled on the
Underground that day, according to a statement from Transport 
for London. The previous busiest day for the Tube network was 
Dec. 9, 2011, when it carried 4.17 million passengers.  As many as 1 million extra visitors have been expected each
day during the games. Travelers have been “avoiding peak hours
and traveling at less busy times,” according to the statement
from TfL. While the Central Line, one of two subway lines to the
Olympic Park, was suspended yesterday morning following signal
failures, TfL expects that passenger numbers for yesterday will 
have been “even higher,” according to spokesman Stephen Taylor.  In addition to the Underground, the Docklands Light Railway
system also carried a record number of passengers on July 30,
with almost 500,000 passengers, a 65 percent increase from
normal levels, according to TfL. The Barclays Cycle Hire system
also saw record traffic in the week commencing July 23, with
more than 300,000 rentals, TfL said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
