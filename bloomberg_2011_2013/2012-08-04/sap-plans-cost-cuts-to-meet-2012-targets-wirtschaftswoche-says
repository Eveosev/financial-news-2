SAP AG (SAP)  plans to cut costs in the
second half of 2012 to achieve exchange-rate adjusted earnings 
of 5.3 billion euros ($6.6 billion) for the year, as targeted 
for the company’s bonus plan,  WirtschaftsWoche  magazine reported,
citing Chief Financial Officer Werner Brandt.  SAP’s “internal ambitions” are higher than the official
target of 5.05 billion euros to 5.25 billion euros in earnings
for 2012, the magazine cited Brandt as saying. SAP’s adjusted
first-half result of about 1.9 billion euros amounted to only 95
percent of the target for that period, Brandt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
