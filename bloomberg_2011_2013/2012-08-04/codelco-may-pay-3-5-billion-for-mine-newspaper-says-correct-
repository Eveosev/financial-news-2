(Corrects date on item.)  Codelco, engaged in a dispute with
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  over the world’s fifth-biggest copper mine,
may pay $3.5 billion for a 30 percent stake,  El Mercurio 
reported, citing people the newspaper didn’t identify.  Under terms of the agreement,  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  will lend
 Chile ’s state copper miner as much as $5.8 billion and will take
a 5 percent stake in Anglo Sur, the newspaper said.  Codelco originally planned to pay $10 billion for a 49
percent stake in Anglo Sur, which includes the Los Bronces
operation, according to El Mercurio.  The companies are still in negotiations, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
