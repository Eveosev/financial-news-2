SacOil Holdings Ltd., an explorer of
African oil and gas, has gotten “interest” from Asian and
European parties, and companies including energy producers.  “There has been interest from internationals,” Chief
Executive Officer Robin Vela told reporters in Johannesburg,
where SacOil is based, adding it isn’t in talks. He was replying
to a question on the ownership of the company and its assets.  The company plans to begin first production at two Nigerian
concessions in 2013 and 2014, followed by a venture with  Total
SA (FP)  in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It abandoned a plan to
sell additional shares to raise funds in May after the stock
lost more than half its value from a 2011 high in March. SacOil
fell 1.5 percent to 64 cents by 12:27 p.m. in Johannesburg.  It needs financing from about mid-2012 to honor exploration
obligations, Vela said in an interview. The company may also
study funding to accelerate exploration in  Nigeria , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
