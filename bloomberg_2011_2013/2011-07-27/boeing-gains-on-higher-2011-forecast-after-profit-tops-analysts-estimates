Boeing Co. (BA)  rose the most in five
months after increasing its 2011 earnings forecast and posting a
second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, buoyed by
higher commercial-jet revenue and deliveries.  Net income surged 20 percent to $941 million, or $1.25 a
share, Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement today. The
average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 97
cents. Full-year profit will be $3.90 to $4.10 a share, Boeing
said, a jump of 10 cents at each end of its previous range.  Boeing benefited from shipping 118 jets, four more than a
year earlier, and selling more services to airlines. Deliveries
matter because that’s when the company gets much of a plane’s
purchase price. The gains helped counter a drop in net jetliner
orders to 65 from 68 and a 4 percent slide in military sales.  “This is a very strong quarter driven almost entirely by
operational performance,” Noah Poponak, a  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  analyst in  New York , said in a note to investors. He
recommends buying Boeing.  The shares jumped as much as 4.3 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Feb. 25, and climbed $1.82, or 2.6
percent, to $71.98 at 2:24 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Boeing rose 7.5 percent this year through
yesterday.  Boeing left its forecast for full-year revenue unchanged at
$68 billion to $71 billion, saying it was counting on greater
productivity for the profit increase. The 2011 delivery forecast
was pared by five planes to a range of 485 to 495 airliners.  New Jets  The first 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet will be
certified by the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  by the end
of August and reach their initial customers in September, though
fewer of the new planes will enter service this year than
planned, Boeing said.  Deliveries now should total 25 to 30 787s and 747-8s,
weighted more heavily toward the jumbos, Boeing said. The
company previously said that total would be 25 to 40, split
about evenly between the two models.  Both jets have begun the required testing for function and
reliability, and crews have also started on extended-operations
trials for the 787, the world’s first composite-plastic
jetliner, the company said.  787 Output, Inventory  Boeing is building two 787s a month now, will push output
to 2.5 a month later this year and still expects to reach 10 a
month in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on a
conference call. The larger 787-9 variant will be delivered to
the first customer at the end of 2013, he said.  Inventory related to the new plane grew by $1.7 billion
last quarter, to $16.2 billion including 35 airplanes that have
already been built and not yet delivered, Chief Financial
Officer  James Bell  said.  Sales climbed 6 percent last quarter to $16.5 billion.
Boeing’s net income a year earlier was $787 million, or $1.06 a
share, on revenue of $15.6 billion.  Operating profit at the commercial unit jumped 35 percent
to $920 million as sales rose 19 percent to $8.84 billion.
Profit climbed 12 percent, to $798 million, at Boeing’s defense
segment. The drop in military revenue put the total at $7.69
billion.  Boeing is seeking foreign military contracts to counter
U.S. Defense Department budget constraints and is expanding into
new areas including cybersecurity.  Order Backlog  Commercial-jet output, already at a record, is set to surge
over the next three years as Boeing increases the tempo to work
off about seven years’ worth of unfilled orders. The backlog
declined less than 1 percent to 3,300 airplanes valued at about
$262 billion as of June 30, as some customers canceled orders.  Through the first half, Airbus SAS kept the top deliveries
spot it has held since 2003, shipping 258 jets compared with
Boeing’s 222. Airbus parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. reports earnings July 29.  The sales campaign with Airbus over a record order from  AMR
Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines  was “pretty heated” and
“aggressively priced,” McNerney said. Boeing will still make a
profit on the 200 737s being sold to American, he said.  An Airbus spokesman, Rainer Ohler, said the same yesterday
of the 260 jets sold by the Toulouse, France-based company.
American is paying an average of just $35 million to $40 million
for each A320neo, less than half the list price, according to an
estimate yesterday by Gary Liebowitz, a Wells Fargo analyst in
New York.  McNerney said Boeing anticipates being able to “offload
significant parts” of the leasing arrangement committed to with
American’s order, so the planemaker’s balance sheet won’t be
burdened.  Fuel Economy  American and other customers began voicing greater demand
in the past three months for more-efficient jets sooner than
later, McNerney said. That helped persuade Boeing to follow
Airbus by offering new engines on its 737 rather than its
previous preference to wait and develop an all-new plane around
the end of this decade.  Monthly production of the current and revised 737 will
likely reach 50 to 60 planes by the decade’s end, beyond the
current goal of 42 jets by 2014, McNerney said. That will
require a “significant”  capital investment , he said.  McNerney said the tweaked 737 might be assembled at the
current plant in Renton,  Washington , or another location,
including the complex being built in  South Carolina  for the 787.  Boeing will keep investing in South Carolina, McNerney
said, because it expects to win a National Labor Relations Board
complaint that the facility there was opened in illegal
retaliation against striking unions in the Seattle area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
