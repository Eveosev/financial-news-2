Puma SE,  Europe ’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, plans to raise prices by as much as 10
percent starting in the fourth quarter as increasing supply
costs weigh on profit, Chief Executive Officer Franz Koch said.  The gross margin will probably be “on a par or around the
level of last year,” even as cotton and rubber price growth and
rising wages, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, will
hamper profitability in the second half, Koch said today on a
conference call. The CEO reiterated a goal of increasing net
income by a percentage in the “mid-single digits” in 2011.  Full-year revenue is likely to meet a 3 billion-euro ($4.34
billion) target after second-quarter consolidated sales
increased 14 percent to 674 million euros and net income rose 11
percent to 37.6 million euros, Herzogenaurach, Germany-based
Puma said today. Profit exceeded the 37.4 million-euro average
of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Puma rose as much as 3.50 euros, or 1.6 percent, to 222.40
euros and was up 0.9 percent as of 12:56 p.m. in Frankfurt
trading. The maker of Future Cat Ferrari-branded sneakers, which
is controlled by  France ’s  PPR (PP)  SA, has fallen 11 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
