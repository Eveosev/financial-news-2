Ethanol futures were unchanged near
a five-year high amid increased demand for the biofuel.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery settled for a second
day at $3.068 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
highest settlement since July 13, 2006. Futures are up 29
percent this year.  An Energy Department report showed production of
conventional gasoline blended with ethanol gained 1 percent to
5.19 million barrels a day last week, the highest level since
July 1. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline is the lowest since Feb.
21.  “You just have people that are short ethanol,” said
Garret Toay, a grain analyst at Toay Commodity Futures Group in
Clive,  Iowa . “We’ve got prices at the highest in five years.
The blend spread isn’t that good, so you’ve just got people that
are short.”  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York  at
$3.10 a gallon, in Chicago at $3.135, in the U.S. Gulf at $3.165
and on the West Coast at $3.16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for each gallon of
ethanol mixed into gasoline in addition to being able to capture
the spread between the two fuels. That spread was as much as
86.7 cents on April 28.  Gasoline for August delivery sank 1.13 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.1423 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
