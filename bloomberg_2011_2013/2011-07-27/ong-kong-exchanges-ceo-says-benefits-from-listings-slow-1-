Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd.’s marginal benefits from listings have slowed and the
bourse must introduce reforms to strengthen its competitiveness,
Chief Executive Officer Charles Li said.  The exchange can increase global competitiveness by
narrowing bid-ask spreads and reinstating a closing auction
session, Li said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. It should
also consider anonymous trading in “dark pools,” Li said.  The former editor of the government-run China Daily
newspaper said he wants to address skepticism from securities
industry professionals about the necessity of recent measures,
such as after-hours futures trading and the creation of a
 reserve fund  to protect counterparties against default. Hong
Kong must address weaknesses in its market or capital from
mainland  China  will flow to other markets, Li said.  The bourse can achieve greater integration with mainland
Chinese through the adoption of remote trading rules, after-
hours futures trading and aligning trading hours with the
Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, Li said in the statement.  Initial public offerings in Hong Kong have totaled $14.2
billion this year, compared with $17.3 billion for the same
period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hong Kong Exchanges shares rose 0.2 percent in Hong Kong
trading today to close at HK$161.80. The benchmark Hang Seng
Index declined 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
