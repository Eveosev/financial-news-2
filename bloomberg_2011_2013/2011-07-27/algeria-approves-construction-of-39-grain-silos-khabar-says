The Algerian government approved the
construction of 39 grain silos with a storage capacity of more
than 15 million quintals (1.5 million metric tons),  El Khabar 
reported, citing the head of the stateâ€™s grains office.  Algeria is expected to stop importing grains in about 10
years as it expands cultivation of crops by upgrading
irrigation, the Algiers-based newspaper cited Noureddine Kehal,
the director general of the Office Algerien Interprofessionnel
des Cereales, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
