Hedge-fund defaults pose a limited
risk to the stability of the financial system because banks have
reduced their potential losses, the U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  said in a report today.  Hedge funds ’ “footprint remains modest within most
markets” when measured against the size of their holdings, the
FSA said in the  report . The average potential loss for a bank in
the survey in the event of a hedge fund default is less than $50
million, the survey found.  “Counterparties have increased margining requirements and
tightened other conditions on their exposures to hedge funds
since the financial crisis, increasing their resilience to hedge
fund defaults,” the report said.  Hedge funds and private-equity firms have come under
scrutiny from lawmakers who said they were partly to blame for
the financial crisis. The EU approved measures last year to
require hedge fund managers to restrict bonuses and increase
disclosure to regulators.  About 75 percent of hedge funds reported positive returns
for the period from April to September of last year, the FSA
said in a separate  survey  published on its website in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
