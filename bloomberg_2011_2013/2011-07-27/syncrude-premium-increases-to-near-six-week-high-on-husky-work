The premium for Syncrude increased
to the largest in almost six weeks after  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  said
it will run its Lloydminster oil-sands upgrader in Saskatchewan
at reduced rates during maintenance in September and October.  The upgrader, which converts heavy oil to low-sulfur,
synthetic oil, will operate at 70 percent to 80 percent capacity
during the 44-day turnaround, Carla Yuill, a spokeswoman for the
Calgary-based company, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The premium for Syncrude versus benchmark West Texas
Intermediate increased 45 cents to $13.25 a barrel, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg at 2:13 p.m. in New York. That’s the
widest premium to WTI for the grade since May 18. Syncrude is a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
 Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1.05 to
$18.45 a barrel.  Crude oil premiums in the U.S. Gulf strengthened as the
spread between WTI and its European counterpart, Brent, widened.
The gap widened $1.16 to $19.85 a barrel at 2:19 p.m. in  New
York . The spread settled at a record high of $22.63 a barrel
July 14.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it boosts the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added $2.05 to $21.55 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $2 a barrel to
$22 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend increased $1.60 a barrel to $17.05 while Poseidon added
$1.60 to $16.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced $1 to $14.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed by 25 cents to 70
cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium added $2 to
$21.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
