The total capacity of solar  power
plants  in  Slovakia  rose to 478 megawatts by end-June as the
government’s plan to reduce subsidies prompted investors to
speed up construction, the utility regulator said.  As many as 514 companies have this year asked the
regulator for permission to operate solar generators, compared
with 299 by the end of the last year, Jozef Holjencik, the
chairman of the Office for Network Industries, said today at a
press conference in Bratislava. He didn’t specify the
installed solar capacity as of last year.  Slovakia has passed legislation that from July 1 limits
subsidies for new solar generators with capacity exceeding 100
kilowatts, seeking to tame the impact of more expensive green
energy on electricity prices for households. The state support
was meant to help the country attain the European Union’s goal
to boost the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
