Geoff Lewis , Hong Kong-based head of
investment services at JP Morgan Asset Management, comments on
China’s effort to become a more consumption-driven economy and
the potential of shale gas.  He made the comments today to reporters in Singapore:  “China we believe has made some reasonable progress toward
shifting its economy away from dependence on investment. In the
first half of 2011, consumption accounted for 48 percent of GDP
growth. That is up from 37 percent in the calendar of 2010.  “China knows it is in its own best interest to move away
from export dependence at a relatively rapid rate.  “They are doing more to remove their share of global
imbalances than you might say the U.S. administration with all
their checks and balances are achieving on the other side of the
Pacific.  “We think that it would be wrong to bet against Beijing at
this point.”  On shale gas as an alternative energy:  “Longer term, I think shale gas is going to offer an
alternative to oil for auto transport and heating purposes.
There is as much shale gas in  Europe  and there’s a ton of it in
 Poland  and it is a big changer.  “It is going to reduce OPEC’s monopoly strength. It’s
going to reduce  Russia ’s bargaining power and it’s going to be a
lesson to smaller economies like  Morocco , where you shouldn’t
put all your eggs into one basket as it depends 98 percent of
its exports on liquefied natural gas in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
