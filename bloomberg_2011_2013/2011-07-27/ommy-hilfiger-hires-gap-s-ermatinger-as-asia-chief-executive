Tommy Hilfiger Group hired former
 Gap Inc. (GPS)  executive John Ermatinger to be its first chief
executive officer for Asia.  The appointment of Ermatinger, who was Gap’s president for
the Asia-Pacific region, takes effect Aug. 1, Tommy Hilfiger
said in a statement.  “We consider Asia very much the focus market for the
future,” Tommy Hilfiger Chief Executive Officer Fred Gehring
said in a phone interview today. “An increased effort led by a
seasoned executive such as John will further enhance our
presence,” Gehring said in the statement.  Tommy Hilfiger, acquired by  Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. (PVH)  last
year, makes about $500 million of sales from Asia, or 10 percent
of its global revenue, with the U.S. remaining its biggest
market, according to Gehring. It has more than 400 stores in
Asia, excluding  Australia , with 122 in Japan and 80 franchises
in China, he said.  “The Tommy Hilfiger core brand DNA makes it very
attractive to the youthful Asian market,” Ermatinger, who
helped establish the Gap brand in China, said in the statement.
“There is great opportunity for significant growth.”  He worked for at Levi Strauss & Co. from 1973 to 1998
before moving to Nike Inc., according to the statement. He
joined Gap in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
