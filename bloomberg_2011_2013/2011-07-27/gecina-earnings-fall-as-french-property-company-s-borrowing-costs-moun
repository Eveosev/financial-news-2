Gecina SA (GFC) , France’s second-largest
publicly traded property company, said profit fell 7.8 percent
in the first half because of higher borrowing costs.  Pretax earnings excluding changes in asset values and other
items, known as recurrent income, declined to 162.8 million
euros ($236 million), or 2.67 euros a share, from 176.5 million
euros, or 2.90 euros, a year earlier, Paris-based Gecina said in
a statement today.  Recurrent income will drop 7 percent his year due to rising
interest payments, the company reiterated today. Chief Executive

euro disposal program as he focuses Gecina on offices, apartment
buildings and properties related to health care in  France .  Gecina was little changed at 94 euros at 9:02 a.m. in Paris
trading, giving it a market value of 5.89 billion euros. The

behind the average 13 percent gain for an index of French real
estate investment trusts compiled by Amsterdam-based Global
Property Research.  Gecina’s average cost of borrowing rose by 87 basis points
to 4.16 percent, lifting its financial expenses by 36 percent to
95.1 million euros. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Net rental income rose 4.4 percent to 294.6 million euros.
Excluding a one-time lease surrender payment, acquisitions and
disposals, rental income was little changed, the company said.

six months earlier.  Property Disposals  Gecina sold 559 million euros of property during the first
half, trimming net rental income by 14.4 million euros. Since

by 2.6 percent to 11.8 billion euros. Net asset value rose to

to profit, boosting net income to 402.9 million euros. The
