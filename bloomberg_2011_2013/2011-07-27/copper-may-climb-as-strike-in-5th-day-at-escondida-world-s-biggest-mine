Copper may extend its biggest rally
in almost three weeks on speculation a strike at  Chile ’s
Escondida mine may reduce global supplies and as the dollar fell
amid a political stalemate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling.  The metal for three-month delivery added as much as 0.4
percent to $9,859.75 a metric ton, the highest price since July
19 on the London Metal Exchange before trading at $9,8542.25 by
3:25 p.m. Tokyo time. The price rose 1.7 percent yesterday, the
biggest daily gain since July 7. October-delivery copper on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange closed unchanged at 72,810 yuan
($11,302) a ton.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  is refusing to negotiate with workers at
its Escondida unit as a strike at the biggest  copper mine 
continues. The union’s rejection of a 2.8 million-peso ($6,100)
discretionary bonus offer and ensuing “illegal” strike is a
“disappointment” and is costing Chile “a lot of money,”
Peter Beaven, head of BHP’s base metals division, said yesterday.  “Copper prices will continue to get support from the
weaker dollar and the strike in Chile,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . “The
copper market saw light selling in early morning trade against
yesterday’s gain.”  Copper stockpiles on the LME-registered warehouses fell 0.5
percent to 469,100 tons yesterday, declining for a third day
after reaching 474,050 tons on July 21, the highest level since
June 22.  ‘Tight Market’  “Extended labor strike action at Chile’s largest copper
mine (Escondida) reconfirmed a tight copper market view,”
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. analysts including
 Mark Pervan  wrote in a note today.  HSBC Holdings Plc raised its 2012 copper price forecast by
13 percent to $3.86 a pound. The bank also increased its
estimate for copper deficit in 2011 to 143,000 tons from 70,000
tons, analysts led by  Andrew Keen  said in a report e-mailed on
July 21. World demand is set to exceed output by 377,000 tons
this year, according to the International Copper Study Group.  The Dollar Index was little changed against six major
currencies after touching the lowest level since May 5 as U.S.
politicians remain deadlocked after a House vote on Speaker  John Boehner ’s two-step plan to raise the debt ceiling and pare the
deficit was postponed from today. The Obama administration
threatened a presidential veto.  Aluminum rose 0.9 percent to $2,672.75 a ton, gaining for a
fifth day, after touching $2,674 earlier, the highest price
since June 9.  Zinc was little changed at $2,532 a ton after reaching
$2,536 earlier, the highest price since April 11. Nickel
advanced 0.6 percent to $24,249 and lead climbed 0.8 percent to
$2,740.75 a ton. Tin added 0.2 percent to $28,650 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
