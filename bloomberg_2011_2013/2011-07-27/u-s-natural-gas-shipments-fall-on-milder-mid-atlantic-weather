Natural gas shipments to U.S.  power
plants  dropped for a second day on forecasts of moderating
temperatures in the mid-Atlantic that may reduce air
conditioning use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power generators in the
U.S. and Canada was down 2.5 percent to 20.8 million dekatherms
(20.3 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Schedules for 704 of 742 pipelines had been reported
as of 9:31 a.m.  Power plants in a region that includes the mid-Atlantic and
Great Lakes were to receive 2.45 million dekatherms of gas, 12
percent less than yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences declined 5 percent
to 23.6 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  West Virginia , Virginia and  New
York  slid 2.45 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.5682 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 2.32 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.4258 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
