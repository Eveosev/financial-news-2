Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s biggest lender by market value, expects its card
processing division to increase threefold over the next two
years, Angelo Letimier, managing director of the unit, said.  “We are targeting to offer services to about 25 banks in
two years time, from eight right now,” Letimier said in an
interview today in Port Louis, the capital. The average monthly
transactions will probably climb to one million a month from
300,000, he said.  MCB holds an 80 percent stake in International Card
Processing Services Ltd., with the remainder owned by Hightech
Payment Systems SA of Morocco, according to MCB. It offers card
processing, ATM and point of sales management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
