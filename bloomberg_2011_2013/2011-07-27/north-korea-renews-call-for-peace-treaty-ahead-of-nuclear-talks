North Korea  renewed its call for a
peace treaty with South Korea to replace a 1953 cease-fire
agreement ahead of talks in  New York  this week on steps to
revive multinational negotiations on its nuclear program.  “Concluding a peace agreement may be the first step for
settling the Korean issue including the denuclearization,” the
state-run Korean Central News Agency said in an official
commentary today. “Being a curtain-raiser to confidence-
building, the conclusion of a peace agreement will provide an
institutional guarantee for wiping out the bilateral distrust.”  The U.S. invited North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister
Kim Kye Gwan to New York this week for what Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton said would be “an exploratory meeting” to
determine if the North is willing to make genuine efforts toward
scrapping its atomic weapons program.  North Korea and  South Korea  on July 22 agreed to try to
revive the six-party forum on the North’s nuclear-weapons
program, with the first formal discussions in months signaling a
thaw in relations between the two foes after more than a year of
rising tension. The U.S.,  China , Russia and Japan are also
participants in the group.  North and South Korea remain technically at war after their
1950-1953 conflict, in which the U.S. and China fought on
opposite sides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
