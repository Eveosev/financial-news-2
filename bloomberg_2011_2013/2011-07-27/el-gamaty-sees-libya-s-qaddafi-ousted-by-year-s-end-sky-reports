Libya ’s Transitional National
Council’s U.K. representative Guma El-Gamaty is “absolutely
confident” that Muammar Qaddafi will be “squeezed out with his
sons and the downfall of his regime will be brought about,” he
said to Sky News in an interview today.  The Libyan leader will “definitely” be ousted “within
this year and hopefully before the end of the summer,” El-
Gamaty said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
