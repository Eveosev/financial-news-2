Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency, the country’s so-called bad bank, will publish today a
list of about 850 properties it has seized through the
appointment of receivers and now has available for sale, a
spokesman for the agency said.  “We will publish on our website details of the various
properties for sale through the receivership process,” said Ray
Gordon, the NAMA spokesman, by telephone. “We expect about 850
properties will be identified,” he said. Receivership is when a
lender seizes assets to recover amounts due.  NAMA was established by the Irish state in 2009 to take
over most of the country’s lenders’ risky commercial real-estate
loans. It has acquired 72.3 billion euros of loans ($104
billion) at an average discount of 58 percent of face value from
five banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
