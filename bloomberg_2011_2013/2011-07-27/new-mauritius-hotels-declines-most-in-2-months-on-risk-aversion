New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s largest leisure operator by market value, declined the
most in two months as a U.S. debt deadlock curbed appetite for
riskier markets.  The stock retreated 1 percent, the biggest drop since May
23, to 99 rupees by the 1:30 close in Port Louis, the capital.  Mauritian stocks fell to the lowest in more than three
months and the rupee snapped three days of increases against the
dollar as the administration of U.S. President  Barack Obama 
threatened a presidential veto of House Speaker  John Boehner ’s
two-step plan to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and cut
$3 trillion in expenditure.  “NMH is following the generalized downward trend of the
markets,” Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at the Port Louis-
based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone. “The hotel group
is suffering during the low season as most of its revenue is
local, in contrast to its peers who are suffering locally but
whose income is boosted by other Indian Ocean island operations,
mainly Maldives.”  Tourism, with textiles, is the largest foreign currency
revenue earner, in the country, with Europe accounting for
almost two-third of visitors. Low season runs from April to
September.  Tourist arrivals in Mauritius fell 4 percent in May from a
year earlier, as the number of visitors from the country’s main
European markets declined, the Tourism Promotion Authority said
on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
