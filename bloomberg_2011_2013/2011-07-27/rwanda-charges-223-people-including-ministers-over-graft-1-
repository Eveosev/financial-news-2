Rwanda  is prosecuting 223 people,
including unidentified government ministers, for stealing public
funds totaling about $5 million, Inspector-General of the
Prosecution Jules Marius Ntete said.  The allegations are the result of a yearlong investigation
and those being charged include directors of national
institutions, university heads and national researchers, Ntete
told reporters today in Kigali, the capital. The government
issued 22.8 million Rwandan francs ($38,027) worth of fines, and
recovered 17.9 million francs from officials who voluntarily
returned funds.  “Some were finalized, others are in the process of being
scheduled for trial,” Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga said at
the media briefing. “Some of the cases were finished within the
prosecution system without having to file them in court.”  Rwanda’s low corruption, added to its political stability
and shift to a service economy, is helping the country succeed
in its goal of becoming a “Singapore of  Africa ,” Renaissance
Capital said in a report in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
