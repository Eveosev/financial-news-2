The  New York Giants  extended the
contract of coach  Tom Coughlin , who led the National Football
League team to a Super Bowl title, through the 2012 season.  Coughlin has a 65-47 record since joining  New York  in 2004,
with a 4-3 postseason record, including the NFL championship
game after the 2007 season. His 65 wins are the third-highest
regular-season total among Giants head coaches, behind Hall of
Fame member Steve Owen’s 153 and Bill Parcells’s 77.  Financial terms of the extension weren’t disclosed in a
news release sent by the team.  “As I was when I was hired in 2004, I am grateful for the
opportunity,” Coughlin said, calling the chance to coach the
Giants “the fulfillment of a dream.”  The Giants concluded the 2010 season 10-6, continuing a
six-year streak without a losing record. The club has won at
least 10 games in four of Coughlin’s seven seasons.  “We strongly believe in Tom,” Giants owner John Mara said
in the release. “We believe in the job he’s done and we believe
in his ability to lead our team in the future.”  Coughlin led the Giants to four playoff wins after the 2007
season, including a 17-14 victory over the previously undefeated
 New England Patriots  in the Super Bowl.  Before joining New York, Coughlin spent eight years with
the  Jacksonville Jaguars . He’s won four division titles and led
his teams to the playoffs in eight of 15 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
