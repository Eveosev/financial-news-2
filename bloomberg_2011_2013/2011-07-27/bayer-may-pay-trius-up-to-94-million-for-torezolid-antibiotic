Bayer AG (BAYN)  agreed to pay  Trius
Therapeutics Inc. (TSRX)  $25 million upfront for collaboration rights
to the U.S. biotechnology company’s skin-infection antibiotic
torezolid outside the U.S., Canada and Europe.  Bayer will contribute to global development costs for the
experimental drug and may pay Trius as much as $69 million if
the medicine meets certain development, regulatory and
commercial goals, the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said in
a statement today. Trius of  San Diego , California, will also get
double-digit royalties on net sales, Bayer said.  Torezolid is in the final phase of clinical development
before U.S. and European Union regulatory approval and is
expected to compete with Pfizer Inc.’s Zyvox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
