Torrential rain across  South Korea 
caused flooding and landslides that killed at least 32 people,
including 16 in Seoul after a record downpour in the capital.  A mudslide struck a residential area in the cityâ€™s south
today, killing 16 people, Kim Jong Sun, an official at the
Disaster & Safety Management Office, said by phone today.
Another landslide hit at a resort village near Chuncheon, about
75 kilometers (50 miles) east of the capital, killing 13 people,
and three died in Gwangju, Gyeonggi province, he said.  Seoul was inundated by 443.5 millimeters (17.5 inches) of
rain in the 40 hours from midnight July 26, the most on record
over a two-day period, according to the Korea Meteorological
Administration.  South Korea has received at least 60 percent more rain this
month than in the same period in July last year, according to
the weather bureau.  There were no cancellations or delays at Incheon
International Airport and only minor disruptions to trains in
the  Seoul  metropolitan area, according to officials from the
