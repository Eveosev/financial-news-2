CC Sabathia retired the first 19
batters he faced and finished with a career-high 14 strikeouts
in seven innings as the  New York Yankees  won 4-1 to give the
 Seattle Mariners  their 17th straight defeat.  Sabathia earned his Major League Baseball-leading 15th win
while allowing one run and one hit in a game that included rain
delays of 30 and 14 minutes.  After the second interruption last night at Yankee Stadium,
Sabathia walked three Mariners and was relieved by Dave Robertson, who struck out two.  Mariano Rivera  pitched one
perfect inning, striking out two more, to get his 26th save.  The 18 strikeouts by  New York  pitchers tied a franchise
record for most strikeouts in a nine-inning game, set by Ron
Guidry against California on June 17, 1978.  “We did have a few pitches to hit tonight that we missed.
That’s been kind of the story of our season offensively,”
Mariners manager Eric Wedge told reporters. “When you’re facing
good pitching like that you may get one good pitch per at-bat,
you just can’t miss ’em.”  The Mariners are four defeats shy of tying the  Baltimore
Orioles ’ AL-record 21-game losing streak from the 1988 season.  Curtis Granderson hit his 28th home run of the season in
the fourth inning to give the Yankees (61-40) a 1-0 lead.  Eric Chavez  had a run-scoring single in the fifth and Jorge Posada
scored on Derek Jeter’s groundout as New York took a 3-0
advantage.  Mariners shortstop Brendan Ryan ruined Sabathia’s bid for a
perfect game in the seventh with a single to left with one out.  Mark Teixeira  added his 28th home run of the season in the
eighth for New York after Chone Figgins had grounded into a
fielder’s choice to score Justin Smoak for Seattle’s only run  Doug Fister (3-12) allowed three runs on seven hits in
seven innings for the Mariners, who fell to 43-60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
