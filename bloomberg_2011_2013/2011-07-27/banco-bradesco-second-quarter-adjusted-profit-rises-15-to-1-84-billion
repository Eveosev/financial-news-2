Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil’s third-
biggest bank by assets, increased provisions for soured loans in
the second quarter as the default rate rose amid a surge in
lending that exceeded the national average.  Bradesco raised credit-loss provisions by 3.3 percent to
2.44 billion reais ($1.6 billion) compared with the previous
quarter, the company said today in a statement. Total provisions
for bad loans increased 3.7 percent to 17.37 billion reais in
the second quarter, compared with 16.74 billion reais at the end
of March, Bradesco said. The Osasco-based company posted a 15
percent increase in profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The bank’s loan portfolio expanded by 23 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier to 319.8 billion reais and
total assets increased 24 percent to 689.3 billion reais,
according to the bank. Loans to large companies led credit
growth with a 28 percent increase, while loans to individuals
advanced 14.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  The strength of the corporate segment is an improvement in
Bradesco’s credit portfolio, as default rates tend to be lower
than in the personal credit segment, Fernando Salazar, a Sao
Paulo-based analyst at Fator Corretora wrote in a report today.  The average default rate, a measure of payments at least 90
days overdue, rose to 3.7 percent at the end of June from 3.6
percent in the previous quarter.  Bradesco maintained its guidance of credit growth between
15 percent and 19 percent this year. Chief Executive Officer
Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi said he doesn’t foresee a credit
bubble in  Brazil . “We continue to have confidence in a scenario
of sustainable credit growth in Brazil,” he said on a
conference call with reporters today.  Default Rates  Default rates will remain stable this year as a strong
labor market will allow borrowers to pay debts, Investor
Relations Director Domingos Figueiredo de Abreu said on the
call.  Bradesco shares fell as much as 3.05 percent to 28.30 reais
and lost 1.2 percent to 28.83 reais at the close of trading at
4:17 p.m. New York time. The benchmark Bovespa index lost 1.8
percent.  Second-quarter adjusted net income, which excludes one-time
items, climbed 15 percent to 2.83 billion reais, or 2.82 reais a
share, from 2.46 billion reais, or 2.19 reais, in the same
period a year earlier, according to the statement. That beat the
2.79 billion-real average estimate of four analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Net income rose 15.8 percent to 2.79 billion
reais from 2.41 billion reais a year earlier.  Outstanding Credit  Total outstanding credit in Brazil expanded 20 percent in
June from a year earlier, led by a 50 percent increase in
mortgages, even as policy makers have taken steps to slow the
increase in lending. Credit expanded at its fastest monthly pace
in 2011, rising 1.6 percent in June to 1.834 trillion reais, the
central bank said today. The pace of expansion matched the rate
seen in May.  The average consumer default rate was unchanged at 6.4
percent. Company loan defaults were also unchanged at 3.8
percent. Defaults are likely to fall in the second half of the
year, due to wage growth and low unemployment, Tulio Maciel, the
central bank’s economic department chief, told reporters in
Brasilia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
