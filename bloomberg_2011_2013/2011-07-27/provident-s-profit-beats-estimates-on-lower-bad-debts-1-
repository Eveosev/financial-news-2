Provident Financial Plc (PFG) , the U.K.’s
biggest publicly traded subprime lender, said first-half profit
rose 18 percent as bad loans dropped.  Net income rose to 45.8 million pounds ($75 million) in the
six months to June 30, compared with 38.9 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the Bradford, England-based company said
today in a statement. That beat the 42.8 million-pound estimate
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Credit quality in both businesses is very sound as
evidenced by the favorable impairment trends in the first
half,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Crook said in the
statement. “This provides the foundation for delivering good
quality growth for 2011 as a whole.”  Investors including  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and Ivaldi Capital LLP
have disclosed short positions in Provident’s stock in the last
two months, betting that a sluggish U.K. economy and reductions
in welfare payments will cause an increase in arrears. While
Provident is the most short-sold stock in the FTSE 250, with 16
percent of shares on loan according to  Data Explorers , it has
risen 18 percent since the beginning of the year.  Impairments dropped 7 percent to 169 million pounds in the
six-month period, Provident said. The company raised its first-
half dividend 5.1 percent to 26.7 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
