The British government wastes an
“obscene” amount of money on information-technology projects
because of cartel-like behavior by suppliers and a lack of in-
house knowledge, a cross-party panel of lawmakers said.  Procurement of the services was “too often” late, over
budget and not fit for purpose, Parliament’s Public Accounts
Committee said in a report published in  London  today. It said
the government should use a wider range of smaller suppliers and
urged departments to publish more information on the projects
and their cost.  “The government pays between seven and 10 times more than
the standard commercial rate for its work,” Bernard Jenkins, a
lawmaker from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party,
said in a statement. It is “an inexcusable situation that sees
governments waste an obscene amount of public money.”  The government spent about 16 billion pounds ($26 billion)
on information-technology projects in 2009 and is “doomed” to
repeat mistakes made over the last decade unless it changes the
way it operates, the lawmakers said.  Capita Group Plc (CPI) ,  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) , Capgemini Plc and Hewlett-
Packard Co. were among companies named in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
