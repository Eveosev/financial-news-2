The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 10 basis points to 270 at 4 p.m. in London. An
increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Swaps on  Greece  rose 40 basis points to 1,690, according to
CMA. Contracts on  Italy  climbed 16 basis points to 291, Portugal
increased 12 to 952 and  Spain  was up 14 at 337, while Belgium
was 7 higher at 185. Ireland dropped 40 basis points to 841.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 11 basis points to
436, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis point to 116 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 6 basis points to 172.5 and
the subordinated index climbed 14 to 306.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
