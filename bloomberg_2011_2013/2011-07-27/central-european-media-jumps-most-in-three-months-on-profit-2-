Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  increased the most in a year after the broadcaster part-
owned by  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  reported second-quarter earnings and
full-year outlook that exceeded analyst estimates.  CME, as the company is known, advanced 5.5 percent to 325.5
koruna by its 4:24 p.m. close in Prague. It earlier rose as much
as 8.9 percent, the most since July 2010 on an intraday basis.
The company’s U.S. shares rose 7.4 percent to $19.35 as of 10:35
a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Net income from continuing operations was $812,000 in April
to June, compared with a loss of $52.9 million a year earlier,
CME said today. Revenue rose 24 percent to $249.7 million, more
than the $232 million median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Operating income before depreciation and amortization
rose 36 percent to $62.7 million, according to the statement.  “CME published relatively good results overall that were
significantly above the market consensus on the operating
level,” Vaclav Kminek, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS, wrote
in a report to clients. Currency gains in the company’s markets
boosted the earnings in dollar terms, according to Kminek.  The Bermuda-registered operator of channels in the Czech
Republic,  Romania ,  Croatia , Slovakia, Slovenia and  Bulgaria  has
been battling a slower-than-expected pickup in advertising as
the countries recover from recession. The Czech koruna gained 25
percent versus the dollar in the 12 months ended June 30, while
Romania’s leu strengthened 22 percent in the period.  ‘Growth Trend’  CME extended gains after saying in a conference call with
analysts it sees full-year revenue of $831 million and operating
income before depreciation and amortization of $168 million.
Cyrrus brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, had expected a revenue
guidance of around $815 million and Oibda of $145 million,
according to a report to clients earlier today.  More than 284,000 CME shares changed hands today in Prague,
almost four times the daily average in the past three months.
The stock was the best performer in the  Czech Republic ’s 14-
member PX gauge, which retreated 0.5 percent.  Improving results were helped by “fast growth” at Media
Pro and New Media units, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu
said in the statement. CME sees a “growth trend” in all of its
advertising markets in the second half of the year, Sarbu said.  The earnings “show that the company’s activities in the
second quarter were more successful than the advertising market
as a whole,” Tomas Tomcany, an analyst at Patria Finance, wrote
on the Prague-based brokerage’s website.  Time Warner bought 31 percent of CME for $241.5 million in
May 2009, and increased its stake to 34.4 percent on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
