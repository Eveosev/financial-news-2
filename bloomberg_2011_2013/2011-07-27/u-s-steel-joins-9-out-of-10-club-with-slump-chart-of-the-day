Few companies in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index have given shareholders a reason to dread
earnings releases as consistently as U.S. Steel Corp., the
country’s largest producer of the metal.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, U.S. Steel’s shares
slumped after nine of the last 10 quarterly reports. The losses
included a 8.3 percent drop yesterday, when the Pittsburgh-based
company posted second-quarter sales and earnings that were lower
than the average analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Only seven other S&P 500 stocks declined as often in the
first trading day after an earnings release, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hudson City Bancorp Inc. (HCBK) , with 10
consecutive quarters of losses, was among them.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
 Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) ,  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD)  and  Sears Holdings
Corp. (SHLD)  were in the nine-out-of-10 club. So was  Ecolab Inc. (ECL) , based
on the track record preceding its second-quarter report today.  U.S. Steel’s median decline after the quarterly earnings
releases was 5.7 percent, the group’s biggest. Sears was second
with a 3.8 percent drop.  S&P 500 stocks that rose after nine of the last 10 earnings
reports were more difficult to find.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) 
and  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  were the only ones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
