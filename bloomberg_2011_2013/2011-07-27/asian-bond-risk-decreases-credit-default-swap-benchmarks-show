The cost of protecting Asian
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell half a basis point to 115.5 basis
points as of 8:05 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit
Agricole CIB prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 0.5 basis point to
116.5 as of 10:05 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 120 basis
points as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
