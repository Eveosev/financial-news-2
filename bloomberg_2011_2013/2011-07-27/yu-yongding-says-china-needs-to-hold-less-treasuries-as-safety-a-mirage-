Former Chinese central bank adviser
Yu Yongding repeated his call for  China  to reduce its Treasury
holdings amid an impasse among policy makers on raising the U.S.
government’s debt limit.  “U.S. bonds are not safe, but people think they are
safe,” Yu, a researcher at a Beijing institute under the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , told reporters at a briefing
in Mumbai, India, today. “That is a mirage.”  President  Barack Obama ’s administration and Democrats and
Republicans in Congress are locked in a standoff over what kind
of deficit-cutting measures to tie to an increase in the
nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The Treasury Department
has said the U.S. exhausts its borrowing authority on Aug. 2 and
risks going into default.  Yu spoke to reporters before giving a lecture at an event
organized by Export-Import Bank of  India .  Xia Bin, a current adviser to the Chinese central bank,
said July 25 that he’s confident that U.S. political leaders
will reach an agreement before the deadline.  A U.S. default would be “disastrous,” Yu said today.  In March, Yu said that China, the biggest foreign holder of
Treasuries with $1.16 trillion of the securities, should halt
purchases because of the risk of an eventual default. In June,
he predicted that credit agencies would limit the severity of
any downgrade of the U.S. rating to avoid investor panic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
