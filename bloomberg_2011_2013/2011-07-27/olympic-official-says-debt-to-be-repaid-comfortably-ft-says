The U.K.’s Olympic Park Legacy
committee chairman, Margaret Ford, said the development of the
park after the 2012 London games will “comfortably” pay back
public money used to develop it, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  The committee will repay the lottery, “which is 675
million pounds,” ($1.1 billion) and, over a 20-year period,
“should comfortably pay back the 600 million-pound debt the
Treasury took,” Ford said, according to the FT. “And I think
there will be significant upside beyond that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
