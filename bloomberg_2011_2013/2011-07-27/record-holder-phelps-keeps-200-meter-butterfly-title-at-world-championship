Michael Phelps retained his 200-
meter butterfly title, winning his first gold medal at this
year’s world swimming championships in  Shanghai .  Phelps led from the start before  Japan ’s Takeshi Matsuda
briefly went in front at the final turn. The American then
overtook Matsuda to win in a time of 1 minute, 53.34 seconds.  “The race felt good,” Phelps said after winning his third
straight world title in the event and his fifth overall. “I
wanted to do what I usually do when I’m in better shape. I
wanted to step on it from the get go. I saw the other swimmers
at the 150 and I put my hips into it. I know there’s a lot more
I can do in that race.”  Matsuda took the silver medal in 1:54.01, with  China ’s Wu
Peng winning bronze in 1:54.67.  Phelps also qualified for tomorrow’s 200-meter individual
medley final by finishing second in the semifinal to teammate
Ryan Lochte. Phelps won the bronze medal as part of the U.S.’s
400-meter freestyle team three days ago and took silver behind
Lochte in yesterday’s 200-meter freestyle.  Other gold medalists today were Italy’s Federica Pellegrini
in the women’s 200-meter freestyle, China’s Sun Yang in the
men’s 800-meter freestyle and Felipe Franca da Silva of Brazil
in the men’s 50-meter breaststroke.  No world records were set during the first four days of the
eight-day championships, extending the long-course drought since
high-tech bodysuits were banned 1 1/2 years ago. Forty-three
records fell at the 2009 world championships in  Rome .  It’s the last major international swimming meet before the
2012  London  Olympics, which start a year from today. Phelps, a
14-time Olympic gold medalist, has said he’ll retire after those
Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
