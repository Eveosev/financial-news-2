Rock Ohio Caesars LLC, a casino
developer owned by Caesars Entertainment and Rock Gaming, is
seeking a $125 million term loan to back the development of two
gaming properties in Cleveland and Cincinnati, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  are arranging
the six-year debt with an interest rate of 6.5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor, a rate banks charge to lend each other, will have a 1.5
percent floor.  Rock Ohio is proposing to sell the loan at 98 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting yield for investors.  The Livonia, Michigan-based company will not be able to
refinance the loan during the first two years, then can do so at
102 cents in the third year and at 101 cents in the fourth year.  The financing package will also include a $125 million
delayed-draw  term loan  which will be held by the arranging
banks. The lenders will make half of the loan available for 12
months and the remaining portion available for the next 18
months.  Jennifer Kulcyzki, a spokeswoman for Rock Gaming, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
