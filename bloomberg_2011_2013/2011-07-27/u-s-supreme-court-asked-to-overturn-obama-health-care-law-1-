A Christian legal group asked the
U.S.  Supreme Court  to overturn President Barack Obama’s health-
care law, filing an appeal that would let the justices take up
the case later this year.  The Thomas More Law Center today said it had asked the
justices to review a 2-1 federal appeals court decision that
upheld the law last month. The group, based in  Ann Arbor ,
Michigan, contends Congress exceeded its constitutional power by
requiring Americans to either obtain insurance or pay a fine.  The petition is the first challenge to the law to reach the
Supreme Court under its normal procedures. In April, the
justices refused to consider the law on a fast-track basis,
rejecting Virginia’s bid to bypass the appeals court stage in
its suit.  Last month’s ruling by the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals was the first appeals court decision to
address the law’s constitutionality. Three other appeals courts
are still considering challenges, including one being pressed by
26 states.  The 2010 law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, is intended to create the first near-universal U.S. health-
care coverage program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
