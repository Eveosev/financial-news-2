The  U.S. Senate  extended FBI
Director Robert Mueller’s term for two years, granting the Obama
administration’s request to keep him in the post.  The Senate voted 100-0 to confirm Mueller. He took over a
week before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was due to
leave office in September with the expiration of his 10-year
term as head of the  Federal Bureau of Investigation . President
 Barack Obama  has said he needed Mueller to stay on because of
leadership changes at other national security agencies.  The extension “offers the necessary stability and
continuity” for the FBI, said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a
Texas Republican, in remarks preceding today’s vote.  Mueller has transformed the bureau, shifting its top
priority from crime-fighting to counterterrorism. The Obama
administration has been looking for his replacement amid
Republican criticism of its approach to interrogating and
prosecuting terrorism suspects.  Obama has been making changes in his national security team
as he prepares to run for a second term. Former Central
Intelligence Agency Director  Leon Panetta  took over the Pentagon
from Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The president chose General
David Petraeus to lead the CIA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
