European Union rice production is
forecast to climb 0.7 percent this year as higher temperatures
boosted plant growth in  Italy , the region’s largest grower of
the grain, the bloc’s crop-monitoring unit said.  The harvest may advance to 3.09 million metric tons from
3.07 million tons in 2010, the EU’s  Monitoring Agricultural
Resources  unit, or MARS, said in a  report  on its website today.  Italy and Spain are the largest EU rice growers, and most
of their production is consumed within the 27-nation bloc. The
EU will import 1.07 million tons of rice in the 2011-12 season,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates , less than the 1.15
million tons bought the previous season.  “A good potential is expected for the main rice districts
in Spain, Italy and  France , where meteorological conditions
boosted the biomass accumulation,” MARS said. “Reduction in
the total area was compensated by the good yield potential.”  Global rice output in 2011-12 is estimated at 456.3 million
tons, according to the USDA.  Italian rice production is estimated at 1.6 million tons
this year, up from 1.57 million tons in 2010, while farmers in
 Spain  probably will harvest 902,000 tons, below last year’s
926,000 tons, according to the monitoring unit.  In Italy, “the hot conditions at sowing boosted initial
growth, leading to an advance in development,” MARS said.
“This slowed down as a consequence of the heavy rains and the
colder-than-usual temperatures in June.”  Overall EU production is forecast to climb 11 percent from
the five-year average, MARS said. Rice yields are projected to
climb from the average in all EU producers except  Greece ,
according to the report.  The average EU rice yield probably will be 6.7 tons a
hectare (2.47 acres), up from 6.5 tons in 2010, MARS said. In
Italy, the yield may climb to 6.5 tons from 6.3 tons, according
to the EU unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
