Japanese food rice stockpiles are
forecast to decrease 6.6 percent, the  Ministry of Agriculture ,
Forestry and Fisheries said today.  Inventories of private domestic food rice will drop to 1.7
million metric tons on June 30 next year from 1.82 million tons
a year earlier, the ministry said in a report.  Japan , the
worldâ€™s largest corn importer, is self-sufficient in rice as the
government protects growers from foreign competition with a 778
percent tariff on imports.  The country agreed to give minimum market access to rice-
exporting countries at the  Uruguay Round  of world trade talks in
1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
