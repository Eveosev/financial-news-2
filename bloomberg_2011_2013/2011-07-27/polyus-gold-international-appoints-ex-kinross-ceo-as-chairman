Polyus Gold International Ltd., the
mining company formerly known as  KazakhGold Group Ltd. (KZG) ,
appointed  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ’s former Chief Executive Officer
Robert Buchan as chairman.  Buchan was CEO and chairman of Toronto-based Kinross from
1993 to 2005 and served on the board of OAO Polyus Gold from
June 2008 to May 2009, according to a statement late yesterday.
KazakhGold this week changed its name to Polyus Gold
International after acquiring its Russian parent Polyus Gold.  The combined company will seek to merge with a global rival
as early as this year to become one of the world’s top 3 gold
miners, billionaire co-owner  Mikhail Prokhorov  said in December.  Kinross produced 68 metric tons of gold last year, making
it the world’s seventh-largest producer by output, while Moscow-
based Polyus was 10th biggest, with 43.1 tons, according to data
from London-based researcher GFMS Ltd.  Polyus said yesterday that 2011 output will be 1.4 million
to 1.5 million ounces of gold, including production from
KazakhGold, according to a note from Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
