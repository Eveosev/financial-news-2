CSR Corp., whose shares have plunged
this week following a fatal train crash, announced orders to
supply railway stock in  China  and overseas worth about 6.89
billion yuan ($1.07 billion).  The contracts include the sale of 3.13 billion yuan of
rapid transit vehicles to Nanjing Metro Co., China’s biggest
trainmaker said in a statement to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange
today. The company is also selling 2.5 billion yuan of passenger
carriages to China Railway Construction Investment Co. and
CAMRAIL and agreed smaller orders in Australia and Iran, it said
after the Hong Kong stockmarket closed.  Shares of Beijing-based CSR have dropped 16 percent this
week in Hong Kong after the company confirmed it made one of the
trains involved in a fatal high-speed rail crash in China on
July 23, while the other was built by the company’s venture with
Bombardier Inc.  CSR closed 1.2 percent down at HK$5.83 today, while the
benchmark Hang Seng Index slid 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
