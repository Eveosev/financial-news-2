The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index tumbled 1.8 percent to 58,288.46.  Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11 BS), Brazilian unit of
 Spain ’s biggest bank, fell 6.4 percent to 14.80 reais as  Brazil 
imposed a tax on bets against the  U.S. dollar  and warned it may
boost intervention in the country’s derivatives market in a bid
to weaken its currency.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3 BS), the Brazilian consumer-goods
maker, dropped 6 percent to 11.30 reais, the lowest in more than
two years, as concern that quickening inflation led to declines
among companies that depend on consumer demand.  Gafisa SA (GFSA3 BS), Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, retreated 2.6 percent to 7.17 reais, and has plunged 51
percent since Nov. 4 as record-low unemployment drives up labor
costs. Brazil’s homebuilders and retailers have led declines on
the benchmark index as inflation reached the fastest pace since
2005 even after the central bank lifted  interest rates  eight
times in 15 months.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5 BS), Brazil’s
second-largest steelmaker, declined 0.2 percent to 11.03 reais
as commodities fell on concern that the U.S. may lose its top
 credit rating  if an agreement isn’t reached to raise the
country’s debt ceiling. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 raw materials slipped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
