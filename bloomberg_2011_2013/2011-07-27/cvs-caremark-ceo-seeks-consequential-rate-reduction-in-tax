The U.S. tax code inhibits
investment and makes U.S. companies less competitive, Larry Merlo, the president and chief executive officer of  CVS Caremark
Corp. (CVS)  will tell the Senate Finance Committee today, according to
his prepared testimony.  “Without a consequential rate reduction, tax
considerations will have to be an even more significant
component of our overall investment analysis,” he says in the
testimony.  Also testifying before the panel this morning will be the
chief executive officers of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  Kimberly-Clark
Corp. (KMB)  and PMC-Sierra Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
