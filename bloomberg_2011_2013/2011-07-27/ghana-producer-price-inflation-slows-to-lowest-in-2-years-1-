Producer-price inflation in  Ghana 
slowed to the lowest rate since March 2009 after the government
didn’t repeat an increase in utility costs made in June last
year.  The rate fell to 12.2 percent in June from a revised 23.2
percent a month earlier, said  Grace Bediako , head of the Ghana
Statistical Service. Prices rose 0.5 percent in the month.  Utility costs, which account for 16 percent of the overall
index, rose 0.3 percent in June from a 72 percent jump in May,
Bediako said. On June 1, 2010, the cost of water and electricity
for industries in Ghana was increased by the country’s regulator
by as much as 200 percent.  Mining and quarrying costs rose 30.2 percent, compared with
from 32.6 percent in May while manufacturing, which comprises 70
percent of the index, rose 11.8 percent in June from 12.1
percent a month earlier, Bediako said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
