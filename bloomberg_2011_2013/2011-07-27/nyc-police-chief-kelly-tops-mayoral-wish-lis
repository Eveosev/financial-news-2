New York City Police Commissioner
 Raymond Kelly  leads the field of potential mayoral candidates in
2013, even though he hasn’t expressed interest in the job,
according to a  Quinnipiac University  poll.  Voters were asked who they most wanted to see elected mayor
in 2013. Kelly got 23 percent support in the survey, the
school’s first of attitudes toward the race to succeed Mayor
 Michael Bloomberg . The poll showed City Council Speaker
 Christine Quinn , 45, running second with 18 percent, and first
at 23 percent with Kelly left out.  Kelly, 69, took command of the largest U.S. police
department in January 2002, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700.
Since he took over, the city’s crime rate has dropped about 35
percent, according to police statistics. Voters rated his job
performance positively, 67 percent to 17 percent. He scored a
71 percent job-approval rating in May.  “Kelly has never given the faintest hint that he’d like to
move from police headquarters across the street to  City Hall ,
but New York seems to like the idea,” said  Maurice Carroll ,
director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in
Hamden, Connecticut.  “The commissioner has repeatedly said he feels he already
has the best job for him and has no interest in running for
mayor,”  Paul Browne , a Kelly spokesman, said in an interview.  More Preferences  After Kelly and Quinn, voters said they preferred Brooklyn
Borough President Marty Markowitz, at 12 percent; Comptroller
 John Liu , 10 percent; 2009 mayoral candidate William Thompson, 8
percent; Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, 6 percent, and
Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, 4 percent.  Those polled approved of Bloomberg’s job performance, 45
percent to 43 percent who disapproved, compared with a May 11
survey when 40 percent rated him positively and 49 percent
negatively. City voters in the current survey said they admired
Bloomberg personally, 64 percent to 20 percent, and 49 percent
like his policies to 45 percent who said they didn’t.  Pollsters conducted 1,234 telephone interviews with city
voters from July 19-25, and the survey had a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.8 percentage points, the institute said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
