A German company that makes fire-
fighting and civil-protection vehicles, Iveco Magirus
Brandschutztechnik GmbH, was fined 17.5 million euros ($25.3
million) for price fixing on fire trucks with turntable ladders.  Rosenbauer International AG (ROS) ’s Metz Aerials GmbH & Co. KG
unit was also part of the cartel, the German cartel office said
in a statement today. Rosenbauer wasn’t fined because it
reported the violations in 2010. The cartel office conducted
raids in May 2010.  “Price-fixing isn’t alone in causing serious economic
harm,” Andreas Mundt, president of the German Bundeskartellamt,
said in the e-mailed statement. “Agreements between so-called
competitors can unhinge the system of public tenders.”  The fine can be appealed, the agency said, adding it was
based on a settlement with Iveco Magirus. The cartel colluded on
prices of trucks with revolving ladders from 1998 until November
2007. Iveco Magirus and Rosenbauer hold nearly all the market
for the vehicles, the cartel office said.  Iveco Magirus, based in Ulm,  Germany , said in a statement
the violation went back several years and happened under
different management. Iveco Magirus ended the infringing
behavior in 2007, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
