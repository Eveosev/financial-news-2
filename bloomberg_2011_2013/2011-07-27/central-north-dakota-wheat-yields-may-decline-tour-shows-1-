Wheat yields in central and north-
central  North Dakota  may be below last year, according to
preliminary estimates on the second day of the Wheat Quality
Council’s annual tour of the state.  Yields averaged 41.2 bushels per acre, based on random
samples taken today in 15 fields along three routes on the tour,
which is traveling in North Dakota from Mandan to Devils Lake.
Last year, yields on the second day were 44.6 bushels per acre.
The state is the biggest U.S. wheat producer.  Some fields may be as much as six weeks away from harvest,
Brian Walker, the technical service manager at Horizon Milling,
said in an interview. That might be one week to three weeks
behind normal, he said.  “What I see this year is pretty consistent with reports
that have been out there about late planting,” Walker said.
“We’ve seen some insect activity with aphids. We’ve seen a
little bit of scab here and there, but nothing severe, and we’ve
seen some of the leaf diseases.”  Much of North Dakota has had above-normal rainfall this
year. The tour finishes in Fargo tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
