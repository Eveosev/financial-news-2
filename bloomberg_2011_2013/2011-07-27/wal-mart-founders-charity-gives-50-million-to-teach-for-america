The Walton Family Foundation,
created by the founder of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , will donate
$50 million to Teach For America to almost double the size of
the organization’s teaching corps.  Half of the funds, which will be given over three years,
will increase the number of teachers to 15,000 by 2015,
according to a  statement  on the website of the Bentonville,
Arkansas, foundation. The rest of the grant will support the
training of existing Teach For America instructors in seven
communities.  Teach for America , which sends recent college graduates to
low-income schools, was founded in 1990 by Wendy Kopp, who
proposed the idea in her undergraduate thesis at  Princeton
University , in Princeton,  New Jersey . The nonprofit organization,
based in New York, had more than 8,200 teachers working in 39
cities, towns and regions in the 2010-2011 school year,
according to its website.  “With this critical investment, Teach For America will be
able to develop more of our talented recent college graduates
and professionals to become long-term champions of educational
equity and excellence,” Kopp said in the statement.  The Walton Family Foundation was started by Sam and Helen Walton in 1987. Prior to this gift, the foundation donated more
than $22 million to Teach For America since 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
