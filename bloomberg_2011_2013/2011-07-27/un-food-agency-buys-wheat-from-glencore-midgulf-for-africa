The  United Nations ’ World Food
Programme bought $38.2 million of wheat for delivery to the Horn
of Africa region, where malnutrition and famine have killed tens
of thousands of people.  The UN agency purchased $22.54 million of wheat from
Glencore Grain BV for delivery to  Ethiopia  and $15.64 million of
the grain from Midgulf Services Ltd. for shipping to the
Djibouti region, it said in a notice on its  website  this week.  The UN needs $1.6 billion in the next 12 months and $300
million in the next two months to provide aid in the region,
Jacques Diouf, director-general of the UN’s Food and Agriculture
Organization, said at a meeting in  Rome  this week.  The agency typically reports tender results with a delay
that can amount to several weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
