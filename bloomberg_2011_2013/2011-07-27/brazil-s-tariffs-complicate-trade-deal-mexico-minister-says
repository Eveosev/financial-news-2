Brazil ’s existing tariff barriers
complicate promised negotiations on a free-trade agreement with
 Mexico  and there is no date to start formal talks, Mexico’s
undersecretary of industry and commerce said.  “What is the most difficult part is to solve the known
tariff barriers that Brazil has,” Lorenza Martinez said in an
interview at the Mexican embassy yesterday in  Tokyo . “It is
more difficult to do business in Brazil than in Mexico. It has a
more complicated system to operate. That’s the part that makes
this agreement a little bit more difficult than others.”  Mexican President Felipe Calderon and former Brazilian
leader  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  vowed last year to start talks
on a potential free trade agreement. Brazil is  Latin America ’s
largest economy and Mexico, the second biggest, relies on the
U.S. to buy about 80 percent of its exports.  “There is an interest in both countries, but we don’t have
a date to start the negotiations yet,” Martinez said. “It
might be defined in the next month.”  In general, Brazil is more interested in pursuing the trade
deal to benefit its agricultural sector while Mexico hopes to
aid manufacturers, she said.  Separately, Mexico hasn’t changed a forecast for the country
to create 557,000 new private sector jobs this year as it
recovers from the global downturn in 2009, she said.  “The recovery has been faster than in previous cycles,”
she said, adding that manufacturing firms have led the rebound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
