Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, will invest almost $1 billion to build its
second plant in  India , in the state of Gujarat, said a person
briefed on the matter.  The plant will employ 5,000 people and begin making cars in
2014, said the person, who asked not to be identified before the
plans are announced. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
employs about 5,000 at its plant near  Chennai  in the southern
Indian state of Tamil Nadu.  Ford sold 95,395 passenger cars in India in the year ended
March 31, 2011, giving it a 4.8 percent market share, according
to data from the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers .
Earlier this month, the company introduced a new variant of its
Fiesta sedan, the first of eight new models the company intends
to introduce in the country by 2015.  The company in an e-mail declined to comment on plans in
Gujarat.  “Ford continues to pursue an aggressive growth strategy in
India to bring world class vehicles,” the company said in the
e-mailed reply to questions. “As part of its plan to introduce
eight new products by the middle of the decade Ford is
significantly expanding its capacities in its existing facility
in  Tamil Nadu  as well as exploring other options to meet the
growing demand of consumers in India and export markets across
the world.”  The  Press Trust of India  reported on the plans yesterday
citing senior government officials from the Gujarat state
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
