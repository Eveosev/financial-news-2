Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services,
the Arab countryâ€™s second-biggest mobile network operator, fell
to the lowest level in almost three years after posting a
second-quarter loss and missing analyst estimates.  The shares of the company, also known as Mobinil, dropped 1
percent to 104.95 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in
Cairo, the lowest level since October 2008. That gave the
company a market value of 10.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion).
They tumbled as much as 3.8 percent earlier. The benchmark EGX
30 Index dropped 0.7 percent.  Mobinil said late yesterday it had a second-quarter loss of
108.5 million pounds ($18.2 million) because of a new tax
regime. The median estimate of seven analysts was for a profit
of 228 million pounds, according to data on Bloomberg.  First-quarter profit had plunged 94 percent as the popular
revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February
interrupted communication services. The shares fell for the
ninth consecutive day, bringing their decline for the year to 36
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
