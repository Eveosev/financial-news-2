NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
U.S. wind-energy producer, plans to spend as much as $5.8
billion in the next three years to build wind and solar
projects.  The company’s NextEra Energy Resources LLC unit plans to
spend from $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion through 2014 on solar
projects, and $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion on wind farms, Lewis
Hay, chief executive officer of the  Juno Beach , Florida-based
power company, said today during a conference call to discuss
its second-quarter results.  The projects will supply electricity for power purchase
contracts it has already completed or expects to complete in the
coming years.  “We have signed more long-term power purchase agreements
for new wind projects thus far in the first seven months of 2011
than we did in all of 2010,” Armando Pimentel, NextEra’s chief
financial officer, said during the call.  NextEra signed 632 megawatts of contracts for wind farms
since the first quarter, including 469 megawatts for projects in
 Canada  that received contracts from the Ontario Power Authority
and are expected to enter service in 2013 and 2014.  The company has power contracts totaling more than 1.1
gigawatts of wind projects in the U.S. and Canada that entered
service this year or are expected to do so by 2012, Pimentel
said. NextEra said in April that it expects to add by the end of
next year as much as 2 gigawatts of wind power to the 8.3
gigawatts it has in operation now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
