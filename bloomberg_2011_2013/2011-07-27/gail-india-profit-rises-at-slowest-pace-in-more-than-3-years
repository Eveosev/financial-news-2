GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the country’s
biggest natural gas distributor, reported the slowest pace of
quarterly profit growth in more than three years after its fuel
subsidy burden rose.  First-quarter net income rose 11 percent to 9.85 billion
rupees ($224 million), or 7.76 rupees a share, from a year
earlier, according to a stock exchange filing today. The median
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of
8.4 billion rupees. Profit growth in the three months ended June
30 was the slowest since the quarter ended March 31, 2008.  The government asks state-owned energy companies GAIL, Oil
& Natural Gas Corp. and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  to share part of the
revenue loss incurred by refiners, which sell fuels including
liquefied petroleum gas below cost. GAIL’s subsidy bill rose 53
percent to 6.81 billion rupees, according to the filing.  GAIL fell 0.8 percent to 457.55 rupees at 3:08 p.m. in
Mumbai trading. The stock has dropped 11 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent decline in the benchmark Sensitive
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
