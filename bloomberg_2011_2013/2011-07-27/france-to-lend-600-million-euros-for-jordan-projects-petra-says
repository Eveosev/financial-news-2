France  will lend 600 million euros
($861 million) to Jordan for development projects, the Jordanian
state news agency said.  An agreement for the financing was signed in Paris today
following talks between Jordanian King Abdullah and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy , said the agency,  Petra . The accord
set Franceâ€™s lending limit for the projects, which include plans
for improvements to water supplies, sanitation, energy,
transportation and the environment, Petra said.  The financing through the Agence Francaise de Developpement
will end in 2013, according to Petra.  The French agency provided $48 million to Jordan earlier
this month to help finance a drinking-water project. The funds
are part of a $100 million loan pledged in 2009 to the kingdom,
