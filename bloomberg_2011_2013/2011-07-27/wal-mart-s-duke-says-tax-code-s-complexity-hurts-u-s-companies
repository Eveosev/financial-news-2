The U.S. tax code needs a
comprehensive rewrite, Mike Duke, the president and chief
executive officer of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , is telling the Senate
Finance Committee today, according to his prepared testimony.  “The question for today’s discussion is not whether Wal-
Mart can get by as a company under the current tax structure,”
he will say this morning, according to the prepared remarks.
“The question is whether this structure is the best approach
for our country. We believe it is not.”  Also testifying today are the chief executive officers of
 CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) ,  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  and PMC-Sierra Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
