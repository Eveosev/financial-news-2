Jordan canceled a tender to buy
100,000 metric tons of barley for the second time because of
elevated prices and may reissue it on July 31.  “We canceled the tender because the prices offered by
suppliers were too high and we will offer a new one possibly on
Sunday,” Mohamad Malahmeh, head of the tenders department at
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said today by phone.  The barley tender was originally issued June 20. It was
withdrawn because prices were deemed to be excessive and was
reissued on July 10 with a closing deadline of today.  The ministry has issued a tender to buy 50,000 tons of
wheat from all origins, with offers due tomorrow by 2 p.m. in
the capital, Amman. “The results of the wheat tender are most
probably going to be announced tomorrow,” Malahmeh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
