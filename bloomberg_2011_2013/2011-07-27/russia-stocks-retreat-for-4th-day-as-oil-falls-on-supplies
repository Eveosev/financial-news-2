Russian stocks retreated for a
fourth day as oil fell after a U.S. government report showed an
unexpected increase in inventories.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks slid 0.9 percent to 1,706.28
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest loss since July
18. Oil producers OAO Rosneft and OAO Tatneft slipped 1.7
percent and 2 percent, respectively. OAO Uralkali,  Russia ’s
largest potash maker, lost 1.2 percent, and OAO Novatek, the
country’s second-biggest natural gas producer, slumped 1.4
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index declined 0.6 percent
to 1,976.18.  Oil, Russia’s largest export revenue earner, dropped $2.01,
or 2 percent, in  New York  after the U.S. Energy Department said
supplies gained 2.3 million barrels to 354 million last week.
Inventories were forecast to decrease by 2 million barrels,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
