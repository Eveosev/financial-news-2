Citadel Capital  SAE fell to the
lowest level in two months after Abraaj Capital Ltd. dropped
plans to buy a stake in the Egyptian private equity firm.  The shares of the Cairo-based company declined 2.2 percent
to 4.96 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the
lowest level since May 26. That gave the company a market value
of 3.28 billion pounds ($551 million). The benchmark EGX 30
Index retreated 0.7 percent.  Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj said yesterday it is
“no longer currently exploring a transaction with Citadel
Capital.” Talks may be revived in the future “should
performance, deal terms and, or circumstances change,” it said.  Citadel Capital Partners Ltd., the 33 percent owner of
Citadel Capital, said an agreement that would “maximize value
for all Citadel Capital shareholders equally, and adequately
protect the interests of the firm’s stakeholders and co-
investors” couldn’t be reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
