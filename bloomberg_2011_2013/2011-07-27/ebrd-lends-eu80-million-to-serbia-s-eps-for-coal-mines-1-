The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development approved an 80 million-euro
($116 million) loan to help the Serbian state-run  power
company  upgrade its coal mines that fuel the country’s biggest
thermal plants.  The loan, together with an expected 74 million euros from
 Germany ’s development bank KfW, will help Elektroprivreda
Srbije, or EPS, buy new equipment for the open pits of its
Kolubara mining basin south of Belgrade, the London-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The new machinery will “improve the quality of the
lignite it relies upon while reducing fuel wastage” and
cutting costs, the bank said. The improvements will “lead to
savings of around 250,000 tons of coal” in electricity
generation, which will reduce carbon emissions of more than
200,000 tons, it said.  The EPS relies on the Kolubara coal to supply four
thermal plants, with combined capacity of more than 3,000
megawatts.  Residents of the Vreoci village near the mines recently
demanded that the loan be halted until the EPS revises its
plan to resettle them to expand the open pits. They want the
power company to resettle them all together instead of moving
some 850 families individually.  Resettling Vreoci “does not form part of the proposed
EBRD project,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. Still, “if deficiencies in the resettlement
process are identified, the Bank will strongly encourage EPS
to address them.”  According to an earlier EPS estimate, coal reserves under
the Vreoci village exceed 500 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
