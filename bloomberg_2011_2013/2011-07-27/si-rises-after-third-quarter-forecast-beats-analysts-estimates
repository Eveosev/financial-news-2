LSI Corp. (LSI) , the maker of chips used
in computer disk drives, rose as much as 9.3 percent in late
trading after forecasting revenue for the current period that
may beat analysts’ estimates.  Third-quarter sales from continuing operations will be $535
million to $565 million, the Milpitas, California-based company
said in a statement. That compares with the $510.7 million
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The strong forecasts reflects market share gains, Chief
Executive Officer Abhi Talwalkar said in the statement.  LSI rose to as high as $7.04 in extended trading, after
closing at $6.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had
climbed 7.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
