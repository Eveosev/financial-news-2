Valeo SA (FR) ,  France ’s second-largest
auto-parts maker, said first-half profit rose 30 percent as
demand for its fuel-saving technologies outpaced global auto-
market growth.  Net income rose to 218 million euros ($313 million) from
168 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. Sales rose 11 percent to 5.33 billion
euros.  “I remain bullish about Valeo’s ability to accelerate
growth compared with the market in all of our businesses,”
Chief Executive Officer Jacques Aschenbroich said in the
statement.  Valeo, whose products span windshield wipers, headlights,
air conditioning and fuel-efficient “stop-and-start” systems,
is tightening its focus on safety, comfort and environmental
technologies to increase margins. Aschenbroich pledged last year
to double revenue from fuel-saving parts to 1 billion euros by
2013, with a 30 percent return on capital overall.  Operating profit, excluding one-time gains and losses, rose
18 percent to 345 million euros, or 6.5 percent of sales, from
292 million euros, or 6.1 percent. The company reiterated its
full-year guidance to increase the 6.4 operating margin recorded
in 2010.  Order intake rose to a record 7.7 billion euros as European
sales jumped 15 percent, outstripping its home region’s
automotive production growth by 8 percentage points, Valeo said.
 North America  led the sales increase with a 39 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
