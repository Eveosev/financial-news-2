Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest government-controlled bank, was ordered by the
Federal Reserve to improve oversight of its U.S. operations.  The regulator issued a cease-and-desist order requiring the
bank to improve compliance with anti-money laundering rules and
bank secrecy legislation, the Federal Reserve said in a
statement today.  “We set and expect higher standards than those that
resulted in this order,”  Stephen Hester , chief executive
officer of the Edinburgh-based bank, said in a separate
statement. “RBS is well advanced in addressing the deficiencies
noted by the U.S. banking authorities and in continuing to
upgrade our governance and compliance systems throughout the
group.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
