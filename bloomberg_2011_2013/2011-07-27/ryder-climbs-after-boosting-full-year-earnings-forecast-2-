Ryder System Inc. (R) , the biggest
publicly traded U.S. truck lessor, climbed in New York trading
after increasing its full-year profit forecast.  Earnings per share in 2011 will be $3.33 to $3.43, the
Miami-based company said in a statement today. Ryder’s previous
outlook was $2.90 to $3. The average of 12 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was $3.04.  Ryder’s second-quarter revenue in its commercial-rental
segment gained 38 percent as the company raised rates. Many of
its lots are empty amid growing demand from customers who “need
to move freight right now,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton said in a telephone interview.  “When customer demand gets heavier, the way you start
allocating the available capacity is by price, to ensure those
who really need it are going to end up paying,” he said.  The shares climbed 23 cents to $57.88 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, they reached
$60.38, the highest intraday price since Oct. 1, 2008. Ryder was
among only 19 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to
post gains today, as the stalemate over the U.S. debt ceiling
pushed the federal government closer to default.  Ryder also said second-quarter earnings per share from
continuing operations were 92 cents, excluding costs from a tax
law change and an acquisition. That topped the 77-cent average
of 12 analyst estimates. Net income increased 34 percent to $40
million, or 77 cents a share, from $29.8 million, or 56 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent to $1.51 billion.  Quarterly Forecast  Ryder forecast third-quarter earnings per share of 98 cents
to $1.03. The average of 12 analyst estimates was 91 cents.  Year-to-date early terminations and early replacements in
leased vehicles declined, reflecting an improved economy, Ryder
said. Full-service lease revenue advanced 3 percent.  When customers “ask us to get the equipment and lease and
maintain it for them, that means they’re fairly confident in
their business and business volume,” Swienton said. “There’s
been more confidence, more belief that there’s sustainability.
That’s up until now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
