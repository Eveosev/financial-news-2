Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said the lira will find a value between excess strength
and excess weakness, after it declined to the lowest in more
than two years this week.  “A lot of people were complaining a year or two ago after
the Turkish lira rose in value, now people are uncomfortable
about the decline,” Erdogan told reporters in televised
comments from Ankara airport today. “No one should get
concerned: we’ll find a middle ground again and we’ll find it
very comfortably.”  Erdogan was responding to a question about what steps the
government is planning to deal with the widening current account
deficit and about the competitiveness of the lira’s value.  The lira dropped 0.2 percent to 1.7012 per dollar at 11:49
a.m. in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
