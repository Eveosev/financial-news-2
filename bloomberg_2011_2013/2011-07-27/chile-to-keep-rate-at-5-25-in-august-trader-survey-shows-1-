Chile ’s central bank probably will
keep its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged in August as
inflation expectations decline, according to a bi-weekly survey
of traders and investors posted on the bank’s website.  Consumer prices will grow 0.1 percent in July while annual
inflation will reach 3.2 percent in 12 months, according to the
median estimate of 53 respondents in the survey released today.
The median estimates for monthly and annual price gains in the
previous survey were 0.2 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.  Policy makers kept lending costs unchanged in July at 5.25
percent, the first pause since January, as signs of slower
global growth and a moderation in domestic output and demand
provided it space to delay additional increases.  Chile’s one-year interest rate swaps, which reflect
traders’ views of future rate decisions, were trading at 5.64
percent at 8:58 a.m. New York time compared with 5.71 percent a
month ago. The peso rose 0.3 percent from yesterday’s close to a
three-year high of 456.55 against the  U.S. dollar .  Inflation slowed to 0.2 percent in June from 0.4 percent in
May on a decline in clothing and transportation prices, the
National Statistics Institute said in a July 8 report.  Core
inflation , which excludes produce and fuel, decelerated to 0.1
percent from 0.3 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
