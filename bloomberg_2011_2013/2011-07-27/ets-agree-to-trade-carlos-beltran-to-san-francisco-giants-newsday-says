Carlos Beltran  is being traded to
the  San Francisco Giants  from the  New York Mets , Newsday.com
reported.  Beltran has 24 hours to approve the deal, the website said,
citing two unidentified people familiar with the situation.  In return for the six-time All-Star, the Mets would get one
of two minor league prospects, pitcher Zack Wheeler or
outfielder Gary Brown, Newsday said.  Scott Boras , Beltran’s agent, didn’t immediately return a
