Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based
explorer with the most licenses in  Africa , advanced in its first
day of trading on the  Ghana  Stock Exchange.  The stock, which listed at 31 cedis, climbed to 31.05 cedis
by 10:04 a.m. in the capital, Accra.  The debut is the West African nation bourse’s first since
November 2008, Elizabeth Mate-Koli, head of listing at the
exchange, said by phone yesterday. The company sold 3.5 million
shares at 31 cedis each, raising 109.5 million cedis ($73
million), Tullow said on July 21.  Tullow, which also trades in the U.K. and Ireland, operates
Ghana’s Jubilee oil field, West Africa’s biggest discovery of
crude from an offshore field in a decade. Daily output from the
field is expected to climb to 120,000 barrels per day by August
or September from 80,000 barrels now, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
