Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) , the
operator of a server network that lets businesses deliver data
quickly, fell as much as 14 percent in late trading after its
third-quarter revenue and earnings forecast missed estimates.  Profit will be 31 cents to 34 cents a share, excluding some
items, said Akamai Chief Financial Officer J.D. Sherman on a
conference call today. That compares with analysts’ estimates of
38 cents. The company expects sales of $273 million to $283
million, compared projections of $288.7 million.  Akamai, which counts  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  as
customers, provides services such as application acceleration
and cloud-computing security. The company is grappling with more
competition from rivals such as Limelight Networks Inc. and
 Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT) , said Chad Bartley, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities Inc. in  Portland ,  Oregon .  “There are more solutions, more alternatives to Akamai,”
said Bartley, who has a “sector-perform” rating on the stock
and doesn’t own it. “Limelight and Level 3 are improving. We
are seeing more pricing pressure.”  Akamai fell to $25.22 at 6:20 p.m. New York time in late
trading after closing at $29.48 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have declined 37 percent this year.  Second-Quarter Results  Second-quarter profit excluding some items was 35 cents a
share, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said in a
statement. That fell short of the 37 cent average analyst
estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Net income increased 26 percent
to $47.9 million, or 25 cents a share, from $38.1 million, or 20
cents, a year earlier.  Second-quarter results were weighed down by a tax charge of
$28.3 million at a rate of 35 percent, higher than the forecast
rate of 32 percent to 33 percent, the company said in the
statement.  “It was a solid quarter for us,” said Paul Sagan, chief
executive officer of Akamai, in a telephone interview after
results were released. “We’re going to work hard on increasing
the growth rate over time because that’s clearly a concern for
folks and we think there’s a lot more opportunity we can be
executing against.”  Second-quarter sales rose 13 percent to $277 million from
$245.3 million a year earlier. Analysts on average predicted
sales of $277.8 million.  The company expects 10 percent to 13 percent growth in
revenue for the year, said Sherman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
