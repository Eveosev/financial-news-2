Estoniaâ€™s Police and Border Guard
Board will cut jobs because of budget reductions,  Postimees 
reported, citing Director General Raivo Kuut.  The reductions will mainly affect support functions, the
Tallinn-based newspaper cited Kuut as saying. He declined to
give the size of cutbacks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
