Royal DSM NV and  Nutreco NV (NUO)  said
they are considering a joint bid for animal nutrition supplier
Provimi, seeking to split up the asset that could carry a price
tag of more than 1.8 billion euros ($2.6 billion).  The two companies may combine forces to buy the asset from
Permira Advisers LLP should the opportunity arise, Amersfoort-
based Nutreco and Heerlen-based DSM said in a joint statement.  Permira is expected to get final bids at the end of this
month and DSM and Nutreco faces competition from rival suitors
Cargill Inc. and  China ’s New Hope Group Co., two people with
knowledge of the matter said June 23. DSM is likely interested
in the pre-mix part of Provimi, with the animal-food operation
better suited to Nutreco, Jos Versteeg, an analyst at Theodoor
Gilissen Bankiers NV, said in a note prior to today’s
announcement.  As well as attracting food companies, the asset is of
interest to chemical makers like DSM as they diversify away from
more cyclical markets toward more technology-based enzymes and
products destined for consumer products.  Permira, based in  London , bought Provimi in 2007 from
private equity rivals CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and PAI
Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
