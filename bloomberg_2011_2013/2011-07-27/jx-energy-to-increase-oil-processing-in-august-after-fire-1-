JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.,
 Japan ’s largest refiner owned by  JX Holdings Inc. (5020) , plans to
process 1 percent more crude oil in August compared with a year
ago after a fire cut output from one of its plants.  “We need to boost our processing following the output cut
caused by the fire earlier in July at the Mizushima-A
refinery,” Senior Vice President Tsutomu Sugimori told
reporters in Tokyo today. JX will run 5.91 million kiloliters of
crude in August, he said.  JX cut processing at its 150,000 barrel-a-day Mizushima-A
plant in western Japan after a July 18 fire in the refinery’s
vacuum distillation unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
