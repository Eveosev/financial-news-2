Colombia’s peso fell to a three-week
low after President  Juan Manuel Santos  said the government will
continue its policy of “interventions” to stem gains in the
currency and counterweigh the effect of record foreign direct
investment.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 1,766.7, per dollar, a three-
week low, at 2:30 p.m. New York time, from 1,759.3 yesterday.
The currency has jumped 8.5 percent since March 1, the best
performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “The central bank will continue with its policy of
protecting the  exchange rate ,” Santos said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. “And the government will continue the
interventions it has been doing.”  In a bid to ease the peso’s rally, the government has said
it would create an overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion
from dollars bought in the local market through the end of 2011,
and forgo repatriating funds from abroad the rest of the year.
The central bank announced last September it would buy more than
$20 million a day for at least a year.  The peso fell after Santos’ comments on concern it was
nearing 1,750, a level that could trigger the government to step
up measures to curb the currency’s rally, said Jose Luis Alayon,
analyst at Acciones y Valores SA.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.69 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The security’s price rose 0.132
centavo to 118.607 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
