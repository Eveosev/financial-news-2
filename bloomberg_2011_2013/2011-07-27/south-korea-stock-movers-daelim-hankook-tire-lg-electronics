Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul. The
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 5.61, or 0.3 percent, to 2,174.31, rising for a
second day.  Hankook Tire Co. (000240 KS), South Korea’s biggest
tiremaker, fell 5.6 percent to 43,000 won, the steepest drop
since June 13. Woori Investment & Securities Co. cut its rating
to “hold” from “buy,” saying the current stock price mostly
reflects an expected improvement in margins next year, according
to a report today.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  (066570 KS), the world’s third-largest
mobile-phone maker, rallied 2.6 percent to 83,800 won, the
biggest increase since July 15. The stock gained after the
company reported losses at its wireless division that were
narrower than analysts had estimated. The loss at the mobile-
phone division totaled 54 billion won ($51 million) in the three
months ended in June, compared with a median estimate for a loss
of 80.2 billion won in a Bloomberg News survey of six analysts.  Samho International Co. (001880 KS) tumbled 15 percent to
2,440 won, after a company whose asset-backed commercial papers
were backed by Samho failed to make payment. Samho made the
statement on the commercial papers in a regulatory filing
yesterday after the market closed. Daelim Industrial Co. (000210
KS), Samho’s biggest shareholder, also lost 4.8 percent to
128,000 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
