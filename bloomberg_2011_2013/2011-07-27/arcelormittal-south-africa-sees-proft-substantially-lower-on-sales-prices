ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) , the
continent’s largest steelmaker, forecast “substantially lower”
third-quarter earnings than the previous three months because of
a drop in international steel prices and sales volumes.  The effect will be “exacerbated” by a planned shutdown at
its Saldanha plant, an increase in coking coal costs and recent
industrial action, the Vanderbijlpark, South Africa-based
steelmaker said today in a statement.  Second-quarter net income fell 54 percent to 470 million
rand ($70 million) from 1.032 billion rand in the year-earlier
period, according to Bloomberg calculations based on half-year
results published today. That followed a “sharp” increase in
raw materials costs and a stronger rand.  Coking coal costs increased by 59 percent and iron ore by
23 percent in the first six months of the year.  “In general, steel demand was subdued in the past six
months, with slow economic growth being a concern in most
advanced economies,” the statement said.  The company determines its prices based on a basket of
international steel prices from the U.S.,  Germany ,  Brazil  and
China.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  South Africa is controlled by the world’s
biggest steelmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
