Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after Western Refining Inc.’s El Paso, Texas, refinery shut
overnight because of a  power outage .  Units at the 128,000-barrel-a-day plant were being prepared
for restart, Gary Hanson, a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail. Weather may also affect the region, as an area of
thunderstorms and heavy rain in the Caribbean between Cuba and
Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula has a “near 100 percent chance” of
becoming a tropical depression or storm, according to the
National Hurricane Center.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.75 cent to 7.75 cents a gallon on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:58 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 0.81 cent
to $3.0216 a gallon.  A tropical storm may form in the region and head for Texas.  “We believe this is evolving into a depression now and it
is conceivable they could declare it a storm,” said Dan Kottlowski, expert senior meteorologist for AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
