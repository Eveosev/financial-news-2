Economy Minister Philipp Roesler’s
plan to get German companies to invest in  Greece  would benefit
both sides, help Greece get out of its recession and strengthen
the country’s competitiveness,  Handelsblatt  said, citing
Cologne-based IW institute economist Juergen Matthes.  Direct investments by companies should be combined with so-
called structural funds from the European Union and European
Investment Bank loans to reach a size that makes a difference in
economic terms, Matthes told the newspaper.  The focus should be on logistics, including modernizing
harbors and rail and road links, tourism, solar power and
information technology, the economist at the company-sponsored
institute told Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
