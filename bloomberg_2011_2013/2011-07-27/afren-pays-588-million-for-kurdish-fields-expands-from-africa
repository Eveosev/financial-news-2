Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on  Africa , has agreed to pay $588 million for
interests in two production-sharing contracts in the Kurdistan
region of Iraq to expand outside the continent.  Afren agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in the Barda Rash
and 20 percent in the Ain Sifni projects from Komet Group and
the Kurdistan regional government respectively, the London-based
company said today in statement. It will fund the acquisition
through a mix of new equity sales, debt and cash.  The explorer plans to sell about 83.7 million shares to
existing and new investors at the price to be determined by its
coordinators,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch
International unit and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Securities Ltd. The new
shares, if all are sold, would represent about 8.5 percent of
the company’s existing shares, Afren said.  Afren Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah in March
said that he had a “very rich acquisition pipeline” to expand.
The company, which cut its full-year production target last
week, has been  entering new areas  in African oil and gas.  The company agreed to raise a $200 million loan from  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA and VTB Group to fund part of the Kurdistan assets
acquisition, Afren said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
