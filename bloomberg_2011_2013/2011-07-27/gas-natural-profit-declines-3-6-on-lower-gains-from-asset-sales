Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) ,  Spain ’s largest
natural gas company, said first-half profit dropped 3.6 percent
after it earned less from asset sales than a year earlier.  Net income fell to 822 million euros ($1.19 billion) from
853 million euros a year earlier, the Barcelona-based company
said in a statement. That compares with the 856 million-euro
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Excluding
the effects of  capital gains  and losses from asset sales in 2010
and 2011, recurring first-half profit climbed 11 percent.  “The divestments that were carried out, a strict
investment discipline and the evolution of the company’s
businesses are allowing it to progressively normalize its debt
level,” Gas Natural said. Net debt fell to 16.9 billion euros
at the end of June from 19.8 billion euros a year earlier.  Gas Natural buys about a third of its gas from  Algeria ’s
Sonatrach, and in June agreed to pay the state-owned energy
company $1.9 billion to settle a dispute, while saying Sonatrach
may become a shareholder. The deal followed an arbitration court
ruling that recognized Sonatrach’s right to raise prices for gas
sent to Spain since 2007 through the Maghreb Europe pipeline.  The Spanish company on June 17 said it will sell a 3.85
percent stake to Sonatrach for 515 million euros, issuing 38.2
million new shares at 13.48 euros apiece for the transaction.  Shares Slide  Gas Natural fell as much as 1.9 percent to 14.54 euros in
Madrid trading, and was at 14.60 euros as of 10:02 a.m. local
time. The stock has climbed 27 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 13.9 billion euros.  The Maghreb pipeline crosses  Morocco  and extends into Spain
and  Portugal . Spain also imports the fuel by ship, using six
regasification terminals that turn liquefied natural gas back
into gas.  Gas Natural targets net income of about 1.5 billion euros
in 2012 and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of more than 5 billion euros. Ebitda rose 0.4
percent to 2.39 billion euros in the first half, the company
said. Gas Natural said last year it aimed to boost dividends by
at least 10 percent a year on average from 2010 to 2014.  The company plans to invest at a slower pace through 2012
as it seeks to cut debt following the acquisition of the Union
Fenosa SA utility in 2009, through which it gained access to
gas-liquefaction and regasification plants as well as
electricity-generation capacity. Average annual gross investment
will fall to 1.8 billion euros from 2010 through 2012, Gas
Natural said last year.  Debt Plans  Chief Executive Officer Rafael Villaseca said on April 14
he aims to reduce net debt to about 15.5 billion euros by the
end of 2012. The pace of investment may then double to as much
as 3.9 billion a year in 2013 and 2014, he said.  Gas Natural had electricity-generation capacity of 17,305
megawatts in Spain and abroad at the end of December. So-called
combined-cycle  power plants  accounted for 63 percent of
capacity, hydropower 11 percent and coal-fired plants 12
percent. Spanish gas demand dropped 0.3 percent in 2010 after an
11 percent slump in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
