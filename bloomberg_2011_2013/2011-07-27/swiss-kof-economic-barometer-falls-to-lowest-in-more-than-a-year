Switzerland ’s economic barometer
fell in July, adding to signs the franc’s rise and a faltering
euro-region economy may hurt the country’s economic growth.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead dropped to 2.04 from 2.23 in
June, the  KOF Swiss Economic Institute  in Zurich said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since February 2010.
Economists expected the gauge to decline to 2.11, the median of
eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Switzerland’s economy is showing some signs of cooling as
the franc’s 19 percent gain versus the euro over the past year
and faltering demand in the single-currency area are curbing
export growth. Retail sales declined 4.1 percent in May and the
government last month lowered its forecast for 2012 economic
growth to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
