HomeAway Inc., the online vacation-
rental service that first sold shares to the public last month,
said second-quarter profit fell 85 percent as the company
boosted spending to promote its services globally.  Net income fell to $2.2 million from $14.9 million a year
earlier, the Austin, Texas-based company said today in a
statement. Sales rose 41 percent to $58.7 million from $41.6
million.  Founded in 2005, HomeAway owns 31 websites and operates in
145 countries. Property owners and managers pay to list vacation
rentals on HomeAway.com, which travelers can peruse without
charge. Sales and marketing costs rose 49 percent to $20.6
million from $13.8 million a year earlier, and the company
expanded in the Asia-Pacific region through the acquisition of
Australia’s realholidays.com.au.  “During the quarter, we continued to invest in our network
of online vacation rental listing websites through new product
launches, ongoing network improvements and strategic
acquisitions,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Sharples said in
the statement.  HomeAway fell 16 cents to $42.77 on the Nasdaq Stock Market
today. The shares have soared 58 percent since they started
trading on June 29, giving HomeAway a market value of about $3.4
billion.  Revenue this year will increase at least 33 percent to
between $224 million and $226 million from $167.9 million in
2010, HomeAway said. The company expects adjusted earnings to
$62 million to $63 million.  While HomeAway’s business is growing, the company faces
competition from  Airbnb Inc. , the website that lets home owners
turn extra bedrooms into vacation rentals. The San Francisco-
based company said this week that it raised $112 million in a
funding round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
That valued the company at $1.3 billion, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
