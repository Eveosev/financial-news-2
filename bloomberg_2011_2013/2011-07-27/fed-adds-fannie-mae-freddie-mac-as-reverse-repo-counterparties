The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
added  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  as counterparties for reverse
repurchase agreements, which policy makers plan to use to drain
the record amount of cash they added to the financial system.  Fed officials have said they may use reverse repos, pay
interest on excess bank reserves and sell securities directly to
investors to withdraw or neutralize cash in the banking system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, draining cash from the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash to the primary
dealers. In a tri-party repo, a clearing bank acts as a third
party to make sure there’s adequate collateral behind the repo
and that it conforms throughout the life of the transaction to
the investor’s requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
