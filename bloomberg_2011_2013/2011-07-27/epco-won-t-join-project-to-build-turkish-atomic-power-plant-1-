Tokyo  Electric Power Co. won’t
participate in a project to build a nuclear plant in Turkey,
said Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at the utility.  The Japanese company needs to focus on its core business
after the nuclear disaster at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
plant, Matsumoto told reporters in Tokyo today. Tokyo Electric
and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  had been trying to win the order in Turkey.  The company plans to cooperate on a nuclear project in
Vietnam “to the extent possible.” Vietnam agreed in October to
make  Japan  a partner in building the nuclear plant in the
southern province of Ninh Thuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
