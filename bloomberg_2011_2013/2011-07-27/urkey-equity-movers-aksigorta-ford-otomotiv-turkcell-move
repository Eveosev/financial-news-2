Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell for the first day in three, reversing gains of as
much as 0.6 percent after  Standard & Poor’s  said the country’s
economy may be heading for a “hard landing.” The benchmark
gauge closed down 207.09, or 0.3 percent, at 61,181.55 at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Aksigorta AS (AKGRT)  , a Turkish non-life insurer, surged
as much as 10 percent, its biggest intraday gain in four months,
and closed up 5 kurus, or 3.2 percent, at 1.61 liras. Brussels-
based Ageas and its Turkish partner  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) 
 aim to make Aksigorta the industry leader in Turkey
after  Ageas (AGS)  bought a 31 percent stake from Sabanci in February,
Ageas Chief Executive Officer Bart De Smet said at a press
conference today.  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO)  , the Turkish unit of
Ford Motor Co., added 50 kurus, or 4 percent, to 12.95 liras,
its biggest gain since May 9. The company was raised to
“neutral” from “sell” at UBS AG.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI), Turkey’s
biggest mobile-phone company, dropped 8 kurus, or 0.9 percent,
to 8.58 liras ahead of its earnings report. The company may
report second-quarter profit after markets close today of 19.9
million liras ($11.8 million), down from 425 million liras in
the same period a year earlier, according to the mean estimate
of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey, five of whom forecasted a
loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
