A 17-day strike by workers at the
South African units of  oil companies  including  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and Petroliam Nasional Bhd. may be called off tomorrow after
“positive” feedback from union members on a revised pay offer.  “We are cautiously optimistic that the outcome will be
positive” when unions meet tomorrow in Johannesburg, said Dirk
Hermann, the deputy head of the Solidarity trade union.  Workers polled so far by the General Industries Workers
Union reacted “positively” to the revised offer, Edson
Ntsibande, a spokesman for the union, said in a telephone
interview. The union is still getting feedback from some
regions, he said.  Members of the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and
Allied Workers Union (CEPPWAWU) are still discussing the offer,
according to Jerry Nkosi, its chief negotiator.  CEPPWAWU, GIWUSA and the South African Chemical Workers
Unions have been on strike since July 11, demanding pay
increases of 11 percent to 13 percent, more than double the
country’s 5 percent inflation rate. The dispute has caused lines
of cars at gas stations in cities including Johannesburg and cut
production at refineries.  Other companies that have been affected by the strike
include  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP) ,  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  and PetroSA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
