Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and
his associates are the target of a criminal complaint filed by
two advocacy groups today in Paris calling for an investigation
to trace any French assets they may hold.  Transparency International’s French branch and Sherpa, a
Paris-based anti-corruption association, filed the complaint
today with the Paris public prosecutor, according to Maud
Perdriel-Vaissiere, a lawyer for Sherpa.  The groups “don’t have any information” on whether Assad
has assets in  France , she said today. Should any be found, the
assets should be frozen and returned to the Syrian people, the
associations said in a  statement . The complaint couldn’t
immediately be confirmed with prosecutors.  Syrian protesters have been demonstrating since mid-March
demanding Assad’s resignation. The protests are part of the wave
of unrest across the  Middle East  and North Africa this year that
unseated the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia. Assad has blamed the
Syrian dissent on a foreign conspiracy. Government crackdowns
have left about 1,950 dead, according to human-rights groups.  Calls for comment to the Syrian embassy in Paris weren’t
immediately returned. The Syrian embassy in  London  referred
calls to Paris.  Paris prosecutors have opened investigations this year to
trace and freeze French assets linked to deposed Tunisian
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  following similar complaints by the groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
