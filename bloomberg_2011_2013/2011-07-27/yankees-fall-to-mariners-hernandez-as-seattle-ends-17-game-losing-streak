Felix Hernandez allowed one run over
seven innings and the  Seattle  Mariners beat the New York Yankees
9-2 today, ending a 17-game losing streak.  The 25-year-old reigning American League Cy Young Award
winner allowed five hits, four walks and struck out five to earn
his ninth win of the season. Rookie Dustin Ackley was 3-for-5
with three runs batted in, and Ichiro Suzuki added four hits,
two runs and two stolen bases as the Mariners won for the first
time since July 5.  Hernandez, a two-time All-Star, is 9-9 in 2011 with a 3.38
earned run average. His 153 strikeouts are third in the league,
trailing Justin Verlander of the  Detroit Tigers  and CC Sabathia
of the Yankees.  New York starter  Phil Hughes  allowed two runs on nine hits
over six innings and left trailing 2-1. The Mariners broke the
game open with five runs in the seventh off a trio of Yankees
relievers. Derek Jeter and Robinson Cano drove in the two New
York runs.  Seattle’s 17-game losing streak was the longest in baseball
this season and four shy of the American League record of 21 set
by the  Baltimore Orioles  in 1988. The team was outscored 101-44
during the skid and dropped from 2.5 games out of the AL West
division lead to 15.5 games behind the  Texas Rangers .  New York is 61-41, 2 1/2 games behind the Boston Red Sox in
the AL East. The Yankees, who have made the playoffs 15 of the
past 16 seasons, are in first place in the wild-card standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
