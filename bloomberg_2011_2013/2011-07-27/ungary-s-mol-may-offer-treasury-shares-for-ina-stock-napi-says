Hungarian refiner Mol Nyrt. may
offer company shares in exchange for shares in Croatian
subsidiary INA Industrija Nafte d.d.,  Napi Gazdasag  said, citing
MOL Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Molnar.  Treasury shares owned by Mol or kept at various banks
“could play a role in solving the INA situation,” which at
present resembles “a war zone,” Molnar said in an interview
published today.  Mol has the financial resources for “a large” acquisition
of more than $1 billion and may use its own shares in such a
transaction, Molnar said, according to Napi. Mol is “checking
out” regional acquisition possibilities, including  Poland ’s
 Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , while keeping the main focus on organic
development, Molnar told the newspaper.  The Budapest-based company may “in the future” return to
its dividend policy agreed earlier, Molnar said, Napi reported.
Mol last paid a dividend in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
