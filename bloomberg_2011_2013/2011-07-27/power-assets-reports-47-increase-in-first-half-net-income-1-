Power Assets Holdings Ltd., the  Hong
Kong  utility controlled by billionaire  Li Ka-shing , boosted its
first-half profit by 47 percent to a record because of faster
growth in earnings outside the city.  Net income for the six months ended June 30 rose to HK$4.1
billion ($637 million), or HK$1.9 a share, from HK$2.8 billion
yuan, or HK$1.29 yuan, the company said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange. That compares with a median estimate
of HK$3.9 billion in a Bloomberg News survey of three analysts.  Power Assets has made overseas acquisitions to counter
lower returns in Hong Kong. The utility formerly known as
 Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd. (6)  was among the group of companies
controlled by Li that bought the Electricite de France SA’s
assets in October for 5.8 billion pounds ($9.5 billion).  “For the first time the proportion of earnings derived
from activities outside Hong Kong exceeded earnings from our
Hong Kong operations,” Power Assets said in the statement today.  Earnings from the company’s operations outside Hong Kong
more than doubled to HK$2.3 billion in the first half, it said.  -- Wang Ying . Editors: Tan Hwee Ann, Amit Prakash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
