Concern that nuclear radiation
fallout is contaminating meat prompted Aeon Co., owner of
 Japan ’s biggest supermarket chain, to start testing beef for
cancer-causing substances.  Aeon will start selling beef today in Tokyo stores tested
by an independent laboratory to be within safe limits for
radioactive cesium, it said in a statement. The heightened
surveillance may boost confidence in the safety of beef after
agriculture officials said July 26 that 2,906 cattle ate tainted
feed, potentially leading to contaminated meat.  Prolonged exposure to radiation in the air, ground and food
can cause leukemia and other cancers, according to the London-
based  World Nuclear Association . Japanese consumers have spurned
beef, causing prices to slump, after meat exceeding cesium
safety limits was found in supermarkets -- adding to evidence
that fallout from  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant has entered the food chain.  “No matter what it takes and how much it costs, we have to
check all the beef to remove consumer fears,” Shohei Murai, an
Aeon senior executive, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday.  The retail market in Japan for meat and meat products grew
7 percent in the past decade to 5.9 trillion yen ($76 billion)
in 2010, according to London-based Euromonitor International.  Topvalu Beef  The tested Wagyu beef products, sold under Aeon’s Topvalu
brand, will be stocked in 115 supermarkets in and around Tokyo
before being made available nationwide, the retailer said.
Topvalu accounts for 60 percent of Aeon’s domestic beef
products, and the company will ensure its other domestically
produced beef is tested after September, said Yasuhide Chikazawa, a corporate officer at Aeon.  “Aeon is a very savvy company,” Melanie Brock, the Tokyo-
based regional manager for trade group Meat and Livestock
 Australia , said  in a telephone interview today. “Their
decision to test all beef, I think, is likely to be the way
forward” for other sellers, said Brock, who also chairs the
Australian and New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Japan.  Nippon Meat Packers Inc. (2282) , Japan’s biggest meat processor,
is considering measures around cattle inspections, Kohei
Akiyama, a company spokesman, said in a phone interview today.  “We are asking our business partners to test all the beef
produced across Japan for cesium, regardless of the region in
which it was produced and the kind of cattle it’s from, and we
have been doing this gradually since July 22,” Nagatoshi Nii, a
spokesman for Seven & I Holdings Co., Japan’s biggest retailer
and operator of the Ito-Yokado supermarket chain, said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  Cattle Ban  Japan asked  Miyagi prefecture  to stop the movement of beef
cattle from the area after cesium was found in beef sourced from
the region, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said today.
Miyagi was one of the prefectures worst affected by the March 11
tsunami that led to the meltdown at the Fukushima facility.  Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo, will check all beef
exported from the area for radioactive materials,  Kyodo News 
reported today without citing anyone.  Aeon, based in Chiba, near Tokyo, has contracts with 1,500
farmers across the country supplying its Topvalu Wagyu. Half the
farms are on the southern tip of Japan’s southern island of
Kyushu, more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the
Fukushima plant. Aeon said it controls what cattle used for
Topvalu Wagyu products eat and drink.  Under the retailer’s testing program, 1-kilogram (2-pound)
samples are taken from each cattle carcass and sent to one of
five laboratories in Japan for testing to confirm the meat
doesn’t contain levels of cesium 134 and 137 exceeding
government safety standards.  Aeon aims to double its offering of Topvalu Wagyu products,
which it plans to sell in its 1,000 outlets by August, according
to the company’s statement. It will also increase imports of
beef from the Australian island-state of Tasmania by 30 percent
to 50 percent, and sell the products under the Topvalu brand,
Aeon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
