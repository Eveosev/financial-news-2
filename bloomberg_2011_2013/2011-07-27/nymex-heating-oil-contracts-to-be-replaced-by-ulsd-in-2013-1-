CME Group Inc. (CME)  will stop New York
Mercantile Exchange heating oil futures contracts beyond April
2013 and start a contract for ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the
exchange said.  “In response to changing environmental regulations in New
York state requiring cleaner, lower sulfur standards of 15 ppm
for heating oil, we have launched a New York Harbor ULSD
contract with the same specifications,” Damon Leavell, a CME
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The heating oil contract will be replaced by ultra-low-
sulfur diesel, a dual-use contract that can be used for hedging
both heating oil and on-road diesel, Leavell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
