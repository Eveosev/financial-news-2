Croatia  expects economic growth to
accelerate through 2014 after the country concluded negotiations
to join the European Union, Prime Minister  Jadranka Kosor  said.  The economy will expand 2.5 percent next year and 3.5
percent in 2013, Kosor told a Cabinet meeting in Zagreb, Croatia
today. Croatia’s gross domestic product should reach 4 percent
in 2014 and she reiterated that this year’s GDP should rise 1.5
percent.  Croatia is struggling to recover from a recession as
consumption and investment slump. GDP shrank 0.8 percent in the
first quarter, after contracting 1.2 percent last year and 5.8
percent in 2009. The country concluded negotiations with the
European Union in June and expects to be admitted into the bloc
in July 2013.  “We expect an economic recovery this year, especially in the
context of the concluded negotiations with the EU,” Kosor said.
“Our strategy for the next three years is based on stabilizing
the budget, reducing the public debt and continuing the policy
of cost cutting in all sectors.”  The country’s deficit should drop to 3.4 percent of GDP
next year from 4.3 percent of GDP this year, before dropping to
2.3 percent in 2013 and 1.6 percent in 2014.  Finance Minister Martina Dalic said the strategy, presented
today, was “a realistic and sustainable way to remove the
fiscal imbalance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
