Hydrobudowa Polska SA (HBP) , a Polish
construction company, saw “no threat” to its 50-million zloty
($18.2 million) 2011 profit forecast, the company said in an e-
mailed statement last night.  The company, which described its earnings forecast as
“conservative”, kept the 2011 revenue target of 1.6 billion
zloty, saying orders signed by the end of the second quarter
“ensured revenue for this year and partially for the next
year,” Jerzy Ciechanowski, the company’s Chief Executive
Officer, said in the statement.  New orders’ value exceeded 400 million zloty and the
company is bidding for contracts valued above 1 billion zloty,
Hydrobudowa said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
