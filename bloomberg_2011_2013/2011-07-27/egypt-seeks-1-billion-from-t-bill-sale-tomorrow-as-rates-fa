Egypt  plans to sell six-month and
one-year treasury bills valued at 6 billion Egyptian pounds ($1
billion) tomorrow as yields on both maturities fell at the last
three auctions from the highest levels since 2008.  The Arab country’s central bank, which holds the auctions
on behalf of the Finance Ministry, will seek bids for 2.5
billion pounds in six-month notes and 3.5 billion pounds in one-
year bills, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. Egypt
also plans to auction 3 billion pounds in three-year treasury
bonds on Aug. 1.  The nation raised 3 billion pounds from the sale of two-
year notes at a rate of 13.1 percent this week, beating the
13.25 median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
It was the first bond sale since a popular revolt ousted the
president in February. The  Finance Ministry  canceled sales of
19.5 billion pounds in treasury bonds ranging in maturity from
three years to seven years amid the worst political crisis in
three decades.  The average yield on the six-month notes fell 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 12.385 percent at the last
auction. It had reached 12.791 percent last month, the highest
since October 2008. The rate on the one-year notes declined
seven basis points at the last auction. The country will also
sell 5 billion pounds in treasury bills on July 31.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 rose two basis points to 5.58 percent at 2:28 p.m. in
Cairo. The pound was little changed at 5.9571 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
