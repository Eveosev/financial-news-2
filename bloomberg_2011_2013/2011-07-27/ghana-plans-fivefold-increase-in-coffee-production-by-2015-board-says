Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, plans a more than fivefold increase in coffee
output by 2015 as it replants old farms.  The Ghana Cocoa Board, which also oversees the coffee
industry in the West African nation, is targeting output of
10,000 metric tons, up from 1,700 tons now, said Noah Amenyah, a
spokesman for the Accra-based board, in an interview yesterday.
By 2021, production may reach 20,000 tons, he said.  “The board is weeding farms for farmers free of charge,”
he said. “All other inputs and extension services are also
being offered at no cost to the farmers.”  Ghana neighbors  Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer
and  Africa ’s third-biggest coffee grower. Both countries produce
mainly the robusta variety of beans, which are used in instant
coffee and espresso.  In 2012, the Ghanaian board, known as Cocobod, will
encourage farmers to plant new trees that will quadruple the
area under coffee cultivation to 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres),
said William Quaittoo, the board’s manager for coffee, by phone
July 25.  “We are taking advantage of cocoa-growing areas that are
lying idle,” he said. Cocobod will spend 4 million cedis ($2.6
million), Quaittoo said.  Cocobod asked companies that buy coffee from farmers to
register with the board, similar to the cocoa industry’s system
of licensed buyers, Amenyah said. The agencies will be able to
get loans from the board and banks to purchase coffee, he said.  The board is also considering setting a fixed minimum
buying price for coffee beans, he said.  Ghana  establishes a
similar rate at the start of every cocoa harvest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
