A revised budget proposal by House
Speaker  John Boehner  would save $915 billion over the next
decade, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget
Office .  Boehner was forced to retool the proposal after the agency
determined yesterday that it would cut about $850 billion, far
less than Republicans had anticipated.  The CBO report will help clear the way for a vote on the
plan tomorrow. A competing Democratic proposal by Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  would cut $2.2 trillion, according to
a CBO analysis released earlier today. Republicans say more than
$1 trillion of the savings in Reid’s plan come from a budget
gimmick that takes advantage of a quirk in the way CBO is
required to forecast war costs.  The competing plans are designed to give lawmakers the
political cover they want to approve an increase in the
government’s $14.3 trillion debt limit the Treasury Department
says is needed by Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
