Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
fell 74.03, or 0.7 percent, to 10,023.69 as of 10:30 a.m. in
Tokyo. The following are among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  East Japan Railway Co. (9020)  (9020 JT), the nation’s largest
train operator by sales, dropped 2.1 percent to 4,875 yen. The
company will likely post a 28 percent drop in operating profit
to about 250 billion yen ($3.21 billion) for the year ending in
March 2012, the Nikkei newspaper reported without citing anyone.
Profit from its transportation business is falling because of
reduced operation of trains after the earthquake disaster in
March, according to the report.  Hino Motors Ltd. (7205)  (7205 JT), a maker of trucks and buses
majority owned by Toyota Motor Co., declined 2.3 percent to 478
yen. The company forecast it will have 3 billion yen in net loss
for the six months ending Sept. 30, compared with a profit of
5.84 billion yen a year earlier. It booked a 4.89 billion yen
loss for the first quarter with a 21 percent drop in sales.  Koito Manufacturing Co. (7276 JT), a maker of lighting
equipment for car, lost 2 percent to 1,352 yen. It booked a loss
of 790 million yen for the quarter ended June 30, with a 20
percent drop in sales.  M3 Inc. (2413)  (2413 JT), a medical-information service provider,
surged 9.3 percent to 691,000 yen, a level not seen since
January 2006. Net income jumped 63 percent to 1.1 billion yen as
sales climbed 25 percent in the three months ended June 30,
according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Revenue
from its service to deliver medical information online to
registered members increased, the company said in the document.  NTN Corp. (6472)  (6472 JT), a bearing maker, retreated 1.3 percent
to 461 yen. The company said it was probed by Japan’s Fair Trade
Commission for possible infringement of anti-monopoly laws. NTN
is cooperating with the investigation, according to a statement
to the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  Nippon Electric Glass Co. (5214 JT), a glassmaker, sank 3.1
percent to 990 yen, set for the lowest close since September
2010. The company booked a 45 percent drop in first-quarter net
income to 13.7 billion yen and projected profit for the six
months to Sept. 30 will fall to between 26.5 billion yen and
29.5 billion yen from the previous year’s 42.5 billion yen. The
company expects it will take a while for demand for glass used
for electronic devices to recover and that glass demand for
building materials will continue to be sluggish, according to a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Orix Corp. (8591)  (8591 JT), a financial services company, rose
2.1 percent to 8,440 yen. The company’s first-quarter net income
jumped 44 percent to 23.7 billion yen, compared with a year
earlier. Revenue during the period gained 6.2 percent.  S.T. Corp. (4951 JT), a maker of mothballs and aromatics,
surged by 121 yen, or 14 percent, to 1,006 yen. The company will
start selling radiation meters for household use in October, it
said on its website.  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  (6502 JT), an electronics maker, fell 2.2
percent to 410 yen. The company will likely post operating
profit of between 2 billion yen and 3 billion yen for the April-
June period, compared with a 29.4 billion yen profit a year
earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported without saying where it
obtained the information. Falling factory utilization rates
after the March earthquake hurt its profit, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
