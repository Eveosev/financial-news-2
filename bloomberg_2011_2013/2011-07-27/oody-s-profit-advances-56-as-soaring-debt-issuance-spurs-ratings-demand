Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the world’s second-
largest bond rater, said quarterly profit rose 56 percent as
global debt issuance soared, increasing demand for ratings.  Net income climbed to $189 million, or 82 cents a share,
from $121 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier, New York-based
Moody’s said today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .
Excluding a tax benefit, earnings were 79 cents a share for the
three months ended June 30, beating the average 58-cent estimate
by seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Companies sold more bonds than usual in April and May,
buoying Moody’s earnings, according to Douglas Arthur, an
analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. Issuance has
since slowed, which may be a drag on profits for the rest of the
year, Arthur said in a telephone interview before Moody’s
announced its results.  “Debt issuance was so strong in April and May,” Arthur
said. “The surge in issuance has abruptly halted.”  Moody’s revenue increased 27 percent to $605.2 million in
the second quarter. The company raised its earnings forecast for
the year to a range of $2.38 to $2.48 a share, from $2.22 to
$2.32. Results were strong enough to offset an expected slowdown
in debt issuance in the second half, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Raymond McDaniel said in the statement.  “Moody’s second quarter results reflected gains in all
credit ratings areas,” he said. “We expect more challenging
debt issuance conditions in the U.S. and  Europe  in the second
half of 2011.”  The company also said it expects to resume buying back
stock this year. It has authority to repurchase as much as $1.1
billion.  Bond Sales  Corporate bond sales from the U.S. to Europe to  Asia 
increased 47 percent to $906 billion in the quarter ended June
30 from $618 billion in the same period of 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  About $170.4 billion of debt was issued worldwide this
month through yesterday, down from $205.7 billion in the similar
period last year, the data show.  Moody’s and McGraw-Hill Cos., owner of  Standard & Poor’s ,
the largest rater by revenue, have benefited from a surge in
demand for ratings as companies take advantage of  interest rates 
close to record lows to refinance debt, Arthur said.  Stock Gains  Moody’s, whose founder  John Moody  created credit ratings in
1909, has climbed 41 percent this year to $37.42 as of yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while McGraw-Hill,
which is due to report earnings tomorrow, has risen 21 percent
to $43.96.  Moody’s share price remains below its all-time high of
$74.84, reached in 2007, when 38 percent of its revenue came
from rating complex structured investments. The company won that
business by inflating grades for risky securities, helping
trigger the financial crisis, a Senate subcommittee said in a
report in April. Structured finance accounted for $86.3 million
of revenue in the second quarter, 14 percent of the total.  (Moody’s will hold a conference call for analysts and
