Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , blocked from
exploring on federal leases off Alaska valued at more than $2
billion, said four years of government delays may be
“irresponsible” and a waste of taxpayers’ money.  The company needs about 35 U.S. permits to start drilling
in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. The area may produce about
700,000 barrels of oil per day for 40 years, Peter Slaiby, Shell
Alaska’s vice president, said in remarks prepared for a  Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee  hearing today.  Shell, based in The Hague, is awaiting approval from  the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement  to
drill as many as two wells a year in the  Beaufort Sea  and as
many as three a year in the  Chukchi Sea  from 2012 through 2013.  “Delays are frustrating and disappointing -- you might
even say irresponsible,” Slaiby said in his remarks. “Endless
delays by our government are wasteful to the taxpayer and should
not be tolerated.”  The Environmental Protection Agency issued draft air
permits for the company’s Arctic exploration this month after
prior approvals were appealed by environmental organizations.  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management  spokeswoman Melissa
Schwartz declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
