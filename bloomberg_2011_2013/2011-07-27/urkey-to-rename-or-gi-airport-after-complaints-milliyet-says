Turkey  is searching for a new name
for an airport to serve its Black Sea cities of Ordu and Giresun
after complaints that the name, “OR-GI Airport” in English
brings to mind group sex, Milliyet reported.  “Since OR-GI Airport doesn’t have good connotations in a
foreign language, the name has now kind of been given a pass,”
the Istanbul-based newspaper cited Ordu Governor Orhan Duzgun as
saying. “Of course, during the construction phase a new name
will be found.”  Duzgun, Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin and Transport
Minister Binali Yildirim attended a ceremony on July 22 to mark
the start of construction, Milliyet said. The airport, to be
built in the  Black Sea  using landfill, will cost about 144
million liras ($85 million) and will open in 2014, Milliyet
said.  Yildirim said he wanted construction finished in 528 days
and suggested the new name be “528 Ordu-Giresun Airport,”
Milliyet reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
