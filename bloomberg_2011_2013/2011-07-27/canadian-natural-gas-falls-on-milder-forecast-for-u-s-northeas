Canadian natural gas fell as
forecasters predicted milder weather in the U.S. Northeast that
would curb demand.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, dropped 0.5
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said
some cooling was expected in New England next week.  “We have a safe source of supply, we’re still producing at
high levels, even injecting in storage at times of high heat
that we’ve seen, so all that is working together to hammer out a
little bit of a downside to the market,” Eric Bickel, a
commodity analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky, said
in a telephone interview.  Alberta  gas for August delivery declined 1.75 cents to
C$3.385 per gigajoule ($3.43 per million British thermal units)
as of 2:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. September gas fell 0.25 cent to $3.375. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery was unchanged at $4.37 on
settlement on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.4 billion cubic
feet as of 1 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.68 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.93 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.03 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.73 billion cubic feet today, about 63
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
fell 1.65 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $4.5062 per million British
thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange as of 2:05 p.m.
New York time. Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5
billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 5.01 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $4.0557.  To contact the reporter on this story:
