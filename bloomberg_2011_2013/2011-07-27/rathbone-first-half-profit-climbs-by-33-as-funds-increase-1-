Rathbone Brothers Plc (RAT) , the U.K.
money manager founded in 1742, said first-half profit climbed 33
percent as funds under management increased.  Net income for the first six months increased to 14.7
million pounds ($24.1 million) from 11 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the London-based company said in a
statement today. Assets under management rose to 16.4 billion
pounds from 15.6 billion pounds at the end of last year.  “The first half of 2011 has been a positive one for
Rathbones as investment markets have remained resilient,” Chief
Executive Officer Andy Pomfret said in the statement. “We look
to the future with confidence as Rathbones remains well-
positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
