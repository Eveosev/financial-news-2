Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, will extend the contracts of three top
managers including Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher , who
has led the manufacturer out of a corruption scandal.  Loescher’s contract, due to expire in 2012, will be
prolonged by five years, Siemens said in a statement today. The
supervisory board also agreed to retain Peter Solmssen, the
company’s general counsel, and Siegfried Russwurm, head of its
industrial unit, through 2017.  Austrian-born Loescher, 53, joined Siemens in 2007 from
U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co. to replace CEO Klaus Kleinfeld as the
Munich-based manufacturer was engulfed in allegations of
kickbacks and bribes tied to projects in more than a dozen
countries. In addition to exorcising corrupt practices, Loescher
has scaled back Siemens’s operations to focus on industrial,
energy and health-care customers.  The reorganization has included selling the
telecommunications division on which Siemens was founded and
creating a fourth division targeting municipal infrastructure
such as mass transit and energy distribution.  Loescher has vowed Siemens will outgrow its main rivals to
eventually become a company with 100 billion euros ($145
billion) in sales. Revenue will total 73.8 billion euros in the
year ending Sept. 30 and rise to 84.8 billion euros in fiscal
2015, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
