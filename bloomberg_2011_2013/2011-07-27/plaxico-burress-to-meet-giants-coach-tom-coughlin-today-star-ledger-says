Plaxico Burress will meet today with
New York Giants coach  Tom Coughlin  about a possible return to
the team, the Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey, reported citing
the free-agent wide receiver.  “It’s going to be crazy,” Burress told the newspaper last
night. “I really don’t know what I’m going to say.”  Burress, 33, was released from prison in June after serving
20 months for accidentally shooting himself in the leg at a
Manhattan nightclub.  Burress caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
Eli Manning in the final 35 seconds of the 2008 Super Bowl to
give the Giants a 17-14 victory over the New England Patriots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
