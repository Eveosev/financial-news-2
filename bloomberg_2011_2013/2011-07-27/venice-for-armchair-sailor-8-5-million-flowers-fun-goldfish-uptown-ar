When  John Stobart  had his first
Manhattan show in 1967, Thomas Watson Jr., then president of
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , bought six of the
maritime paintings.  Stobart’s latest show is at the  Gerald Peters Gallery , with
20 works from the 1950s to the present. They include recently
painted views of  Venice ’s Bridge of Sighs and the entrance to
the city’s Grand Canal.  Early in his career, Stobart painted passenger-cargo
vessels in the hope that ship companies would buy them for
boardroom display and calendar prints. In the mid-1960s, he
shifted to historical sailing ships and harbor scenes, with his
usual attention to detail and accuracy.  “Sailors are always impressed by the accuracy of the
riggings in Stobart’s pictures,” said Reagan Upshaw, director
of the gallery, whose favorite work depicts abandoned ships in
 New York ’s Lower South Street in 1885.  Prices range from $42,000 to $575,000. “John Stobart: New
Works” is at 24 E. 78th St. through July 29. Information: +1-

VeneKlasen came up with a floral theme for a summer group show,
with 24 works by 23 artists.  Peter Doig’s “Lemons” features bright fruit on a
background of white and sea-foam green. It’s a compelling image
among an initially confusing jumble of works. Yet like a flea
market, once you start browsing you find the good stuff.  There’s a 1986 color study by  Sigmar Polke , a vase of
flowers painted by Picasso in his twenties, a dark portrait
entitled “Papion” by Picabia, and finally “Blumen (Flowers)”
by  Georg Baselitz .  The latter is a lyrical upside-down vase of flowers with
dark stems. Bits of a yellow background peek out from a storm of
brushstrokes the color of red wine. By contrast, Aaron Curry’s
“Greenegalbwrry,” a steel, cardboard, wood and rope sculpture
almost 7 feet tall, merits VeneKlasen’s description as “the
strangest ‘flower’ in the show.”  Though most works are consignments or part of the gallery’s
collection, Thomas Houseago created his white sculpture of a
flower and leaves especially for the summer show.  Prices range from $40,000 to $8.5 million (for the
Picasso). “Flowers for Summer” is at 4 E. 77th St. through
Sept. 10. Information: +1-212-988-1623;

lens in a 1933 bromide print that once belonged to the  Museum of
Science & Industry  in Chicago.  It’s part of a show at  Manhattan ’s  Keith de Lellis Gallery 
featuring the owner’s acquisition of some of the museum’s
prints. The 52 images are arranged along such themes as travel,
nature, landscapes and still life.  C.F. Ross’s 1935 “Blast Furnaces” presents a sharp-edged
view of Philadelphia using Man Ray’s solarization technique, in
which a print is briefly exposed to light in the dark room.  Don’t miss David Schwab’s wonderful 1933 portrait of a
friendly takin, or goat-antelope, going nose to nose with
someone named Capt. Pfeiffer wearing a suit and a broad smile.  Prices range from $600 to $6,000. “Salon Photography:
1930s Exhibition Prints from the Collection of the Museum of
Science & Industry,  Chicago ” is at 1045 Madison Ave. through
