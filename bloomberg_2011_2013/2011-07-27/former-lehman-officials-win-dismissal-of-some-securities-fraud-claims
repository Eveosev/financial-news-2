Former  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) 
officials won the dismissal of some claims in a securities-fraud
suit brought by buyers of more than $31 billion of the defunct
investment firm’s securities.  U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in  New York  today granted
parts of a motion to throw out claims in the class-action. It
names as defendants five former top Lehman officers, nine former
directors, Lehman’s outside auditor Ernst & Young LLP and 51
underwriters of Lehman securities.  The plaintiffs -- a group of pension funds, companies and
individuals -- claimed Lehman’s financial statements contained
misstatements and omissions about the firm’s use of “Repo 105”
transactions, risk-management policies, liquidity risk, credit
risk and the value of real estate held by Lehman.  Lehman, once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank,
filed for  bankruptcy protection  in September 2008 with assets of
$639 billion.  Kaplan also dismissed part of the investors’ claims against
Ernst & Young, while allowing the case to go forward against the
accounting firm.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA
Litigation, 09-MD-2017, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
