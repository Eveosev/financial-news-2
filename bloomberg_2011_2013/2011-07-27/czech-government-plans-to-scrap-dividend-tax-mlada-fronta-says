The Czech government plans to scrap
the current 15 percent tax on dividends and shares of profit
that owners of companies pay on top of the corporate tax,  Mlada
Fronta Dnes  reported, citing Prime Minister Petr Necas.  The three ruling-coalition parties have already agreed on
the change and it should be a part of an overhaul of the tax
system expected to come in force in 2013, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
