China ’s money-market rate declined
for a fourth day on speculation the central bank will drain less
funds from the financial system to help ease a cash squeeze.  The People’s Bank of China yesterday issued 1 billion yuan
($155 million) of one-year bills, the least in a month, and
offered no  repurchase agreements . China has limited room to
raise reserve-requirement ratios as fewer central bank bills
will mature in the second half, the Financial News, which is
supervised by the monetary authority, reported today, citing
unidentified experts. The central bank has ordered lenders to
set aside more cash as reserves in each of the last eight months.  “Less sales of bills and repos show the central bank
doesn’t want to see a worsening of the cash crunch,” said Liu Junyu, a Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co.,
the nation’s sixth-largest lender. “No reserve-ratio hike this
month has given banks some time to breathe.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.97 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It has declined 95 basis
points since July 21.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was
unchanged at 4.24 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
