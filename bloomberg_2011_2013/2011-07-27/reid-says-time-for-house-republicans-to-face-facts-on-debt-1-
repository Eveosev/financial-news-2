Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said it’s time for Republicans to “face facts” and agree on a
compromise plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  “We’re running out of time,” Reid said at a news
conference today in Washington with other Senate Democratic
leaders. Reid said his plan to trim spending over 10 years is
the only one with “true compromise,” and it can be modified by
“tweaking” in the wake of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office’s finding that it would save only $2.2 trillion instead
of the $2.7 trillion he had advertised.  Reid called a rival plan by House Speaker  John Boehner  a
“big wet kiss to the right wing.”  “It is not a solution, and it will not pass” in the
Democratic-controlled Senate, he said. “Every Democratic
senator will vote against it.”  Boehner’s plan would save just $850 billion rather than the
advertised $3 trillion, according to the CBO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
