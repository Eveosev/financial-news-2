Drogasil SA (DROG3)  and  Raia SA (RAIA3) , operators
of Brazilian drugstores, rose after the retailers said they are
considering a merger.  Drogasil gained 3.4 percent to 12.25 reais, its highest
price in three months, in Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New
York time. Earlier, shares climbed as much as 16 percent. Raia
advanced 3.2 percent to 28.60 reais, the highest since the
company held an initial public offering in December.  The merger would create  Brazil ’s largest drugstore chain
with 696 stores in eight states and 8.4 percent of the market,
wrote Fabio Monteiro, an analyst at Banco BTG Pactual, in an
investor report. Sales for the two companies were a combined 4.2
billion reais ($2.7 billion) last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We really expect the deal to go through,” Monteiro said.
“A merger is very positive for both companies and a move that
shows a lot of business acumen as it is being made precisely in
Sao Paulo state, home to intense competition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
