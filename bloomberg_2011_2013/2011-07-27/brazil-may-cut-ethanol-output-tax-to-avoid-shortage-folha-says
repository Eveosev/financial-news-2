Brazil  may cut taxes on ethanol
production or allow mills to delay tax payments to avoid a
shortage of the fuel in the future, Folha de S.Paulo reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.   The government is also considering reducing the amount of
ethanol mixed into gasoline to 20 percent from currently 25
percent to prevent the scarcity of the product in the short
term, the newspaper said. The measures will be assessed in a
meeting today, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
