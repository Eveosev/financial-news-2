Archaeopteryx, once hailed as the
first  bird , may not have been a bird at all, a study suggests.  The skeleton of a chicken-sized dinosaur found in  China 
has feathers and long forearms, features that had been thought 
distinctive of modern-bird ancestors. The fossil, though, 
shows it more closely related to dinosaurs, according to a 
paper in the journal  Nature .  The  Archaeopteryx , which is about 150 million years old, 
reflects the evolution from reptile to bird, the authors 
wrote. Today’s findings suggest that a bird-like skull and 
an herbivore diet are probably the traits kept in very early
birds, the authors wrote.  “There has been growing unease about the status of
Archaeopteryx as, one by one, its ‘avian’ attributes (feathers,
wishbone, three-fingered hand) started showing up in non-avian
dinosaurs,” wrote  Lawrence M. Witmer , a paleontologist at Ohio
University in  Athens , in a related opinion article. “Perhaps
the time has come to finally accept'' it as "just another
small, feathered, bird-like theropod.''   Archaeopteryx was first discovered in Bavaria in 1861, 
about two years after  Charles Darwin  published “ The Origin of 
Species .”   When the authors of the study, led by Xing Xu of Linyi
University in China, ran a phylogenetic analysis combining the
newly discovered fossil with other similar dinosaurs and early 
birds, it was clear that it should no longer be considered a 
full developed bird, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
