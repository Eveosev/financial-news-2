European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the European Union’s bailout of  Greece 
is an investment in the country’s future and not a fruitless
subsidy.  “The Europeans are not subsidizing Greece to never see
their money again,” Trichet told France’s Le Point magazine in
an interview, according to a transcript released by the
Frankfurt-based ECB. “They are investing in its recovery. Of
course, they need to monitor their investment closely.”  Trichet said if rating agencies downgrade Greece to
“selective default” because of the losses private sector
investors stand to incur as part of the bailout package,
government guarantees of Greek bonds used as collateral in money
market operations will protect the integrity of the ECB.  “The protection of the integrity of the central bank is
non-negotiable,” he said.  Greece’s exit from the monetary union was not discussed at
last week’s leaders’ summit, Trichet said. “Not for a minute
did anyone consider that option,” he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
