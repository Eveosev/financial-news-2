Qatar’s Qatofin Co’s so-called
linear-low-density polyethylene plant was shut because of
“technical issues” on an upstream cracker, chemical news and
pricing service ICIS said, citing unnamed industry officials.  The plant is shut from July 12 to Aug. 2, ICIS reported. A
call to Qatofin’s office wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
