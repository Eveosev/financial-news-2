Most Asian stocks dropped, led by
exporters and banks, as a political stalemate over raising the
 U.S. debt  ceiling increases concerns the world’s biggest economy
could default, stalling the global economic recovery.  Samsung Electronics Co., a South Korean consumer and
industrial electronics maker that gets about 85 percent of its
revenue abroad, lost 0.6 percent in  Seoul .  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest listed lender, dropped 0.7
percent.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , Asia’s largest-listed tobacco
company by market capitalization, jumped 4.7 percent in  Tokyo .
Catcher Technology Co. advanced for a second day in Taipei after
reporting a gain in net income.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , Asia’s No. 1
casino operator by market value, surged 9.9 percent after
reporting second-quarter profit doubled.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.01 point, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 139.18 as of 7:40 p.m. in Tokyo after
falling as much as 0.5 percent. About three stocks fell for
every two that rose on the gauge. The measure is on course for a
gain this week as forecasts for higher earnings at companies
from Canon Inc. to Baidu Inc. countered the U.S. lawmakers
struggle to reach an agreement to raise the federal debt limit
before an Aug. 2 deadline, increasing concern that the
government may default on its debt.  “The primary focus at present is the U.S.-debt-ceiling
stalemate and investors will remain nervous until that is
resolved,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages about $350 million
at White Funds Management in Sydney. “Everyone considers the
deadlock will be resolved in the end, but the consequences of
not doing so would be very serious for Asia and Asian stock
markets.”  Debt Impasse  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.5 percent as the
yen strengthened against the dollar, cutting the profit outlook
for the nation’s exporters.  South Korea ’s Kospi index climbed
0.3 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.8
percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1
percent today. The index retreated 0.4 percent yesterday in  New
York , whipsawed by negotiations over the nation’s debt limit.  A House vote on Speaker John Boehner’s two-step plan, which
would cut $3 trillion in  government spending  to raise the U.S.
debt ceiling, was postponed amid growing Republican opposition
to the measure that the Obama administration has threatened to
veto. President Barack Obama’s Office of Management and Budget
said it “strongly opposes” the measure and would recommend a
veto if it were passed by Congress.  Exporters Decline  Samsung Electronics, maker of the Galaxy mobile phone, slid
0.6 percent to 845,000 won in Seoul, the biggest drag on the
Kospi index.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which counts  North America  as
its largest market, declined 1.2 percent to 3,255 yen in Tokyo,
the third-heaviest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Honda
Motor Co., the automaker that receives 83 percent of its sales
from outside Japan, lost 1.7 percent to 3,145 yen.  Banks declined on concern rating agencies may lower their
outlook for U.S. debt, roiling credit markets. Both S&P and
Moody’s Investors Service are weighing a downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating.  The amount of U.S. Treasuries held in Japan was estimated
at $912.4 billion at the end of May, the highest level since at
least 2000, according to U.S. Treasury data compiled by
Bloomberg.  U.S. Downgrade Concerns  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0.7 percent to 403 yen,
while rival  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  slipped 1.2
percent.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s
third-largest lender by market value, dipped 1.3 percent to
A$21.28.  “Investors are protecting themselves in case a resolution
is not reached within time,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities
manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Among stocks that rose, Japan Tobacco gained 4.7 percent to
333,000 yen, extending yesterday’s gains, and was the biggest
support to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Vice Finance Minister Fumihiko Igarashi said on July 25 the
Japanese government is weighing selling assets including shares
in Japan Tobacco to pay for earthquake reconstruction costs.
Japan Tobacco plans to buy back some of the shares sold by the
government, Citigroup Inc. analyst Nobuyoshi Miura wrote in a
Japanese-language report dated July 25.  Catcher Rises  Catcher Technology jumped 6.8 percent to NT$265.50,
extending yesterday’s 6.9 percent jump. The company said on July
25 that second-quarter net income rose to NT$2.4 billion ($83.4
million) from NT$839.6 million a year earlier. Credit Suisse
Group AG and UBS AG raised their share-price estimates for
Catcher yesterday.  Sands  China  surged 9.9 percent to HK$23.40, the strongest
support to the Hang Seng Composite Index. The company said net
income rose to $267.4 million in the three months ended June 30
from $133.6 million a year earlier, as gambling surged at its
Macau venues.  Indonesian banks were among the most actively traded stocks
today. PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia, nation’s second-biggest lender
by assets, jumped 3.8 percent to 6,900 rupiah in Jakarta ahead
of announcing second quarter earnings tomorrow. PT Bank Mandiri,
the No. 2, added 2.6 percent. PT Bank Negara Indonesia, majority
owned by the country’s government, climbed 7.2 percent to 4,475
rupiah.  “Historically, banks’ second quarter earnings are better
than the first quarter as lending growth is usually small in the
first quarter,” said Made Suardhini, an analyst at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas in Jakarta. “Every time the earnings results are
about to come out people buy the stocks.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index rose 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 5.9 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
