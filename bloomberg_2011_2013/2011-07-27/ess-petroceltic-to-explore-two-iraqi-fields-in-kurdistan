Hess Corp. (HES) , the New York-based oil
company, and  Petroceltic International Plc (PCI)  agreed to explore two
fields in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq.  The two companies signed a production-sharing agreement for
the Dinarta and Shakrok blocks with the Kurdistan Regional
Government, Dublin-based Petroceltic said in a statement today.
Both blocks will be operated by Hess, with Petroceltic and the
KRG each taking a 20 percent interest.  Iraq resumed oil exports from the semi-autonomous Kurdish
region earlier this year, ending a yearlong halt caused by a
dispute over oil revenue between local authorities and Baghdad.
Kurdistan has attracted more than $10 billion in energy
investments from more than 40 companies from 17 countries,
Regional Government Prime Minister Barham Salih said on May 5.  “These highly prospective blocks add further high-impact
exploration potential to our portfolio,” Petroceltic’s Chief
Executive Officer Brian O’Cathain said in a statement. “While
significant discoveries have already been made, the Kurdistan
region of  Iraq  remains a vastly under-explored area with huge
potential.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
