Acciona SA (ANA) , Spain’s second-largest
wind-farm owner, rose the most in six months in Madrid trading
after its first-half profit beat analysts’ estimates, helped by
its energy and infrastructure businesses.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed 19 percent to 631 million euros ($914
million), the Madrid-based company said in a statement today.
The average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was 590 million euros.  “These good earnings may be a catalyst for the stock,”
Antonio Cruz-Guzman, an analyst at Banesto Bolsa based in
Madrid, wrote in a report today. He said the results beat his
estimates in all divisions.  The shares rose as much as 5.6 percent to 72.89 euros, the
steepest gain since Jan. 19, and traded at 72.04 euros at 10:01
a.m. in Madrid.  First-half net income climbed to 247.6 million euros from
78.2 million euros a year earlier, the company said. Profit was
bolstered by  capital gains  from the sale of stakes in two toll
road concessions in  Chile .  To contact the reporter on this story:
