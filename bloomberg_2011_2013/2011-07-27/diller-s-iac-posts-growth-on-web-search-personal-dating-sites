IAC/InterActiveCorp., the operator
of Match.com and Ask.com, reported a 23 percent increase in
second-quarter revenue from Web-search products and growth in
online dating subscribers. The stock jumped.  Net income at IAC, the Web-based businesses built and
controlled by  Barry Diller , increased to $42.4 million, or 44
cents a share, from $13.6 million, or 12 cents a share a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings excluding some items were 62 cents a share, topping the
38 cent average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  IAC, which operates more than 50 Internet sites, is
building a wide range of digital content and service-oriented
businesses. In February the company formed a joint venture with
 Newsweek magazine  to combine the publication’s operations with
the news website Daily Beast.  IAC rose $4.23, or 11 percent, to $42.02 at 9:42 a.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, and earlier jumped as
much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday gain since September
2008. The shares had added 32 percent this year before today.  Sales increased to $485.4 million from $394.2 million a
year earlier, the company said. That compares with the $465.2
million analysts had projected. The largest share of that growth
came from IAC’s Web-search products including Mindspark, Ask.com
and Dictionary.com.  IAC’s Match.com said in May that it would make a tender
offer for the 73 percent of Meetic SA that it did not already
own. The offer valued the French dating service at $493 million.  (IAC will audiocast its conference call with investors
today at 11 a.m. New York time. The live audiocast can be heard
