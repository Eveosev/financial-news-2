Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the third-
largest U.S. defense contractor, said second-quarter profit fell
30 percent on weak U.S. defense sales and shares fell the most
in more than a year.  Northrop declined $2.72, or 4.2 percent, to $62.68 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since June 29,
2010, after the company said full-year sales will be $27
billion, or $500 million lower than an earlier forecast because
of federal budget pressure and reduced war spending.  Income from continuing operations was $520 million, or
$1.81 a share, compared with $740 million, or $2.44, a year
earlier, the Los Angeles-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts forecast $1.67, the average of 20 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.6 percent to $6.56 billion.  “While sales for the quarter were impacted by several
factors” including lower sales to the U.S. Defense Department,
it was made up by higher margins, Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush said in the statement. The company was boosting its full-
year profit estimate “despite a reduced top-line outlook,” he
said.  “Although we are impressed by margins, we do not see
Northrop’s decision to effectively  shrink revenue as conducive
to stock appreciation,” Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at
Standard & Poor’s Equity Research wrote in a note to clients. He
downgraded the rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  Profit Forecast  Northrop raised its full-year profit forecast to the range
of $6.75 to $6.90 a share, compared with an earlier estimate of
$6.50 to $6.70 a share. Sales for the year will be about $27
billion, the company said, lowering the forecast by $500
million. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast profit of $6.73
a share on sales of $27.6 billion.  The higher profit forecast for the year is driven by a
“higher expected segment margin rate,” Northrop said in the
statement.  The U.S. Congress’s approval of the Pentagon’s 2012 budget
might be delayed, leading to orders for the year being slowed
down, Bush said in a conference call today. Fiscal year 2012
starts Oct. 1.  Northrop’s units have suffered from a slow flow of orders
after the Pentagon’s 2011 budget was delayed more than six
months. Orders for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and E2D
Hawkeye command and control plane were delayed, Bush said.  Stopgap Measures  Congress funded the Defense Department under stopgap
measures until mid-April when the 2011 spending bill was
approved.  For the quarter, profit at the Electronic Systems unit,
which makes military radar, rose 7.6 percent to $284 million
because several contracts are nearing completion and because of
improved performance on intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance programs, the company said.  Sales and operating income at the three other company
segments, including aerospace,  information systems  and technical
services, declined during the quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
