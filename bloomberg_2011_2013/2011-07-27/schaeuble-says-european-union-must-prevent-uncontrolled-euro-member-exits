German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said European governments must prevent a breakup of
the euro region as well as an “uncontrolled” exit of one of
its members.  With the  International Monetary Fund  and the  European
Central Bank  assuming that  Greece  will have a sustainable
primary surplus from 2012, Greece is likely to “master” its
debt after implementing economic policy changes, Schaeuble said
in a letter to lawmakers from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
