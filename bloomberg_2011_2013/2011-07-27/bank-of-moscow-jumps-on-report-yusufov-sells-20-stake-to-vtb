Bank of Moscow shares climbed for
the second day after RIA Novosti reported shareholder Vitaly
Yusufov signed a preliminary agreement to sell his 19.9 percent
stake to VTB Group.  The shares erased losses of as much as 6.6 percent and
gained as much as 2.2 percent to 821 rubles. The stock was up
0.4 percent at 805.90 rubles as of the 6:45 p.m. close of
trading in Moscow.  VTB bought the city government’s 46.5 percent-stake in the
bank after President  Dmitry Medvedev  fired Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov in September amid allegations he showed favoritism in
awarding contracts to his developer wife. Russia’s second-
biggest lender has been pushing to raise its stake to 75 percent
by buying out other shareholders of Bank of Moscow.  The deal ends uncertainty over whether VTB will gain a 75
percent stake, said Marco Casas, a New York-based vice-president
for equity sales at Otkritie Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
