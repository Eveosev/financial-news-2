The yield discount investors are
willing to accept for 10-year German bunds rather than similar-
maturity Treasuries reached the most in more than five months
amid the U.S. impasse on raising the debt ceiling.  German bonds outperformed as House Speaker  John Boehner 
attempted to salvage his plan to curb spending by $3 trillion,
which the White House said President Barack Obama will veto. The
struggle may lead to the U.S. losing its top-level  credit
rating , according to BlackRock Inc. and Loomis Sayles & Co.  “We’re uncomfortably close to one second to midnight,”
said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in London. The widening yield spread “is
certainly based on the idea that a last-minute deal seems
elusive and illusive.”  German bunds rallied, sending the yield down 10 basis
points to 2.65 percent as of 3:58 p.m. in London. The yield
spread with Treasuries widened 10 basis points to 31 basis
points, the most since Feb. 24.  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings have said that they may cut the U.S.’s top-level
sovereign ranking if officials fail to resolve the stalemate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
