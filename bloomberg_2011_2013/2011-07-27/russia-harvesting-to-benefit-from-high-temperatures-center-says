High temperatures in the 10 days to
the end of July will aid grain harvesting in most of  Russia , the
 Federal Hydrometeorological Center  said.  “Heat will have only a positive effect in the regions
which are conducting reaping,” Anna Strashnaya, head of agro-
meteorological forecasts at the center, said today by phone from
Moscow. Those regions are the Southern, Northern Caucasus, and
Central federal districts as well as the southern part of the
Volga federal district, she said. They comprise country main
growing area and source of grain exports.  Temperatures today reached 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the southern part of the Volga area, according to
the center’s website.  In the extreme south of the Volga district, excessive
dryness toward the end of June and early this month may have led
to reduced yields, Strashnaya said. Weather conditions are
“not bad” for crop in Siberia and the Urals, she said.  Overheating of upper soil layers in European Russia and
Siberia since mid-July impeded the growth of sugar beets, she
said, without expanding on the potential damage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
