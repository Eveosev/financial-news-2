Global sugar inventories may take
two years to be rebuilt after demand outpaced supplies in the
past two seasons, the  International Sugar Organization  said.  Smaller crops in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons left a
deficit of 15 million metric tons, senior economist  Sergey Gudoshnikov  estimated. Production will outpace consumption by
just 779,000 tons in the season started in October, according to
the London-based ISO. The surplus for 2011-12 forecast at more
than 3 million tons may be reduced on lower output in Brazil, it
said July 14.  “For the time being, I can’t see where the big crop
increases will come from to make up for 15 million tons,”
Gudoshnikov said in an interview in  London  yesterday. “Even
with the best scenario possible for Brazil’s production this
year, it won’t be enough to rebuild stocks.”  Sugar output in the Center South,  Brazil ’s main producing
region, will fall for the first time in six years to 32.4
million tons in the 2011-12 season, industry group Unica
estimates. While the 2011-12 crop year starts in October for
most countries, harvesting in Brazil is already under way. The
nation is the world’s largest producer of the sweetener.  Sugar prices are likely to stay volatile in the new season
as low inventories will be unable to provide a cushion in case
of weather effects or other supply-related shocks, Gudoshnikov
said. “Stocks are affecting the stability of price, rather than
dictating price level,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
