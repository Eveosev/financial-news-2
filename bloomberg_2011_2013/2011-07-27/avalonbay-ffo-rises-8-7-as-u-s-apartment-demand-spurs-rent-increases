AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) , the
second-largest publicly traded U.S. apartment owner, said funds
from operations climbed 8.7 percent in the second quarter as
rising demand allowed the landlord to increase rents.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $99.9 million, or $1.13 a share, from $87.8
million, or $1.04, a year earlier, the Alexandria, Virginia-
based real estate investment trust said in a statement today.
Analysts expected FFO of $1.12 a share, the average of 21
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Demand for apartments has soared in the U.S. as
foreclosures forced people out of their homes and prospective
buyers found it harder to get mortgages. Rental supply remains
tight, with a surge of multifamily construction not expected to
be complete for at least two years, said Paula Poskon, a REIT
analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in McLean,  Virginia , with an
“outperform” rating on AvalonBay.  “It’s going to be a while before that new supply rears its
ugly head in a way that really meaningfully diminishes the
apartment REITs’ pricing power,” Poskon said in an interview
before earnings were announced. “So I think they’ve got a good
run here through 2013.”  Vacancies Decline  U.S. apartment vacancies dropped in the second quarter to 6
percent, the lowest in more than three years,  Reis Inc.  said in
a July 7 report. Effective rents, or what tenants actually pay
after perks such as a free month, climbed in 80 of the 82
metropolitan areas Reis surveyed, to an average $997 a month
from $974 a year earlier.  AvalonBay cut its forecast for full-year funds from
operations to $4.60 to $4.75 a share from a projection last
month of $4.70 to $4.85. The lowered outlook reflects the
planned sale of an operating community that is now “unlikely”
to be completed before the end of the year, the company said.  AvalonBay reported earnings after the close of regular U.S.
trading. The shares fell 2.4 percent to $134.36 in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading today. They gained 26 percent
in the past 12 months, compared with a 31 percent advance in the
Bloomberg REIT Apartment Index of 14 companies.  FFO, used by REITs, doesn’t conform to generally accepted
accounting principles.  (AvalonBay will hold a conference call tomorrow at 1 p.m.
