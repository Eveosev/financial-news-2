Latvia  expects to receive non-
binding offers to buy state-owned Citadele Banka AS “this
autumn,” the  Baltic News Service  reported, citing Guntis
Karklins, a spokesman for  the privatization agency .  The government will conduct two rounds of bidding and plans
to complete the sale in six to 12 months, Karklins told BNS.  Citadele was split from Parex Banka, Latvia’s second-
biggest lender, after a run on deposits triggered a government
rescue in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
