ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest
steelmaker, reported quarterly profit grew 22 percent on higher
prices and forecast rising shipments in the second half.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed to $3.41 billion in the second quarter from
$2.81 billion a year earlier, Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal
said today in a statement. That beat the $3.25 billion average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The company has delivered a strong performance in the
second quarter of 2011 underpinned by higher steel selling
prices,” Chief Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal  said in the
statement. “Although the third quarter will experience some
seasonal impact, we do not expect this to be as pronounced as
last year.”  Steelmakers’ earnings are benefiting from a recovery in
demand for the alloy, used in construction, cars and pipes. U.S.
Steel Corp., the largest U.S. producer by volume, reported its
first profit in 10 quarters on July 25, while  India ’s JSW Steel
Ltd. posted a 64 percent jump in quarterly net income yesterday.  ArcelorMittal gained 0.8 percent to 22.345 euros by the
close of Amsterdam trading, paring an earlier gain of as much as
2.8 percent.  Hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product, has risen 4.2
percent in 2011 to 552 euros ($799) a metric ton after peaking
at 636.75 euros on Feb. 15, Steel Business Briefing data show.  Shipments Recover  “Due to the continued underlying demand recovery, steel
shipments in the second half of 2011 are expected to be higher
than the same period in 2010,” ArcelorMittal said.  The company, seeking to avoid a repeat of last year’s slump
in second-half earnings as prices fell back and costs rose, said
raw material accounting charges would grow from last quarter.  Ebitda will be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion in the third
quarter, ArcelorMittal said. The range compares with the $2.68
billion average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Use of steelmaking capacity will decline to about 75 percent in
the third quarter from 78 percent in the second, it said.  Costs last quarter also weighed on net income, which fell
to $1.54 billion from $1.71 billion. Steel shipments were little
changed at 22.2 million tons in the period, while net debt rose
by $2.4 billion to $25 billion, according to the statement.  Combating Volatility  Gains in raw-material costs have hobbled producers’ efforts
to emerge from the industry’s worst crisis in 60 years following
a collapse in demand after the world financial crisis.  Iron ore ,
a steelmaking ingredient, may average $160 a ton this year, up
from $122 last year, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  In response, ArcelorMittal is boosting self-sufficiency.
The company joined Peabody Energy Corp. this month to bid for
Australian coal producer  Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC)  In January, it and
Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc. agreed on a C$590 million
($626 million) deal to acquire Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.  ArcelorMittal, which increased iron-ore output 30 percent
in 2010 to 48.9 million tons, plans to expand production 10
percent this year. Steelmakers use about 1.6 tons of iron ore
and half a ton of coking coal to make 1 ton of the alloy.  The  World Steel Association  forecast in April that steel
consumption would expand by 5.9 percent this year, while Morgan
Stanley expects demand to grow by 6.4 percent.  “Barring any significant developments as a result of the
fiscal issues in  Europe  and the U.S., I would expect orders and
shipments to be higher in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to
the third quarter 2011,”  Aditya Mittal , chief financial
officer, said on a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
