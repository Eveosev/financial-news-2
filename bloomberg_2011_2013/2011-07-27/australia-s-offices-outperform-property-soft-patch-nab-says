Australia ’s capital city office
values will rise 1.6 percent in the coming year as buoyant
tenant demand helps overcome a “soft patch” for commercial
property, a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey showed.  NAB’s commercial property index, which measures capital
value and rental pricing expectations in the real estate
industry, fell to minus 5 in June, from 6 in March, the survey
found. The outlook for the office and hotels markets remained
positive, while retail and industrial conditions worsened, the
survey showed.  “Interest rates are now identified as the main challenge
confronting property firms over the next year and the extent of
concern over the impact of higher rates is also rising,” NAB
said in the report. “Finance and funding is seen as the next
biggest challenge, but concerns over consumer confidence are
also rising quickly.”  At 4.75 percent, Australia’s benchmark interest rate is the
highest among the world’s developed economies. Business
confidence dropped to a six-month low, according to a NAB survey
of more than 400 companies in the last week of June, while
 consumer confidence  this month plunged by the most since Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in 2008, a survey from
Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
