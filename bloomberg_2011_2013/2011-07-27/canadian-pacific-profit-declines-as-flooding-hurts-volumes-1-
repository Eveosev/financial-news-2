Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , the
country’s second-largest railroad, reported a 23 percent decline
in second-quarter profit, hurt by inclement weather.  Net income fell to C$128 million ($136 million), or 75
cents a share, the Calgary-based company said today in a
statement. That beat the 72-cent average of 25 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Flooding in the U.S. during the quarter forced Canadian
Pacific, which operates in  Canada  and the U.S. Midwest and
Northeast, to close lines and reroute trains. The company has
sought to boost speed and volumes since inclement winter weather
reduced first-quarter profit 67 percent.  Canadian Pacific fell 67 cents to $61.26 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
declined 5.5 percent this year.  The company reported net income of C$167 million, or 98
cents a share, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
