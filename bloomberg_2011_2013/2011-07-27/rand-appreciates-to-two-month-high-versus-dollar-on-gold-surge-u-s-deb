The rand fluctuated between gains
and losses as investors and traders weighed the advance of gold,
a key South African export, against concern that the European
Union’s debt crisis may spread.  The country’s currency strengthened as much as 0.7 percent
to 6.6285 per dollar, the highest since May 3, after adding 3.5
percent in the previous six days. The rand traded at 6.6755 as
of 6:31 p.m. in Johannesburg, against yesterday’s close of
6.6752, and climbed 1 percent to 9.5793 per euro.  Gold rose to as high as $1,628.05 an ounce as investors
sought to protect their wealth against the possibility of a U.S.
default that may come as soon as next week and cost America its
AAA credit rating amid a standoff over the country’s $14.3
trillion debt limit.  The rand pared its advance after  Germany ’s Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said his country opposes a “blank check”
for the euro-area rescue fund to purchase bonds on the secondary
market, prompting investors to sell the euro and riskier,
emerging-market assets. The euro dropped against 13 of its 16
most-traded peers.  “The euro lost ground, and that correlation” with the
rand “was fairly strong,” said William van Rijn, a currency
trader at Nedbank Group Ltd. by phone from Johannesburg. “As
the market gave back its gains, and the dollar showed some
resilience,” the rand lost ground, he said.  The rand often moves in tandem with the euro, the currency
that is used to buy 45 percent of  South Africa ’s exports, with a
statistical correlation of 0.83 over the past month. A value of
1 would mean they moved in lock step.  Bonds gained. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 added 17
cents to 89.85 rand, cutting the yield three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 8.30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
