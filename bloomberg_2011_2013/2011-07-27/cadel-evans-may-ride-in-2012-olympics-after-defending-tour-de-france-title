Cadel Evans  probably will compete in
next year’s  London  Olympics after defending his Tour de  France 
title, Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates said.  Evans, who became the first southern hemisphere champion in
cycling’s premier race three days ago, previously competed at
the Olympics as a mountain biker in 1996 and 2000 before
switching to a road bike. He rode in the time trial and the road
race at the 2008 Beijing Games.  “We believe that he will want to compete in these Games
again, in the time trial,” Coates said today at an AOC function
in Sydney marking the one-year countdown to the 2012 Games.  Victory in London would allow Evans, 34, to join  Germany ’s
Jan Ullrich and Spain’s Miguel Indurain as the only road
cyclists to win a gold medal, Tour de France and Road World
Championships title.  Evans finished 15th in the Beijing Olympics road race
behind  Samuel Sanchez , who won the King of the Mountains polka
dot jersey at this month’s Tour de France, and placed fifth in
the time trial four days later.  “He came into the Games with a knee injury and wasn’t at
his best,” Coates said.  The London Olympics road race is scheduled for July 28 with
the time trial on Aug. 1. Next year’s Tour de France starts June
30 in Liege, Belgium, and ends in Paris on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
