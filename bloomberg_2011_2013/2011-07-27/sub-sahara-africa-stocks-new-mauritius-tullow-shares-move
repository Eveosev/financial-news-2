percent to 2,031.26 by the 1:30 p.m. close in  Port Louis , the

bourse. Kenya’s All-Share Index snapped five days of declines,

operations in nine African countries, surged 55 cents, or 5
percent, to 11.5 shillings, the highest closing level since July
12. The Nairobi-based company’s net income grew to 2.16 billion
shillings ($23.8 million) in the six months through June, from
1.18 billion shillings a year earlier.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  , the country’s largest
leisure operator by market value, fell 1 rupee, or 1 percent, to
99 rupees, the biggest decline since May 23, on speculation that
the company is suffering from fewer visitors to the Indian
island ocean nation. Tourist arrivals in Mauritius fell 4
percent in May from a year earlier, as the number of visitors
from the country’s main European markets declined, the Tourism
Promotion Authority said on June 28.  “The hotel group is suffering during the low season as
most of its revenue is local, in contrast to its peers who are
suffering locally but whose income is boosted by other Indian
Ocean island operations, mainly Maldives,” Bhavik Desai, a
research analyst at the Port Louis-based Axys Stockbroking Ltd.,
said by phone.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  , the London-based explorer with the
most licenses in Africa, climbed to 31.1 cedis, after listing at
31 cedis, in its first day of trading on the Ghana Stock
Exchange, the first debut on the West African nation’s bourse
since November 2008. Tullow, which also trades in the U.K. and
Ireland, operates Ghana’s Jubilee oil field, West Africa’s
biggest discovery of crude from an offshore field in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
