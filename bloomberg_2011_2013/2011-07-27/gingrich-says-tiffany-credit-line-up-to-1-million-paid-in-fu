Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich ,
seeking the Republican presidential nomination, reported that he
has closed and “paid in full” a line of credit of up to $1
million at Tiffany & Co.  Gingrich, in his financial disclosure report released today
by the  Federal Election Commission , also said he had an  American
Express Co. (AXP)  credit limit of up to $100,000.  The former speaker, 68, reported ownership of Gingrich
Productions Inc., valued at $500,000 to $1 million, and a loan
from Gingrich Group LLC, his consulting firm, to Gingrich
Productions valued at between $5 million and $25 million.  He reported more than $2.5 million in outside income last
year, most of it from Gingrich Productions, a documentary film
and book company owned by Gingrich and his wife, Callista.  Gingrich, who represented part of  Georgia  in the U.S.
House, indicated that he stepped down in May as an officer of a
bevy of corporations known collectively as Newt Inc., including
the Gingrich Group and Gingrich Productions. He also left his
advisory board post at  Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC) ’s Fleishman-Hillard
Inc. subsidiary. He announced his candidacy in May.  He reported campaign debts of about $1 million through June
30, including more than $450,000 owed to an air charter company
and almost $50,000 to himself. More than a dozen campaign aides
resigned in June, citing disagreements with the campaign. Two
top fundraising aides also quit. Gingrich raised $2.1 million
and had $322,222 in the bank.  Presidential candidates are required to file personal
financial disclosure forms with the FEC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
