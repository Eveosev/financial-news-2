Copper fell for the second time this
week after orders for U.S. durable goods unexpectedly dropped,
damping the outlook for metal demand.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years fell
2.1 percent in June, the Commerce Department said today. The
median forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a 0.3 percent increase. The U.S. is the world’s
largest copper user after  China .  “Durable-goods orders are a little bit of a disappointment
for the market,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing some
reluctance on the part of buyers.”  Copper futures for September delivery dropped 3.15 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to close at $4.4465 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest loss for a most-active contract
since July 21.  The metal has dropped 4.5 percent since reaching a record
$4.6575 on Feb. 15 amid weak Chinese demand.  Declines were limited as a strike continued at the world’s
biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida in  Chile . The
company is refusing to negotiate with workers.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid $41, or 0.4 percent, to $9,779 a metric ton ($4.44 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead and zinc also fell in London. Nickel and tin
gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
