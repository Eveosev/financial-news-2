EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said it expects a “sustainable downward trend” in wind energy
costs per unit of output.  Manufacturing overcapacity and competition among sellers of
equipment is leading to “price pressure,” the unit of Lisbon-
based EDP said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
