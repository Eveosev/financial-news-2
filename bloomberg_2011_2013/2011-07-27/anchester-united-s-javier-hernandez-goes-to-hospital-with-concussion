Manchester United striker  Javier
Hernandez  spent last night in the hospital after sustaining a
concussion in practice on the club’s U.S. tour, the Premier
League champion said on its website.  Hernandez was injured yesterday at Red Bull Arena in
Harrison,  New Jersey , as United trained for tonight’s exhibition
against the Major League Soccer All-Stars. The club didn’t say
when he would be released.  Hernandez, 23, scored 20 goals in his first season with
United in 2010-11, helping the club win an English-record 19th
league title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
