Economic growth in Zambia,  Africa ’s
biggest copper producer, will probably stay “robust,” led by
mining, agriculture and tourism, saidCaleb Fundanga, the
governor of the country’s Lusaka-based central bank.  “The medium to long term prospects for Zambia’s economy
are bright,” Fundanga said a copy of a speech e-mailed today.
The government will use money earned from a growing copper
mining industry to invest in infrastructure, such as roads, he
said.  Food prices should remain low after a good corn harvest,
with inflation forecast to stay below 10 percent, Fundanga said.
The southern African nation’s economy will expand 6.8 percent
this year, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
