Wide receiver  Santonio Holmes 
reached agreement on a contract to stay with the  New York Jets ,
according to a person familiar with the negotiations.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed by the person, who was
granted anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the
matter publicly. Teams can’t formally sign free agents until
July 29 and won’t comment on deals until at least that date.
Joel Segal, Holmes’s agent, didn’t immediately return a
voicemail left on his cell phone seeking comment on the
receiver’s contract status.  Holmes, 27, joined the Jets last National Football League
season after catching the winning touchdown pass for the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super Bowl. He had 52 catches for 746
yards and six touchdowns for the Jets in 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
