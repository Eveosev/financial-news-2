Italian 10-year inflation-linked
bonds, yielding close to the most on record, may weaken further
before a sale of the securities today, Barclays Plc said.  “The sector and the auction stock have seen significant
concession on the curve ahead of the tap,” strategists
including Alan James, head of inflation-linked bond research in
 London , wrote yesterday in an investor note. “This seems
necessary amid the current volatility, even if the tap size is
relatively small. More concession may be warranted going into
the auction.”  Italy plans to sell as much as 1 billion euros ($1.5
billion) of 2.1 percent inflation-linked bonds maturing in
September 2021.  The yield on 10-year Italian index-linked bonds rose to
3.94 percent yesterday, after reaching 4.15 percent on July 18,
the most since Bloomberg generic data started tracking the
securities in 2007. The 10-year breakeven rate, derived from the
difference in yield between conventional and inflation bonds,
fell to 1.67 percentage points yesterday, the least since 
December on a closing-market basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
