American Airlines President Tom
Horton said the European Union’s plan to include international
airlines in its emissions-trading system is an “unwise”
proposal, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  The bloc’s plan is “layering more cost” on an industry
“that’s already beleaguered,” Horton said, according to the
FT.  -- Editor: Ben Livesey  To contact the reporter on this story:
