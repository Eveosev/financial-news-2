Nigerian central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said yesterday’s increase in the benchmark
 interest rate  to 8.75 percent aimed to attract more capital into
the country and lift foreign currency reserves.  Nigeria  needs to guard against a drop in the price of oil,
its main export, as the U.S. and European debt crisis deepens,
Sanusi said in an interview today on CNBC Africa television.  “Higher rates will help us attract inflows to reduce
pressure on our foreign reserves,” he said.  Africa’s top oil producer depends on exports of the
commodity for more than 95 percent of foreign exchange income
and more than 80 percent of government revenue, according to the
 Finance Ministry . The 2011 budget of 4.5 trillion naira ($29.5
billion) is based on a crude oil price of $75 a barrel.  “Revenue projections are not being met” and the
government is at risk of a structural deficit, Sanusi said.  Yesterday’s three-quarter-point rate increase was the
fourth this year. The central bank cited higher energy costs
from the planned removal of a fuel subsidy and increased
spending to meet the new minimum wage of 18,000 naira a month.  The central bank of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest
economy has been using foreign-currency reserves to keep the
naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or below 150 per
dollar at its twice-weekly auctions.  Gross foreign currency reserves were $33.36 billion on July
25, compared with $34.21 billion the week earlier and $32.31
billion the month earlier. Reserves peaked at $63 billion in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
