British prosecutors said they are
deciding whether to charge U.K. Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  for
allegedly asking his former wife to take the blame for a
speeding violation.  The  Crown Prosecution Service  in London received a file of
evidence from police in Essex, England, relating to allegations
involving Huhne and Vicky Pryce, the agency said in a statement
today.  Prosecutors will review the file and “a decision on
whether to charge will be made in due course,” the CPS said.  The energy secretary is under investigation over
allegations that he asked Pryce in 2003 to say she’d been
driving his car when it was caught speeding so he wouldn’t lose
his license. He denies the charge.  A spokesperson for Huhne’s office declined to comment.
Huhne left Pryce last year for a former aide, Carina Trimingham.  To contact the reporter for this story:
