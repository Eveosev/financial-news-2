The number of jobseekers in  France 
climbed for a second month in June on signs that growth may be
slowing as the global recovery loses pace.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
climbed by 33,600, or 1.3 percent, from May, the Labor Ministry
said in a statement in Paris today. The total number of
jobseekers was 2.72 million.  The increase wipes out all of the improvement in jobless
claims shown so far this year, highlighting the difficulty
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  faces in generating employment two
years after France emerged from its worst recession in six
decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
