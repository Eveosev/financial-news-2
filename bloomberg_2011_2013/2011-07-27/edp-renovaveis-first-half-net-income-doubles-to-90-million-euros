EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said first-half profit doubled as electricity output increased
and it extended the life of its assets.  Net income climbed to 90 million euros ($130 million) from
43 million euros a year earlier following a 27 percent jump in
output, EDP Renovaveis said today in a statement. Extending the
useful life of operating assets had a net impact of 21 million
euros on second-quarter profit as depreciation charges fell.  EDP Renovaveis is expanding wind projects from  Europe  to
the U.S., tapping government support for alternative-energy
development. Lisbon-based parent company EDP, which bought
Horizon Wind Energy LLC of Texas from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
in 2007, says it’s the world’s third-biggest wind-park operator.  Nations are adding wind-power capacity in a bid to curb
 carbon emissions . China spent the most on low-carbon energy last
year, investing $51.1 billion, according to  Bloomberg New Energy
Finance  data.  “We are growing soundly,” EDP Renovaveis Chief Financial
Officer Rui Teixeira said on a conference call today. The
company doesn’t plan to install wind farms in  Asia , he said.  The EDP unit installed 1.4 gigawatts of capacity in the 12
months through June, taking the total to 7.2 gigawatts. In
November, the company said it’s adjusting planned capacity
additions for 2011 and 2012 to 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts a
year.  EDP Renovaveis has climbed 6.5 percent in Lisbon trading
this year, valuing the company at 4.03 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
