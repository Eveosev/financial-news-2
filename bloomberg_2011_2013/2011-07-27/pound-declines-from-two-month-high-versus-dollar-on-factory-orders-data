The pound erased an advance versus
the dollar after a report showed an index of U.K. manufacturersâ€™
optimism fell to the least in two years.  The British currency was 0.2 percent weaker at $1.6378 as
of 11:22 a.m. in  London , after climbing as much as 0.2 percent
to $1.6439. It pared gains versus the euro to trade 0.2 percent
stronger at 88.31 pence.  The orders gauge declined to minus 10 in July from 1 in
June, the  Confederation of British Industry  said in a report in
London today. A quarterly measure of sentiment fell to minus 16
from 9 in April, while an index of export expectations for the
next three months slid to zero, the weakest in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
