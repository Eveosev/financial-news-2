Zimbabwe  Alloys Ltd. needs at least
$18 million to resume operations at its Gweru-based refinery,
the  Daily News  said, citing Finance Manager Kudawashe Mahobele.  The company’s refinery has had one furnace operating since
September and last exported ferrochrome in February 2009, the
Harare-based Daily News said. Zimbabwe Alloys has 34,000 metric
tons of ore in stock, of which 22,000 tons is already sold and
hasn’t been shipped, the Daily News added. Zim Alloys, sold by
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  in 2005, has re-started two underground
chrome mines after it stopped mining operations in 2008, it
said.  Zimbabwe has 12 percent of the world’s chrome resources,
the newspaper cited Joe Zvaipa, services director at Sinosteel
Corp.’s Zimasco unit. Chrome miners may ask government to set a
minimum price for the mineral because  China , which produces 25
percent of the world’s ferrochrome, is suppressing prices in
Zimbabwe, the News added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
