Ivory Coast , which is recovering
from a violent political crisis, collected 36 percent more taxes
than projected in the period between May 1 and July 25, said
Pascal Kouakou Abinan, director-general of taxes.  Revenue totaled 284 billion CFA francs ($622 million) in
the period, compared with the government’s expected earnings of
208 billion francs, Abinan told reporters in Abidjan, the
commercial capital, yesterday.  The economy of the world’s biggest cocoa producer was
largely halted following a November presidential election that
saw incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refuse to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara . Gbagbo was captured in April and Ouattara took office
in May.  Tax collection is expected to slow 14 percent to 864
billion francs this year, compared with 2010, Abinan said.  Ivory
Coast ’s economy may contract 6.3 percent in 2011 after the
crisis disrupted business activity, it said July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
