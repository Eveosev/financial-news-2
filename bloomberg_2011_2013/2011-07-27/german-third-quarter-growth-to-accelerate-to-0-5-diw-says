German economic growth will
accelerate to 0.5 percent in the third quarter from 0.4 percent
in the previous three-month period, the Berlin-based DIW
economic institute said today in an e-mailed report.  “Because of the positive signs from residential
construction and also parts of the services sector there’s a
chance that growth in the third quarter will be higher than
expected so far,” said DIW economist Simon Junker.  While the “rapid upswing” phase in  Europe ’s biggest
economy is over,  Germany  is enjoying “stable” growth driven
increasingly by domestic demand, Junker said. The DIW left its
second-quarter forecast unchanged from a June 29 release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
