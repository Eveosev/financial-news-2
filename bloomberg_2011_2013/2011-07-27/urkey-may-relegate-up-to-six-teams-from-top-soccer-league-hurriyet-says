The Turkish Football Federation may
relegate five to six teams from the top league, pending the
results of a probe into alleged match-fixing, Hurriyet reported.  The league will start with all 18 teams in competition,
Hurriyet said, citing comments yesterday by TFF Chairman Mehmet
Ali Aydinlar after a summit in Istanbul with club owners. The
federation said it may also relegate six to seven teams from the
lower division depending on the investigation results.  The TFF has authority to promote teams to the top league,
Aydinlar said during the press conference, according to
Hurriyet. Teams that made play offs to compete in the top league
may be moved up, Aydinlar said.  Yildirim Demiroren, chairman of cup-winner Besiktas JK
which is alleged to have participated in match-fixing along with
league champion Fenerbahce SK, criticized the TFF for trying to
resolve the matter within 15 to 20 days and said his club is
ready to wait for the judiciaryâ€™s decision on the investigation.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
