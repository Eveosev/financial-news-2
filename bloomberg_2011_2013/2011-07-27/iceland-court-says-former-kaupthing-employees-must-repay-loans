Reykjanes District Court has ruled
that two former employees of Iceland’s failed Kaupthing Bank Hf
should be held personally liable for loans made to them by the
lender.  Halldor Benjamin Hreinsson, the former director of
analytical banking at Kaupthing, is personally liable for a 6.2
million-krona ($54,000) loan the bank gave him to purchase its
shares, according to the  ruling . The court also said in a
 separate ruling  that Delia Kristin Howser, a former employee in
one of Kaupthing’s branches in Iceland, must repay a 6.6
million-krona loan granted while she worked at the bank.  Kaupthing’s board in a letter dated Sept. 28, 2008, had
sought to revoke personal liability on loans given to a number
of executives in connection with purchasing stock in the bank.
The decision was taken following a drop in the lender’s share
price. Kaupthing collapsed on Oct. 9, 2008, after it was unable
to secure the short-term funding needed to stay afloat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
