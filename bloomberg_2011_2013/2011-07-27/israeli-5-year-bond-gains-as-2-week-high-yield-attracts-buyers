Israel ’s five-year government bonds
advanced on speculation yields near the highest level in two
weeks will attract buyers.  The yield on the 4.25 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due in
August 2016 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 4.5 percent as of 1:09 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The rate reached
4.51 percent yesterday, matching the highest level since July
13. The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.3988 against the
dollar.  “The market is swamped with liquidity after selling in
connection with tax changes for foreign investors and high
levels of fund redemptions so investors are looking for
somewhere to put their money,” Assaf Rosenberg, a trader at
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel
said by telephone. “Still, volumes are low as they don’t see a
lot of value in the government curve.”  Israel on July 7 began taxing foreigners as much as 24
percent on interest income from Makam bills, short-term notes
issued by the  Bank of Israel , in an effort to curb a 12 percent
gain in the shekel over the past year.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bond
due in January 2020 rose one basis point to 5.02 percent, the
highest level since July 13.  Investors withdrew about 6 billion shekels ($1.8 billion)
from so-called traditional funds in June in a switch to safer
assets amid concern about the European debt crisis, Meitav
Investment House Ltd. said on July 3. It was the biggest monthly
drawdown since January 2008, according to Meitav.  To contact the reporter on this story:
