Ervin Santana pitched the third no-
hitter of the Major League Baseball season as the visiting Los
Angeles Angels beat the  Cleveland  Indians 3-1 today at
Progressive Field.  The eighth no-hitter in Angels history follows ones by
Francisco Liriano of the Minnesota Twins against the Chicago
White Sox on May 3 and  Justin Verlander  of the  Detroit Tigers 
against the  Toronto Blue Jays  four days later.  Santana threw 106 pitches in the 2-hour, 22-minute game,
striking out a season-high 10 and walking one. The Indians’ run
came in the first inning, when leadoff hitter
Ezequiel Carrera reached on an error, stole second base and
scored on a wild pitch. It was the first time since 1993 that
the losing team in a no-hitter scored. Houston Astros pitcher
Darryl Kile threw a no-hitter in a 7-1 win over the  New York
Mets  on Sept. 8, 1993.  The Angels scored in the fifth, sixth and ninth innings.
Peter Bourjos had a game-high two hits, with one run scored and
a run batted in.  Santana, 28, made his major-league debut in Cleveland on
May 17, 2005. He is 6-8 this season with a 3.46 earned run
average.
David Huff took the loss for the Indians, allowing one earned
run in 5 2/3 innings.  It’s the 250th no-hitter in major-league history. Before
today, there were 133 in the National League and 116 in the
American League, according to baseball’s  website . Twenty were
perfect games.  Six No-Hitters  There were six no-hitters last season, including one by the
 Philadelphia Phillies ’ Roy Halladay in his first postseason
outing. Halladay also threw one of two perfect games during the
2010 regular season, joining Dallas Braden of the Oakland
Athletics.  It’s the first no-hitter for the Angels since Mark Langston
and Mike Witt combined in a 1-0 win over the Seattle Mariners on
April 11, 1990. The Indians have been no-hit victims 11 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
