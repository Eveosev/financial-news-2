Zimbabwe ’s licensed independent
power producers aren’t filling the gap left by the state-owned
utility because prices are too low, Zimbabwe Electricity
Regulatory Authority spokesman Fullard Gwasira said.  “Our tariff compared to that charged in the region is
really cheap,” Gwasira said in an interview on the sidelines of
a manufacturing industry conference in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.
Currently ZESA is charging 7.53 cents per kilowatt, compared
with a regional average of 12 cents, he said.  Zimbabwe, the southern African nation with the second-
biggest reserves of platinum and chrome, suffers regular power
outages, and rations energy to homes and businesses.  ZESA is owed $450 million by consumers, which is affecting
its operations, Gwasira said. It owes other suppliers $100
million, he said.  Government should lift a ban on private power importers as
ZESA is failing, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries President
Joseph Kanyekanye said in a speech at the conference.  “Industry requested an opportunity to import power
directly,” Kanyekanye said. “This was shot down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
