National Aluminium Co.,  India ’s
third-largest producer, increased its alumina capacity 33
percent to boost exports and tap global demand for the raw
material used to make the lightweight metal.  Capacity at the  Damanjodi  refinery in the eastern state of
Orissa was expanded to 2.1 million metric tons from 1.58 million
tons, Production Director A.K. Sharma said today in a telephone
interview. The additional output will start on Aug. 1 and
stabilize in a month, he said.  Rising incomes and public works in China and India, the
fastest growing major economies, are driving consumption of
aluminum, used in everything from aircraft to beverage cans.
 Japan ,  Asia ’s largest aluminum importer, is placing more orders
as the nation rebuilds from its worst earthquake and tsunami.
Alumina prices have risen 20 percent from start of this year
until May 27, according to Metal Bulletin.  National Aluminium, based in the eastern city of
Bhubaneswar, exported 702,554 metric tons of alumina in the year
ended March 31. Shipments fell in the last two years as the
company used more alumina to feed a 40 percent increase in
smelter capacity. Bauxite is turned into alumina that in turn is
refined into aluminum.  National Aluminium shares fell 1 percent to 78.15 rupees at
the close of trading in Mumbai. The stock has declined 20
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent drop in the
benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
