China ’s inflation may slow to 4
percent or less by year-end from 6.4 percent in June, said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC Holdings Plc.  Monetary policy may shift from “tight” to “more
neutral” after September, Qu said at a briefing in  Hong Kong 
today.  Policy makers are seeking to sustain growth while cooling
the nation’s fastest inflation since 2008. The central bank
raised benchmark interest rates this month for the fifth time
since mid-October.  To contact the reporter for this story:
