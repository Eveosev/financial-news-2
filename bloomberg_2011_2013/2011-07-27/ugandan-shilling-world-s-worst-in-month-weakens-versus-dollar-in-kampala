Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency over the past month against the
dollar, erased yesterday’s gains.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
weakened 0.2 percent to 2,600 shillings per dollar at 2.36 p.m.
local time in capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It closed at 2,595 shillings a dollar yesterday.  “This week we have really been trading in a narrow
range,” Denis Mushabe, a currency trader at Standard Chartered
Bank Plc’s Ugandan unit, said by phone from Kampala.  The shilling has depreciated 11 percent against the dollar
this year, the world’s third-worst performer after Suriname’s
dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa, as a surge in food and fuel prices
pushed inflation to a 17-year high. The currency has weakened 4
percent over the past month, the most worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
