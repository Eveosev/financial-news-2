Indonesia ’s rupiah rose to the
strongest level in seven years as overseas investors boosted
holdings of local assets amid accelerating economic growth.
Benchmark bonds advanced.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  climbed to a record after
exchange data showed global funds bought $525 million more
shares than they sold this month. Indonesia has a “more than 50
percent chance” of winning a sovereign upgrade in the next 12
months to 18 months,  Fitch Ratings  said on July 19. The Dollar
Index dropped to a two-month low as U.S. lawmakers try to come
up with a plan to increase the debt ceiling and avoid a default.  “Capital inflows into Indonesia will be supported by
positive sentiment including a rating upgrade this year or early
next year,” said Ho Woei Chen, a Singapore-based economist at
United Overseas Bank Ltd. “It is broad dollar weakness that’s
driving Asian currencies.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.4 percent to 8,478 per dollar as
of 4:43 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,476 earlier, the highest level since March 2004.  Fitch rates Indonesia BB+, while  Standard & Poor’s  boosted
its rating in April to BB+ from BB, both one step below
investment grade. The economy expanded 6.1 percent last year,
the fastest pace since 2008.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
currencies of six major trading partners, reached 73.421, its
lowest level since May 5.  President  Barack Obama ’s Office of Management and Budget
said it “strongly opposes” House Speaker John Boehner’s two-
step plan to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and cut $3
trillion in expenditure, on which the Republican-controlled
House is set to vote today before an Aug. 2 deadline.  Overseas ownership  of Indonesian government bonds rose 25
percent to 243.93 trillion rupiah ($28.8 billion) this  year 
through July 22, according to the debt management office.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose for a second day. The yield
on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell 14 basis points to
7.08 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
