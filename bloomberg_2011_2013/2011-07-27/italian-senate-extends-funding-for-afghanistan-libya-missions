The Italian Senate voted to extend
funding for foreign military missions, supporting forces in
Iraq,  Afghanistan , Lebanon and a NATO-led effort in Libya.  The vote came a day after an Italian paratrooper was killed
in Afghanistan, the 41st Italian soldier to die while serving
there. Legislators held a minute of silence before debating the
measure and casting the ballot for another six-month extension.  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Northern League allies
voted to back the extension, signaling support for the premier
amid tension within the ruling coalition. The League has been
critical of the peacekeeping missions and called for troops to
be brought home. The opposition  Democratic Party  also approved
the measure.  Italy’s 9,250 troops currently serving abroad will be
reduced to 7,222, newspaper  Corriere della Sera  reported
yesterday. Today’s vote, which must be followed by backing in
the lower house Chamber of Deputies, approved 694 million euros
($1 billion) in funding for the missions, down from 911 million
euros in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
