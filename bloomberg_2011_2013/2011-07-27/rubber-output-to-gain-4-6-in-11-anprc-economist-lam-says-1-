Total rubber output from members of
the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries may expand
4.6 percent to 9.9 million metric tons in 2011, according to Lam
Soon Jin, an economist at the group.  The total rubber-yielding area in the group may expand by
141,000 hectares to 7.13 million hectares this year, Lam told a
conference in Kuala Lumpur today. The association’s members
represent about 92 percent of global supply.  The latest production forecast is lower than an estimate
given last month, when the group said output from member
countries may climb 5.2 percent to 9.96 million metric tons this
year. The association said on June 28 that natural-rubber output
in key growing countries may expand in May as  Indonesia , the
second-largest producer, boosts supplies.  Yields from Indonesia are on the “low side,” Lam said
today. “We see there is huge potential for them to improve on
their yields” once they replant with higher-yielding clones,
she said.  Rising supplies may accelerate a slump in futures from a
record 535.7 yen a kilogram ($6,624) reached on Feb. 18 and
reduce costs for companies such as Bridgestone Corp., Michelin &
Cie. and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the top three tire makers.  Members’ natural-rubber output is estimated to grow to 10.4
million tons in 2012, 12.25 million tons in 2015 and 13.4
million tons in 2018, Lam told the conference. The group is
expected to release its monthly report tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
