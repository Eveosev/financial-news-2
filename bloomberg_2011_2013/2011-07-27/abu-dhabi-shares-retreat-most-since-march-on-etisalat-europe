Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark index fell the
most in almost five months as Emirates Telecommunications Corp.
declined amid concern its smaller rival is increasing market
share and European stocks retreated.  Etisalat, as Emirates Telecommunications Corp. is known,
dropped to the lowest level in almost two months. Construction-
supplies maker  Arkan Building Materials Co. (ARKAN)  lost for the third
time in four days. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 1.2
percent, the most since March 2, to 2,641.41 at the 2:00 p.m.
close in the emirate. The measure has dropped 2.3 percent this
month. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) , which tracks the biggest 200
companies in the Persian Gulf region, declined 0.5 percent at
2:11 p.m. in Riyadh.  The shares of Etisalat have tumbled 6.8 percent since it
said July 18 that second-quarter profit declined 15 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates. The United Arab Emirates’ second
phone company,  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. (DU) , or
Du, is forecast to report a 54 percent jump in second-quarter
profit next month, according to the mean estimate of three
analysts on Bloomberg. Du has fallen 0.3 percent since
Etisalat’s earnings.  “Du is picking up a lot of market share,” said Dubai-
based Haissam Arabi, chief executive officer at Gulfmena
Alternative Investments. Etisalat’s second-quarter “earnings
weren’t spectacular.”  Debt Ceiling  European stocks fell for a third day with the Stoxx  Europe 
600 Index declining 0.5 percent. The gauge has retreated 7.7
percent from this year’s high in February amid concern that
Europe’s fiscal crisis will derail the economic recovery and
speculation that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on increasing
the nation’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline.  Etisalat, which has the biggest weighting on Abu Dhabi’s
benchmark index, fell 1 percent to 10.30 dirhams, the lowest
level since May 31. Without adjusting for a 25-fils cash
dividend, the shares lost 3.3 percent. Du retreated 0.3 percent
to 3.16 dirhams.  Arkan Building declined 3.1 percent to 1.24 dirhams. Each
dirham has 100 fils.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX)  and Qatar’s gauge dropped 0.3 percent. Kuwait’s measure
and Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  retreated 0.4 percent, while Bahrain’s
gauge rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
