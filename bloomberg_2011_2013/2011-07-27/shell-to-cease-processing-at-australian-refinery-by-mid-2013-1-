Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, will halt refining operations at its Clyde
plant in Sydney before mid-2013 and convert the facility into a
fuel-import terminal.  The refinery, which processes about 79,000 barrels a day,
is no longer regionally competitive against Asian “mega-
refineries,” the Hague-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The plan was first mooted in April.  Shell intends to reduce global refining and marketing costs
by $1 billion by the end of next year as it seeks to accelerate
production growth through 2014, it said in March. The company,
which also operates a second refinery at Geelong in Victoria
state, acquired Clyde in 1928. The Clyde plant supplies about 40
percent of Sydney’s petroleum needs.  “The decision to convert Clyde into a terminal is
consistent with Shell’s strategy to focus its refining portfolio
on larger assets and to build a profitable downstream business
here in  Australia ,”  Andrew Smith , vice president of the
company’s Australian downstream unit, said in the statement.  The plan to end oil refining wasn’t prompted by Australia’s
proposed tax on carbon emissions, Shell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
