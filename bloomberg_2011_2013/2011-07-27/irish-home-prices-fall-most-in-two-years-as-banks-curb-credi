Irish  home prices  fell 2.1 percent
in June from the previous month, the biggest decline in two
years, as debt-laden banks restricted new lending.  The June decline is the biggest since May 2009, when prices
also declined 2.1 percent, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork
said on its website. Values dropped 12.9 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 12.2 percent in May.  “At the moment banks are more interested in bolstering
their balance sheets and raising capital, selling assets than
expanding their mortgage book,” said Alan McQuaid, chief
economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin. “We’re bobbing
along at the bottom.”  Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said yesterday the
government will inject about 17.5 billion euros ($25.3 billion)
more into the country’s lenders this month to restore investor
confidence after the collapse of the country’s property bubble
in 2008. The average price for houses nationwide fell at its
fastest pace in 18 months in the second three months of 2011,
property website  Daft.ie  said this month.  The average asking price nationwide fell below 200,000
euros in June 2011, compared with 366,000 euros in mid-2007,
according to a statement by Daft.ie. The government obtained a
court order yesterday to seize control of Irish Life & Permanent
Plc, the fifth lender to fall under the aegis of the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
