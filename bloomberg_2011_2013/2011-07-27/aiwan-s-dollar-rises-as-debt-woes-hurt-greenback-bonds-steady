Taiwan ’s dollar advanced for a
second day as the failure of Republicans and Democrats to agree
on a plan to tackle  U.S. debt  unsettled global financial markets
and weighed on the greenback.  President  Barack Obama ’s Office of Management and Budget
said it “strongly opposes” House Speaker John Boehner’s two-
step plan to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and cut $3
trillion in expenditure, on which the Republican-controlled
House is set to vote on tomorrow. The Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback versus the currencies of six major trading
partners, touched a 12-week low today.  “There’s appreciation pressure on the  Taiwan dollar  given
the greenback is so weak because of the debt-ceiling problem,”
said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at
the Union Bank of Taiwan. “Trading volume is thin as everyone’s
waiting to see if there’s any progress made today in the U.S.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$28.802
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. Tong forecast the currency could
surpass the NT$28.70 level by the end of the week.  Taiwanese bonds were little changed before the government
sells NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 20-year bonds tomorrow. The
yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 was 1.191 percent,
compared with 1.195 percent yesterday, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show. The rate reached 1.22 percent on July 22,
the highest level for a benchmark five-year security since
January 2009.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.383 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
