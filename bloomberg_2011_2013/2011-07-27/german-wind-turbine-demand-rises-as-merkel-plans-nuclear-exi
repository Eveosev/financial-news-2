Demand for  wind turbines  in Germany
increased in the first half of the year after the government
decided to phase out the nuclear plants which provide 23 percent
of the country’s generating capacity.  The country will add 1,800 megawatts of new turbines this
year, up from 1,551 megawatts in 2010, the industry lobby group
 BWE German Wind Energy Association  said today in a statement,
citing rising installations in the first six months of the year.  “The domestic market is gradually gathering steam again,”
Hermann Albers, the head of the BWE, said in the statement.  The increase may boost profit at German turbine makers
including  Nordex SE (NDX1) ,  Siemens AG (SIE)  and Enercon GmbH that saw the
fallout from the financial crisis cut their total revenues by 5
percent to 4.97 billion euros ($7.14 billion) in 2010, the group
said. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said last month she will
replace the country’s 17 nuclear reactors with a combination of
renewable-energy sources and fossil-fuel-based power plants.  The government has raised subsidies for offshore wind farms
as part of a plan to install 10,000 megawatts of sea-based
turbines by the end of this decade, up from about 210 megawatts
now. About 2,000 megawatts of offshore projects with a total
value of at least 6 billion euros have been “contractually
secured,” said Thorsten Herdan, president of VDMA Power
Systems, the trade group for German machinery makers.  Albers said demand may be particularly strong in southern
Germany, where the governments of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria
have vowed to push turbine installations following the country’s
decision to exit from nuclear energy by 2022.  Merkel shut down eight of the country’s reactors in March
after the accident at the Fukushima reactor in  Japan  stoked
safety concerns in  Europe ’s largest power market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
