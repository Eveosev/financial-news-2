Sytrol,  Syria ’s state-run oil
company, will increase daily exports of its Souedie crude for
loading in August by 44 percent from July, according to a
shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  The program for Souedie, also known as Syrian Heavy,
comprises seven 80,000-metric-ton cargoes for shipment from its
Mediterranean port of Tartous. That’s equivalent to 125,006
barrels a day, compared with 87,058 barrels a day in July.  The loading program for Syrian Light is not available.  Souedie has a density of 24.1 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 3.9 percent,
according to Energy Intelligence Group. The conversion factor
from a ton to a barrel is 6.92.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
