Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a four-month low as traders bet President-elect
Ollanta Humala will defend economic policies fueling growth.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 149 at 1:47 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Humala named as finance minister July 21 Miguel Castilla,
who served as outgoing President  Alan Garcia ’s deputy finance
minister, and tapped central bank President Julio Velarde to
remain in his post. Banks including BNP Paribas expected Humala,
who takes office tomorrow, would likely pick his finance
minister and central bank chief from officials closer to his
party.  “The appointments were much better than expected,” said
Daniel Carabajal, a research associate at RBC Capital Markets
Inc in Toronto. “They’ve been accepted by the market, which was
very nervous, and set a positive tone for Humala’s next steps.”  Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in dollars rose to a 14-
month high of 2.31 percentage points above Treasuries on April
27 after Humala won the first round of balloting in the nation’s
presidential elections, leading investors to bet the former army
rebel would shun economic policies fueling the region’s fastest
growth.  The Peruvian sol was unchanged at 2.7365 per  U.S. dollar .  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 declined one basis point to 6.22 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
