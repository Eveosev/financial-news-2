Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  is
evaluating the resumption of production at its No. 1 naphtha
cracker, as its No. 3 plant is scheduled for an annual
maintenance from the middle of next month.  “We are still evaluating and there is no timetable for
reopening,” Lin Keh-yen, a company spokesman at Formosa
Petrochemical Corp., said by phone today.  The No. 1 plant has halted production since May 12 after a
fire at a pipe in the Mailiao complex, he said. The unit has an
annual capacity of 700,000 metric tons of ethylene.  The company’s No. 3 plant has been scheduled to halt from
the middle of August for maintenance, which will last 40 to 45
days, Lin said. “The maintenance plan was decided earlier, it
has nothing to do with the fire yesterday,” he said.  The response came after the Taipei-based Economic Daily
News reported that a fire yesterday at the Mailiao complex,
owned by the Formosa Plastics Group, could affect both plants
and cause a daily operating loss of NT$400 million ($13.9
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
