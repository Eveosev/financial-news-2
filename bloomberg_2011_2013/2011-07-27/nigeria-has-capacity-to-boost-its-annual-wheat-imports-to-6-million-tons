Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous
nation, has the milling capacity to boost its wheat imports to
more than 6 million metric tons a year as Africa’s largest
population eats more of the staple food.  “Grain consumption per head in Nigeria is currently about
25 kilograms per person per year” and demand is increasing
steadily because of population growth,’’ Rotimi Fashola, a
consultant at the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture and Co-
operatives, told the Rice Africa Outlook conference in Durban,
 South Africa , today. “We have milling capacity for more than 6
million metric tons a year.”  Nigeria currently imports more than 3.6 million tons of
wheat per year, he said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
forecasts that Nigeria will import 4.1 million tons of wheat in
the year ending June 30, 2012. Most of Nigeria’s wheat comes
from the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
