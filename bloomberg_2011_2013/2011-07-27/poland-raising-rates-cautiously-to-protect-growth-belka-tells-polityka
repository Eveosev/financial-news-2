Poland ’s central bank is increasing
interest rates “very cautiously” to avoid choking off economic
growth, Governor  Marek Belka  said in an interview with the
weekly magazine  Polityka .  The Narodowy Bank Polski on July 6 left the seven-day
 interest rate  unchanged at 4.5 percent, the highest since 2008,
after raising it by 1 percentage point this year to slow
inflation that peaked at twice the targeted 2.5 percent. The
central bank also lowered its forecast for 2012 economic growth
to 3.2 percent from 3.6 percent.  “Inflation isn’t punishment for our sins,” Belka told
Polityka. “It’s mainly the result of rising global prices for
crude oil and food. The Americans are printing money like
crazy.”  Belka also said that Poland, which has no deadline for euro
adoption, has time to decide on the timing of the conversion.  “First, we have to meet the criteria,” he said. “And
second, the euro area has to meet our increasingly tough
requirements.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
