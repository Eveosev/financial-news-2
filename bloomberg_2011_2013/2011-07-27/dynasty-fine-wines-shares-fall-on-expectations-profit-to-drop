Dynasty Fine Wines Group Ltd. (828)  fell
as much as 14 percent, heading for a record decline, in  Hong
Kong  trading after saying first-half profit may be
“considerably lower” than a year earlier.  The Tianjin, China-based winemaker, partly owned by
France’s  Remy Cointreau SA (REMYF) , dropped 14 percent to HK$2.16 as of
11:54 a.m. on the city’s stock exchange. The stock looked set to
end trading with the biggest loss since it listed in January
2005.  Net income will decline because of lower sales in
Zhejiang, Huadong, which is Dynasty’s “strongest” market in
the country, as the company reorganizes distribution, it said in
a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. The
winemaker is talking to distributors about strengthening control
on retail prices, it said.  “It won’t be easy for Dynasty to change its distribution
model because wine distributors in  China  have enormous
negotiating power,” Jason Yuan, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian
Investment Co., said by phone today. “I don’t think they can
succeed.”  Gross profit margin in the first half of the year was also
reduced by higher costs of raw materials and manufacturing, a
new city construction tax and an education surcharge on its
units in China, Dynasty Fine Wines said in the statement.  Remy Cointreau manufactures Remy Martin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
