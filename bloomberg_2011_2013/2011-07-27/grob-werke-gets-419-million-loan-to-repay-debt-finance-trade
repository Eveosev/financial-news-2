Grob-Werke GmbH & Co KG, a German
manufacturer of metal cutting machine tools, obtained 290
million euros ($419 million) of loans to refinance debt and
issue letters of credit.  The five-year facility includes a 100 million-euro
revolving credit, a 50 million-euro term loan and a 140 million-
euro guarantee facility, according to an e-mailed statement from
coordinator  UniCredit SpA. (UCG)   The proceeds will be used to refinance an existing
facility, the Mindelheim-based company said, as well as issue
letters of credit, which are typically used to ensure payments
in international trade finance.  UniCredit was joined in syndication by 10 banks, including
Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
