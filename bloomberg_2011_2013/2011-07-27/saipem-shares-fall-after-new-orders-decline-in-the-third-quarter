Saipem SpA (SPM) ,  Europe ’s largest
oilfield services contractor, fell in Milan trading after new
orders fell 29 percent in the second quarter even as the company
reported an increase in profit for the period.  Saipem was awarded new contracts worth 3.1 billion euros
($4.5 billion) in the quarter, compared with 4.4 billion euros
in the same period a year earlier. Net income rose 14 percent to
225 million euros, helped by the company’s onshore and offshore
engineering and construction business.  “The orders number is not so bad in context, it’s in line
with expectations,” said Alessandro Frigerio a  fund manager  at
RMJ Sgr in Milan. “It’s just that nothing new that could push
the price higher emerged, so many investors have probably
decided to cash in at what they think is a good price.”  The shares dropped 4.1 percent to 36.17 euros as of 2:55
p.m. in Milan, the sharpest decline in two weeks. The stock has
fallen 1.6 percent this year.  New orders will allow Saipem to reach a target of
increasing 2011 profit and revenue by 8 percent. In July, the
company said it was awarded new orders worth 800 million euros,
mainly related to its engineering and construction activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
