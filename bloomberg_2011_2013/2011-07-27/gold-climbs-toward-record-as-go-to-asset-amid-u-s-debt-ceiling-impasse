Gold futures rose to a record
$1,631.20 an ounce as the impasse on the  U.S. debt  ceiling
boosted demand for the precious metal as a haven.  The cost of insuring U.S. debt rose to a 17-month high, and
the dollar fell to a record against the Swiss franc as
congressional leaders offered competing budget plans. Moody’s
Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have said
they will cut the U.S.’s top-level credit rating should a
failure to raise the debt ceiling lead to a default.  “ Government securities , the traditional area of safety,
are now at risk, so that’s why you’re seeing gold grind
higher,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The
level of U.S. government borrowing has caused the erosion of the
dollar and adds more fuel to the metal’s rally.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.90, or 0.5
percent, to $1,628 at 10:33 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . In
July, the price has climbed 8.3 percent, heading for the biggest
gain since November 2009.  Holdings of gold in exchange-traded products rose 0.3
percent to a record 2,128.229 metric tons yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 57.7 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $41.275 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery gained $8.80, or 0.5
percent, to $1,816 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for September delivery climbed $8.35, or 1
percent, to $844.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
