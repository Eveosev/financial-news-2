Cyprus’s long-term government bond
ratings were downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service to Baa1
from A2, with a negative outlook.  Moody’s cited concerns about Cyrpus’ government finances,
exacerbated by the destruction of a power station this month, a
“fractious political climate,” and the risk that some banks
will need state support because of their exposure to  Greece .  “Although the government has recently announced a range of
structural measures intended to improve fiscal sustainability,
the positive impact of those measures for the next few years
will be reduced by the plant’s destruction,” Moody’s said in an
e-mailed statement today. “In view of the regular power outages
caused by the destruction of this plant, Moody’s has reduced its
forecasts for Cyprus’s economic growth to 0 percent in 2011 and
1 percent in 2012.”  The yield on Cyprus’ 6 percent bond maturing in June 2021
rose 13 basis points to 10.06 percent as of 9:06 a.m. in London.  Cyprus has been suffering electricity shortages since the
July 11 explosion at a munitions depot on the east Mediterranean
island’s southern coast, which killed 13 people, knocked out the
nearby 767-megawatt Vasilikos power station. The plant supplied
about half of the country’s power generation capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
