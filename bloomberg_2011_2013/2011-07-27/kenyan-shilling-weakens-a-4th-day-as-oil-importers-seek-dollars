Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
fourth day as oil importers bought more dollars, anticipating
greater demand as power outages drive businesses to rely on fuel
for powering operations.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 0.2 percent to 90.60 per dollar and traded less than 0.1
percent lower at 90.39 at 12:23 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling has weakened on demand by oil importers on
anticipation of increased use of diesel by businesses for their
operation following the planned power cuts which start today,”
Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp.,
said in a phone interview today.  Kenya Power Ltd., the nation’s sole electricity
distributor, said it will begin scheduled outages from July 27
amid a shortage caused by a lack of infrastructure and machine
breakdowns.  The Central Bank of Kenya will raise its key lending rate
25 basis points to 6.50 percent, according to the median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Inflation in
Kenya accelerated for the eighth consecutive month in June,
reaching 14.5 percent, almost three times the government’s 5
percent target.  The decision will be announced in the afternoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
