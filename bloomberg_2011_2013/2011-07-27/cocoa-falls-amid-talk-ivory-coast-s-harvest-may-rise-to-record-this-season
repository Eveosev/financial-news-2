Sugar gained for the second straight
day as output in  Brazil , the world’s biggest exporter and
producer, may fall because of adverse weather. Coffee declined,
while cocoa advanced.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s main
producing region, may decline 7.5 percent from a year earlier
because of dry weather and a frost earlier this month,  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at New York-based commodity
broker Newedge, said today in a telephone interview. Futures in
New York are heading for a third straight monthly advance.  “The sugar content has been lower than expectations and
that is a cause of concern,” Ricardo Scaff, a trader at
Rabobank International in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “Many analysts are revising their estimate downwards
for the Center South crop.”  Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.19 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at 31.13 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The commodity has climbed 69 percent
in the past year.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery retreated
3.75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.412 a pound in New York, the
biggest decline since July 19.  Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $21, or 0.7
percent, to $3,036 a metric ton on ICE.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , refined sugar and robusta coffee
dropped, while cocoa advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
