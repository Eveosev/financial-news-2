Cotton rose, capping the biggest
two-day rally since March, on signs that persistent drought will
slash production in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.
Orange-juice futures fell.  About 41 percent of cotton crops as of July 24 were in very
poor or poor  condition , compared with 8 percent a year earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. In  Texas , the largest
grower, 59 percent got the lowest rankings. On July 12, the USDA
cut its forecast of domestic production more than analysts
expected to 16 million bales from 17 million in June. A bale
weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Unusually hot, dry weather across the southern U.S. “could
possibly be devastating” to a crop that may tumble below 15
million bales, Louis Barbera, a broker with VIP Commodities in
New York, said by telephone.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 2.85 cents, or 2.8
percent, to settle at $1.0361 a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price surged 7.1 percent since
July 25, the biggest two-day rally since March 18. The fiber, up
35 percent in the past year, reached a record $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 0.1 cent
to settle at $1.9875 a pound on ICE. The commodity has gained 35
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
