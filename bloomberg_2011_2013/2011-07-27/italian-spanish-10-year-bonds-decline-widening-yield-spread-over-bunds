(Corrects headline to show yield spread to bunds widened.)  Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds
opened lower, increasing the additional yield investors demand
to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on 10-year Italian securities rose five basis
points to 5.68 percent as of 7:41 a.m. in  London . That pushed
the difference in yield, or spread, to 10-year German bonds
eight basis points wider to 297 basis points. The yield on
Italian two-year notes rose nine basis points to 4.14 percent.  Spain â€™s 10-year bond yield was one basis point higher at
5.97 percent, 326 basis points more than the equivalent-maturity
German securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
