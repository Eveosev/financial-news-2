China ’s yuan touched a 17-year high
as Democrats and Republicans continued to argue over competing
plans to cut the U.S. deficit, unsettling global financial
markets and weighing on the dollar.  The central bank set the daily fixing 0.07 percent stronger
at 6.4426 per dollar, the highest level since July 2005. The
Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the currencies
of six trade partners, was steady after dropping 1 percent in
the previous two days. U.S. lawmakers must agree on a plan to
tackle debt and raise the borrowing ceiling before an Aug. 2
deadline or go into default.  China’s economy  grew 9.5 percent in
the second quarter from a year ago, data this month showed.  “Economic growth is still intact and that’s positive for
the yuan,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “The stronger  reference rate  also
reflects the continued weakness of the dollar.”  The yuan closed at 6.4433 per dollar, little changed from
6.4414 yesterday in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.4375 earlier, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  In the offshore market in Hong Kong, the yuan rose 0.05
percent to 6.4360. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped
0.04 percent to 6.3718, a 1.1 percent premium to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China should accelerate the pace of yuan appreciation,
 Nouriel Roubini , the co-founder and chairman of New York-based
Roubini Global Economics LLC, said in Shanghai yesterday.  Faster gains would help China control inflation, give it
some degree of monetary independence and increase the nation’s
purchasing power to help the economy shift from a dependence on
exports to domestic demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
