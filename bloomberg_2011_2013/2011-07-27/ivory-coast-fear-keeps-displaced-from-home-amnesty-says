A “climate of fear” of security
officials in  Ivory Coast  has kept tens of thousands of displaced
residents from returning home, more than three months after the
end of a post-election crisis, according to  Amnesty
International .  In the west of the country, troops loyal to President
 Alassane Ouattara  and groups of traditional hunters known as
Dozos committed ethnically targeted attacks against civilians,
even after the May 21 inauguration of Ouattara, U.K.-based
Amnesty said in report today.  “The authorities must act to establish a clear chain of
command and disband militia groups who, despite the end of the
conflict, continue to spread fear among the population,” Gaetan
Mootoo, Amnesty’s West Africa researcher, said in an e-mail
accompanying the report.  Residents in the west of the country and in the commercial
capital of Abidjan fled their homes during a violent conflict
triggered by the refusal of former leader  Laurent Gbagbo  to
acknowledge defeat in a November election.  The crisis eased when Gbagbo was captured by Ouattara’s
troops on April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
