Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN) , the focus of a
$3.31 billion takeover bid by  International Paper Co. (IP) , said it
received a second request from U.S. antitrust regulators for
more information related to the proposed deal.  The request today from the U.S.  Justice Department  was for
“additional information and documentary material and a civil
investigative demand,” Austin, Texas-based Temple-Inland said in
a regulatory filing.  Buying Temple-Inland would increase International Paper’s
share of the North American corrugated-packaging market to about
37 percent from about 27 percent, International Paper Chief
Executive Officer John Faraci said in an interview on June 6. It
would also enable cost cuts in International Paper’s corrugated-
packaging business and increase the company’s earnings in the
first year, he said.  Temple-Inland said on July 18 its board of directors voted
unanimously to reject the offer. Earlier this month,
International Paper took its buyout bid directly to Temple-
Inland shareholders in a tender offer that expires Aug. 9.  Temple-Inland fell 31 cents, or 1 percent, to $30.41 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have risen 43 percent this year.  International Paper fell 78 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$29.87 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
