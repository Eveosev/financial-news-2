A toddler and three other children
were among at least 13 people killed as Syrian security forces
raided homes in the village of Kanakir near the capital
Damascus, Al Jazeera television reported today.  Two of the children were about 10 years old and the toddler
was about 3, the Doha-based news network said, citing a village
resident. Kanakir was one of the sites of protests demanding the
ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
