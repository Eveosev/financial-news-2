Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Brazil’s biggest card-
payment processor by market value, said second-quarter profit
fell 7.5 percent because of lower fees and a slowdown in retail
sales in  Latin America ’s largest economy.  Net income fell to 423.6 million reais ($275.2 million)
from 457.7 million reais a year earlier, the Barueri, Brazil-
based company said in a regulatory filing yesterday evening. The
average estimate for profit excluding some items was 421.1
million reais, according to a Bloomberg survey of eight
analysts. Adjusted net sales rose 6.7 percent to 1.12 billion
reais.  Net fees Cielo charges retailers to process credit cards,
known as the merchant discount rate, or MDR, have fallen since a
July 2010 ruling removed exclusive rights for companies to
process certain transactions, increasing competition, said
Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Victor Schabbel in a July 22
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. Retail sales growth slowed
in  Brazil  to 6.2 percent in May from a year earlier, compared
with a 10 percent expansion the previous year.  “Sound volume growth offset once again net MDR
compression,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts including
Jorg Friedemann wrote in a note today. “In the current scenario
of  risk aversion ,” buying the company’s shares “would be a
defensive play in domestic consumption, given their strong cash
flow generation and high dividend yield.”  Net Fees  The value of credit-and debit-card transactions rose 21.2
percent to 74.62 billion reais in the quarter. Redecard SA is
the country’s second-biggest card-payment processor.  Cielo expects net fees for credit-card transactions to fall
by as much as 7 basis points to 112 to 116 basis points in the
second half of the year, from 119 basis points in the first
half. The company expects net fees from debit-card payments to
fall to 70 to 73 basis points from 75 basis points, according to
a presentation on its website.  Cielo fell as much as 3.3 percent today, the most in more
than five weeks on an intraday basis. The stock closed down 2.9
percent in  Sao Paulo  at 41.15 reais in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
