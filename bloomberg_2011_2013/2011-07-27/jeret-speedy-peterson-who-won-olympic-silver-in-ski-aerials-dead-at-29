Jeret “Speedy” Peterson, the
silver medalist for the U.S. in freestyle aerial skiing at the
2010 Vancouver Olympics, died of what Utah police said appeared
to be a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  Peterson, 29, called police on the evening of July 25 to
give his location and say he was going to kill himself, Lt.
Justin Hoyal of the Unified Police of Greater Salt Lake said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Police later found his body
next to his car about 15 miles outside  Salt Lake City .  “Jeret ‘Speedy’ Peterson was a great champion who will be
missed and remembered as a positive, innovative force on not
only his sport of freestyle aerials, but on the entire U.S.
Freestyle Ski Team family and everyone he touched,” Bill Marolt, chief executive officer of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Association, said in a statement.  Peterson had problems with alcohol and depression, the
 Associated Press  reported. As a child, he was sexually abused
and lost his 5-year-old sister to a drunken driver, AP said.  “The personal challenges Speedy has battled are familiar
to all of us, and on behalf of the U.S. Olympic Committee, I’d
like to offer my sympathy to Speedy’s family and friends,” U.S.
Olympic Committee Chief Executive Officer Scott Blackmun said in
a statement. “Today is a sad day.”  Peterson was arrested July 22 in Hailey,  Idaho , for driving
under the influence and pleaded not guilty, AP said.  Peterson, who started skiing at the age of 7, placed
seventh in the 2006 Turin Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
