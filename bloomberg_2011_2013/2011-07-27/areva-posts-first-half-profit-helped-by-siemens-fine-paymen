Areva SA, the biggest supplier of
nuclear fuel and services, returned to an operating profit in
the first half as Siemens AG paid it a penalty for breaching an
agreement.  The 710 million-euro ($1 billion) profit followed a 648
million-euro payment from Siemens, and compares with an
operating loss of 485 million euros a year earlier, when Areva
booked charges on a nuclear plant project in  Finland  and on
uranium mines in  Africa , the company said in a statement. Sales
declined because of the disaster at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant in Japan.  Areva’s backlog fell by 1.1 billion euros in the first half
to 43.1 billion euros as Japanese and German customers cancelled
191 million euros of orders, the Paris-based company said.
German and Japanese companies account for 17.5 percent of
Areva’s backlog, and some 700 million euros of these orders may
be cancelled or renegotiated, the company said.  Luc Oursel, who took over from  Anne Lauvergeon  as chief
executive officer last month, plans to outline his strategy in
coming months as demand for reactors, fuel and services may slow
following the nuclear disaster in  Japan  in March. Germany and
 Switzerland  have already decided to progressively close plants,
and public opposition to nuclear energy is mounting in other
nations such as Japan.  Net income fell to 351 million euros in the first half from
843 million euros a year earlier, after Areva booked a capital
gain on the sale of its power-grid unit in June 2010. Revenue
fell 9.2 percent in the second quarter to 2.02 billion euros,
reflecting falling sales to Japanese power companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
