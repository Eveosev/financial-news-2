OAO Polymetal, a Russian gold and
silver miner, advanced for a third day as gold climbed to a
record and silver prices advanced.  The stock jumped 1.8 percent to 586.9 rubles by 12:40 a.m.
in Moscow.  Gold surged to an all-time high as investors sought to
protect their wealth against the possibility of a U.S. default
that may come as soon as next week amid a standoff over the
countryâ€™s $14.3 trillion debt limit. Silver rose to the highest
since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
