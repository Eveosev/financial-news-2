The  Icelandic Air Line Pilots’
Association  has approved a new agreement with Icelandair Group
hf, averting further job action, according to a statement on the
union’s Web Site.  Of the union’s 281 members, 183 pilots approved the pact,
while 41 rejected it. Turnout was 82 percent, according to the
statement.  Icelandair canceled about 20 flights in June after pilots
stopped working overtime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
