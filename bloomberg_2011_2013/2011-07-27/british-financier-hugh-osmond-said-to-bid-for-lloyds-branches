Hugh Osmond, the British
entrepreneur who founded U.K. restaurant chain Pizza Express,
may bid for 632 branches being sold by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The financier, who is a partner of Sun Capital Partners
Ltd., a group of individual entrepreneurs who jointly acquire
assets, is among the three bidders for the outlets, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, may narrow
the number of bidders in coming weeks, the person said. A
spokeswoman for London-based Lloyds and officials at Sun Capital
declined to comment.  NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK) , run by Peter Levene, and Co-Operative
Bank Plc have also made indicative offers for the branches,
people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Lloyds, 41 percent taxpayer-owned after its bailout, is seeking
2.5 billion pounds ($4 billion) for the assets, which it’s being
forced to sell to comply with  European Union  state-aid rules.  Lloyds hired Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to
oversee the sale. The Financial Times reported Osmond’s interest
earlier today. Osmond and his Sun partners may set up a special-
purpose company to fund the acquisition of Lloyds’ branches, the
person said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
