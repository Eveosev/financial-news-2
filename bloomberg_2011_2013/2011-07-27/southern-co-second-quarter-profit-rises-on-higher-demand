Southern Co. (SO)  the largest U.S.
utility owner by market value, said second-quarter profit rose
as unseasonably warm weather increased power demand.  Net income increased to $603 million, or 71 cents a share,
from $510.2 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Southern said in a statement on PR Newswire today. The company
was expected to earn 64 cents a share, the average of 16
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Southern’s utilities sold power to 4.42 million customers
in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi last year,
according to its  annual report . The company owns  power plants 
capable of generating more than 42,000 megawatts, enough for
33.6 million average homes, according to U.S. Energy Department
statistics.  The earnings were announced before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Southern fell 5 cents to $40.26 yesterday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has
seven buy ratings, 15 holds and three sells from analysts, has
risen 5.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
