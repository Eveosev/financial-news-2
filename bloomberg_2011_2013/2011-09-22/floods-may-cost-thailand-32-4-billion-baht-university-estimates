Floods in  Thailand  since the end of
July may cause as much as 32.4 billion baht ($1.1 billion) of
damage, with the figure for the whole year rising to as much as
58.5 billion baht, the University of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce said in an e-mailed statement in Bangkok today.  The damage caused by the annual flooding may shave 0.7
percentage point from Thailandâ€™s economic growth, according to
the university. As many as 1.9 million people have been affected
by the disaster, and 4.2 million rai (672,000 hectares) of
agricultural land has been damaged, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
