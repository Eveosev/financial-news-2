Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) , a
Spanish savings bank  seized  by the Bank of  Spain , said more than
half of its loans for property development were in default.  Of 12.7 billion euros ($17.2 billion) lent to developers,
6.4 billion euros were classed as doubtful, the lender said in
explanatory  notes  to its first-half earnings published late
yesterday. Another 1.3 billion euros of those loans were classed
as “substandard,” the lender said.  The Bank of Spain is looking for a buyer for CAM, which was
seized in July. It posted a 1.14 billion-euro first-half loss as
its default ratio more than doubled to 19 percent since
December.  Selling the stricken lender is a priority for the regulator
as it seeks to bolster confidence in a banking industry pummeled
by defaulted loans to developers. Auditors KPMG said yesterday
that the bank’s viability depends on the success of a plan put
together by the government’s rescue fund.  The Alicante-based lender said 5.4 percent of its 1.1
billion euros of  mortgage loans  to individuals were in default.
Property development and business-services loans accounted for
29 percent of its loan book, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
