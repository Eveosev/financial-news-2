Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
risks becoming global if the region’s governments don’t act to
stem contagion, European Central Bank council member Erkki Liikanen said.  “Concrete measures are absolutely crucial,” Liikanen told
Suomen Kuvalehti in an interview to be published in tomorrow’s
issue of the magazine. “There’s a great risk that contagion
cannot be stopped and the European debt crisis spreads and
becomes global.”  Governments must do their part and approve the enhanced
powers of Europe’s temporary rescue fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility, to ensure it becomes “fully functional,”
Liikanen said. If leaders fail to take adequate action, the
crisis may deepen and last longer, he said.  The ECB is ensuring the transmission of monetary policy
through its bond purchase program, which marks a “new and
unusual” step for the ECB, Liikanen said. The central bank buys
the securities as a temporary and exceptional measure, he said.
