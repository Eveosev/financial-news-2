A-Tec Industries AG (ATEC)  is seeking new
talks to find a buyer as the insolvent Austrian engineering
company races against a Sept. 30 deadline to raise funds to
pay creditors.  A-Tec is restarting negotiations with Penta Investments
Ltd., a Czech suitor whose previous bid was rejected, after a
member of a group that agreed to buy some assets pulled out,
Nicole Berger-Akin, an A-Tec spokeswoman, said today by phone
from Vienna. She confirmed a report by Austrian magazine Format
today that Pakistani investorAlshair Fiyaz’s Solstice
International is no longer interested in acquiring A-Tec’s
Montanwerke Brixlegg unit.  Solstice was part of a group led by Contor Industries GmbH,
whose offer A-Tec accepted on Sept. 5. Other members of the
group included Wolong Holding Group Co. Ltd. and PalmSquare
International FZC, A-Tec said at the time. Penta said on Sept.
20 that it had sued A-Tec in the Vienna Commercial Court over
the sale.  Penta is “open to suggestions” from A-Tec on how to
proceed, Martin Danko, a spokesman at the private-equity firm’s
Prague headquarters, said in a telephone interview.  A-Tec needs more than 200 million euros ($269 million) in
proceeds from the sale to pay 47 percent of claims under a
reorganization approved by creditors in December. The insolvency
administrator must receive the sum by the end of this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
