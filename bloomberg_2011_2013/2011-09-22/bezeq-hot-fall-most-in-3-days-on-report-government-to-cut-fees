Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp. and  Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT)  declined the most in
three days after TheMarker reported a government panel plans to
cut the interconnection fees they charge.  Bezeq,  Israel ’s largest communications company, retreated
4.6 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Sept. 19, to 6.90
shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Hot, the country’s
second-biggest fixed-line operator, lost 2.8 percent to 46.18
shekels.  A government appointed panel will recommend cutting or
completely abolishing the fees charged by the two companies for
calling between networks, TheMarker reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The panel is finalizing its recommendations and will submit
them to the Ministry of Communications, Yechiel Shabi, a
ministry spokesman, said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
