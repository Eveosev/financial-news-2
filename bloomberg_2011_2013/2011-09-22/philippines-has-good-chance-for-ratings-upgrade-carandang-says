The Philippines’ chances of winning
higher credit ratings are “good” as it intends to further
boost confidence of investors to support upgrades that will
attract more funds and investments, President  Benigno Aquino ’s
spokesman Ricky Carandang said today in Manila.  “We have not exhausted other methods of raising new
revenues,” Carandang said during the arrival of Aquino from the
U.S. Higher taxes remain a “last resort” and the nation
expects “pretty good numbers” from tax-collecting agencies
“in the coming days,” the spokesman said.  International Business Machines Corp. plans to expand its
Philippine business, Aquino said today.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  is “on
target” with its $1 billion investment in the Philippines and
may further expand, Trade Secretary Gregory Domingo said today.
Other key economic officials are still in the U.S. to meet with
rating companies, Carandang said. Aquino will bring an 80-man
business delegation to  Japan  next week, Domingo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
