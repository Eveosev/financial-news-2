Investors don't tend to make lots of money betting against China. Just ask hedge fund manager  Jim Chanos , who's been shorting the second biggest economy since at least 2009. The place is still growing 9.5 percent, and both  Standard & Poor's  and Moody’s Investors Service rate China on par with  Japan . Why, then, does Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates Ltd. in  New York , appear to be doubling down? China may be recoupling with the West. The big story in Asia since the onset of the 2008 global crisis was its decoupling from the U.S. and  Europe . It used to be that where the whims of American and European consumers went, Asia's export-led economies followed. That connection seemed to break down amid Wall Street's crash. While Asian growth softened a bit, it remained impressively robust. The lens through which Chanos is looking is colored by a world economy that may be sliding back into recession. It was one thing for China, and  Asia  generally, to pump massive amounts of stimulus into markets a few years back. It's quite another to think such efforts will pay off anew if the U.S. and Europe hit a wall. Investors would be reminded that the quality of China's growth is as important as the quantity. “Everything there is focused on fixed investment -- building and construction -- people have to keep their eye on that,” Chanos told Bloomberg Television on Sept. 21. “The world believes that China is an engine of growth and will continue no matter what happens in the West. It’s not immune.” Chanos estimates that the amount of debt  China  guarantees in state-owned businesses and local governments will probably grow from 100 percent to 200 percent of gross domestic product. “Those are numbers that are staggering,” he said. "Those are European kind of numbers, if not worse.” It's something to which investors need to pay more attention. China did a remarkable job sailing through the world crisis. The price for the untold waves of stimulus China pumped into its economy may be mountains of bad debt. Should the West slide back into turmoil, a recoupled China may have more than one crisis on its hands. (William Pesek is a Bloomberg View columnist.)
