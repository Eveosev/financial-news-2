Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
fell for a second day as demand from refiners dropped amid a
slump in processing profits.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in November slipped 4 cents to a premium of 43 cents a barrel to
its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price earlier this month reached 63 cents over
its official level, the most since May. Qatar Land slipped 6
cents to a premium of 32 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  A decline in processing margins has limited demand for
crude that helped to push up premiums earlier in September.
Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of profit, fell today
to $16.37 a barrel, compared with $17.56 a month ago, according
to London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped $3.27, or 3
percent, to $104.57 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November decreased 3 percent to $104.19. Murban
for spot delivery fell 3 percent to $108.65.  Oman futures for November delivery dropped $1.89 to $105.26
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:06 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,421 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$105.16 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 23 cents to $5.05 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December rose 12 cents to $4.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
