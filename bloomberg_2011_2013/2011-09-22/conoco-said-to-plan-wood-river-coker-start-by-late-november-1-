ConocoPhillips (COP)  may start a new unit
that will process heavy crude by late November at its Wood River
refinery in Illinois, according to two people familiar with
plant operations.  The unit, a coker that is part of a project to increase the
heavy oil capacity by 130,000 barrels a day, was targeted to
start in October, according to the people, who requested
anonymity because the information isn’t public.  “The Wood River coker and refinery expansion project will
start up by the end of the year,”  Rich Johnson , a spokesman for
the company, said in an e-mail.  The coker project is expected to increase crude oil gross
capacity from 95,000 barrels to 225,000 a day and increase clean
product yield by 5 percent, according to the company’s  2011
summer fact book .  Wood River receives domestic, Canadian and other foreign
crude oil by various pipelines and produces a high percentage of
transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel,
according to Conoco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
