Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis is
putting the survival of the 17-nation Economic and Monetary
Union at risk, according to a paper published today by the
 European Central Bank .  “The greatly increased fiscal imbalances in the euro area
as a whole and the dire situation in individual member countries
risk undermining stability, growth and employment, as well as
the sustainability of EMU itself,” the paper, co-written by ECB
Executive Board member Juergen Stark and published on its
website, says.  It proposes additional measures to strengthen fiscal
governance that go beyond those planned by governments, saying
the challenge of how to place public finances on a sound footing
remains “as yet unresolved.”  The fiscal crisis that started in  Greece  has engulfed
Ireland and  Portugal  and is now threatening Italy and  Spain .
With governments prevaricating over how to stop the contagion,
the ECB has been forced to step into the breach, supplying banks
with unlimited cash and buying  government bonds  to reduce market
borrowing costs.  The paper, titled “The Stability and Growth Pact, Crisis
and Reform,” says the views expressed are those of the authors
and “do not necessarily reflect those of the ECB.”  It says while proposed tougher fiscal rules go in the right
direction, they don’t represent the “quantum leap” needed. The
paper identifies five additional fiscal-governance measures it
says are “essential to ensure effective policy coordination and
sound public finances in the future.”  These are: a requirement that national budget deficits be
approved at the European level where they exceed safe levels;
automatic correction of slippages; financial receivership when
adjustment programs do not remain on track; automatic fines for
deficits in excess of 3 percent of gross domestic product; and
independent entities at the national and European level to
ensure compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
