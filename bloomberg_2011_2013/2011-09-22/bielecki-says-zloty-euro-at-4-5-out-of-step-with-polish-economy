Markets are testing  Poland  with the
zloty near 4.5 per euro, a level that is out of step with the
country’s economic strength, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who chairs
Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s  Council of Economic Advisers , said
today in an interview on Radio Tok FM.  Bielecki said he agrees with central bank Governor Marek
Belka’s statement earlier today that the currency is straying
from Poland’s “healthy fundamentals.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
