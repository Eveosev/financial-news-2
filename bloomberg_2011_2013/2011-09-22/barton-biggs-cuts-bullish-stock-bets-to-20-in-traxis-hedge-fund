Bets that stocks will gain make up
20 percent of Traxis Partners LLC’s holdings, down from as much
as 85 percent six months ago, as the threat of a recession makes
equities too risky, according to founder  Barton Biggs .  “I wish I was minus 20,” Biggs said during an interview
today on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with  Matt Miller  and Carol Massar. “I wish I was zero. I don’t think any
place is a place to invest.”  The benchmark gauge for American equities lost 3.2 percent
to 1,129.56 today, extending its weekly drop to 7.1 percent, on
concern policy makers are running out of tools to avoid another
global recession. Biggs said Aug. 18 that the  S&P 500  may be
bottoming after an 18 percent drop between April 29 and Aug. 8.  Markets are telling policy makers that “they’ve got to
change and act or we’re going to go into a double-dip recession,
and we’re going to go down another 20 percent,” said Biggs,
whose equity purchases prior to the March 2009 market bottom
sent his Traxis hedge fund to a 39 percent gain that year.  Biggs runs the Traxis Global Equity Macro Fund, which
produced a 2.2 percent profit, net of fees, for investors in
2011 through the end of July, according to Adam Jaffe, the
company’s chief operating officer. That compared with the 3.3
percent gain for the MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in
45 nations, including reinvested dividends.  “If we’re going into a global double-dip, corporate
earnings projections for the U.S. and  Europe  are way too high,”
Biggs said. “So there are major revisions coming.”  S&P 500 earnings are poised to reach a record $99.34 a
share this year, according to the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Analysts are more optimistic about earnings
since the S&P 500 peaked at a three-year high on April 29,
driving their forecast up from $98.73 a share that day.  “I want to see an important stimulus program in the  United
States , combined with major reform in social security, Medicare
and our  defense budget ,” he said. “If we did that, we could
have a 20 percent rally.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
