Tropical Storm Hilary is nearing
hurricane strength off  Mexico ’s Pacific coast while Ophelia
intensified as it headed westward across open Atlantic waters.  Hilary, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Punto
Maldonado, Mexico, was moving west-northwest at 9 mph, the
National Hurricane Center said in an 8 a.m. Miami time  advisory .
The system packed winds of 70 miles per hour, just below the 74-
mph threshold to be classified as a Category 1 hurricane on the
five-step  Saffir-Simpson scale .  “Hilary is forecast to become a hurricane today and could
become a ‘major’ hurricane by Saturday,” the center said. The
core of the storm will continue to move parallel to the
southwest coast of Mexico though any deviation to the north of
the track could bring stronger winds to the shore, it said.  Mexico’s government issued a tropical-storm warning from
Lagunas de Chacahua to Punta San Telmo and a tropical-storm
watch from there to the coastal resort of Manzanillo, according
to the center.  In the Atlantic,  Ophelia , the  15th named storm  of the
season, was about 1,020 miles east-southeast of the Leeward
Islands and east of Barbados, the center also said. The system,
moving west at 14 mph with a slight increase in top winds to 65
mph, is forecast to slowly weaken in the next 48 hours.  The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
