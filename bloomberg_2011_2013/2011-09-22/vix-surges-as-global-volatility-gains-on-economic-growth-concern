The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options rose a fourth day, the longest streak of gains since
July, as volatility gauges rose in  Europe  and  Asia  on concern
the global economy is slipping into another recession.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, jumped 11 percent to 41.35 today, bringing its
four-day increase to 33 percent. Europe’s  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which
measures the cost of protecting against a decline in the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, rose 8.3 percent to 47.78.  Hong Kong ’s HSI
Volatility Index climbed 19 percent, while  South Korea ’s
volatility advanced 8.2 percent and  India ’s surged 22 percent,
the most since Aug. 5.  Investors drove up prices for insurance against equity
losses amid concern central banks are running out of tools to
prevent another recession. The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday
that there are “significant downside risks” in the  U.S.
economy , prompting the central bank to announce a $400 billion
plan to spur growth as the recovery from the worst contraction
since the Great Depression falters.  “It’s very difficult to find clarity here in market
direction and volatility when trading seems to be led by fear,
panic and computers as opposed to rational fundamentals,” said
Jeremy Wien, a VIX options trader at Chicago-based Peak6
Investments LP, which manages more than $1 billion. “Market
sentiment flips 180 degrees on a weekly basis.”  S&P 500   The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has lost 7.1 percent since
Sept. 16, and has slumped in six out of the past eight weeks.
Today, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged 4.6 percent and closed
at its lowest level since July 2009.  The VIX surged 50 percent to 48, its highest level since
March 2009, on Aug. 8. The gauge has an average of 20.44 in its
21-year history. The VStoxx reached its highest level since
January 2009 on Sept. 12. The index’s average is 26.13 since
April 1999, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The European Union is dealing with a problem they’ve
never encountered before and that’s worrisome for investors,”
Gareth Watson, vice president of  investment management  at
Richardson GMP Ltd. in Toronto, said in a telephone interview.
Richardson oversees about C$16 billion. “It’s unknown
territory,” he said, and “there are no easy answers or quick
answers to the European situation.”  Put options  Commodities plunged today amid speculation demand is
slowing. Copper futures slumped 7.3 percent, while the S&P GSCI
Index retreated 4.9 percent.  Put-options volume jumped to five times the four-week
average for Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., whose bearish
contracts were among the most traded in the U.S. equity options
market. Copper sank to a one-year low, while oil and gold
futures slipped on concern raw-material demand will falter amid
an economic slowdown.  The price of puts to sell Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s
largest publicly traded copper producer, should the company fall
10 percent was 1.21 higher than calls to buy on Aug. 30, the
highest level since November 2005, Bloomberg data show. The
price relationship known as skew fell 6.1 percent since then to
1.14 yesterday.  Molycorp Inc., owner of the largest rare-earth deposit
outside of  China , saw its 30-day implied volatility jump to
105.17, the highest level in a month, as the shares fell 9.8
percent to a 2011 low of $35.96. Put volume increased to more
than 26,000 contracts, three times the four-week average.  “People are starting to become nervous about non-U.S.
growth,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management in New York, said in a telephone interview. His firm
oversees more than $1 billion. Copper “is sensitive to a risk
of slowdown within the emerging market complex. That’s probably
the biggest global risk out there, which people are unprepared
for.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
