U.S. stock-index futures maintained
losses after more Americans than forecast filed jobless claims
last week, underscoring concern that a struggling labor market
will continue to be a drag on the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 2.3 percent to 1,129.7 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 225 points, or 2
percent, to 10,782.               Applications for jobless benefits decreased 9,000 in the
week ended Sept. 17 to 423,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists forecast 420,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The average number
of claims in the past month rose for a fifth straight week, to
the highest level since July 16.  The  S&P 500  fell as much as 18 percent from a three-year
high on April 29 through Aug. 8 amid concern the economic
rebound was in jeopardy as  Europe ’s government debt crisis
threatened to exacerbate the slowdown. The index then rebounded
4.2 percent through yesterday.  The index sank 2.9 percent yesterday, its worst drop in a
month, as the  Federal Reserve  said strains in financial markets
are taking a toll on the economy and Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded three banks.  Global stocks extended declines today after data showed
that  China ’s manufacturing may shrink for a third month in
September, the longest contraction since 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
