New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
said the state is willing to provide $5 million in funding for
Hoboken University Medical Center, after the Hoboken City
Council decided not to fund the hospital.  The lack of funding would force the hospital to close
within the next few weeks and risk municipal authority default
in Hoboken, Christie said in an e-mailed statement.   Christie said local unions must still make necessary
concessions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
