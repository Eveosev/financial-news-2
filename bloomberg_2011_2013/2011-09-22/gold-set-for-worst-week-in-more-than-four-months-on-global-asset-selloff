Gold headed for its worst weekly
performance in more than four months as investors sold the metal
alongside global equities and other commodities on concern the
world economy will falter.  Immediate-delivery gold traded little changed at $1,740.07
an ounce at 3:34 p.m. Singapore time, after swinging between
gains and losses. It earlier fell to a one-month low of
$1,720.53. The metal is down 3.9 percent this week, the biggest
drop since the period to May 6. December-delivery bullion in  New
York  declined as much as 1.1 percent to at $1,722.30, also the
lowest in a month, and traded at $1,742.50.  “Gold has been caught up in the overall flight to the exit,
but in a normal, sensible world, we should expect to see some
support from the fear and trepidation investors are facing,”
Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at  Australia  & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., wrote in an e-mail.  Global stocks entered a bear market for the first time in
more than two years, oil touched a six-week low and copper fell
to the lowest level in a year on concerns that the debt crisis
in  Europe  may escalate as the U.S. faces another recession. The
 Federal Reserve  said Sept. 21 there are “significant downside
risks” to the outlook, driving the dollar to a seven-month high
against a six-currency basket yesterday.  “The  U.S. dollar  rallied on a flight to safe haven assets,
putting downward pressure on the gold price,” Lachlan Shaw, an
analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in an e-mail.  Washington  Meetings  Central bankers and finance ministers discuss the outlook
today at the annual meetings of the  International Monetary Fund 
and  World Bank  in Washington. Moody’s Investors Service today
downgraded eight Greek banks amid a pledge by Group of 20
finance chiefs that they are “committed to a strong and
coordinated international response to address the renewed
challenges facing the global economy.”  Gold, up 16 percent since the end of June, is still set for
the best quarterly gain since 1986, after reaching a record
$1,921.15 on Sept. 6, as investors seek to hedge against other
depreciating assets and central banks look to diversify reserves.  Bullion held in exchange-traded products was little changed
at 2,236.068 metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The holdings reached a record 2,298.4 tons on Aug. 8.
Central banks, the biggest holders in the world, have been net
buyers of the metal for the first time in a generation.  Russia ’s central bank increased its gold reserves to 27.2
million troy ounces last month, from 27 million at the end of
July, Bank Rossii said on Sept. 20, joining Thailand, South
Korea and  Mexico  in adding the metal to their coffers this year.  Cash silver tumbled as much as 4.5 percent to $34.2675 an
ounce, extending yesterday’s 9.6 percent slump, before trading
at $34.9762 an ounce. Spot platinum advanced as much as 1.1
percent to $1,706.25 an ounce, while palladium lost as much as
1.5 percent to $641 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
