LivingSocial may raise more than
$200 million in funding that would give it a valuation of as
much as $6 billion, rather than proceeding toward an initial
public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The proposed funding round may include both equity and
debt, said two people, who asked not to be identified because
the talks were private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is acting as an
adviser in the deliberations, they said.  LivingSocial, which was in talks with banks earlier this
year about raising $1 billion in an IPO, is reconsidering the
prospect amid a stock-market rout that has shaved 13 percent off
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since July 21. Companies have
shelved or scrapped U.S. public offerings at a faster rate in
the past three months than the comparable period of any year
since 2004, Bloomberg data show.  The private funding round being considered would likely
include some of LivingSocial’s existing backers as well as new
investors, said two of the people. LivingSocial would reconsider
an IPO at a later date even if it raises the funds, according to
two people.  Groupon, the daily-coupon leader, delayed its IPO in
response to market gyrations, three people familiar with the
matter said earlier this month.  Another concern for LivingSocial’s management and investors
is a growth slowdown in the market for daily coupons, two of the
people said. LivingSocial had fewer weekly unique visitors in
August than during the peak in June, research firm  ComScore Inc. (SCOR) 
said last month.  LivingSocial’s Funding  Groupon said in June it has never turned a profit, and
competitors including Facebook Inc. and Yelp Inc. have closed or
pulled back their deal services.  LivingSocial, led by co-founder Tim O’Shaughnessy, raised
$400 million in April, valuing the company at $3.5 billion, two
people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. It has
raised a total of $627 million from investors, including Grotech
Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price Group
Inc. and e-commerce site  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)   Brendan Lewis, a spokesman for LivingSocial, declined to
comment on the company’s funding plans. Tasha Pelio, a
spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, also declined to
comment.  LivingSocial delivers daily discounts on restaurants,
hotels, events, and other goods and services. The daily-deal
market may generate $4.17 billion in U.S. sales in 2015,
compared with $1.97 billion this year, according to research
firm BIA/Kelsey in Chantilly, Virginia.  Chicago-based Groupon may still be able to sell shares
before year-end, two people said earlier this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
