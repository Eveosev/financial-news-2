Historical analysis shows recession warnings are best determined by
looking for the annualized change in the leading index to fall more
than 3.5 percent at the same time the diffusion index is below 50
over a six-month span. The diffusion index measures the proportion
of the components that are rising.  SOURCE: The Conference Board  To contact the reporter on this story:
