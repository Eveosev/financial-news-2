Sixteen officials of the $225
billion  California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the
largest U.S. public pension, were fined by the state political
watchdog for failing to properly disclose gifts.  The fines included $400 each for the president,  Rob Feckner , and a board member, Louis Moret, the California Fair
Political Practices Commission said. No proof of intentional
non-disclosure was found, the agency said. Failure to report the
gifts was “at worst negligent and at best inadvertent,” it
said.  Calpers was roiled by a pay-to-play scandal last year
involving middlemen hired by firms seeking to win the fund’s
business. California law requires anyone involved in investing
taxpayer money to file a statement yearly describing their
income and listing any gifts. The value limit on gifts is $420.  “We are fully committed to transparency, openness and the
highest ethical standards,” Calpers said in a statement.  The commission probed 49 current and former Calpers
employees and board members, including  Joe Dear , chief
investment officer, for failing to report gifts or value them
properly.  Except for the 16 fined, most of the other cases were
dismissed after officials proved they purchased the item in
question or it didn’t qualify as a gift.  To contact the reporter on this story:
