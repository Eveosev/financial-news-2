European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the EU will issue a
feasibility study on joint euro-bond issuance “in coming
weeks,” though calling the idea “not a matter of today.”  “The euro-area member states need to go further in pooling
economic sovereignty” before considering common bond issuance,
Rehn said today in the text of a speech in Washington.
“Successful strengthening of the Economic and Monetary Union
along these lines could also make the consideration of some type
of common bonds more realistic,” he said.  The European Commission, the EU executive in Brussels, will
“present a feasibility study on euro bonds in the coming
weeks,” Rehn said. “While not a matter of today or even
tomorrow, I see deeper economic policy integration and perhaps
euro bonds as the music of the day after tomorrow - as an
expression of  Europe ’s evolutionary road.”  Rehn’s remarks echoed those of European Commission
President  Jose Barroso , who said in an interview this week that
common euro-bond issuance should remain an “option.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
