The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
declined the most in 16 months, dropping 988.13, or 3.2 percent,
to 30,323.04 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, a second day
of losses.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , fell to the
lowest in more than a week, sliding 12.85 rand, or 4.4 percent,
to 282.65 rand. Copper fell to a one-year low in  New York  and
headed into a  bear market  in  London  after a China factory index
signaling contraction added to speculation of slowing metals
demand.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, declined 12.15 rand, or 5.2 percent, to 220.65 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, dropped for the first day in seven, slipping 5.64
rand, or 1.5 percent, to 371.50 rand. Gold fell to a four-week
low in New York as the dollar’s rally cut demand for the metal
as an alternative asset after the  Federal Reserve  said it will
buy longer-maturity  U.S. debt .  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the continent’s second-biggest
gold producer, slid 1.69 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 139.32 rand.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), the continent’s third-
largest gold company, dropped 1 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 105
rand.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producer,
declined the most in more than two weeks, dropping 23.52 rand,
or 5 percent, to 442.75 rand.  Iron ore  is set for the first
four-year drop since at least 1982 as supplies surge. Global
prices may fall 29 percent to an average $123 a metric ton in
2015 from a record $173 this year, according to the median
estimates of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, retreated the most in a month, slipping 5.46 rand, or
2.1 percent, to 259.54 rand. The maker of Peroni and Grolsch
beer fell as European stock markets slumped and analysts said
the company may be paying a high price for Foster’s Group Ltd.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest producer of motor
fuel from coal, declined for a second day, falling 7 rand, or 2
percent, to 339.50 rand. Oil fell to a one-month low after the
Federal Reserve cited “significant downside risks” to the
economy of the U.S., the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  The  Foschini Group Ltd. (TFG)  , a clothing retailer,
dropped the most in almost 2-1/2 years, sliding 4.88 rand, or
5.3 percent, to 87.90 rand. The rand plunged to an almost two-
year low against the dollar, raising input costs and cutting
rate-cut chances in the continent’s biggest economy.  Truworths International Ltd. (TRU)  , declined 3.10 rand,
or 4.1 percent, to 71.95 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
