Chileâ€™s peso may fall to 550 per
 U.S. dollar  as it heads toward levels last seen in mid-2010, BNP
Paribas SA strategist  Diego Donadio  wrote today in a note to
clients.  The Sao Paulo-based strategist had previously recommended
selling the peso against the dollar with a target of 500 per
dollar. The currency reached that target yesterday and today
fell through 520 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
