OMV AG (OMV)  Chief Executive Officer
Gerhard Roiss said it may take as long as 18 months for oil
production in  Libya  to reach pre-crisis levels.  “Our people will go into Libya next week,” Roiss said in
an interview in Istanbul late yesterday. “I think it could take
up to one, one and a half years until production is where it was
before the crisis.”  OMV said in July that oil and gas production fell 9.5
percent to the equivalent of 275,000 barrels of oil in the
second quarter from the previous one because output from its
assets in Libya stopped in February.  Production at OMV’s assets in the country isn’t expected to
resume this year. Libya accounted for 33,000 barrels a day, or
10 percent of its total production, in 2010. OMV, of Vienna, is
central  Europe ’s biggest oil company.  “As we see it, the situation is quite stable” now, Roiss
said, and OMV recently received its first shipment of Libyan
crude since the crisis began, produced by another company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
