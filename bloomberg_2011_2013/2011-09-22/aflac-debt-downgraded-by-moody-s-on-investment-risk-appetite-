Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, was downgraded by Moody’s
Investors Service after losses tied to holdings in banks from
 Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland.  The senior debt was lowered to A3 from A2, reflecting
“continued concerns over the company’s higher than average
investment risk appetite,” the ratings firm said today in a
statement on the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
