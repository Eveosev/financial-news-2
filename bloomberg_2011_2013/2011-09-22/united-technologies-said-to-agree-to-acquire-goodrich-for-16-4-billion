United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  agreed to
buy aerospace supplier  Goodrich Corp. (GR)  for $16.4 billion, paying
$127.50 a share in an all-cash deal, a person familiar with the
matter said.  The person asked not to be identified because the details
aren’t public. The companies’ boards met separately tonight to
approve the transaction, said three people with knowledge of
those discussions.  At $127.50 a share, the United Technologies offer values
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based Goodrich at 47 percent more than
its closing share price on Sept. 15, the day before Bloomberg
reported the companies were in talks.  Buying Goodrich will add the world’s largest maker of
aircraft landing gear to an aerospace portfolio at Hartford,
Connecticut-based United Technologies that includes Sikorsky
helicopters, Pratt & Whitney  jet engines  and the Hamilton
Sundstrand unit, whose products include aviation electronics.  Goodrich’s aerospace lineup includes nacelles, the casings
that hold jet engines; electronics; and temperature-control
systems.  Goodrich will be combined with Hamilton Sundstrand, and
Goodrich Chief Executive Officer Marshall Larsen will lead the
new unit, according to the person familiar with the terms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
