U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
and five other leaders of Group of 20 nations wrote to French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to urge him to use his chairmanship
of the body to find agreement on actions to support growth.  “We need decisive action to support growth, confidence,
and credibility,” the six wrote in the letter released by
Cameron’s office today. “We have not yet mastered the
challenges of the crisis. Global imbalances are rising again.
Surplus countries need to increase their expansion of domestic
demand, enshrining their policies in clear political
commitments within the G-20 including on structural reform, to
keep markets open, increase exchange-rate flexibility and
refrain from competitive devaluation.”  The letter was also signed by Australia’s  Julia Gillard ,
Canada’s Stephen Harper, Indonesia’s Susilo Yudhoyono, South
Korea’s Lee Myung-Bak and Mexico’s Felipe Calderon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
