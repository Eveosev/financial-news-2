Brazil ’s unemployment rate was
unchanged at 6 percent in August, a record low for the month,
crimping the scope for interest rate cuts as the economy slows.  Economists expected an August unemployment rate of 6.1
percent, according to the median estimate from 38 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Average real wages rose 0.5 percent from
the previous months to 1,629.40 reais ($839.16) a month, the
report showed.  “The number showed that the jobs market in August hasn’t
changed because of the international volatility,” said Mauricio Rosal, chief economist at Raymond James in Sao Paulo. “For now,
inflation pressures on consumer goods items don’t look like they
will be letting up with the labor market so strong.”  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini cut Brazil’s
benchmark interest rate a half point to 12 percent on Aug. 31,
after raising it at the previous five policy meetings, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global economy. The bank
said lower borrowing costs won’t compromise its 4.5 percent
inflation target next year. Annual inflation in mid-September
was 7.33 percent, the fastest rate in six years.  Rising Yields  Yields on interest-rate future contracts in future years
rose after jobs report and the decline in the real, which may
increase the price of some imported goods, said Rosal. Yields
for contracts due January 2014 7 basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 11.31 percent at 1:47 p.m. New York time.
The real rose 0.7 percent to 1.8626 against the dollar after the
central bank acted in the currency futures market for the first
time in two years to arrest a plunge in the real, which touched
a two-year low today.  Labor Minister Carlos Lupi said on Sept. 14 that  Latin
America ’s largest economy will create more than 2.7 million jobs
this year, down from previous forecasts of 3 million. The
jobless rate will end this year at 5.5 percent to 5.7 percent,
he said on Aug. 29.  Brazil’s economic growth slowed last quarter to 3.2 percent
from a year earlier, down from 4.2 percent in the first quarter
and 7.5 percent last year, the fastest pace in two decades.  Even as the global slowdown hit Brazil’s industrial sector,
which shrank in July from a year earlier, workers across the
nation have walked off their jobs to demand higher salaries. The
metalworkers union in the industrial belt surrounding Sao Paulo
voted in favor of a 10 percent wage increase on Sept. 20 after
threatening to strike.  Benchmark Rate  Economists expect the benchmark Selic rate to end this year
at 11 percent, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 16
central bank survey of about 100 economists. Their forecast for
the 2012 year-end Selic fell to 10.75 percent from 11 percent.  Brazil’s federal revenue rose 15.92 percent in August from
a year earlier to 74.61 billion reais ($39 billion), the federal
tax agency said today.  The “extraordinary” increases in tax collection will help
the government reach its primary surplus target, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in
 Sao Paulo .  The Treasury said today that Brazil’s federal debt rose
1.96 percent to 1.77 trillion reais ($958 billion) in August
from July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
