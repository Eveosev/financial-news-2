William Tanona, an analyst who
specializes in U.S. brokerage stocks, is leaving  UBS AG (UBSN)  after
less than a year to work for  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ’s
corporate credit group.  At Fortress, the buyout and hedge-fund firm run by Dan
Mudd, Tanona will work for Peter Briger, a principal and co-
chairman who oversees the credit unit, said Gordon Runte, a
spokesman for Fortress.  “Bill is a top industry talent in the financial sector,”
Briger said in a statement. “We are confident his expertise
will benefit our investment process and ultimately our limited
partners.”  Tanona, 37, was hired by the New York office of Zurich-
based UBS in December as a managing director and analyst
covering companies including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan
Stanley. (MS)  He previously worked as an analyst at  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) , Goldman Sachs and Collins Stewart, now known as Collins
Stewart Hawkpoint Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
