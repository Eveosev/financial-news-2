As  Standard & Poor’s  considered the
first ratings downgrade of the world’s biggest economy in late
July, some of the largest bond investors held undisclosed
meetings with the firm that would ultimately strip the U.S. of
its AAA grade.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , Western Asset Management, and TCW Group
Inc., which oversee almost $4 trillion, were visited by S&P,
after the company had said publicly that there was more than a
50 percent chance of a cut, said people familiar with the
conversations who declined to be identified because they were
private.  Ed Sweeney , a spokesman for S&P, says such talks are an
attempt to make the ratings process more transparent.  While these meetings can be legal, they underscore the
influence granted to the ratings companies during the Great
Depression to say what’s safe and what’s risky in the $35
trillion U.S. fixed income market. The sessions provided some
investors more access than others at a time when confidence in
the global financial system has yet to recover from the subprime
crisis that the firms helped create.  “This isn’t an ordinary commercial enterprise we’re
talking about,” said Robert Hillman, a professor at the
 University of California , Davis, School of Law and the
institution’s fair business practices and investor advocacy
chair. “We want to expect more of a company like S&P.”  S&P, Moody’s Investors Service, and  Fitch Ratings  are the
largest of 10 firms approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to assign credit rankings used by investors and
regulators to evaluate securities. Many pension and mutual funds
require minimum ratings to buy debt, and banks generally must
hold more capital to back bonds deemed of lower quality.  Material Information  Laws that forbid companies from privately disclosing
material information generally don’t extend to conversations
between corporations and ratings companies, which are designated
by the SEC as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, or NRSROs. They must create and follow internal
policies governing disclosure and obey  insider trading  statutes.  S&P placed its AAA rating for the U.S. under review for
downgrade on July 14, saying the move signaled “at least a one-
in-two likelihood” of a cut within 90 days.  Fitch and Moody’s reviewed the government at the same time
and affirmed their top grades. S&P’s downgrade, on Aug. 5, even
after the Treasury claimed the firm made a $2 trillion
calculation error, contributed to stock losses that left
shareholders $1 trillion poorer by Aug. 25. Treasury investors
have repudiated the assessment, pushing 10-year notes to a
record low yield of 1.85 percent yesterday.  Private Meetings  BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with more
than $3 trillion in assets, Western Asset, which oversees about
$365 billion, and TCW, which handles $115 billion, met with S&P
officials after the company placed the U.S. under review,
according to the people familiar with the matter. The investors
and S&P declined to comment on what was discussed.  Some of the meetings preceded by at least a week the Aug. 2
agreement by President  Barack Obama  to cut $2.4 trillion of
spending to gain approval from lawmakers to raise the nation’s
deficit ceiling and avert a default, the people said. S&P had
indicated publicly that anything less than $4 trillion would
jeopardize the rating.  ‘Regular Outreach’  Talks between the ratings firms and investors can be
acceptable because the graders usually provide public
disclosures explaining the evolution of their views about an
issuer’s creditworthiness, Douglas Arthur, a New York-based
analyst at Evercore Partners Inc., said in a telephone
interview.  “They typically move slowly and gradually and send signals
to the market in terms of the direction they’re going, so there
are not a lot of surprises,” Arthur said. “Also, having
conversations with the movers and shakers is part of their
information discovery.”  The talks are “part of the regular outreach that we
have,” said John B. Chambers, chairman of S&P’s sovereign debt
rating committee, at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in New York
Sept. 15. “One of the issues we talked with investors about was
whether they thought there would be forced selling after such an
announcement, and would have done that whether it was the U.S.
or anybody else that had so much market debt.”  While all the rating groups say their policies prohibit
analysts from disclosing non-public information, investors often
try to use the conversations to gain an edge in predicting
upgrades and downgrades, according to former employees.  ‘Double-Edged Sword’  Harvey Pitt , the chairman of the SEC from 2001 to 2003,
said in an e-mail that private talks with investors represent
“a double-edged sword,” sharpened by legislation enacted by
Congress last year.  Even though thorough information-gathering improves rating
firms’ analysis and is mandatory under proposed new rules in the
Dodd-Frank Act, “the mere fact that one is required to do due
diligence doesn’t mean that one has a license to reveal the
direction in which a proposed rating is likely to head,” said
Pitt, now head of Washington-based consulting firm Kalorama
Partners LLC.  Given the market’s hunger for exclusive information, “it’s
kind of a difficult balancing act,” said Jerome Fons, executive
vice president at Kroll Bond Ratings Inc. and former managing
director in Moody’s credit policy and financial institution
groups.  “One might assume what the buy-side is the most interested
in is information about potential ratings moves,” Fons said.
“So they may be looking for body language.”  More Contacts  S&P said it increased contacts with bond buyers since the
financial crisis that began in 2007 and led to more than $2
trillion in writedowns and losses at the world’s largest
financial institutions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In reports this year, the independent Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission and a Senate investigative panel concluded
the firms lowered standards to win business from issuers who pay
for credit grades and cut inflated rankings too slowly.  “Over the last several years, S&P has taken many steps to
make the ratings process more transparent, including increasing
our interaction with investors, policy makers, and the press,”
Sweeney, the S&P spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We speak with
thousands of investors annually and S&P is committed to reaching
as many market participants as possible with its views on credit
risk.”  Analysts limit their comments on rating-related matters to
previously published material, Sweeney said in response to
questions about the conversations ahead of the U.S. downgrade,
which were reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 7.  No Guidance  Moody’s policies say workers can’t “give any guidance of
possible future rating actions, except to the relevant issuer or
its designated agents” and can’t share the information internal
except on a “need-to-know” basis, according to a copy provided
by  Michael Adler , a spokesman. Employees are expected to follow
the policies, he said.  “We regularly meet with investors and other market
participants to discuss published ratings and commentary, but
Fitch policy clearly limits such discussions to our previously
published material,”  Daniel Noonan , a Fitch spokesman, said in
an e-mail.  After the U.S. downgrade, bond yields fell to record lows.
 Warren Buffett , the world’s most successful investor, said the
U.S. should be rated “quadruple A” rather than AA+. S&P, a
unit of New York-based McGraw Hill Co., said last month it would
replace President Deven Sharma with Douglas Peterson at year-
end.  Some investors said access to the ratings analysts may
depend on how much money they manage or the fees paid to the
firm for services.  Fees for Access  In addition to payments from issuers, rating firms may
charge investors as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars for
access to research that goes beyond public news releases as well
as the opportunity to have conversations with analysts, said
Kroll’s Fons. Kroll Ratings, the company founded by Jules Kroll
that began grading debt this year, doesn’t now charge investors.  Bonnie Baha, the head of global developed credit in  Los
Angeles  at DoubleLine Capital LP, which manages $16 billion,
said her company wasn’t visited by S&P about the U.S. credit
rating before the downgrade, nor did she request a meeting.  “I guess size matters,” Baha said. “They wanted to go to
centers of influence who are also their biggest customers.”  Thornburg Investment Management Inc., which oversees about
$83 billion, questioned if size gave their rivals an advantage.  Fair Disclosure  “It strikes me as odd that they would release, or even
just intimate, that information to a select group of folks,”
said Jason Brady, a managing director for Thornburg in  Santa Fe ,
New  Mexico . “I don’t really agree with that and I am a paying
S&P subscriber.”  The SEC’s Regulation FD, which stands for fair disclosure
and bars corporate officers from revealing market-moving
information to favored investors before general dissemination,
doesn’t apply to conversations between rating firms and
investors because the analysts aren’t providing information
about their own companies, said  John Coffee , a law professor at
 Columbia University  in  New York .  Laws barring insider trading could apply, he said. The
firms could also be censured or lose their NRSRO status for
employee violations of their own policies, Coffee said.  Hedge Funds Subpoenaed  The SEC sent subpoenas to hedge funds as part of an
investigation into whether some investors traded on confidential
tips ahead of S&P’s decision, a person briefed on the matter
said Sept. 20. The probe will likely focus on firms that made
unusually large bets that markets would decline, ahead of the
announcement, according to the person, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the investigation isn’t public. The subpoenas
were reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 20.  Rating firms are trying to rebuild their reputations after
being blamed for fueling the U.S. housing bubble with AAA grades
on mortgage debt that helped push the nation into the biggest
recession since the 1930s.  When the values of top-rated mortgage securities plummeted,
losses spread across the world, leading to the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. three years ago, a seizure in
credit markets and the longest recession since the 1930s.  Investors are set to ultimately lose $378 billion, or 73
percent, on the $517 billion of collateralized debt obligations
used to repackage mortgage bonds from 2005 through 2007,
according to a paper released last month by researchers at the
 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia . After being hired by banks
to rate the securities, S&P, Moody’s or Fitch gave top grades to
more than 75 percent.  Seeking an Edge  Graciana del Castillo, a former S&P analyst who helped
oversee its upgrade of Mexico to investment grade in 2002, said
investors often seek an edge in predicting ratings when talking
with analysts. At the same time, the conversations can provide
value to the analyst, she said.  “When you decide on a rating, it’s very important to have
as much information as you can, and for that you have to be
constantly talking to people,” said del Castillo, who is now a
director in New York at consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisory
Group and adjunct professor at Columbia University’s School of
International and Public Affairs.  It’s inappropriate for the firms to use conversations with
investors to gauge the impact of their decisions, said  Joel Levington , a former S&P rater who is now managing director of
corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management, which
oversees $24 billion of fixed-income assets. Ratings analysts
need to have the courage of their convictions and not be swayed
by potential market reactions to their decisions, he said.  “That’s really not the role of a rating agency,” he said.
“The rating agency is there to make an independent call on what
they think  credit quality  is, period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
