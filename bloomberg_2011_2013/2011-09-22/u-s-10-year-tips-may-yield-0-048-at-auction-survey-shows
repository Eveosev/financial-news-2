The Treasury Department’s $11
billion sale of 10-year inflation-indexed securities may draw a
yield of 0.048 percent, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of five of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20
primary dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities mature in July
2021. The current 10-year TIPS yielded 0.026 percent in pre-
auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $13 billion sale on
July 21, drew a yield of 0.639 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.62, versus 2.66 at the previous auction in May,
and an average of 2.84 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 41.6 percent of the securities
at July’s auction, compared with 40.7 percent at the May sale.
The average for the past 10 offerings is 42.4 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.7 percent of
the notes at the July sale, versus 3.1 percent in May and an
average of 4.7 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The auction today is the Treasury’s only offering of notes
or bonds this week. Next week, the government will sell $35
billion of two-year notes, the same amount of five-year debt and
$29 billion of seven-year securities in separate offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
