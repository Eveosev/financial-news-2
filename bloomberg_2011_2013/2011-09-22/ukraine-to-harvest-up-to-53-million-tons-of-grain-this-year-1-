Ukraine raised its grains forecast
for this year to 53 million metric tons, matching the 2008
record, according to First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev.  The harvest may climb to 54 million tons in the next few
years, Klyuev told lawmakers in  Kiev  today. The government’s
previous grain forecast on Sept. 8 was 52 million tons.  Ukraine would match its all-time record grain harvest in
2008 of 53 million tons, of which about 25 million tons
was exported. The country’s agriculture ministry last week
maintained the grain export forecast of 24 million tons.  Ukraine harvested 37 million tons of grain as of yesterday,
agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said in an e-mailed
statement today. Farmers harvested about 10 percent, or 1.86
million tons of corn, according to the statement.  Ukraine expects a record corn harvest this year which may
exceed 18 million tons, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk
said last week. Corn harvesting is “much slower” this year
than in 2010 as farmers seek to minimize drying costs by leaving
the crop in fields during hot, dry weather.  Klyuev said last week that Ukraine was to keep the duty for
exports of grain after Jan. 1 until the end of the marketing
year on June 30. Ukraine started taxing grain shipments from
July 1 for the first time in history as it sought ways to reduce
the state budget gap. Corn shipments are taxed at 12 percent,
wheat at 9 percent and barley 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
