World corn production will be lower
in the year through June 2012 than forecast a month ago after
the outlook for the U.S. crop was cut, the  International Grains
Council  said.  Global corn output in 2011-12 will be 845.2 million metric
tons, down from 849.1 million tons forecast in August, the
London-based IGC said in a monthly report published today,
cutting its outlook for a second time in two months.  Corn futures have gained 5.5 percent in  Chicago  this year
amid deteriorating crop conditions in the U.S., the largest
grower and exporter. That contrasts with wheat, which slumped 19
percent as the outlook for harvests in the European Union and
Russia improved.  “Global crop prospects have declined somewhat in the past
month, mainly because of a reduced U.S. maize forecast,” the
IGC said, using another name for corn. “The U.S. maize
production forecast is only partly balanced by an enhanced
outlook for crops to be planted in  South America .”  The U.S. corn harvest is estimated at 315 million tons from
a previous forecast of 325 million tons, and declining 0.4
percent from last year’s harvest of 316.2 million tons,
according to the IGC.  The estimate for world wheat output was raised to 678.9
million tons from 677.1 million tons, led by higher forecasts
for Australia, Russia and  Morocco , the report showed. The
council raised its outlook for a third time in as many months.  “Wheat crop prospects have improved somewhat, especially
in the Southern Hemisphere,” the IGC said.  Corn Consumption  High corn prices will weigh on consumption, according to
the IGC, which cut its outlook for global corn use in 2011-12 to
852.8 million tons, from a forecast of 857.7 million tons a
month ago. Corn use is forecast to rise from 846.9 million tons
a year earlier.  “With international prices likely to remain strong against
a backdrop of tight U.S. supplies, growth in world demand will
be slower than in recent years,” the grains council said.
“High prices are expected to cap U.S. domestic and export
demand.”  U.S. corn exports will slide 12 percent to 42.4 million
tons, the IGC said, cutting its forecast for shipments by 2.6
million tons from August. Exports by  Argentina , the second-
biggest shipper, will rise to 16.5 million tons, up from the
August estimate of 16 million tons, according to the report.  Outpacing Production  With corn consumption still expected to outpace production,
world stocks of grain at the end of June 2012 are forecast to
slide to 344.8 million tons from 358.6 million tons a year
earlier, according to the report. The outlook for ending stocks
was lifted by 2.4 million tons from August.  Wheat use is forecast to be 678.8 million tons from 655.6
million tons 2010-11, similar to production and leaving stocks
little changed year-on-year at 192.9 million tons.  “Competitive prices relative to maize continue to promote
the use of wheat in livestock feeds,” the IGC said. “Global
industrial use is revised lower due to slower-than-anticipated
expansion of ethanol production in the EU.”  The council raised the outlook for wheat exports by  Russia ,
Australia and Ukraine, while cutting its forecast for U.S.
shipments. Russia, which halted grain exports last year because
of a crop-wasting drought, is forecast to boost shipments
fourfold to 16 million tons, 500,000 tons more than in the
August forecast, the IGC said.  The U.S., the world’s largest wheat exporter, may ship 28.5
million tons of wheat this marketing year, 2.1 million tons less
than the quantity estimated a month ago, from an estimated 35.7
million tons in 2010-11.  World rice production on a milled basis is forecast to rise
to 461 million tons from 451 million tons in 2010-11, and 3
million tons more than expected in August, the IGC said. Output
will exceed consumption for a seventh year, lifting stockpiles
to 101.2 million tons from 97.8 million tons, according to the
council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
