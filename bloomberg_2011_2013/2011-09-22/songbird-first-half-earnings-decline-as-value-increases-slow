Songbird Estates Plc (SBD) , the company
that controls the Canary Wharf financial district in east
 London , said first-half earnings fell on declining rental income
following the sale of two buildings.  Pretax profit excluding changes in asset values and one-
time items fell to 6.6 million pounds ($10 million) in the six
months through June from 13.1 million pounds a year earlier,
Songbird said today in a statement. Net rental income fell to
124.6 million pounds from 153.5 million pounds a year earlier
after the sale of the former Lehman Brothers International
headquarters at 25 Bank Street and 5 Churchill Place.  “In the London market, where supply of high quality Grade
A space is still limited and the number of development
completions is still relatively low, there remain opportunities
for the group to add value and to maximize returns,” the
London-based company said.  Songbird is expanding its focus to the  City of London  from
 Canary Wharf , the smaller of U.K. capital’s two financial
districts. Songbird’s Canary Wharf Group unit is building a 37-
story tower there known as the Walkie-Talkie along with Land
Securities Group Plc. In July, it bought most of Royal Dutch
Shell Plc’s London headquarters campus in a 300 million-pound
joint venture with Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co.  Songbird fell less than 1 percent in London trading to 119
pence as of 9:58 a.m. The stock has declined about 16 percent
this year, giving the company a market value of 910 million
pounds.  Canary Wharf Dividend  Net income increased to 88 million pounds, or 11.7 pence a
share, from 3.5 million pounds, or 0.5 pence. Net financing
costs declined to 102.2 million pounds from 277.7 million
pounds.  Songbird has a 69 percent stake in Canary Wharf Group,
which owns 17 of the 35 buildings in the district and manages
the other 18. The company will receive 31.2 million pounds from
a Canary Wharf dividend declared yesterday.  The value of Songbird’s assets increased by 88 million
pounds in the first half, compared with a gain of 177.6 million
pounds a year earlier.  Footfall in the company’s retail properties increased by
3.3 percent and Songbird received approval for plans to add
another 43,000 square feet of shopping space in Canary Wharf.  “A productive start to 2011 with a further extension of
activity in central London and successful lettings/pre-lets at
Canary Wharf has helped place the Group in a strong position to
cope with macroeconomic uncertainty,” the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
