Scottish consumers using large
supermarkets face a double price increase on alcohol as the
government tries to tackle drink-related health and social
problems, the Herald said, citing Finance Secretary John
Swinney.  The government plans to introduce minimum pricing on
alcohol and also to increase business taxes on retailers above a
certain size selling both alcohol and tobacco, the Glasgow-based
newspaper said. That will raise 110 million pounds over the next
three years, the Herald said citing Swinney.  The additional charge on large retailers is “illogical and
discriminatory” and will make it harder for food retailers to
keep prices down, Ian Shearer, director of the Scottish Retail
Consortium, told the Herald.  To contact the reporter on this story:
