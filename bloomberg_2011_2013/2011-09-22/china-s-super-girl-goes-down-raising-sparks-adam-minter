Lately,  China ’s media regulators have done a good job alienating China's microblogging  youth . Now, authorities have suspended a popular reality show for a year for repeatedly overrunning its time slot. This isn't the first time  Hunan Satellite TV , China’s second most popular television network, has been in trouble because of Super Girl, an unabashedly low-brow, American Idol-like singing contest. Just a year after the show debuted in 2005, The Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film and Television ( SARFT ) suspended it for three years. To the sizable majority of Chinese netizens who prefer entertainment gossip to politics, this latest suspension of Super Girl struck a nerve. Zhou Lin, an accountant,  tweeted  on the Sina Weibo microblog: “Although I don't like to watch this year’s Super Girl, I think people have the right to be vulgar." Super Girl was a  revelation  to Chinese television viewers who were accustomed to the staid, zero-fun programming of state-run  CCTV , China’s largest television network. Whereas CCTV  tends to highlight  the talents of conservatory- and military-trained vocalists, Super Girl's most successful  contestants  were often gender-benders who could barely sing. China's young viewers embraced the show partly because they saw themselves in the contestants. Even more compelling was the participatory nature of the program. Like Idol, Super Girl allowed viewers to vote for their favorites. And vote they did. The  finals  of the inaugural season attracted more than eight million text-message votes. If Hunan TV had asked SARFT for permission to air Super Girl, it’s hard to imagine that the regulators would have granted it. But with Hunan TV's headquarters located 900 miles from Beijing in Changsha, the capitol of Hunan Province, they apparently didn't feel the need to ask. China has recently seen wider crackdowns on so-called mindless entertainment. In May, the Director of SARFT,  Cai Fuchao , announced that he was no longer interested in television programs that only entertain; he wanted to  develop a method  “to gauge the merits of TV programs scientifically.” And earlier this year  Bo Xilai , the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing, a massive municipality in southwest China, initiated a “red culture”  campaign . Bo banned sitcoms and other entertainment programs from his region's Chongqing Satellite Television. In their place, the station  now broadcasts  programs such as “Review of Classic Movies” and “Daily Red Songs.” Bo's actions have gained him the support of Beijing's political elite, but they have  cost  Chongqing Satellite Television viewers and advertising revenue. To some independently-minded netizens, the future of China's entertainment programming is  dim .  ShepherdZ echoed hundreds of other Sina Weibo users when he  tweeted : SARFT has been silent on the matter since stating that Super Girlwas suspended because it repeatedly ran over its given time limit. But Xinhua, the state-owned news service,  reported  that Hunan TV would replace Super Girl next year with programs that “promote moral ethics, public safety and provide practical information for housework.” In other words, SARFT's suspension of Super Girl is an effort to make Hunan TV more like CCTV. Some support the move. Speaking of Hunan TV, Wu Yongzhi, a brand manager in  Inner Mongolia ,  tweeted  on Sina Weibo: “It serves them right.” He continued: An editorial at Jingchu.cn, a news portal based in rural Hubei Province,  took it further : However, some netizens and newspaper editors suspected SARFT's motivations for the suspension. The Economic Observer, a highly-respected, independent financial newspaper, candidly  blamed  the show's suspension on its democratic approach to selecting a winner -- and the voting habit it could encourage in young viewers: A similarly-minded tweet from another Sina Weibo user, Brother Huai, referenced an even more delicate matter--The Tiananmen Uprising of 1989. He  wrote : That’s probably a stretch. More likely, the negative reaction to Super Girl's suspension will continue to push China’s entertainment-hungry netizens further onto the internet and away from state-regulated broadcast television. And the internet is a much tougher space to control. Hunan TV’s webmasters know this. On Sept. 20, just a few days after having to shut down Super Girl, the station’s homepage featured a slideshow that included a Chinese  heartthrob  mostly in the buff and two  female celebrities  in what appeared to be a staged kiss. For those tired of watching state-sponsored, officially filtered TV, it was hard to miss. (Adam Minter is the Shanghai correspondent for the World View blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)
