Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
11 percent to the lowest in 10 weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen, dropped 2.42 million barrels in
the week to yesterday to 18.86 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest
since the seven days ended July 13.  Stockpiles of middle distillates including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene increased 727,000 barrels, or 5.7 percent,
to 13.58 million. That’s a five-week high, based on the
ministry’s data.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate climbed 625,000 barrels, or 7.4 percent, to 9.06
million.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
