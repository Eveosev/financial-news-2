Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ENZN) , the
biotechnology company pressured to sell assets by investor  Carl Icahn , said it will cut almost half its workforce in June 2012
to reduce annual operating costs by about $6 million.  The move will reduce the staff to 47 and enable Enzon to
“more closely align its resources with the company’s research
and development activities,” the Piscataway, New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement.  Enzon, under pressure from Icahn, agreed last November to
sell its Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals unit, and announced in
February that Jeffrey Buchalter had resigned as chief executive
officer. Alex Denner, senior managing director at Icahn
Enterprises LP, is the company’s board chairman and Richard Mulligan, an Icahn associate and a genetics professor at  Harvard
Medical School , also serves on Enzon’s board.  Icahn’s firms owned about 12 percent of Enzon or 6.9
million shares, as of June 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Enzon declined 20 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $7.50 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading before the
announcement. The company’s shares have dropped 38 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
