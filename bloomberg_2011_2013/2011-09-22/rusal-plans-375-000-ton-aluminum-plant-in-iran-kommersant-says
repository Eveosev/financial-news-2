United Co. Rusal, the world’s
biggest aluminum maker, isn’t holding talks on building a plant
in  Iran , while saying the Persian Gulf country is a possible
opportunity as it expands in developing markets.  “Iran is one of numerous options for examination,” the
aluminum producer’s Moscow-based press service said by e-mail.
“There are no exact plans and the company does not hold any
project discussions in this country.”  Rusal was responding to a report today in the Kommersant
newspaper, citing a government document, that the alumimum
producer is in talks about building a plant in the Persian Gulf
country with output of as much as 375,000 tons a year, equal to
9 percent of its existing capacity.  Such an investment could violate U.S. sanctions against
Iran, depriving Rusal of access to the U.S. market, Kommersant
said. The U.S. accounts for almost 10 percent of Rusal’s sales,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
