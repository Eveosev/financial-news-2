The biggest European banks should
react to funding shortages by scaling back trading rather than
carrying out the “blackmail threat” of limiting their lending,
said Christophe Nijdam, an analyst at AlphaValue.  For banks like UBS AG with investment-banking activities,
“while they do face a snowballing squeeze in funding access,
they have alternatives before triggering a credit crunch to the
real economy,” Nijdam said in a phone interview from Paris.
“The alternative is to rein in the casino banking before
touching on the real banking.”  The  International Monetary Fund  said yesterday that the
European debt crisis has generated as much as 300 billion euros
($407 billion) in credit risk for European banks and called for
capital injections to reassure investors and support lending.  “A number of banks must raise capital to help ensure the
confidence of their creditors and depositors,” the IMF wrote in
its Global Financial Stability Report. “Without additional
capital buffers, problems in accessing funding are likely to
create deleveraging pressures at banks, which will force them to
cut credit to the real economy.”  Nijdam said banks that specialize in retail lending benefit
from stable retail deposits, and so are in a less precarious
position. If those banks were to cut back on the credit they
offer, it would have a bigger economic impact, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
