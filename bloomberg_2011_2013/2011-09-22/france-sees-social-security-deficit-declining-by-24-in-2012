The French government said its
social-security deficit will shrink by a quarter next year
through higher taxes and lower spending.  The social-security system, which covers spending on health
and pensions, will see its shortfall narrow to 13.9 billion ($19
billion) from an estimated 18.2 billion euros this year, the
Budget Ministry in Paris said in a statement today. Higher-than-
forecast revenue is helping the government undershoot its 20.9
billion-euro target for this year. The deficit was 23.9 billion
euros in 2010.  France  runs two sets of budget accounts. The general-
government account, which is fed by income tax and value-added
tax, covers expenses such as education, defense and justice. The
social-security account is funded through social charges.  The two are combined for the purposes of calculating
France’s Maastricht criteria, the basis for deficit rules set by
the euro region. The government is seeking to bring its overall
deficit to 4.5 percent of economic output in 2012 and to 3
percent in 2013, from an estimated 5.7 percent this year.  The government wants to bring the retirement system to
break even in 2018 after raising the pension age as part of a
package passed in November 2010 by President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
amid opposition from unions. It’s aiming to balance the health-
system budget in 2015.  Health-system losses are forecast to narrow to 5.9 billion
euros in 2012 from 9.6 billion euros in 2011. About half of the
improvement will come from new revenue included in next year’s
budget while greater efficiencies in hospitals and forcing down
the cost of prescription medicine will account for the rest, the
budget ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
