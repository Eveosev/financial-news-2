Russia’s grain exports may be
between 20 million to 22 million metric tons this marketing
year from a crop of 90 million tons, Deputy Agriculture Minister
Ilya Shestakov said.  Exports were about 7.4 million tons from July 1 until
Sept. 14, including 6.6 million tons of wheat, 720,000 tons of
barley and 28,000 tons of corn, he said at a  news conference  in
Moscow today. The government plans to boost grain exports by
cutting rail tariffs in half for some shipments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
