Estonia’s government approved plans
to build a high-speed rail link to  Latvia  under the  Rail Baltica 
project that would link the region to  Poland  and western Europe.  Estonia expects to start investment in 2018-2019 after the
government approved a feasibility study by U.K.-based consultant
AECOM, Economy Minister Juhan Parts told a news conference today
in the capital Tallinn. Estonia will seek financing from the
European Union’s next budget in 2014, he added.  “We should concentrate on building as many physical
connections with western Europe as possible,” Prime Minister
 Andrus Ansip  told the same news conference. Lithuanian Premier
Andrius Kubilius and Latvia’s Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis
both support the project, he added.  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- three former Soviet Baltic
republics -- have sought to align themselves with  Europe  after
the fall of communism 20 years ago, joining the EU in 2004. They
are seeking to bolster road, rail and energy connections with
the 27-nation bloc after they exited recessions in 2008-2009.  Estonia’s state-owned Eesti Raudtee rail company plans to
create a joint venture with its Latvian and Lithuanian
counterparts to develop the project, Parts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
