Russia ’s central bank may conduct
stress tests of banks in the fourth quarter amid volatility on
global financial markets, RIA Novosti reported, citing an
official at the bank.  “We did for half a year,” the news service quoted the
deputy head of the regulator’s banking control department,
Mikhail Kovrigin, as saying. “Theoretically it’s not hard to do
it every month.”  Banks lost around 50 billion rubles ($1.6 billion) in
August after the value of securities they hold depreciated,
Kovrigin, RIA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
