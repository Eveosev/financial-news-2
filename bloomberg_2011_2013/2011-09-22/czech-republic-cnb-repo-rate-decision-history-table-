The following table
details the changes in the Czech National Bankâ€™s
benchmark  interest rate .  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the interest rate
in March 2004 there have been a total of 76 rate decisions
by the bank for which surveys were conducted. In 13 cases the
survey did not match the decision made, resulting in the survey
correctly predicting the decision 82.9% of the time.  NOTE: The meeting on January 22, 1998 was the first time the
Board of the Czech National Bank made decisions on interest
rate setting within the framework of inflation targeting.  SOURCE: Czech National Bank  To contact the reporter on this story:
