(Corrects second paragraph to say yen decline was on
concern that  Bank of Japan (8301)  may act to stem currency gains.)  The yen pared its steepest intraday
loss against the dollar in a week, leaving it little changed at
76.53 to the U.S. currency as of 8:13 a.m. in London.  Japan ’s currency had earlier weakened as much as 0.7
percent to 76.97 yen, the biggest decline since Sept. 15. The
decline was sparked by concern the nation’s central bank may act
to stem gains in the currency to protect exports.  The yen yesterday rose to the most since it touched a post-
World War II record of 75.95 per dollar on Aug. 19. Finance
Minister Jun Azumi said yesterday he’s closely watching markets
and will take “bold” action on currencies if needed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
