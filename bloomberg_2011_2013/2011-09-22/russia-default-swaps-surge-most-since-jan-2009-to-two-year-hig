The cost of protecting Russian debt
against non-payment for five years using credit-default swaps
jumped 33 basis points to 270, according to data provider CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Thatâ€™s the biggest daily jump since January 2009 based on
closing prices, the data show, and the highest level since
September 2009.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
