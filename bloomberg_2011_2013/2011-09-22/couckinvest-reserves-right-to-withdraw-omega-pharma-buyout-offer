Omega Pharma (OME)  NV founder and Chief
Executive Officer Marc Coucke said he reserves the right to
withdraw his 36 euros-a-share buyout offer for the supplier of
consumer-health products after  Belgium ’s BEL20 Index closed
below 2,040.14 points today.  Couckinvest said any decision to maintain the buyout offer
doesn’t waive his right to invoke the withdrawal right,
according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
