Polish banks led declines on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  after the zloty’s slump to the lowest
level in 27 months revived concern that homeowners in Poland may
default on foreign-currency mortgages.  Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the financial-services group controlled
by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, headed for the lowest close
since July 2009, falling the most among companies in the WIG
Banking Index. The benchmark WIG20 Index, in which financial
shares have a more than 40 percent weighting, fell 5.5 percent
to 2,162.01 at 4:29 p.m. in Warsaw, extending this year’s
decline to 21 percent.  Poland’s currency tumbled as much as 1.6 percent to 4.4948
against the euro and lost 1.8 percent to 3.6702 against the
Swiss franc as stocks slumped worldwide after the U.S. Federal
Reserve signaled “significant downside risks” in the world’s
largest economy. The zloty’s decline makes it harder to pay back
foreign-currency home loans, which totaled 188.2 billion zloty
($57 billion) in July and accounted for 63 percent of mortgages
in  Poland , according to the country’s financial regulator.  “The weakening zloty is a burden on mortgage holders,”
Dariusz Gorski, a Warsaw-based analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA’s
brokerage said by phone. “Even though the zloty’s current
levels aren’t that dangerous for the industry, the key question
is how long the currency remains weak.”  Getin Holding lost 7.5 percent to 7.07 zloty, falling for
the first time in three days. Getin is among eastern European
lenders whose earnings are most vulnerable if a decline in the
zloty worsens the quality of franc-denominated home loan
portfolios, ING Groep NV said on Aug. 9.  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest bank, retreated 6.0
percent to 30.22 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , majority-owned by
UniCredit SpA, tumbled 5.0 percent to 128.5 zloty.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , in which Banco Comercial Portugues SA
seeks to sell its majority stake, lost 3.9 percent to 4.45 zloty
in a second day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
