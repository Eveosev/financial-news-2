European banks face the risk of a
“domino effect” on debt markets were  Greece  to default, a
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  executive said today.  Institutions would be able to handle a Greek default,
regardless of the level of bondholder losses and the bigger
concern is how it would affect Spain, Portugal, Ireland or
Italy, Markus Beumer, a member of the German lender’s board of
managing directors, said at a press briefing in Brussels.  “We have no concerns to handle and to manage Greece, but
what happens afterwards, nobody knows,” Beumer said.  Commerzbank’s Belgian unit is aiming for “double-digit”
revenue growth this year and beyond, said Burkhard von der
Osten, the country manager for Belgium and Luxembourg.  The Belgian unit, which focuses on clients working in more
than one European country, makes up about 10 percent to 12
percent of Commerzbank’s international business and about 1
percent to 2 percent of its overall revenue, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
