OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest
oil company, plans to sell 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of
refining and marketing assets by 2014 to increase its focus on
exploration and production.  The sale will be a “combination” of assets, including
refining units and filling stations, Chief Executive Officer
Gerhard Roiss said in an interview in Istanbul late yesterday.
OMV may leave some countries, he said, without identifying any
locations. The company plans to concentrate on businesses
“where we can supply out of our refineries.”  OMV won’t sell its Petrobrazi plant in Romania or refining
assets that are closely linked to petrochemical operations,
Roiss told reporters today. That would leave OMV’s 45 percent
stake in Bayernoil Raffinerie GmbH. Roiss said that while he
could “follow that assumption,” he wouldn’t comment on
individual assets.  The move will shift Vienna-based OMV’s focus to the
exploration and production unit, which is expected to account
for 55 percent of its assets by 2021, up from 35 percent in
2010, Roiss said. Gas and power assets will increase to 20
percent from 12 percent, while refining and marketing will fall
to 25 percent from 53 percent. Some international  oil companies 
including Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have sold
unprofitable European refineries.  No Borealis Sale  OMV will evaluate its R&M assets over the next six months,
Roiss said, adding that the company has no plans to sell its 36
percent stake in Borealis AG, a Vienna-based provider of
plastics for packaging. “Borealis is quite a profitable
business,” he said said.  Borealis’s Abu Dhabi Polymers Co. joint venture, known as
Borouge, is expected to go into operation by the start of 2014,
he said, and will provide a “big boost” to the unit’s
earnings. After that, “we can think about an IPO, but nothing
is decided.”  OMV expects to increase its oil and gas production by 2
percent to 4 percent a year until 2016 and to stabilize output
in  Romania  and  Austria  by 2014 at the equivalent of about
200,000 to 210,000 barrels of oil a day. That will increase
OMV’s production to 350,000 barrels by 2016, from 275,000
barrels in the second quarter.  Roiss also said that OMV aims to build more gas-fired power
plants in  Turkey  should there be a sufficient supply in equity
gas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
