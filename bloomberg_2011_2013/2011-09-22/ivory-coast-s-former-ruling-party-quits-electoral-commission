The former ruling party in  Ivory
Coast  has withdrawn from the country’s electoral commission,
saying it hasn’t been consulted about preparations for a
parliamentary vote, said spokesman Augustin Guehoun.  The Front Populaire Ivoirien, which held power during the
rule of Laurent Gbagbo, also can’t participate in the 32-member
commission because its representatives on the body are in exile,
he said by phone today from Abidjan, the commercial capital.  Gbagbo was captured in the city in April after he refused
to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara  following a disputed November
election. Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, may hold
parliamentary elections in late November or early December,
Ouattara said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
