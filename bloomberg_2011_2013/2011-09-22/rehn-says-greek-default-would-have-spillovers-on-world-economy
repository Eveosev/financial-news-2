European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said “an uncontrolled
default” by  Greece  would have “serious spillovers” on the
global economy.  “It is important to underline that the European Union is
not going to abandon Greece,” Rehn said today in the text of a
speech in  Washington . “An uncontrolled default or exit of
Greece from the euro zone would cause enormous economic and
social damage, not only to Greece but to the European Union as a
whole, and have serious spillovers to the world economy.”  At the same time, Rehn said Greece must implement “all the
corrective measures required, without any wavering,” under its
international aid program. “In the past couple of weeks, Greece
has gone a long way toward meeting these demands, but we are not
quite there yet,” the commissioner said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
