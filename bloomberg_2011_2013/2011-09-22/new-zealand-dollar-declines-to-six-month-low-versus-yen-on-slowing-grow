Australia ’s dollar slid to a six-
month low versus its U.S. counterpart, falling below parity for
the first time since August, after a survey indicated that
manufacturing in  China , the nation’s biggest trading partner,
may weaken.  New Zealand’s currency dropped to the lowest level in more
than four months against the greenback after a government report
showed second-quarter growth trailed economists’ estimates. The
two South Pacific currencies fell versus most major peers as
stocks and commodities tumbled after the  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday the  U.S. economy  faces “significant downside risks.”  “The key issue is the current appraisal of a much softer
global economic environment and the impact that’s having on the
Australian economy,” said Tim Riddell, Singapore-based head of
global markets research for  Asia  at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. “China is going to have an impact on
sentiment towards the Aussie because the Aussie is seen as a
freely tradable proxy for the growth profile in, particularly,
China, because of its resource need.”  Australia’s dollar fell to as low as 97.35 U.S. cents, the
least since March 17, before trading at 97.81 cents, down 2.6
percent, at 1:19 p.m. in  New York . The last time the currency
fell below parity was on Aug. 9. The Aussie weakened 2.7 percent
to 74.69 yen and reached 74.20 yen, the least since August 2010.  New Zealand’s currency dropped 2.6 percent to 78.09 U.S.
cents, from 80.14 yesterday, and slumped to 77.62, the least
since May 16. It declined 2.6 percent to 59.66 yen and touched
59.16 yen, the weakest since March.  Commodities, Stocks  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
dropped 4.4 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated
3.5 percent.  China’s manufacturing may contract for a third month in
September as measures of export orders and output decline. A
preliminary reading of 49.4 for a manufacturing index released
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today compared with
final readings of 49.9 for August and 49.3 for July. A number
below 50 indicates a contraction.  New Zealand’s economy expanded 0.1 percent in the second
quarter from previous three months,  Statistics New Zealand  said
in Wellington. That was less than all but one of 15 forecasts in
a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The Fed said yesterday after a two-day meeting it will
replace $400 billion of short-term  U.S. debt  in its portfolio
with longer-term securities to spur growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
