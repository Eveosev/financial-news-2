Danske Bank A/S doesn’t expect loan
losses at its Irish unit to improve until next year as Ireland’s
housing market takes longer to recover than the lender first
estimated.  “We currently don’t see any concrete signs of improvement
in the property market despite the fact that the Irish economy
looks to be picking up,” said Thomas Borgen, the head of
Danske’s international banking activities, in an e-mailed reply
to questions. “We still expect continued high writedowns in the
second half of 2011. We think we have to move into 2012 before
the property market might have bottomed out.”  Ireland’s economy has shrunk every year since 2007 after a
property boom turned to bust, pushing the country’s financial
system close to collapse and forcing the government to seek an
international bailout. The nation’s gross domestic product will
expand 0.4 percent this year, compared with a euro area average
of 1.6 percent, the  International Monetary Fund  said this week.  “Ireland has been, and is, very demanding for us,” Borgen
said. “The property market has fallen considerably and we’ve
continually needed to write down the value of our assets
there.”  Danske Bank back in December estimated its Irish loan
losses peaked in the second quarter of last year, while
predicting writedowns would remain high through 2011.  Housing Slump  The bank’s Irish and Northern Ireland businesses were the
only two to see losses before tax widen in the first half.
Impairments in the Irish unit rose to 3.13 billion kroner ($566
million) in the period from 2.74 billion kroner a year earlier.
Irish  home prices  have fallen 43 percent since peaking in 2007,
according to the country’s statistics office.  The difference between two-year Irish government bond
yields and borrowing costs on similar maturity German bunds
widened two basis points to 871. The 10-year spread also widened
two basis points to 694.  Danske Bank shares underperformed the 46-member Bloomberg
Index of European financials, which was up 1.4 percent as of
9:49 a.m. in  London . Danske shares gained 0.9 percent to 67.60
kroner.  Home loans at Danske’s Irish unit relative to property
values rose to 96.4 percent in the first half, versus 83.7
percent a year ago, according to its second-quarter report.  The bank’s Irish business has cost shareholders 34 billion
kroner ($6.24 billion), Borsen reported Sept. 19, citing a
confidential document obtained by the Copenhagen-based newspaper
and written by Danske Bank unit Danske Markets. The bank’s share
price would be 58 percent higher now had the lender not bought
the  National Irish Bank  and Northern Bank in 2004, Borsen said,
citing the analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
