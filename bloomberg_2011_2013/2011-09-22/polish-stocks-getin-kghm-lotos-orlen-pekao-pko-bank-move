Poland’s WIG20 Index slumped
166.30, or 7.3 percent, to 2,122.55 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Warsaw, falling the most in 31 months.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, plunged
2.65 zloty, or 8.2 percent, to 29.5 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, slumped 11.2 zloty, or 8.3
percent, to 124 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-
services group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, lost
0.79 zloty, or 10 percent, to 6.85 zloty.  The zloty slumped to the weakest level in almost 27 months
against the euro and depreciated versus the Swiss franc,
reviving concern homeowners in Poland may default on foreign-
currency mortgages. Non-zloty home loans totaled 188.2 billion
zloty ($57 billion) in July, accounting for 63 percent of all
mortgages, according to Poland’s financial regulator.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, sank 21.5 zloty, or 13 percent, to
139.5 zloty, heading for the lowest close since December. Copper
fell to the lowest price in one year in  London , heading into a
 bear market , after a China factory index signaling contraction
added to speculation of slowing metals demand.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, lost
3.39 zloty, or 9.2 percent, to 33.51 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) 
, the second-largest refiner, plunged 1.8 zloty, or 6.4
percent, to 26.2 zloty. Oil fell to the lowest price in more
than four weeks in  New York  after the U.S. Federal Reserve cited
“significant downside risks” to the economic outlook in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
