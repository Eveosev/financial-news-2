“The X Factor,” the new Fox
talent competition featuring  Simon Cowell , averaged 12.5 million
viewers last night, the television network’s biggest September
debut in five years.  The two-hour episode attracted 52 percent more viewers in
the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, a group targeted by
advertisers, than Fox’s programming on the same night a year
ago, the Los Angeles-based network said today in a statement,
citing Nielsen data.  “X Factor,” ranked fourth overall and second in the
targeted age group, may average 20 million viewers a night in
its first season and lift Fox’s fall-season ratings, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in San Francisco, said in a
report yesterday.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox is betting Cowell, who
departed “American Idol” at the end of the 2010 TV season, can
create another top-rated reality show.  The two-episode new-season debut of “Modern Family,” on
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, was the most-watched last night in total
viewers and the 18 to 49 group. Two dramas on  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
network also drew more total viewers, Nielsen data show.  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Rupert Murdoch, fell 53 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $15.60
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
shares have climbed 7.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
