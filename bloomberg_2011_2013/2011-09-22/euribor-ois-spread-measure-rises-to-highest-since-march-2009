A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  rose to the highest in 2 1/2 years
after the  Federal Reserve  signalled “significant downside
risks” to the  U.S. economy .  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the three-
month euro interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps,
climbed to 85 basis points as of 3:45 p.m. in London, the
highest since March 2009, Bloomberg data show. The gauge was at
82.6 yesterday.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  gave its judgement on the
economy as it announced measures aimed at preventing the U.S.
from sliding into another recession.  Standard & Poor’s  cut
ratings or lowered the outlooks on Italian banks including
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  yesterday after the government’s credit was
downgraded for the first time in five years this week.  Europe’s “crisis remains at an elevated level, and the
tone coming from the Fed heightens the macro risks which make
resolution of debt dynamics very difficult,”  Padhraic Garvey ,
head of developed debt-market strategy at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a note. “There is no sense that  market
sentiment  has latched on to a more positive tack,” he wrote.  European banks have the highest dollar funding costs in
almost three years, according to one indicator.  The cost of converting euro payments into dollars, measured
by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, was at 76 basis
points less than Euribor, from 70 yesterday and the biggest gap
since December 2008, Bloomberg data show.  Three-Month Swap  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 106 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, from 99 basis
points yesterday. The cost was 112.5 basis points under Euribor
on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive since December
2008.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- fell to 1.536 percent from 1.537
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor increased to 1.17 percent
from 1.14 percent.  The jump in one-week Euribor may be for technical reasons,
according to  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in London. “This may be a reflection of increased
funding pressure over month- and quarter-end,” he said.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 10th day, to 0.35806 percent from 0.35556
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 16, 2010.  TED Spread  The TED spread, the difference between what lenders and the
U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose to 36 basis
points, the highest since July 20, 2010, from 35 basis points.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 121.4 billion euros ($157 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based lender yesterday, compared with 114.7
billion euros on Sept. 20 and 197.8 billion euros on Sept. 12,
the ECB said.  Credit-default swap indexes measuring investors’ perception
of European banks’ creditworthiness soared to records.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior
debt of 25 lenders and insurers rose 26.5 basis points to 315.5,
while a gauge of subordinated-note risk increased 53 basis
points to 555, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
