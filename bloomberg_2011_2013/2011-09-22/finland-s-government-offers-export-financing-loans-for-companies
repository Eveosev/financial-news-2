Finland’s government approved
measures to improve companies’ access to funding amid weakening
economic prospects, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Finland will set up an export-financing scheme of at most 3
billion euros ($4 billion), in which Suomen Vientiluotto Oy is
tasked with lending money to companies and Finnvera Oyj with
raising the funds and managing liquidity, the ministry said.  The government also extended Finnvera’s investment loan
program and Suomen Teollisuussijoitus Oy’s industrial investment
program.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
