Petrominerales Ltd., a Calgary-
based company that explores for and produces oil in  Colombia ,
tumbled the most since it began trading in Bogota last month
after failing to find oil in three exploration wells.  Petrominerales fell 11.3 percent to 48,200 pesos as of 4
p.m. New York time.  Petrominerales said it didn’t find commercial amounts of
hydrocarbons at tests at the Babaco-1, Calandria-1 and Borugo-1,
according to a regulatory filing. The company also said it has
resumed 95 percent of production that was cut at the Corcel and
Guatiquia block this month and will recover the rest of
production in the next week.  “Petrominerales’ update on its Colombia exploration
campaign showed a very negative balance with various dry
wells,” said Juan David Pineros, analyst at Interbolsa SA,
Colombia’s biggest brokerage. “The behavior of international
markets and oil’s drop also weighed on the stock.”  Oil fell to a six-week low after the  Federal Reserve  cited
“significant downside risks” to the  U.S. economy , the world’s
biggest consumer of crude.  August production averaged 39,323 barrels of oil per day as
at least two wells were shut and output at the Candelilla-3 well
trailed forecasts, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
