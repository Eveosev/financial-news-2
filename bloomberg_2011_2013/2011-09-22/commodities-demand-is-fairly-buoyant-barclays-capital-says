Commodities demand is not slowing
fast enough to make up for disruptions in supplies, said  Kevin
Norrish , managing director of commodities research at  Barclays
Capital  in London.  Demand is “fairly buoyant,” Norrish said at a meeting in
London today. “Demand is slowing down but it’s not slowing down
fast enough to alleviate pressures on the supply side.”  Commodities erased gains for the year today as the Federal
Reserve’s outlook for “significant downside risks” for the
U.S. economy added to signs of slowing growth. China’s
manufacturing may shrink for a third month in September, a
preliminary index of purchasing managers from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
