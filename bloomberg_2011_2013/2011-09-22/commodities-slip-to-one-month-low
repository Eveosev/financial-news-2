Commodities erased this year’s
gains after the U.S.  Federal Reserve  said the world’s
biggest economy faces “significant downside risks,” boosting
speculation raw-material demand will falter.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities dropped
4.1 percent as of 2:44 p.m. in  London , bringing the decline this
year to 3.1 percent. Copper fell to a one-year low in New York
and London and oil dropped to the lowest in four weeks.  The Federal Reserve said yesterday it will replace $400
billion of short-term debt with longer-term Treasuries to spur
growth, saying it sees “significant downside risks” to growth.
The Dollar Index gained to a seven-week high, making commodities
trading in the U.S. currency more costly for buyers using other
monies.  “We’re seeing the dollar strengthen and that’s weighing
down on the whole commodity complex,”  Dan Smith , an analyst at
Standard Chartered Plc in London, said today by phone.  The world economy will expand 4 percent this year and in
2012, the  International Monetary Fund  said on Sept. 20, cutting
forecasts made in June for a 4.3 percent expansion this year and
4.5 percent in 2012.  Manufacturing in  China , the world’s largest metals user,
may shrink for a third month in September, according to a
preliminary index of purchasing managers from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics released today. The initial reading for
this month was 49.4 compared with a final 49.9 for August and
49.3 for July. Figures below 50 signal a contraction.  ‘Risk Aversion’  “On the back of the plentiful bearish news and the further
rise of  risk aversion , it is not surprising that metal prices
have come under strong pressure,” Commerzbank AG said in a
report. The U.S. is the second biggest metals consumer.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as
much as 6.6 percent to $7,750 a metric ton, the lowest price
since Sept. 22 last year. Prices in London have dropped 24
percent from the record $10,190 on Feb. 15, qualifying for a
 bear market  if they close at or below $8,152.  Copper may drop to as low as $7,000 as concerns grow about
the global economic slowdown, Im Byeong Chloe, an executive at
 South Korea ’s Public Procurement Service, said on Sept. 21. The
contract hasn’t traded below $7,000 since July 2010.  Gold for December delivery declined as much as 4.3 percent
to $1,731.20 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Immediate-
delivery gold fell as much as 2.9 percent to $1,730.28 an ounce.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 8.4 percent
to $37.06 an ounce on the Comex.  November-delivery oil fell as much as 6.6 percent to $80.25
a barrel, the lowest price for a most-active contract since Aug.
19, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Wheat for December
delivery fell as much as 3.3 percent to $6.45 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
