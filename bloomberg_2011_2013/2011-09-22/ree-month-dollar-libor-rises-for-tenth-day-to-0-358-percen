The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars increased
for the 10th straight day, reaching the highest level since
August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.35806 percent from 0.35556 percent yesterday,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest rate since Aug. 16, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 27.01 basis points at 11:41 a.m. in London, up
from 26.81 basis points yesterday. The spread reached 28.95
basis points on Sept. 19, the widest on a closing-price basis
since July 27, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what banks and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose the
most in more than a week. It widened to 35.80 basis points from
35.05 basis points yesterday. That’s the widest since July 20,
2010, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
