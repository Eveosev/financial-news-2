A reshuffled Cabinet in the first few months of a new administration isn't usually cause for alarm. But President  Dilma Rousseff  has lost her chief of staff, four other Cabinet ministers, and dozens of government staffers since taking office in January -- and the press is smelling blood. Newspapers like the  Folha de Sao Paulo  and its rival the  Estado de Sao Paulo  won't leave the subject alone. The trouble started when Rousseff's chief of staff,  Antonio Palocci , quit in June after Folha  revealed  he had increased his personal worth 20 times in four years and had recently bought a luxurious new apartment, despite his modest government salary. A consultancy he owned also made hefty profits in 2010, an election year. In a television  interview , Palocci denied wrongdoing, but would not reveal who his clients were or how his firm made its money: Soon after, more Cabinet ministers started falling. In July, the news magazine Veja  reported  that officials in the transportation ministry had conducted an "over-invoicing" scheme and alleged they had accepted bribes. Transportation Minister Alfredo Nascimento suspended several officials and denied knowledge of wrongdoing. Then the O Globo newspaper  revealed  that prosecutors were investigating links between a company owned by Nascimentoâ€™s son and one that benefited from contracts awarded by the ministry. Nascimento resigned, and called for an investigation, but again admitted no guilt. Defense Minister Nelson Jobim went down next after he admitted in August to voting for  Jose Serra , Rousseff's rival presidential candidate, and allegedly making disparaging remarks about his colleagues. About a week later, Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi fell under a storm of allegations. Veja alleged that a lobbyist had a "clandestine office" in the ministry and acted as an intermediary with outside companies. Rossi promised a clean-up. Then Veja  carried  another story by a whistleblower saying that Rossi could have received a bribe in an auction. In his resignation letter, Rossi said the allegations were "lies" and said his parents and friends had been attacked. "My family is my limit," he said. Folha ran a special section dedicated to corruption on Sept. 4. "A value equivalent to at least the Bolivian economy was diverted from government safes from 2002-2008," estimated columnist Mariana Carneiro. The paper ran a  photo gallery  of the fallen ministers looking sheepish on Sept. 14, with the latest victim, 80-year-old Minister of Tourism Pedro Novais, looking as he frequently did: bewildered. Novais clung to his job while 36 of his staff were indicted in a Federal Police investigation into bribery and corruption. Then Folha  revealed  that he was using government money to pay his maid and a government driver to take his wife to upscale Brasilia stores. And the paper alleged that he had previously been involved in questionable deals as an official in his home state of Maranhao. He denied wrongdoing. In his reign at the ministry, Novais signed just one act. His successor, Gastao Vieira, is also from Maranhao. And that says a lot about who enjoys real power in  Brazil : Maranhao is the North East state dominated by 81-year-old Senate president (and former Brazilian president) Jose Sarney and his family. Sarney's Democratic Movement Party of Brazil, or PMDB, forms a key part of Rousseff's ruling coalition, and his hand is seen behind both appointments. "Connected to Sarney, Gastao Vieira will be the new Minister of Tourism,"  announced  the headline on news site Terra Sept. 14. The choice of Vieira had followed a "fierce dispute" among the PMDB, said Terra, because although the party wanted to maintain control of the ministry, too many of its potential candidates had scandals or corruption allegations hanging over them. The nomination "made analysts and the general public ask: why, so many years after leaving the presidency, does Jose Sarney conserve so much power in the republic?" wrote Vera Magalhaes in a column in Folha on Sept. 17. Some Brazilians see Sarney as the last survivor of "colonelism" -- a throwback to the days when rich, powerful landowners, or colonels, ran entire Brazilian states, buying votes with food and intimidation in a policy known as "bread and circus." In Maranhao, Sarney's daughter is in her fourth term as governor, and his son runs the local television station. The family is so powerful that Vieira felt it important to  tell  TV Globo Sept. 15 that his new job had nothing to do with their influence: "Absolutely not. I have had a connection with the Sarney family for many years and he has never imposed on me to do anything," Vieira said. In 2009, Sarney himself survived a blizzard of corruption allegations -- including accusations that money destined for an educational foundation was diverted to front companies, that his son was involved in  money laundering  and that 663 "secret acts" were passed in the senate under his leadership, some of which benefited Sarney's family members. Sarney  denied  all of this. And days after Vieira's appointment a high court announced that it had annulled a federal police investigation into the activities of the Sarney family. In August, Sarney was seen using one of Maranhao's new emergency helicopters, allegedly for personal business, while a patient lay on the runway -- by Folha again, which also  ran  an amateur video of the incident. "He's not just any person,"  said  State Deputy Magno Bacelar. "Do you want the Senate president riding on a donkey?" To accompany its coverage of the incident, Veja ran a widely used  photograph  of Sarney. He's sitting on an ornate leather seat in the corridors of power, smiling knowingly, unlikely to be riding a donkey out of government any time soon.
