Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell the
most in more than two weeks before an inflation report due this
week.  Consumer prices climbed 23.02 percent in August from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since November 2008, official data
show. The General Statistics Office is due to publish data for
September by Saturday.  The yield on five-year government notes rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.47 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest increase since Sept. 7.  “The trend is still unclear and investors are waiting”
for the inflation report, said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based money-market dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank.  The dong strengthened 0.1 percent to 20,812 per dollar as
of 3:20 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628 today,
unchanged since Aug. 24, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
