German bonds rose, with 10- and 30-
year yields dropping to record lows, as speculation the world
economy is headed for another recession increased demand for
safer securities.  Ten-year bunds gained for a fifth day after the  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday there were “significant” risks to the
 U.S. economy  and it would buy more longer-dated debt. Dutch
yields also dropped to a record after a report showed European
services and manufacturing shrank. Italian and Spanish bonds
gained, reversing losses that earlier pushed  Italy ’s 10-year
yield to the most since Aug. 5, as the  European Central Bank  was
said to be buying the two countries’ debt.  “If you don’t get any growth it will be even more
difficult for southern Europe to get through the debt crisis and
that’s why the periphery is being punished while the core
performs,” said Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen. “Concern that we could get another recession
remains intact.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield dropped eight basis points to 1.70
percent at 4:20 p.m. in  London , after falling to 1.648 percent,
the lowest since at least 1989 when Bloomberg started collecting
data on the bonds. The 2.25 percent security due September 2021
gained 0.70, or 7 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,346) face amount, to
105.020.  Thirty-year yields declined as much as 17 basis points to
2.43 percent. Ten-year bund futures climbed to a record high,
with the contract expiring December rising as much as 0.8
percent to 139.07 before being 0.4 percent higher at 138.53.  Services Shrink  Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank for the
first time in two years in September as the region’s debt crisis
added to concerns the economy could slide back into a recession.
A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers fell to 49.2 this month from 50.7 in August, Markit
Economics said.  European industrial orders dropped the most in 10 months in
July, falling 2.1 percent from June, when they dropped 1.2
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast a decrease of 1.2 percent,
the median of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The Dutch 10-year yield fell six basis points to 2.17
percent, after dropping to a record 2.138 percent. Finland’s 10-
year rate slid five basis points to 2.21 percent.  Stocks Slide  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index of shares slid 4.6 percent and
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 4.1 percent. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index declined for a fourth day and was down 3
percent, extending yesterday’s 2.9 percent slide.  “There are significant downside risks to the economic
outlook, including strains in global financial markets,” the
Fed’s Open Market Committee said after a two-day meeting ended
yesterday. The U.S. central bank will buy bonds with maturities
of six-to-30 years through June while selling an equal amount of
debt due in three years or less, the FOMC said.  “As the debt crisis remains the dominant theme and there
is no all-clear from the economic front, interest in safe
investments will probably remain intact,” Ulrich Wortberg, an
economist at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt ,
wrote today in a note to clients.  Treasury 10-year yields dropped to a record 1.7519 percent
today and the Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency
against those of six trading partners, rose to the highest in
seven months.  Italy, Spain  Italian and Spanish bonds rallied as people with knowledge
of the transactions said the ECB bought the securities today.
Italy’s 10-year yield declined nine basis points to 5.67
percent, after rising as much as nine basis points to 5.85
percent. Similar-maturity Spanish yields decreased 11 basis
points to 5.30 percent.  The extra yield on 10-year Italian bonds over German bunds
narrowed one basis point to 398 basis points. The Spanish spread
was three basis points lower at 361 basis points.  Greek notes fell, after earlier gaining when the heavily
indebted nation said it will accelerate budget cuts to keep
emergency loans flowing.  The two-year yield rose 14 basis points to 66.64 percent.
The 10-year rate gained two basis points to 23.57 percent.  Volatility on  Austria ’s sovereign debt was the highest
among euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year spreads and credit-defaults swaps.
Swings on German 10-year bonds were 1.5 times the 90-day
average, according to the Bloomberg gauge, which follows
developed markets.  German  government bonds  have returned 2.8 percent this
month, extending this year’s gain to 8.1 percent, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries rose 8.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
