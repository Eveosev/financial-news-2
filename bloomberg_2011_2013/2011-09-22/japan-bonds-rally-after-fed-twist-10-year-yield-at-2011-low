Japanese bonds climbed after  U.S.
Treasuries  rallied on the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to buy longer-
term debt and sell shorter maturities to sustain the economic
recovery.      The 10-year note’s yield fell to 0.965 percent, the least
this year, while 30-year yields declined three basis points to
1.87 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
