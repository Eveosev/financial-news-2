Bank of Israel  Governor Stanley Fischer said he doesn’t consider the  Federal Reserve ’s program
of lengthening the average maturity of its bond portfolio
problematic.  “I don’t find any particular problem with the Operation
Twist,” Fischer said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. The Fed
has to “weigh potential costs of that against potential
benefits. I don’t see that that’s a terrible idea.”  The central bank said yesterday it will extend the average
maturities of the Treasuries in its portfolio by purchasing $400
billion of long-term debt while selling an equal amount of
shorter-term securities in a move dubbed “Operation Twist.”
The Fed also maintained its pledge to hold its benchmark
 interest rate  near zero through the middle of 2013 so long as
unemployment stays high and the inflation outlook is
“subdued.” The target rate has been in a range of zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  “There is very little left for the Fed to do,” Fischer
said. “It seems to be sensible thing to do.”  Fischer, 67, became Bank of Israel governor in 2005. He
earned a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1969 and taught there over the next three
decades, serving as the thesis adviser to  Ben S. Bernanke , now
the Fed chairman.  Fischer also said he doesn’t “see the case for Italy
leaving the euro.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
