Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX)  said it won a
court ruling blocking Mylan Inc. from selling a generic version
of its Doryx antibiotic.  Warner Chilcott, based in Dublin, sued Mylan in federal
court in  Newark , New Jersey, in 2009, claiming infringement of
various patents, including one issued in 2008 on its 150-
milligram tablets.  In granting a preliminary injunction against Mylan, based
in Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania , U.S. District Judge William Martini
ruled that Warner Chilcott had shown a reasonable likelihood of
success on its claim that its 150-milligram patent was valid and
had been infringed, the Irish drugmaker said today in a
statement.  “Mylan believes that the district court erred in its
decision to grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary
injunction and we intend to seek an expedited trial or other
expedited relief from the order,” Mylan spokewoman Nina Devlin
said in an e-mail. “Mylan remains confident in its position in
the case.”  The ruling couldn’t immediately be confirmed in court
records.  The case is Warner Chilcott Laboratories v. Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 09-cv-2073, U.S. District Court, District
of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
