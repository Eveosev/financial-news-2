UltraTech Cement Ltd. (UTCEM)  may buy a
cargo of 75,000 metric tons of power-station coal from  Russia 
after it issued a tender for two shipments,  India Coal Market
Watch  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Separately, the Vedanta Group plans to buy two cargoes of
imported thermal coal of Indonesian or South African origin,
India Coal reported.  India may need to import 114 million tons of coal for the
year ending March 2012 to plug a supply gap, according to the
coal newsletter, citing Indiaâ€™s coal minister Sriprakash
Jaiswal. The gap widened to 83 million tons last year from 50
million in 2007-08 as production growth slowed, India Coal
reported Jaiswal as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
