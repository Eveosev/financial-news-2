Israel’s embassy in  Georgia  said it
“regrets to learn about maltreatment” of oil trader Rony Fuchs
and his partner Zeev Frenkel, who were jailed by a court in the
capital, Tbilisi, in April for bribery.  “Letters of concern and protests regarding the above
mentioned maltreatment were sent to Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Corrections and Legal Assistance, Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs  and Public Defender of Georgia,” Israel’s
embassy said today in an e-mailed statement.  The two men have been intimidated and treated
disrespectfully, including verbal abuse, Archil Kbilashvili,
Fuchs’s lawyer, said by phone. Shota Khizanishvili, a spokesman
for Georgia’s Interior Ministry, didn’t reply to a request for
comment. Calls to the Ministry of Corrections and Legal
Assistance went unanswered.  Fuchs and his partner Zeev Frenkel were sentenced to seven
years in prison and ordered to pay 600,000 lari ($366,000) in
penalties after being found guilty of attempting to bribe
officials in 2010. The men had been trying to negotiate a $100
million settlement from the Georgian government after an oil
project in the country was expropriated. An arbitration panel in
 London  ruled last March that Georgia owed Fuchs and a Greek
partner $98 million plus interest.  Fuchs’s family has asked Georgian President Mikheil
Saakashvili for a pardon and is awaiting a response, Kbilashvili
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
