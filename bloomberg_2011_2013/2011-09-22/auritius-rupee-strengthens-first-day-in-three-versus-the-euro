Mauritius’s rupee appreciated for
the first day in three against the euro, the currency of its
main trading partner, and increased versus the dollar, reversing
earlier declines.  The currency strengthened as much as 2.4 percent, and
traded 1.6 percent higher at 39.1475 per euro by 2:04 p.m. in
 Port Louis , the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 28.90 per dollar.  An Indian Ocean island nation with a population of 1.3
million people, Mauritius derives 41 percent of its foreign-
currency income in euros, according to Bank of Mauritius data.
 Europe  is the country’s main source of visitors, and biggest
buyer of manufactured goods, the  Central Statistics Office  said.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.9236 to 28.0905
and the selling price increased to 29.4033 compared with 29.2572
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
