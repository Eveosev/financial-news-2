Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said global financial markets are in a “dangerous”
situation because of the European debt crisis, and that
investors are acting on fear.  “We’re now at a stage where the uncertainty in global
markets is getting to extremely dangerous levels,” Harper told
reporters in Ottawa after meeting with U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron .  Harper said European policy makers need to act decisively
on their deficits, and that the crisis will only worsen if debts
are not reduced.  Cameron told reporters is it crucial that Greece implement
the austerity measures it pledged to do.  To contact the reporter on this story:
