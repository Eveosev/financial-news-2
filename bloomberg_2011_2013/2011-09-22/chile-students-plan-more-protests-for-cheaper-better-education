Chilean students will stage
demonstrations in downtown Santiago today after talks with the
government to cut the cost and improve the quality of education
broke down, the University of Chile student federation said in a
 statement  posted on its website.  Students have been protesting for more than three months
for increased education spending and a ban on for-profit
schools. Demonstrators rejected a government offer to create an
education fund worth about 2 percent of gross domestic product
and demand authorities freeze education bills now in Congress
before they agree to restart talks that started Sept. 3.  The governmentâ€™s aeronautical authority is forecasting rain
today in Santiago, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
