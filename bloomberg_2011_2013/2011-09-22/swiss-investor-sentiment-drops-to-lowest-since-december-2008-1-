Swiss investor confidence dropped
to the lowest in almost three years in September as a worsening
European debt crisis and faltering export demand clouded the
growth outlook.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, fell to
minus 75.7 from minus 71.4 in August, the  ZEW Center for
European Economic Research  in  Mannheim ,  Germany , and Zurich-
based  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s the lowest since December 2008.  The Swiss economy is showing increasing signs of a slowdown
after growing in the second quarter at the weakest pace since
emerging from a 2009 recession. The central bank on Sept. 15
reiterated its pledge to defend a franc ceiling of 1.20 versus
the euro to protect foreign sales and the government earlier
this week lowered its projection for 2012 economic growth and
exports.  “Over the coming months, foreign sales will decline
further,” said Marc Bruetsch, chief economist at Swiss Life
Asset Management AG in Zurich. “However, we might see a
recovery in the second half of 2012 as the SNB’s cap on the
franc will help exporters.”  The Swiss franc was little changed after the report,
trading at 1.2286 versus the euro at 11:28 a.m. in Zurich, down
0.6 percent from yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
