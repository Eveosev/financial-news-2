Greentown China Holdings Ltd. (3900) 
hasn’t received a notice from China’s banking regulator and
there is no investigation into the group, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  The property developer was 17 percent lower at HK$4.47 as
of 2:16 p.m. in Hong Kong trading. Greentown noted the decrease
in the share price and is unaware of reasons for the decline, it
said. The China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered  trust
companies  to inform the regulator of business dealings with
Greentown, Reuters reported yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
