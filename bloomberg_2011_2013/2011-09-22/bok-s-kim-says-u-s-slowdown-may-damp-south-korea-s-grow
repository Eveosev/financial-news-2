A one percentage point drop in the
U.S. economic growth rate may lower South Korea’s expansion rate
by 0.4 percentage point, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said in  Washington  today, citing the central bank’s estimates.  The  International Monetary Fund  this week cut its
projection for U.S. growth to 1.5 percent in 2011 from the 2.5
percent it forecast in June.  The IMF also reduced its estimate for South Korea’s
expansion to 4 percent this year from 4.5 percent. The nation’s
economy grew 3.4 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in seven quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
