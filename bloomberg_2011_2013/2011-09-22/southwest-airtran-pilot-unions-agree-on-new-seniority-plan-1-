Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  pilot union
leaders and their counterparts at AirTran Holdings Inc. agreed
to a new plan to mesh their seniority lists as the two carriers
combine operations.  Leaders of the  Air Line Pilots Association  at AirTran voted
to send the plan to their members for approval or rejection,
said Neal Hanks, a spokesman for the  Southwest Airlines Pilots’
Association . The Southwest union is considering the matter
during a board meeting that runs through tomorrow, he said.  A plan to move pilots from both carriers onto one seniority
list must be approved by each union before they can negotiate a
single contract with Dallas-based Southwest. Seniority is
important to pilots because it helps determine compensation,
what type of plane they fly and what schedules they work.  The new plan was negotiated after union leaders at  Orlando ,
Florida-based AirTran opted not to send the original accord to
their members for a vote. The two unions had agreed to turn the
issue over to an independent arbitrator if they couldn’t agree
on a plan by Oct. 1.  Southwest, which completed its purchase of AirTran in May,
expects to receive a single operating certificate from U.S.
regulators in 2012’s first quarter. Integrating operations into
one carrier will take a few years, Southwest has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
