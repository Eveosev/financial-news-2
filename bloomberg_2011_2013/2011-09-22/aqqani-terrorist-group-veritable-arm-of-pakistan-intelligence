The Haqqani terrorist network,
which the U.S. blames for attacks on Americans and others in
 Afghanistan , acts as a “veritable arm” of Pakistan’s
intelligence service, the U.S.’s top uniformed official said
today.  Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that
Haqqani network operatives, with support from Pakistan’s Inter-
Services Intelligence agency, “planned and conducted” the
Sept. 14 assault on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  “We also have credible intelligence” that the Haqqani
network was behind the June 28 attacks against the Inter-
Continental Hotel in Kabul “and a host of other smaller but
effective operations,” Mullen said in his likely last
appearance before the panel before retiring next week.  Mullen said the Pakistan Army and ISI are using the Haqqani
network as “proxies” for “hedging their bets” for when the
U.S. leaves the region “or redressing what they feel is an
imbalance of regional power.”  “In choosing to use violent extremist as a instrument of
policy, the government of  Pakistan  and most especially the Army
and ISI -- jeopardizes not only the prospect of our strategic
partnership, but also Pakistan’s opportunity to be a respected
nation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
