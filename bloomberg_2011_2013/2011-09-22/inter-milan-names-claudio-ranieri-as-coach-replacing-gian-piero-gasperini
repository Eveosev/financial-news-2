Inter Milan  hired Claudio Ranieri
as coach, one day after Gian Piero Gasperini was fired following
a winless start to the season.  Ranieri signed a two-year contract, Inter said on its
 website . He’ll make his debut when Inter visits Bologna in two
days.  Gasperini was dismissed a day after a 3-1 loss to newly
promoted Novara left Inter with a tie and two losses from its
first three Serie A matches this season.  Ranieri last managed at Roma, where he resigned in
February. He’s also coached teams including Juventus, Chelsea,
Atletico Madrid and Valencia.  The 59-year-old becomes Inter’s fourth coach since  Jose Mourinho  led the club to victory in the  Champions League , Serie
A and Italian Cup in 2009.  Rafael Benitez took over after Mourinho left for Real
Madrid and lasted six months before being fired in December.
Leonardo finished out the rest of the season before leaving to
become sporting director at Paris Saint-Germain and was replaced
in June by Gasperini.  Inter is winless in five overall games this season after
losing at home 1-0 to Trabzonspor in its opening Champions
League group match last week and falling 2-1 to rival AC Milan
in the Italian Super Cup last month. It visits CSKA Moscow in
the Champions League on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
