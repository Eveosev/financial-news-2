Argentina ’s central bank net
reserves are likely to fall to $33.7 billion next year on
capital flight and government plans to use $5.7 billion to pay
debt, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report.  Such a level of reserves, which now stand at $49.3 billion,
would be “inadequate,” according to the report by analysts
including Marcos Buscaglia.  “‘Free disposable reserves’ are likely to be low or null
at the end of 2011 according to our estimates,” the report
said. “The further use of reserves for debt payments is likely
to arouse some controversy.”  Argentina can use free disposable reserves, which are the
amount of reserves that exceeds the monetary base, to pay debt,
a gap that is narrowing as reserves shrink and money supply
increases. The monetary base rose 18 percent to 191.6 billion
pesos ($45.7 billion) this year, $3.6 billion less than the
current level of reserves.  The government may curb the use of reserves to manage the
currency, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
