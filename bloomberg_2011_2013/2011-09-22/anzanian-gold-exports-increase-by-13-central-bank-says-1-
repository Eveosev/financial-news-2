Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with Mali as  Africa ’s third-largest producer of the
precious metal, climbed to $1.7 billion in the year through June
from $1.5 billion a year earlier, the central bank said.  The current-account deficit, the widest measure of trade in
goods and services, expanded to $2.76 billion in the period from
$2.56 billion previously, the Dar es Salaam-based Bank of
Tanzania said in a statement on its website today.  “This development was attributed to an increase in the
value of imported goods and services that outweighed the
increase in the value of exports of goods and services as well
as official current transfers,” the bank said.  Exports totaled $6.48 billion, with the central bank
attributing the increase in the value of gold shipments to
rising bullion prices.  Imports climbed 19.2 percent to $9.93 billion in the year
ending June from $7.97 billion a year earlier, the bank said.  “Imports of food and foodstuff recorded a significant
increase about 40 percent largely due to increase in price of
cereals,” it said.  Tanzania’s foreign exchange reserves were $3.6 billion as
of June, sufficient to cover 4.4 months of projected imports,
according to the statement.  The country’s debt increased to $11.6 billion in the year
ended June from the $11.4 billion registered at the end of the
preceding month, the statement said.  “The increase is attributed to recording of new external
debt disbursements, accumulation of interest arrears, and
issuance of  Government securities .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
