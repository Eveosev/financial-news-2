Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele proposed February 2014 as a deadline for migration to
 Europe ’s common electronic payments system SEPA.  “While many may think it would be desirable or necessary
to have a transition period going beyond February 2014, such an
option is not on the agenda anymore and not realistic,” Thiele
said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. Companies’ investment for
the migration will quickly pay off, he added.  SEPA enables customers to make euro transfers across
borders within Europe using a single payment account and a
single set of payment instruments. Thirty-two European countries
are participating in SEPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
