Colombia ’s peso plunged to its
lowest level this year as concern central banks in developed
countries are running out of tools to prevent a recession led
investors to shun higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso plunged 2.2 percent to 1,915.68 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:37 a.m. New York time, wiping out this year’s gain, from
1,874 yesterday. Earlier, it touched 1,932.50, its weakest
intraday level since Dec. 29. The peso is down 0.3 percent this
year.  The U.S. Federal Reserve said yesterday it saw
“significant downside risks” in the world’s biggest economy
and it will replace $400 billion of short-term debt with longer-
term Treasuries to spur growth.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.55
percent. The bond’s price fell 0.599 centavos to 119.651
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
