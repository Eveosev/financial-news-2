Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  Chief Financial
Officer Pavel Cejka said the Societe Generale SA Czech unit may
need to take an additional charge on Greek bonds it holds in its
portfolio if the country defaults on its debt,  Lidove Noviny 
 reported .  Komercni still holds “slightly more” than 5 billion
koruna ($271.6 million) in Greek state bonds, Cejka told the
newspaper in an interview.  “In the entire history of modern economics, it has not
happened, I think, that a bankruptcy of one state has led to a
100 percent writeoff of its debt,” he said in the interview.
“I admit that we will have to book additional” writedowns.  “There is no immediate need for further impairment of
Greek bonds in Komercni’s holdings,” Jakub Cerny, the bank’s
head of  investor relations , said today in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News.  The last Greek bonds the bank bought were in 2006 and 2007
and since then it has only invested in Czech sovereign bonds and
a limited amount of Slovak and Polish state bonds, Cejka said,
according to Lidove. Loans at the bank are growing between 6
percent and 8 percent this year, the newspaper said, citing him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
