Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the Finnish maker of
mobile phones, named Henry Tirri as chief technology officer and
member of the leadership team starting today.  Tirri, who reports directly to Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Elop, took over the duties in June when Rich Green went
on leave for personal reasons. Green, who became chief
technology officer in May 2010, has left the company, Espoo,
Finland-based Nokia said today in a statement.  “Henry has provided Nokia technical leadership and
challenged us to explore forward-looking technologies,” Elop
said in the statement. Tirri “will have the opportunity to make
a greater impact and set the course for Nokia and our role in
the mobile industry.”  Nokia is readying a line of phones based on  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 7 operating system to replace the
company’s own Symbian line, which is losing out to Apple Inc.’s
iPhone and Android handsets based on Google Inc.’s system. Nokia
targets the fourth quarter for the first Windows handset.  Nokia fell as much as 3.6 percent to 4.04 euros in Helsinki
trading, and was down 2.9 percent at 10:12 a.m. local time.  Tirri will be based in Sunnyvale,  California . He previously
led the Nokia Research Center in nearby  Palo Alto .  To contact the reporter on this story:
