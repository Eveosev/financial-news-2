The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m.  New York  time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index tumbled 4.8 percent to 53,280.28.  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  (BISA3 BS) fell 7.7 percent to
5.40 reais.  Brazil ’s fifth-largest real-estate company by
revenue helped lead declines for companies that depend on
consumer demand as a report showing lower-than-expected
unemployment spurred traders to pare bets for further interest-
rate cuts.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3 BS), the  iron-ore  miner
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , slumped 6.1 percent to
7.36 reais, following metals prices lower. Iron ore is set for
the first four-year drop since at least 1982 as supplies surge.
Global prices may fall 29 percent to an average $123 a metric
ton in 2015 from a record $173 this year, according to the
median estimates of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BS) declined 5.3 percent to
19.50 reais as crude futures sank in New York. Brazil’s state-
controlled oil company said output of oil and natural-gas
equivalent fell 1.7 percent in August from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
