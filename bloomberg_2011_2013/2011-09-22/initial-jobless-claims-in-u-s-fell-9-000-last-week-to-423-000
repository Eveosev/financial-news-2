More Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments last week
as the labor market struggled to improve.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 9,000 in the
week ended Sept. 17 to 423,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists forecast 420,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The average number
of claims in the past month rose for a fifth straight week, to
the highest level since July 16.  An elevated level of dismissals raises the odds U.S.
companies may put off plans to increase employment, making it
difficult for joblessness to fall below 9 percent. Citing
ongoing weakness in the labor market,  Federal Reserve  policy
makers announced yesterday they would use another unconventional
monetary tool to spur economic growth and job gains.  “These numbers are consistent with a job market that is
essentially in suspended animation,” said  Brian Jones , an
economist  Societe Generale  in New York, who correctly forecast
the level of claims. “Anything that the Fed does to help the
economy should help the labor market, but it takes time. We’ve
got to see job growth before we can get more demand.”  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 408,000 to
430,000 in the Bloomberg survey of 45 economists. The Labor
Department initially reported the prior week’s applications at
428,000.  A Labor Department official said today as the figures were
released that the latest week’s data included no special
circumstances.  Survey Week  Today’s report represents claims applications that coincide
with the survey week for the monthly non-farm payrolls report.  Stock-index futures maintained losses after the figures.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December declined 2.6 percent to 1,126.1 at 8:43 a.m. in  New
York . Treasuries rose, pushing down the yield on the benchmark
10-year note to 1.76 percent from 1.86 percent late yesterday.  The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure,
climbed to 421,000 from 420,500.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
fell by 28,000 in the week ended Sept. 10 to 3.73 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
103,350 to 3.5 million in the week ended Sept. 3.  Unemployment Rate   The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3 percent in the
week ended Sept. 10, today’s report showed. Forty-three states
and territories reported a decrease in claims during that week,
while 10 had an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Following a two-day meeting, Fed policy makers announced
yesterday they would replace some notes in their portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries to further reduce borrowing costs and
keep the economy from relapsing into a recession.  “Economic growth remains slow,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said in a statement describing the central bank’s
actions. While officials said they “expect some pickup in the
pace of recovery over coming quarters,” they anticipate “the
unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels”
consistent with their mandate for maximum employment.  Federal Reserve  The Fed left unchanged its pledge to keep the benchmark
 interest rate  near zero through at least mid-2013 so long as
unemployment remained high and the inflation outlook stayed
“subdued.”  Total payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest
reading since September 2010, and the unemployment rate held at
9.1 percent, the Labor Department said Sept. 2.  There are some bright spots for employment in the U.S.
Capital One Financial Corp., the lender that would become the
fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by domestic deposits with the purchase
of an online bank from ING Groep NV, intends to take on another
1,800, the McLean, Virginia-based company said Sept. 19.  Union Pacific Corp. plans to hire 15,000 people in the next
5 years, Chief Executive Officer Jim Young told the Detroit
Economic Club on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
