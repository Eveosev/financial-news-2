Nottingham’s Trent Bridge and
Lord’s and the Oval in  London  were selected as sites for Test
matches in cricket’s Ashes series in 2013 and 2015.  The  England  and Wales Cricket Board announced in a
 statement  today the venues for the next two Test series against
 Australia  played in the U.K.  Tests will also be played at Old Trafford in Manchester and
the Emirates Durham ICG in 2013, while Edgbaston in Birmingham
and the SWALEC stadium in Cardiff will also host matches two
years later.  England retained the Ashes by completing a 3-1 win in
January, its first series victory in Australia in 24 years.
England won 2-1 the last time it hosted the Ashes in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
