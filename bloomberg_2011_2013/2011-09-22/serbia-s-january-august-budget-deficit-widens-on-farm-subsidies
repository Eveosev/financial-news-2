Serbia’s budget deficit widened to
94.07 billion dinars ($1.24 billion) in the first eight months
of the year, as  government spending  exceeded a plan with payment
of farming subsidies, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, calculated under the International Monetary
Fund methodology, expanded from 83.8 billion dinars in the first
seven months of the year, the Belgrade-based ministry said on
its website today.  Following a new agreement with the IMF on an 18-month
precautionary loan program worth 1 billion euros ($1.34
billion), which is to be cleared by the IMF board next week, the
government targets a full-year gap of around 143 billion dinars,
or 4.5 percent of GDP. That would be more than the previous goal
of 4.25 percent.  In August, revenue came mainly from the collection of
value-added tax and excise duties. Spending topped the plan
because of higher farming subsidy payments for the second
consecutive month.  Serbia’s total public debt, including the government’s
liabilities to creditors at home and abroad, was at 41.7 percent
of GDP at the end of August, below a self-imposed limit of 45
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
