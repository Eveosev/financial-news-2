Solaria Energia & Medio Ambiente SA
agreed with  China ’s Dongfang Electric Corp. to jointly develop
100 megawatts of photovoltaic power plants a year as Spain’s
only traded solar-panel maker seeks to expand in  Asia .  Dongfang will also provide a $30 million  credit line  to buy
parts for solar panels, Solaria said by e-mail today.  “This agreement strengthens our position in Asia and
offers significant opportunities to further develop our presence
in the region,” Sales Director David Carrasco said in a phone
interview. Dongfang “is a powerful partner,” he said.  The company didn’t say where the parks would be built.  Solaria, based in Madrid, has been increasing investment in
photovoltaic power plants as German demand for its solar panels
slowed, leading to a loss in the second quarter. The company,
which produces panels in Puertollano,  Spain , from Chinese parts,
was certified as a European Union manufacturer last month.  Dongfang, based in Chengdu, may benefit from subsidies in
Italy, the second-biggest solar market after Germany, that are
10 percent higher for panels assembled by EU certified makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
