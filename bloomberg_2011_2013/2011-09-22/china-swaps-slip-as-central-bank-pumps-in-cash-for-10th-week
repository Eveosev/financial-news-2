China ’s interest-rate swaps dropped
by the most in more than a week as policy makers added cash to
the banking system for a 10th week, signaling they aren’t about
to tighten monetary policy.  The People’s Bank of China pumped a net 48 billion yuan
($7.5 billion) into the market this week, up from 7 billion yuan
in the previous five-day period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank also kept yields on one-year and
three-month bills unchanged for a fifth week.  “The PBOC will continue to inject to send a signal that
there’s no tightening yet,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-
income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . Swap
rates are also declining amid concern about slowing global
economic growth, he said.  The one-year swap, or the fixed cost needed to receive the
floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell 16 basis points to 4.02
percent as of 4:51 p.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest drop since Sept.
13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Central bank adviser Zhou Qiren said today consumer-price
gains haven’t shown signs of “easing considerably” and that
tackling inflation remains the “No. 1 challenge.” Zhou said
China should continue to tighten monetary policy.  Annual inflation eased to 6.2 percent in August from 6.5
percent the previous month, which was the highest since June
2008, official data showed on Sept. 9.  The seven-day repo rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point,
to 3.93 percent, the first decline in four days, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  The yield on the government’s 3.99 percent bonds due June
2021 declined two basis points to 4.07 percent, according to
quotes provided by the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
