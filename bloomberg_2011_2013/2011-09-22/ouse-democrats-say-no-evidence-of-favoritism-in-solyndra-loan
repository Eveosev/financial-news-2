A House energy committee
investigating Solyndra LLC’s $535 million U.S. loan guarantee
hasn’t seen evidence that “political favoritism” led to the
financing, according to Democrats on the panel.  The Democrats’ staff on an Energy and Commerce Committee
panel released the report before a hearing tomorrow with the
company’s top executives. Republicans who lead the committee are
investigating the guarantee and have suggested Solyndra’s ties
to George Kaiser, a campaign supporter of President Barack Obama, may have played a role in the September 2009 award.  Kaiser’s family foundation was a leading Solyndra investor.
The Fremont,  California , maker of lightweight tubular solar
panels filed for  bankruptcy protection  on Sept. 6 and its
offices were raided by the FBI two days later.  “To date, the committee has received no documents
indicating political favoritism played a role in the decisions
involving the loan guarantee for Solyndra,” according to the
memorandum from the Democrats’ staff.  Solyndra Chief Executive Officer Brian Harrison and Chief
Financial Officer W.G. Stover are scheduled to appear at the
hearing tomorrow. Lawyers for both men have said they will
invoke their Fifth Amendment rights and decline to answer
questions from the committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
