Schalke 04  manager Ralf Rangnick
stepped down from the German  soccer club , citing exhaustion.  The team, which knocked defending champions Inter Milan out
of the  Champions League  last season, made the announcement in a
statement on its website. It was his second stint at the club,
after managing Schalke between 2004 and 2005.  “After long deliberation, I have come to the conclusion I
need a break,” Rangnick, 53, said in a  statement . “It’s been
very difficult for me to take this decision. But my current
energy levels aren’t sufficient to be successful, and in
particular to push the club forward in its sporting
development.”  Rangnick joined Schalke in March as successor to Felix Magath. Under Rangnick’s guidance, the club beat Inter Milan in
the quarterfinals of the Champions League, before losing to
 Manchester United  in the last four. Schalke is currently in
ninth place in the German  Bundesliga .  Assistant coach Seppo Eichkorn will be in charge of the
team during its home match against SC Freiburg this weekend, the
club said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
