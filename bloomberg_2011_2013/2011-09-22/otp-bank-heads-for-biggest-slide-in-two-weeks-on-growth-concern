OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, declined the most in six weeks on concern Hungary’s
economic recovery will be hurt by a global slowdown and the
government’s economic policies.  The shares sank 11 percent to 2,995 forint by the 5 p.m.
end of trade in Budapest, after a suspension for breaching the
10 percent intraday trading limit, the biggest drop since Aug.
10. OTP extended its slump this quarter to 50 percent. The
benchmark BUX index, in which OTP has a 25 percent weighting,
fell 6 percent.  “Investors have become less confident about the
macroeconomic outlook for the coming years,”  Akos Kuti , head of
research at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. in Budapest, said in a
telephone interview. “The coup de grace came from the Fed which
emphasized that it also sees huge risks in the financial
sector.”  Emerging-market stocks and bonds fell after the  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday the  U.S. economy  faces “significant
downside risks.” Hungary’s economy may grow 1 percent next
year, compared with an earlier estimate of 1.5 percent, the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank said today in a report.  “The tax policy changes announced daily are making it
increasingly difficult to appraise the outlook,” Kuti said.  The government is seeking 750 billion forint ($3.5 billion)
in budget savings next year including an increase in the value-
added  tax rate  to a European Union-high of 27 percent from 25
percent. It is also proposing a “temporary” levy on higher
earners, the Economy Ministry said in a statement on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
