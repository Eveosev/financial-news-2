Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
credit-card issuer and payments network outperforming two larger
rivals this year, posted third-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as loan-loss provisions declined.  Net income in the period ended Aug. 31 rose to $649
million, or $1.18 a share, from $261 million, or 47 cents, a
year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based company said today
in a statement. The average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings per share of 96 cents.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Nelms, 50, is
acquiring businesses and repurchasing stock as fewer customers
default. Discover posted a $100 million provision for losses on
soured loans, compared with $713 million a year earlier, an 86
percent decline, the company said. Loans deemed uncollectable
fell to 3.6 percent in August from 8 percent in the same month
last year, Discover said in regulatory filings.  “We achieved record results again this quarter as a result
of further improvements in credit performance and record sales
volume,” Nelms said in the statement. Discover repurchased 8.4
million shares in the third quarter, he said.  Discover fell 9 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $25.25 at
4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  Visa
Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest bank-card network, declined 3.4
percent and  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the No. 2 network, fell 2.9
percent.  American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest U.S. credit-card
issuer by purchases, declined 3.3 percent.  Purchases Increase  Purchases made with Discover cards in the third quarter
increased 9 percent to $26.3 billion from the year-earlier
period, the company said. Net interest income climbed $90
million, or 8 percent, to $1.24 billion, and credit-card loans
rose 2 percent to $46.2 billion. Accounts at least 30 days late
fell to 131,403 from 230,669.  Expenses rose $74 million, or 14 percent, from the same
period a year earlier, because of increased compensation costs
and expenses related to Discover’s purchase in January of
Student Loan Corp. from New York-based Citigroup Inc. in a deal
valued at $600 million, the company said.  Discover gained 37 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with 30 percent for San Francisco-based Visa, and 52
percent for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. New York-based
American Express gained 12 percent.  “It’s a clean story,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, a New York-
based analyst with KBW Inc. who has an “outperform” rating on
Discover. “They’re one of the few companies within the
financial-services space where  credit quality  as a whole is
trending quite favorably, on top of which you have top-line
growth driven by both organic and inorganic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
