percent complete as of Sept. 19, “well ahead” of the previous
five-year average of 61 percent, the provincial government said
today in a  report .  About 74 percent of spring wheat and 75 percent of durum
were collected, the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture said on
its website. The harvest is 72 percent complete for the canola
crop, and 33 percent finished for flax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
