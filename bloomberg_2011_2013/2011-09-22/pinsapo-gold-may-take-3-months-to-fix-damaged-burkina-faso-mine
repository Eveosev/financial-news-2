Pinsapo Gold SA, a miner that
operates in  Burkina Faso , may take three months to repair its
site in the country after it was damaged by residents of a
nearby town, said Business Development Manager Alex Levitski.  The losses from the Sept. 14 protest at Peleguetenga, 150
kilometers (93 miles) north of Ouagadougou, the capital, are
about 1 billion  CFA francs  ($2 million), he told reporters
today. Earlier, Mines, Careers and Energy Minister Salif
Lamoussa Kabore said the damage amounted to 3 billion francs.  About 300 residents of the town protested against the use
of cyanide in the mineâ€™s operation, damaging equipment. The
Burkinabe government will form a commission to allow for talks
between mining companies and concerned residents, Kabore said
after a visit to the site.  Officials have arrested 18 people in connection with the
demonstration, said Paul Sondo, director general of the national
police, on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
