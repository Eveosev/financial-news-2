International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said the world’s biggest
economies need to strengthen cooperation to restore stability to
global financial markets.  “What is lacking today” among global officials “is the
collective momentum and the spirit” demonstrated at the Group
of 20 meeting in  London  in April 2009, Lagarde said today at a
news conference in Washington.  Lagarde said regulators in many nations need to step up
“financial reform,” and that she wants “constructive
dialogue’ with Argentina.  The IMF chief supported the determination of euro officials
to sustain their common currency. “It’s not only economics,
it’s not only about finance, it’s also about a political
collective destiny,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
