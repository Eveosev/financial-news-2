Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
fell to the lowest level since March 2009 on concerns about
growth in eastern  Europe , complicating the lender’s plans to
raise capital by selling new shares in the next 11 months.  Raiffeisen declined 8.4 percent to 20.25 euros in Vienna
trading, the lowest since March 30, 2009, when the shares closed
at 19.41 euros. The stock was among the 10 worst performers in
the 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index, which dropped 5.7 percent today.  Investor concerns that eastern Europe, where Raiffeisen is
the third-biggest bank, will grow slower because of reduced
demand from debt-ridden Western economies has weighed on the
shares of the region’s banks. The  International Monetary Fund 
this week cut its 2011 growth forecast for eastern Europe by 1
percentage point and its 2012 forecast by half a percentage
point. That was the biggest forecast reduction of any region
except the  United States .  “Eastern European economies still depend to a large degree
on economic momentum in western Europe and if this slows down,
it will, as we’ve seen in 2009, inevitably spill over,” said
 Dirk Becker , bank analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in
 Frankfurt . Hungary’s plan to impose on lenders losses related to
Swiss franc mortgages is also hurting share prices, Becker said.  Bank Shares Decline  Hungary’s OTP Bank Nyrt. plummeted 11 percent in Budapest
to 2,995 forint, the lowest since May 18, 2009. OAO Sberbank
dropped 9.2 percent in Moscow, the most since June 2009, and PKO
Bank Polski SA fell 8.2 percent in Warsaw, the biggest drop
since February 2009.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , the region’s second-
largest lender, declined more than 10 percent, making it the
third-biggest loser among European banks.  Raiffeisen said Aug. 25 it may sell new shares in the next
12 months to underpin loan growth and boost capital as new bank
rules are being phased in. Its share price has dropped by 25
percent since and supervisory board Chairman Walter Rothensteiner said today he doesn’t want to sell shares at the
current prices, according to the Austrian Press Agency.  “I don’t feel like” selling new shares at those prices,
Rothensteiner was quoted as saying by the newswire. Raiffeisen
first sold shares to the public in 2005 at 32.50 euros apiece,
and at 104 euros in a secondary offering in 2007.  ‘Need a Miracle’  “Raiffeisen management seems to gamble on a higher share
price to conduct the rights issue but this is a dangerous
game,” Kepler’s Becker said in an e-mailed comment. “The share
price is capped as long as the capital increase is not behind
us. They need a miracle to be able to issue shares at book value
of 35 euros per share.”  Raiffeisen’s core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial
strength, declined by 40 basis points to 8.5 percent in the
second quarter because its loan book grew 3.1 percent. The
capital includes 1.75 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in state
funds it received in 2009 and must repay at some point.  Raiffeisen may sell shares for about 1.5 billion euros this
year to boost capital, according to the majority of 14 analysts
polled by Bloomberg in February.  Standard & Poor’s  said Feb. 7
it may cut Raiffeisen’s debt rating if the lender doesn’t sell
new stock in the “short to medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
