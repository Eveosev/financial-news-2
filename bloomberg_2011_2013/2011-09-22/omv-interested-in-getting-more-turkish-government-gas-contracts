OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe â€™s biggest
oil company, is interested in getting more gas contracts from
Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, according to Chief Executive
Officer Gerhard Roiss.  Botas, owned by the Turkish government, plans to offer more
gas contracts it has with OAO Gazprom to private companies for
wholesale distribution.  The government will decide within one or two months how to
go ahead with awarding the contracts, Roiss told reporters in
Istanbul today.  OMV already has a 40 percent stake in Enerco, an Istanbul-
based company that was awarded by Botas to sell 2.5 billion
cubic meters a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
