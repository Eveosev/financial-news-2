KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) ’s plan to add
guano production to its list of operations may indicate that the
Polish copper producer’s planned Latin America acquisition will
be in Peru.  Shareholders will vote on Oct. 20 on a measure to add
production of the seabird manure, used as a fertilizer, to the
company’s official list of activities, Lubin, southwestern
Poland-based KGHM said in a regulatory statement today. Chief
Executive Officer  Herbert Wirth  said this month the state-
controlled company is negotiating a purchase of a  copper mine  in
Latin America and plans to complete the deal this year.  Peru is the world’s largest guano producer, according to an
Agriculture Ministry  website  announcing plans to establish a
museum of the fertilizer it called “an icon” of the Latin
American country.  Last month Wirth said the price will account for a majority
of KGHM’s 9.05 billion-zloty ($2.76 billion) acquisition budget.  KGHM spokesman Dariusz Wyborski didn’t answer two calls to
his mobile phone seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
