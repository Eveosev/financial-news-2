An employers’ lobby rejected a
proposal to consolidate reserves of the Estonian Unemployment
Insurance Fund under the management of the State Treasury,
claiming the fund could become unable to fulfill its tasks.  The  Finance Ministry  said this month it plans to
consolidate the management of all assets of state institutions
under the Treasury from 2012, eliminating the government’s need
to borrow elsewhere by 2015.  The fund’s assets could be transferred to the Treasury only
if the parties involved sign a loan agreement which would
require negotiations between the board of the fund and the
Finance Ministry, as well as amending the unemployment insurance
law, the council of the  Estonian Employers’ Confederation  said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Consolidating reserves under the Treasury would cut the
planned state debt to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product by
2015 from an April forecast of 11.8 percent, the ministry said
Sept. 7. Estonia had the lowest level of public debt in the 27-
member European Union last year, at 6.6 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
