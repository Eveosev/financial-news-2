BNP Paribas SA,  France ’s largest
bank, plans “significant” staff reductions at its investment-
banking unit as the lender cuts total assets by about 10
percent, Chief Executive Officer  Baudouin Prot  said.  “It’s essentially at our corporate- and investment-banking
platforms,” Prot said in an interview on BFM radio today. “It
will be a significant magnitude, but without reaching at all the
figures announced by other banks, especially Anglo-Saxon ones,”
he said, declining to give further details.  Prot also denied that the bank is making specific attempts
to attract a Middle Eastern investor, as reported in the
Financial Times.  BNP Paribas fell as much as 5.5 percent in Paris trading,
and was down 1.14 euros, or 4.7 percent, to 23.32 euros by 1:49
p.m., valuing the bank at 28.2 billion euros ($38 billion). The
stock has fallen 51 percent this year amid concerns over the
deepening European sovereign-debt crisis.  “No particular measure is to be expected” for job cuts at
 BNP Paribas (BNP) ’s consumer bank networks, especially in France, Prot
also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
