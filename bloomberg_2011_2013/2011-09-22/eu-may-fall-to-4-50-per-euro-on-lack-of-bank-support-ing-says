The leu may weaken to 4.50 per euro
from 4.298 as  Romania ’s central bank is likely to refrain from
buying the currency, ING Groep NV said today.  “Using foreign-exchange data, we concluded the central
bank was not present in the  spot market  during August,”
Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, chief economist at ING’s
Bucharest unit, wrote in a report.  “Falling inflation gives additional room for maneuver to
the National Bank or Romania, he added in the report.
‘‘Consequently, we would not be surprised to see NBR relaxed
over a euro-leu trading above 4.30, particularly given weaker
external demand.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
