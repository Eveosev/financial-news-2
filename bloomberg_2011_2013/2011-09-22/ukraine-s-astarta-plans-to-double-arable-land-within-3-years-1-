Astarta Holding NV (AST) , a Ukrainian
agricultural company and producer of refined sugar, said sales
and output growth and increased efficiency will help it almost
double the size of its harvestable fields within three years.  The company plans to raise its  land bank , or arable land
leased from individual Ukrainian owners, to between 400,000 and
450,000 hectares by 2015, Chief Executive Officer Viktor Ivanchyk said in a Sept. 20 interview. It aims for agreements to
plant on 240,000 to 250,000 hectares of fields by year-end from
210,000 at the end of 2010. Next year’s land bank will be
increased by 10 percent to 15 percent.  “This is absolutely real for us and we are working
intensely in this direction,” Ivanchyk said.  Agriculture companies in Ukraine have to lease plots for
planting because Ukrainian law has banned them from buying
fields outright since the country broke from  Soviet Union  in
1991. Parliament will vote on ending that limit by the end of
the year, allowing owners to sell plots or continue leasing them
to growers.  Astarta grows and sells wheat, barley, soya, corn and
sunflower. The company doubled its wheat harvest from last year
to 200,000 metric tons this year and reaped almost 40,000 tons
of barley, Ivanchyk said. It plans to increase its corn harvest
to 300,000 tons, compared with 100,600 tons in 2010, he said.  The Kiev-based company, which grows and refines sugar beet
since 1997, will produce around 350,000 tons of sugar this year
from 2 million tons of its own sugar beet and half-a-million
tons of  sugar beet  it will buy from other producers. Last year’s
refined sugar output was around 200,000 tons.  Cost Cuts  “We are working seriously on decreasing costs,” Ivanchyk
said. He added that results of this year look “optimistic,”
and the “situation allows for confidence about further growth
and profitability.”  Astarta aims to reduce the share of gas in the cost of its
sugar production and switch more to biofuels which the company
aims to make itself, the chief executive said. The consumption
of natural gas for processing 1 ton of sugar beet was reduced 8
percent in 2010 to around 33 cubic meters.  The project to produce biofuels from by-products of sugar
refining has started at Astarta, Ivanchyk said. The company will
use such fuels for 50 to 60 percent of its sugar-production
needs.  It aims to have this project installed at every sugar plant
and is going to invest $15 million into each of its seven sugar
refiners across Ukraine. Astarta is in talks with Wells Fargo
Bank NA and several other banks to finance investment projects,
he said.  2012 Investments  “We will take loans in tranches within timeframes that
will allow us to use the funds with maximum efficiency,” said
the CEO. Astarta plans to invest about 50 million euros ($68.25
million) next year and about the same amount in the next five
years, he said. The first disbursement can be between $15
million and $20 million, according to Ivanchyk.  The cost of products can be lowered by 10 percent to 15
percent at plants that use biofuels, he said.  Financial results of the company will be better than in
2010 because of higher sales volume in grains and other goods,
Ivanchyk said, declining to elaborate. Astarta reported net
profit of 80 million euros in 2010.  Milk Production  Milk production will increase in 2011 to between 60,000
tons and 65,000 tons from 52,000 tons last year, Ivanchyk said.
Milk production growth will be between 10 to 15 percent next
year, he said.  The company is completing a second cattle farm in Hoholevo
in the Poltava region, which will be started in the spring of
2012 in addition to a 1,200 milk-cow farm.  Astarta may export milk to the European Union, Ivanchyk
said.  “We are making serious preparations in this direction. We
are working on certifying our product for environment safety and
work safety,” he said. “Our products will match all EU
requirements on quality and other standards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
