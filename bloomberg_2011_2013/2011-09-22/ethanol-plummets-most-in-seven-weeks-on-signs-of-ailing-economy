Ethanol futures dropped the most in
seven weeks amid signs of an ailing economy that could threaten
fuel demand.  Futures slumped after the  Federal Reserve  cited
“significant downside risks” in the  U.S. economy . The Fed said
it will replace $400 billion of short-term debt with long-term
debt to help stave off recession.  “Everything is just kind of falling apart,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa .
“It’s just following suit and here we go.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery plunged 9.3 cents,
or 3.5 percent, to $2.556 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the lowest price since June 30 and the steepest decline
since Aug. 4. Futures have gained 7.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 19
cents, or 6.7 percent, to $2.635 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive fell 7.5 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.725, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago declined 7 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
$2.62 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel decreased 6
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.805.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in Iowa was making
12 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
Illinois was banking 15 cents as of Sept. 15, according to Ag
TraderTalk, a Clive, Iowa-based online grains information
service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
