Stephen Roach , non-executive
chairman of Morgan Stanley  Asia , said the Greek government will
probably default on its debt.  “Greece will default” and while that event is “pretty
close” to being priced into financial markets, the consequences
of that are not, Roach said in an interview on CNBC today. “I
don’t think we have a clear sense of what the whole web of
counterparty risk is in the event of a Greek default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
