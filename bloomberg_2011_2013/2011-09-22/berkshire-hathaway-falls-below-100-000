Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  fell below
$100,000 in  New York  trading for the first time in 20 months as
the economic slowdown pressures the firm’s industrial units and
stock declines hurt Chairman Warren Buffett’s equity bets.  Berkshire Class A shares slipped $2,050, or 2 percent, to
$99,200 at 10:48 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and are down about 18 percent this year. Berkshire
traded as low as $97,580 on Jan. 19, 2010.  Buffett’s  $35 billion  portfolio of equity-index derivatives
may lose value amid the five-month decline in stock markets in
New York and  London . The economic slowdown in the U.S. may crimp
business at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire subsidiaries
spanning railroads, luxury travel, manufacturing and retail.  “The bad economic numbers are definitely flowing,” said
 Paul Howard , director of research at Solstice Investment
Research in Glastonbury, Connecticut. “The world thinks that in
aggregate all those different businesses are going to suffer.”  Berkshire Class B shares slipped 2.3 percent to $65.68. The
shares were added to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index last year.
The S&P 500 slumped 2.3 percent to 1,140.41 and is down about
9.3 percent since Dec. 31.  Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe last year for $26.5
billion in what he described as an “all-in wager” on the  U.S.
economy . In July, Buffett told Bloomberg Television he expected
economic growth to continue and would “bet very heavily”
against a second recession in three years.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday that there are
“significant downside risks” to the economic outlook. The Fed,
which said strains in global financial markets may hurt the U.S.
economy, announced plans to support growth by extending the
average maturities on its Treasury holdings.  Berkshire added to its portfolio of subsidiaries this month
by acquiring Lubrizol Corp., an engine-additives maker, for
about $9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
