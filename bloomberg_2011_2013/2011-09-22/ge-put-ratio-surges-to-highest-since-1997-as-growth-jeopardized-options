Options traders are the most
bearish on  General Electric Co. (GE)  in 14 years, speculating its
streak of quarterly earnings increases won’t survive Europe’s
debt crisis and slowing global growth.  The ratio of puts to sell shares versus calls to buy has
climbed 15 percent since July 12 to 1.31, and was 1.33 on Sept.
15, the highest since October 1997 and the third-highest among
Dow Jones Industrial Average companies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  and  Honeywell
International Inc. (HON) , which compete with Fairfield, Connecticut-
based GE, both have more calls than puts.  GE, which expects to get about 60 percent of sales from
outside the U.S. this year, is susceptible to falling consumer
spending and industrial demand for its products such as  jet
engines . The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for
global growth this week and predicted “severe” repercussions
if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers
deadlock over a fiscal plan.  “If there is a global recession, which we’re sort of on
the razor’s edge of, it’s going to impact their sales, and
you’re going to see the stock decline further,” said Tom Wirth,
who helps manage $1.6 billion as senior investment officer for
Chemung Canal Trust Co. in Elmira, New York, said in a Sept. 21
phone interview. “It’s more fear-driven than anything else.”  VIX, VStoxx  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 11
percent yesterday to 41.35 amid a global equity rout that drove
the MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations down
more than 20 percent from its 2011 peak, meeting the common
definition of a  bear market . The VIX dropped 0.2 percent to
41.25 at 4:15 p.m. New York time today.  Europe ’s VStoxx Index
rose 1.6 percent to 48.54 today, after climbing 8.3 percent
yesterday.  GE added 1.1 percent to $15.21 yesterday. It has fallen 29
percent from its Feb. 17 high, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped 15 percent. GE, the world’s biggest maker of jet
engines, locomotives and medical-imaging machines, trades for
11.8 times reported profit, or 5.2 percent less than the
multiple for the  S&P 500 . The 8.4 percent valuation discount on
Sept. 12 was the lowest since June 2010.  Seven of the 10 GE contracts with the biggest increase in
ownership in the past week were puts. October $13 puts added
37,655 contracts, rising to 78,892 contracts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Open interest for January $7.50 puts had
the second-biggest increase, followed by October $14 puts.
January $12.50 puts have the biggest open interest, followed by
January $15 puts and January $17.50 puts.  Taking a Stance  “Customers are opening put transactions, and when you see
that -- end users establishing new positions -- it’s notable
because they’re not just trading volatility,” Brenna Hardman, a
broker at TradingBlock on the CBOE floor, said in a Sept. 22
phone interview. “They have a view on where it’s going.”  Andrew Williams , a spokesman for GE, declined to comment on
the options trading.  The put-to-call ratio for the  Industrial Select Sector SPDR
Fund (XLI) , which tracks companies including GE,  United Technologies 
and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , was 1.67-to-1 on Sept. 20, 31
percent below its average 2.4-to-1 ratio for this year. United
Technologies had 0.82 puts for each call on Sept. 20, while
Honeywell’s put-to-call ratio was 0.77-to-1, the lowest since
January 2010. GE is the biggest company in the fund.  “Industrial in general is a weak segment, so that’ll hurt
their earnings, but it’s got the double whammy with GE
Capital,” Joe Kunkle, founder of OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-
based provider of options-market analytics, said in a Sept. 21
telephone interview.  GE Capital  GE’s finance division, GE Capital, generated 17 percent of
the company’s operating income in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Financial stocks have fallen the most
since the MSCI All-Country World Index peaked in May, slumping
31 percent through yesterday.  GE Capital , is selling or winding
down about $80 billion in assets and will shift those resources
to areas such as aircraft leasing and middle-market lending.  Analysts estimate GE will report a 6 percent decline in the
fourth quarter net income, breaking a streak of four straight
increases, according to the average projection in a Bloomberg
survey.  At a GE Healthcare event last week, GE Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  said he wasn’t concerned about a second
recession because he saw “decent” economic growth in places
around the world. Immelt is pushing into faster-growing emerging
markets as the U.S. and Europe slow.  Energy Division  GE is targeting annual sales of $100 billion in the next
decade from its energy unit, the company’s largest, which would
help more than double the projected $45 billion in 2011 revenue,
John Krenicki, the vice chairman who runs GE Energy
Infrastructure, said at a Sept. 20 investor presentation in
Crotonville,  New York .  Three-month GE options that profit should the stock fall 10
percent cost 1.27 more than options 10 percent above the current
stock price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The level
of 1.36 on June 30 was the highest since 2008.  “The market is telling us that it’s becoming more
concerned,” Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM
Partners LP in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone
interview on Sept. 21. “In a Greek default situation, the
dominoes fall: sovereign debt crisis into a credit shock into
U.S. banks into the  U.S. economy  into GE.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
