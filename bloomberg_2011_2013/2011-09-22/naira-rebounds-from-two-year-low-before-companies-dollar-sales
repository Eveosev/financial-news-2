Nigeria ’s naira rebounded from the
weakest level in two years against the dollar on expectations of
improved foreign-currency supply.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest oil producer
appreciated 0.3 percent to 157.25 naira per dollar in interbank
trading by 3:50 p.m. in Lagos, the first gain since Sept. 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira depreciated
to the weakest since August 2009 yesterday as demand for foreign
currency at the central bank’s auction exceeded supply for a
21st straight sale. The bank sold $350 million, compared with
$506.5 million demanded by lenders.  Month-end dollar sales by international energy companies
operating in the country expected next week “are likely to
provide support for the currency,” Johannesburg-based Absa
Capital wrote today in a note to clients. The central bank “may
also opt to increase supply at next week’s auctions should
demand remain elevated,” it added.  Nigeria has been using foreign-currency reserves to keep
the naira within a 3 percentage-point range above or below 150
naira a dollar at its twice-weekly auctions to help check
inflation. The  exchange rate  at yesterday’s auction was 2.9
percent above 150 naira per dollar.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said at a conference in
 Washington  today he won’t defend the naira rate “at all costs”
though “will try to hold the line as much as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
