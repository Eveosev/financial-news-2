Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank, hired former Federal Reserve economist Nathan Sheets
as head of international economics in the company’s investment
research and analysis division.  Sheets was previously the director of the Division of
International Finance at the Fed in Washington and was an
economist for the Federal Open Market Committee, New York-based
Citigroup said today in a statement. He will be based in New
York and report to Chief Economist  Willem Buiter  and Andrew Pitt, global head of investment research, according to the
statement.  As director of the Division of International Finance,
Sheets briefed Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other officials
on economic developments outside the U.S. and represented the
Fed at international meetings. He quit as the central bank’s
chief international economic adviser in August after almost four
years in the position.  Sheets “brings with him an innate understanding of global
macroeconomic issues and he will provide incredible guidance to
our clients,” Pitt said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
