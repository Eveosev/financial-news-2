European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the slowdown in the
EU economy is “no excuse” to curtail governments’ efforts to
cut their budget deficits.  “The slowdown is no excuse to stop putting our fiscal
houses in order,” Rehn said today in the text of a speech in
 Washington . “That is necessary to restore confidence.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
