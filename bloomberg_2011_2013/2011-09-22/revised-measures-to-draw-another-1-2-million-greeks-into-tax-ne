About 1.2 million Greeks will pay
income taxes for the first time this year after the government
said yesterday it will lower the tax-free threshold, said Platon Monokroussos, an economist at EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA.  The people, mainly low-income earners and pensioners, will
pay between 50 euros ($67) and 300 euros under the plan to lower
the threshold to 5,000 euros from 8,000 euros, Monokroussos said
today in a note from Athens. It’s the second time this year the
government has lowered the ceiling on tax-free income.  Greece ’s government said yesterday it will accelerate
budget cuts to keep emergency loans flowing, extending austerity
measures that have deepened a recession. International lenders
demanded the latest round of cuts targeting civil servants’
wages and pensioners to ensure Greece reaches deficit-reduction
targets in a 110 billion-euro bailout and receives a payment due
next month.  Other measures announced following two rounds of talks with
the European Union and the IMF include a 20 percent cut in
pensions of more than 1,200 euros a month and lower wages for
30,000 state employees.  Monokroussos estimated the adaptions to the tax rates would
raise about 1 billion euros in additional revenue. Some 2.9
million Greeks will continue to pay no taxes as they declare
incomes below 5,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
