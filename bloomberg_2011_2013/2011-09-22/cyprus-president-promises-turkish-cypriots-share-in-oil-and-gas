Cypriot president Demetris Christofias said he guarantees Turkish Cypriots will benefit
from offshore hydrocarbon discoveries even before the island
achieves reunification.  “I guarantee as president of the republic that even before
a settlement we shall find a way to use revenues to the benefit
of both communities,” Christofias said according to a  statement 
on the website of the  Press and Information Office . The
continental-shelf  agreement  announced yesterday by  Turkey  and
northern Cyprus is “unacceptable,” Christofias added.  Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in 1974 in response to a coup
inspired by the junta then in power in  Greece  and is the only
state to recognize northern Cyprus as an independent nation,
disputes Cyprus’s right to explore for hydrocarbons in its
exclusive economic zone and sent warships to the area.  Reunification talks resumed in 2008 after Greek Cypriots,
who run the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the
south, rejected a  United Nations  sponsored settlement plan.  U.S. based  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , which has an exploration and
exploitation license in Cyprus’s Block 12, started drilling
Sept. 18 and is expected to deliver first results in two-and-a-
half months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
