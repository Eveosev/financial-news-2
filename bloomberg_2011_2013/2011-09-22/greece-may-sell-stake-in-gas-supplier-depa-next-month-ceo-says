Greece  plans next month to sell as
much as 55 percent in  Depa SA , the state-owned natural-gas
supplier, Chief Executive Officer Harry Sachinis said.  Depa is debt free with 300 million euros ($405 million) in
cash, Sachinis said today in an interview in Baku,  Azerbaijan .  The state currently holds 65 percent in Depa while Hellenic
Petroleum SA owns the remainder. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan,
known as Socar, has said it will bid for a stake in the Greek
company.  Greece is seeking to raise 50 billion euros by the end of
2015 from asset sales and implement austerity measures to keep
emergency loans flowing and avoid default. Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s government said yesterday it will accelerate budget
cuts, targeting civil servants’ wages and pensioners, to comply
with demands set out by international lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
