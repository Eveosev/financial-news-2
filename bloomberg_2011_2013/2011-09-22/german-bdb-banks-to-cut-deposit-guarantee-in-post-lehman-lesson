Germany’s private banks plan to cut
voluntary guarantees on consumer and investor deposits, drawing
on the lesson from systemic crises such as the one triggered by
the collapse of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)   The lenders, including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and more than 170
others, will reduce minimum guarantees for deposits to 437,500
euros ($586,700) per account from today’s 1.5 million euros over
a decade from 2015, the Berlin-based  BDB  private bank group
said. Some 95 percent of all private-bank deposits will stay
guaranteed, the group said today.  New capital reserve rules that have pushed up costs since
the international bank crisis in 2008 and 2009 as well as the
role of the government in bailing out lenders during the
turmoil, prompted the BDB to review its guarantees, Hans-Joachim Massenberg told reporters in the capital today. Fears of a run
on banks in October 2008 led the government to offer “unlimited
guarantees” for all consumer deposits.  German banks’ reliance on pledges of taxpayers’ money for
bailouts in 2008 and 2009 shows that the system of voluntary
guarantees is “overstretched in a systemic crisis -- that goes
for all banks,” said Massenberg. The BDB aims to maintain
protection levels for most depositors while trimming guarantee
cover to a “realistic” and “credible” level, he said.  Bailout Fund  The German government in October 2008 created a 480
billion-euro bank bailout fund, dubbed Soffin, though it has
avoiding putting into law its pledge to underwrite all deposits
without limit. The private banks’ voluntary fund was set up in
1976 to supplement the mandatory guarantees for all  bank
deposits  that are pegged at 100,000 euros.  The revamped voluntary system, which still has to go to a
member’s vote next month, involves reducing guarantees for a
deposit account to 8.75 percent of a lender’s total liability
equity capital. The reduction from a level of 30 percent today
will be carried out in three phases.  The system works in the following way: using the example of
a bank that holds the country’s smallest legal capital stock of
5 million euros, deposits are currently guaranteed up to at
least 1.5 million euros, or 30 percent.  Consumers and institutional investors will be able to
spread assets between accounts to maximize guarantee coverage,
Massenberg said. The minimum protection in 2025 will still be
four times larger than  Germany ’s compulsory system, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
