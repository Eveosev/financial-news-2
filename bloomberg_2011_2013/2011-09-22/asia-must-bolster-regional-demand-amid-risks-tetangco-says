Asia  must bolster regional demand
amid risks posed by a faltering global recovery highlighted by
the  Federal Reserve ’s move, Philippine central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said in a mobile phone message today.  “Two things that I believe we seriously need to think
about are; a further U.S. sluggishness could begin to weaken
Asian growth amid the tightening policy stance late last
year/early this year, and the policy tools that are still
available to the Fed,” Tetangco said. “These move the spectre
for inflation lower. And instead makes it even more imperative
for emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia, to
review strategies for growing domestic demand at the national
and regional levels.”  The Philippine central bank “will remain mindful of
ensuring policy settings that could help sustain the growth we
are now enjoying, given the lower risk of inflation that is
looming,” Tetangco said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
