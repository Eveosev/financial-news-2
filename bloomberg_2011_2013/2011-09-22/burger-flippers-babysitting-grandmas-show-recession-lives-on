Americans flipped more burgers,
rented more homes, used less-expensive heating fuel and asked
for more government help last year, the U.S. Census Bureau says.  More people worked fewer hours for less money. Fewer
couples got married, and more grandparents cared for their
grandchildren. Fewer children attended preschool, and more
adults enrolled in graduate school than in 2009.  An annual survey released today, coupled with census data
last week showing the highest poverty rates and lowest incomes
in a generation, offers a vivid portrait of how people are
struggling to cope after the worst recession of their lifetimes.
Washington lawmakers remain deadlocked over how to respond.  “It’s getting worse and worse,” said Elmi Osman, 38, of
Clarkston,  Georgia , who began driving a taxicab after being laid
off from his job at Hertz Corp. in 2008. “I don’t have a
choice. I have an associate’s degree in engineering, and I
cannot find another job.”  The data were released as part of the American Community
Survey, an annual questionnaire sent to 3 million homes that
replaces the census “long form,” which yielded results once a
decade. The annual figures are used to guide the distribution of
more than $400 billion in state and federal spending.  Rich-Poor Gap  The figures show that the 8.8 million American households
earning less than $10,000 annually remained almost twice the
number of those earning more than $200,000. The gap between rich
and poor was widest in the District of Columbia, New York and
 Connecticut , and was lowest in  Utah .  The number of households receiving cash public assistance
rose 9.3 percent, to 3.28 million last year from 3 million in
2009. That doesn’t include the 1 million additional households
receiving Social Security income, or the 1.9 million extra
households participating in the food-stamp program. About two of
every three new food-stamp recipients earned more than the U.S.
poverty rate of $11,139, or $22,314 for a family of four.  More than 13.6 million U.S. households, about one of every
eight, needed government help to put food on the table in 2010,
an increase of 16.2 percent from 2009. Nevada added 31,000 food-
stamp recipients, a jump of 48.4 percent. The largest numerical
rise was in  Florida , which added 204,000 -- more than 10 percent
of all new food-stamp households.  Fewer Executives  Some pain was even felt in corporate boardrooms: There were
almost 96,000 fewer Americans employed as top executives.  At the same time, the number of food-preparation workers
grew by 97,000. And about 50,000 more U.S. households made at
least $200,000 last year.  “If history is repeating itself, it would be no surprise
that the rich are getting richer,” said Arloc Sherman, a senior
researcher at the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities. “Coming out of a recession, poverty frequently
continues to rise.  “We’re stalling when we need to be growing,” he said.  The White House underlined that point last month, when it
projected that the nation’s unemployment rate, which has hovered
at or above 9 percent for more than two years, will be stuck
there next year amid sluggish economic growth.  The number of workers fell 1.7 million between 2009 and
2010, while the percentage of the employed population dropped to
66.6 percent from 68.2 percent, the census figures show.  ‘Recession Isn’t Over’  The average American, who worked 38.4 hours a week in 2009,
was on the job for 38.3 in 2010. Hours worked by men fell to an
average of 40.7 hours from 40.9; women dropped to 35.6 from
35.7.  “The work isn’t what it used to be,” said Steve Reeves,
45, a heating and air conditioning technician in Atlanta. “Even
if you work, you’re not getting 40 hours.”  Reeves, who has had his job for 25 years, held onto it
through the worst of the downturn. Still, his hours dropped and
haven’t climbed back up. “The recession isn’t over,” he said.  The National Bureau of  Economic Research  declared that the
recession, which began in December 2007, ended in June 2009.  Those who still have jobs are taking slightly longer to get
there: The average commute climbed to 25.3 minutes, an increase
of a dozen seconds. The percentage of Americans who drove to
work alone climbed to 75.6 percent from 75.1 percent. Fewer
people carpooled, took mass transit, biked or walked. The
longest average commutes were in  Maryland , where it took 31.8
minutes, and  New York , at 31.3 minutes.  Home Values Fall  The collapse of the housing market triggered the recession,
and census figures show that median home values continued to
fall, to $179,900, down 2.9 percent from $185,200. And more
people lived in less-expensive housing. Texas added more than
39,300 mobile homes, roughly 80 percent of the almost 50,000
units added in 2010.  About 900,000 housing units were added in 2010, an increase
of 0.8 percent. The number of owners grew by 0.04 percent to
74.9 million. The number of renters climbed to 39.7 million, or
2.4 percent. The District of Columbia had the highest percentage
of renters, at 57.5 percent of all housing, followed by New York
at 45.8 percent.  West Virginia  had the highest percentage of
owners, at 74.7 percent.  People cut back. They dropped oil or kerosene heat in favor
of electricity or utility-provided gas. There were 2.4 million
households that used wood as a primary heating fuel. Slightly
more than 15 percent of Vermont households used wood, the
highest percentage in the nation. About 1.1 million households,
more than one-third in  California , reported using no fuel at all
for heat.  Women Marrying Later  The percentage of women who have never been married climbed
to 29 percent from 28.6 percent in 2009, an increase the census
bureau called “significant.” The figures were lowest in
 Wyoming , where 20.7 percent of women haven’t been married, and
highest in the  District of Columbia , at 55.8 percent, and New
York, at 34.8 percent.  The number of grandparents living with their grandchildren
rose to 7 million in 2010, from almost 6.7 million in 2009.
Three percent of all grandparents in Mississippi took care of
their grandchildren. Only 0.6 percent of Vermont grandparents
were responsible for theirs.  Almost 193,400 fewer children were enrolled in preschool
last year, while almost 1.2 million more adults attended
undergraduate or graduate school.  Washington, D.C., had the highest percentage of people with
a college degree, at 50.1 percent, and graduate or professional
degrees, at 26.9 percent.  No Guarantee  Education was no guarantee of economic success for Osman,
the Georgia cabdriver struggling to scratch out a living.  “When I started, I could make $300 to $400 in an average
eight-hour day,” he said, standing in a line of 13 cabs waiting
for fares outside a downtown Atlanta hotel. “Then it went to
$300, to $250, to $200. Now an average day is $100 for 15 to 16
hours.”  He’s sticking with it, because he has to, he said.  “I’m doing this to survive and pay my rent.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
