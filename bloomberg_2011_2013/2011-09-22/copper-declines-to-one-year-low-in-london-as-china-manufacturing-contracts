Copper futures plunged the most
since 2008 as a  China  factory index signaling contraction added
to speculation that metal demand will slump amid signs of
faltering economies in the U.S. and  Europe .  A preliminary index of China purchasing managers was 49.4
this month, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Copper has dropped 22
percent this year as Europe’s debt crisis and the possibility of
another contraction in the  U.S. economy  hampered demand. In
2008, during the U.S. recession, copper fell 54 percent.  “The meltdown of 2008 is in the cards if the defaults
start in Euroland,” said David Threlkeld, the president of
Resolved Inc., a trading company in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Copper futures for December delivery dropped 27.55 cents,
or 7.3 percent, to close at $3.4885 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract
since Oct. 30, 2008. After the settlement, the price touched
$3.412, the lowest since Sept. 10, 2010.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $626, or 7.5 percent, to $7,674 a metric ton ($3.48
a pound). The price has tumbled 25 percent from a record $10,190
on Feb. 15.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted in
September for the first time in more than two years, a report
from Markit showed today. Europe accounts for 19 percent of
global copper demand, compared with China’s 37 percent and 11
percent for  North America , according to Barclays Capital.  Global copper demand is expected to increase 3.9 percent
this year, faster than production and resulting in a shortfall
of 639,000 tons, Barclays said on Aug. 24.  “Copper’s almost like a symbol of the bigger commodity
markets,”  Kevin Norrish , an analyst at Barclays in London, said
today in an interview. “There’s evidence of increasing
fundamental tightness that’s not feeding into prices because of
macroeconomic concerns.”  On the LME, aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also
dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
