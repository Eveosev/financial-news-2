Stocks sank, dragging a gauge of
global equities into a bear market, Treasury 10-year yields slid
to a record low and the Dollar Index rose to a seven-month high
amid concern central banks are running out of tools to prevent a
recession. Commodities erased gains for the year.  The MSCI All-Country World Index plunged 4.5 percent at
4:39 p.m. New York time and is down 22 percent from its May
peak, while emerging-market stocks tumbled the most in almost
three years. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 3.2 percent to
1,129.56 after briefly falling below its 2011 closing low. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average slid the most over two days since
2008. Ten-year Treasury yields lost as much as 16 basis points
to 1.6961 percent. The Dollar Index rose 1.4 percent.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday it saw “significant
downside risks” in the economy and it will replace $400 billion
of short-term debt with longer-term Treasuries to spur growth as
the recovery falters.  China ’s manufacturing may shrink for a
third month, U.S. jobless claims topped estimates and euro-area
services and manufacturing output contracted for the first time
in more than two years, reports showed.  “The storyline is that global growth is decelerating,”
Mike Ryan, the New York-based chief investment strategist at UBS
Wealth Management Americas, said in a telephone interview. His
firm oversees $774 billion. “Financial stresses are rising and
policymakers are finding few viable options to stabilize the
real economy.”  Bear Markets  The MSCI global index of developed and emerging-market
stocks joined gauges of European and developing-nation equities
in entering a so-called bear market, typically defined as a drop
of at least 20 percent from a peak. The only developed markets
out of 24 that aren’t in bear markets are the U.S., the U.K.,
 Canada , Singapore and  New Zealand . The  S&P 500  is down 17
percent from a three-year high at the end of April.  The world is on the eve of the next financial crisis, with
sovereign debt at its epicenter, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief
executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., which
runs the biggest bond fund. The  European Central Bank  hasn’t put
in place a “circuit breaker” to contain the region’s debt
crisis, El-Erian, who is also Pimco’s co-chief investment
officer, said at an event in  Washington  today.  The Dow average plunged 391.01 points, or 3.5 percent, to
10,733.83 and lost 5.9 percent in two days for its steepest
decline since December 2008.  Commodity Shares Lead  Gauges of raw-material and energy producers lost more than
5 percent and industrial companies slid 3.8 percent to lead
losses among all 10 industry groups in the S&P 500, with Alcoa
Inc., Chevron Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. falling at least 4.4
percent.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the world’s biggest cargo
airline and considered a proxy for the global economy, tumbled
8.2 percent in its biggest drop since March 2009 after cutting
its full-year profit forecast amid falling demand in the U.S.
and Asia.  The S&P 500 extended this week’s slump to 7.1 percent and
dipped as low as 1,114.22, below its lowest closing level in
more than a year. The index lost 2.9 percent yesterday after the
Fed’s statement and as Moody’s Investors Service cut its long-
term credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. and  Wells Fargo &
Co ., saying U.S. support has become less likely if lenders get
into financial trouble. Citigroup Inc.’s short-term rating also
was downgraded by Moody’s.  ‘Orderly Selling’  “We’re seeing orderly selling,” Ryan Larson, head of U.S.
equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management Inc. in  Chicago ,
wrote in an e-mail. “While the headlines and tone remain very
much negative, the panic is not setting in.” Larson said he was
watching the 1,101 level on the S&P 500, which marked the 2011
intraday low on Aug. 9. “You might see panic set in if that
level fails to hold.”  The  S&P 500 Financials Index (S5FINL)  slumped 3 percent, extending
this week’s decline to 11 percent and sinking to the lowest
level since July 2009. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America and
Citigroup lost at least 3.5 percent today and traded at their
lowest prices since 2009.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
benchmark gauge of U.S. stock-option prices, surged 11 percent
to 41.35. Volatility gauges in  Europe  and Asia also climbed.  The S&P 500 may drop as low as 1,076 before investor panic
abates and stocks rally, according to Tom DeMark, the creator of
indicators for identifying turning points in securities. The
benchmark index may reach that level intraday as early as next
week and then gain as much as 20 percent, DeMark said in a
telephone interview from Phoenix today. The swings will push the
VIX above the high of 48 it reached on Aug. 8, he said.  Economy Watch  U.S. equities remained lower after a Conference Board
report that showed the index of U.S. leading indicators
increased more than forecast in August, pointing to a faster
pace of growth heading into next year. Applications for jobless
benefits fell 9,000 in the week ended Sept. 17 to 423,000, the
Labor Department said. Economists forecast 420,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The market is finally coming to understand that there’s
only so much the Fed can do for the economy,”  Michael Feroli ,
chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  Treasury 30-year bonds rallied, pushing yields down the
most over two days since the depths of the financial crisis
almost three years ago. Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 20
basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 2.798 percent and
fell as much 44 basis points over two days.  European Stocks  The Stoxx Europe 600 sank 4.6 percent today as all 19
industry groups declined at least 2.2 percent. The regional
index has tumbled 26 percent from its high for the year. Mining
companies and automakers led today’s retreat. Among national
indexes, the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , France’s  CAC-40 Index (CAC)  and
Germany’s DAX slid more than 4.6 percent.  European banks slumped 5.8 percent as a group, falling to
the lowest level since March 2009. Dexia SA and Lloyds Banking
Group Plc sank more than 10 percent. The biggest risk to the
euro area is a run on southern European banks, said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the  International Monetary
Fund , Handelsblatt reported.  The cost of insuring sovereign bonds jumped across Europe
with credit-default swaps on France and Germany surging to
records. Contracts on Germany rose 13 basis points to 109, swaps
on France jumped 16 to 205 basis points and Belgium, Italy and
Spain also reached records, according to CMA prices at 5 p.m. in
 London . The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of debt
swaps on 15 governments climbed eight basis points to an all-
time high of 362 based on closing prices.  ‘Negative Headwinds’  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in euro-area services and manufacturing industries fell below
50, indicating contraction, for the first time since July 2009,
Markit Economics said in an initial estimate. The index fell to
49.2 this month from 50.7 in August, a deeper slide than the
drop to 49.8 that economists had forecast, according to the
median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “We have negative headwinds that are absolutely massive,”
Patrick Legland, the Paris-based head of research at Societe
Generale SA, said in a Bloomberg Television interview with
Francine Lacqua in London. “There’s a very powerful slowdown
and maybe a recession for Europe and the U.S.”  ‘Bailing Out of Risk’  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, advanced to 78.39, the highest
level since February. The 17-nation euro pared losses against
the yen, trading down 1 percent after depreciating as much as
1.5 percent to the lowest level since June 2001. The euro sank
0.7 percent to $1.3472 and slid as low as $1.3385, the weakest
level since January versus the dollar.  “The euro zone is in meltdown and investors are bailing
out of risk wherever they can,” said  Steven Barrow , head of
research for Group of 10 currencies at Standard Bank Plc in
London, referring to yesterday’s statements by the Fed and the
Bank of England. “The fact that the Fed delivered no more than
the market expected was probably seen as a disappointment.”  The Australian dollar slid below parity with its U.S. peer
for the first time in more than six weeks, falling as much as
3.5 percent. New Zealand’s dollar sank 2.6 percent against the
U.S. currency as a report showed the economy almost stalled in
the second quarter, reinforcing the case for central bank
Governor Alan Bollard to maintain record-low  interest rates 
until 2012.  Commodities Plunge  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities fell 4.9 percent, the
biggest plunge since May, to leave it down 3.9 percent for the
year. Copper plunged to a one-year low, losing 7.3 percent to
$3.4885 a pound. Silver plunged 9.6 percent. Oil tumbled to a
six-week low, sliding 6.3 percent to $80.51 a barrel after
dipping as low as $79.66.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index sank 6.3 percent, the most
since November 2008. Indonesia’s  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  slumped
8.9 percent, the biggest loss since October 2008, and  Russia’s
Micex tumbled 7.8 percent for its worst plunge in two years. The
Shanghai Composite Index slid 2.8 percent after the
manufacturing gauge declined and the government said it will
broaden taxes levied on resources.  Manufacturing in China, the world’s largest metals user,
may shrink for a third month in September, according to a
preliminary index of purchasing managers from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics released today. The initial reading for
this month was 49.4 compared with a final 49.9 for August and
49.3 for July. Figures below 50 signal a contraction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
