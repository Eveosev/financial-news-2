Indonesia stocks plunged by the
most since October 2008 as overseas investors cut holdings,
while the rupiah rallied from a one-year low after the central
bank said it will intervene to slow the currency’s drop.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  sank 8.9 percent to 3,369.14 at
the 4 p.m. local-time close as investors sold riskier assets
amid concern global economic growth will slow. The gauge has
tumbled 19.7 percent from a record high on Aug. 1. Some
investors regard a drop of 20 percent or more as a  bear market .  The rupiah fell as much as 3.9 percent to 9,367 per dollar,
the weakest level since May last year, before recovering to
9,024.  Bank Indonesia , which said it intervened when the
currency slumped on Sept. 14, will remain in the market to boost
confidence, Hendar, the central bank’s director of monetary
policy, said today.  “Investors are afraid that if they don’t sell now, shares
will plunge further given the worsening condition of the global
economy,” said Soni Wibowo, who helps manage $1.98 billion at
PT Bahana TCW Investment Management in Jakarta. “ Risk aversion 
has risen.”  Overseas investors sold a net 4.5 trillion rupiah ($498.7
million) of Indonesian shares this month through yesterday,
paring net purchases this year to 9.7 trillion rupiah, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesian stocks are the most
“crowded” trade this year on a net-foreign-buying basis,
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report this week.  Treasury Yields  “The market is in a panic on concern the U.S. and  Europe 
crisis has come to Asia,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “Bank Indonesia
is trying to calm the market in this turmoil.”  Central banks intervene in  currency markets  by arranging
purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Indonesia has $125
billion in reserves with which to defend the rupiah.  The rupiah is still the best performer among the 10 most-
active currencies in  Asia  outside of  Japan  since end-2008,
having gained 20 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Foreign ownership of the government’s fixed-income
securities fell 5.6 percent to 233.49 trillion rupiah as of
Sept. 20, according to debt management office data. The yield on
Indonesian government benchmark 8.25 percent securities due July
2021 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.36
percent.  ‘Dumping Assets’  “Foreign investors are dumping local assets,” said Akbar Syarief, who helps manage $98 million in assets at PT MNC Asset
Management in Jakarta. “They’re seeking the safety of U.S.
Treasuries while waiting out developments in the U.S. and in
Europe.”  Treasury 10-year yields fell three basis points to 1.82
percent as the  Federal Reserve  signaled “significant downside
risks” in the  U.S. economy  and Moody’s Investors Service cut
credit ratings on three U.S. banks.  PT Astra International, Indonesia’s biggest auto retailer
and largest company by market value, tumbled 9.5 percent to
58,000 rupiah, the steepest loss since March 2009. PT Bank
Mandiri, the nation’s biggest lender by assets, sank 15 percent,
a record decline, to 5,300 rupiah.  PT Medco Energi International, the nation’s biggest oil
company, retreated 12 percent to 2,150 rupiah as oil futures
fell for a second day. Crude for November delivery dropped as
much as 3.8 percent to $82.63 a barrel in after-hours trading in
 New York .  PT Perusahaan Gas Negara, Indonesia’s biggest distributor
of the fuel, fell 13 percent to 2,200 rupiah as Bisnis  Indonesia 
reported the government is reviewing the possibility of reducing
natural-gas sales to Singapore to secure supplies to the
domestic market. Gas Negara Corporate Secretary Sri Budi
Mayaningsih couldn’t be reached when called at her office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
