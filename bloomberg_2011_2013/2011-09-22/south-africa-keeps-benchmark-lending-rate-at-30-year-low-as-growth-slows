South Africa should maintain
 government spending  and keep monetary policy loose to avoid an
economic slump, said Antoinette Sayeh, director of the
International Monetary Fund’s African department.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest economy, like some other
emerging nations, is expanding by less than its potential as the
debt crisis in  Europe  weakens export demand and lowers
investment, Sayeh said in an interview today in the Kenyan
capital, Nairobi.  “South Africa and other middle-income countries are likely
to be significantly affected by a euro crisis,” she said.
“We’re saying to those countries, that are not growing at the
level they could grow and where there are no financing
constraints, that they should indeed maintain that same stance
of larger fiscal deficits and potentially monetary policy that
is more lax, in order to mitigate the impact of that crisis on
their economy.”  South Africa ’s central bank left its benchmark lending rate
at a 30-year-low of 5.5 percent on Sept. 22 and said the
Monetary Policy Committee was “ready to act” if the economic
crisis in the U.S. and Europe threatens to derail growth.  South Africa’s economy is expected to expand 3.4 percent
this year and 3.6 percent in 2012, compared with a sub-Saharan
average of 5.25 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, the IMF
forecast in its  Regional Economic Outlook  published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
