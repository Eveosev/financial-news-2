Societe Cotonniere du Gourma,
 Burkina Faso’s  second-biggest cotton company, increased the area
of land under cultivation by 12 percent as it seeks to meet a
production target following a slow seasonal start.  The company, based in the eastern part of  Africa ’s biggest
cotton producer, is farming 55,800 hectares (137,900 acres) of
the fiber, more than the 50,000 hectares it expected to plant at
the start of the 2011-12 season in June, said Ali Compaore,
director general of the company.  Insects and a lack of rain during the planting season have
caused concern, he said by phone from Ouagadougou, the capital,
today. Socoma, as the company is known, expects “good” output of
at least 36,000 metric tons, he said.  A protest by farmers over prices for their crop, which
delayed planting in some areas, and unfavorable weather have cut
projections for the harvest for other companies, including
Societe Burkinabe des Fibres Textiles, the biggest buyer.
Farmers who sell to Socoma didn’t take part in the
demonstrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
