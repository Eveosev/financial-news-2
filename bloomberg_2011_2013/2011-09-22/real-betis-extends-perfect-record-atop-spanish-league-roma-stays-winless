Real Betis beat Real Zaragoza 4-3
to extend its perfect record in Spanish soccerâ€™s Primera
Division and open a two-point lead atop the standings.  Roque Santa Cruz  scored twice last night, either side of
penalties by Salva Sevilla and Benat Etxebarria. Zaragoza
rallied with two late goals from Juan Carlos after Betis
goalkeeper Casto Espoinosa was red-carded in the 69th minute.  Seville-based Betis, which won the Spanish league
championship in 1934-35, is the only club in the 20-team top
flight with a perfect record through four games. Valencia has 10
points in second place.  In  Italy , Roma remains winless after three matches
following a 1-1 home draw with Siena last night.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
