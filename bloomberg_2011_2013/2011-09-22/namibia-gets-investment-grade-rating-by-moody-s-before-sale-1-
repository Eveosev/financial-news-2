(Corrects bond sale amount in fourth paragraph in story
published yesterday.)  Namibia  was given the lowest
investment-level credit rating by Moody’s Investors Service as
the African nation plans to sell debt in international markets
this year.  Moody’s rated the country Baa3 with a stable outlook, it
said in a statement from  New York  today. The assessment is equal
to Tunisia and Colombia’s and is three steps below  South Africa ,
the largest economy on the continent.  “The low investment-grade ratings reflect the government’s
track record of responsible budget management and maintenance of
low public debt as well as an investor-friendly policy
framework,” according to the statement.  Namibia plans to sell as much as $500 million of bonds
abroad this year as the government seeks alternative forms of
financing, according to a Namibian official with knowledge of
the sale who declined to be identified because she isn’t
authorized to speak to the media.  Nigeria sold its first dollar-denominated debt in January
while  Kenya , Angola and Rwanda are planning to tap international
debt markets. Namibia is the fourth-largest producer of uranium
in the world and neighbors South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
