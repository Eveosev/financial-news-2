Japan  bought 96,624 metric tons of
milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia  in a regular
tender today, the smallest volume in two weeks, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  Shipment is set from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministry’s grain-trade division said by phone. It was the
smallest purchase since Sept. 8, when the government bought
86,471 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.52 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
