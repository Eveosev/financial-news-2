Hong Kong-listed Chinese real-
estate developers declined in early trading on the city;s stock
exchange after Credit Suisse Group AG said  China  appears to be
limiting funding for property companies.  KWG Property Holdings Ltd. fell 13 percent as of 10:15
a.m., Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. 12 percent,  Country Garden
Holdings Co. (2007)  13 percent,  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  13
percent,  Greentown China Holdings Ltd. (3900)  10 percent and  Shimao
Property Holdings Ltd. (813)  10 percent.  A Reuters report that the China Banking Regulatory
Commission ordered trust companies to inform the regulator of
their dealings with Greentown may be a sign that China is trying
to restrict financing sources for developers, Credit Suisse
analyst Jinsong Du wrote in a report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
