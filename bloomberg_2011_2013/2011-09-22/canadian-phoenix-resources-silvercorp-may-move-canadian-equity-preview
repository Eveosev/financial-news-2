Canadian stocks fell, drawing
closer to a  bear market  at any time since rebounding from a
five-year low in March 2009, as investors were forced to sell
precious metals to cover losses in other assets.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
declined 4.5 percent as the metal completed its biggest two-day
retreat since 1983.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) ,  Canada ’s fourth-
largest precious-metals company by market value, lost 8.9
percent as silver futures plunged the most in a day since at
least 1979. Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the biggest owner of the
Syncrude project, decreased 2.9 percent as crude oil settled
below $80 a barrel for the first time since Aug. 9.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 99.64
points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,462.87, extending its weekly
decline to 6.5 percent, the most since March 2009. The index has
decreased 19.7 percent since closing at a post-2008 high on
April 5. A decline of 20 percent is a common definition of a
bear market.  “Gold is not a safe haven,” Robert “Hap” Sneddon, the
president of Oakville, Ontario, money manager CastleMoore Inc.
and the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts, said in a
telephone interview. “When margin clerks call, people go to any
position that’s been strong to get that liquidity, and that’s
what’s happened with gold.”  The S&P/TSX sank 5.3 percent in the previous two sessions
as the U.S. Federal Reserve said the economic recovery is at
risk and economic data from  Europe ,  North America  and  China  were
more indicative of a slowdown than most economists had forecast
in Bloomberg surveys. The Canadian stock measure is set to drop
for a seventh straight month, the longest streak since 1984.  Gold, Silver  Gold futures dropped 5.9 percent in  New York  today. Silver
sank 18 percent after tumbling 9.6 percent yesterday. The
S&P/TSX Gold Index, which according to Bloomberg data includes
48 percent of the world’s publicly traded gold companies by
market value, completed its biggest two-day decline since April
2009.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
decreased 4.5 percent to C$47.90.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s
second-biggest company in the industry by market value, slipped
4.24 percent to C$46.95.  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG) , which mines in
Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, tumbled 9.8 percent to C$20.64. Silver
Wheaton lost 8.9 percent to C$33.24 for its biggest two-day
plunge since October 2008.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index fell to a two-year low as crude
futures completed a weekly drop.  30-Month Low  Canadian Oil Sands lost 2.9 percent to C$19.95, the lowest
close since March 2009.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
country’s second-biggest energy company by market value, slipped
2.2 percent to C$30.23 for a sixth-straight drop.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG) , which produces oil and gas in
 Colombia , declined 8.9 percent to an 11-month low of C$23.66
after Jamie Somerville, an analyst at Toronto-Dominion Bank, cut
his rating on the shares to “buy” from “action list buy.”
The company said yesterday it had failed to find oil in three
exploration wells.  Base-metal and coal producers in the S&P/TSX retreated for
a sixth day as copper completed its biggest two-day plunge since
October 2008.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest company in
the industry, decreased 3.2 percent to C$30.73.  Zambian Election  Copper producer  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  fell 7.3
percent to C$13.71 after  Michael Sata , who has called for higher
mining taxes, won Zambia’s presidential election. Shares of the
Vancouver-based company plunged 35 this week, the most since
October 2008.  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , which mines coal in Mongolia,
dropped 11 percent to C$6.65, the lowest since January 2009.
Shares of companies with operations in Mongolia have plunged
this week on concern the Asian country will seek to revise
ownership accords.  Financial and industrial companies rose after an internal
working paper showed European governments are exploring speeding
up the setup of a permanent rescue fund.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, gained 1.6 percent to C$46.09 after closing at the
lowest since July 2009 yesterday.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s
No. 3 lender, increased 1.5 percent to C$50.73.  Canadian Pacific
Railway Ltd. (CP) , the country’s second-biggest railroad, advanced
5.1 percent from a 22-month low to C$48.59.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Canada’s
largest drugmaker, climbed 5.2 percent to C$39.36 after Annabel Samimy, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note to
clients that the shares “have been unduly punished.” Valeant
had declined 9.1 percent in the previous four days.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which develops natural-gas
engine technology, rallied 6.4 percent to C$31.15 after saying
it replaced C$36 million ($35 million) in matured debt with
lower-cost debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
