Deutsche Bahn AG expects its high-
speed rail project in Stuttgart to cost 370 million euros ($499
million) more than planned, Die Welt said in advance of a report
to be published tomorrow, citing unnamed members of the
supervisory board.  The tunnel for the project will be more expensive than
forecast, the newspaper said. The German rail company will
present the new estimates to government and city officials
tomorrow, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
