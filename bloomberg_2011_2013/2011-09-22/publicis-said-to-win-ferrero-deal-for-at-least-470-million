Publicis Groupe SA (PUB) , the third-
largest advertising agency, won a marketing account from Italian
chocolate-maker Ferrero SPA valued at 350 million euros ($470
million) to 400 million euros annually, said a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The deal covers advertising and marketing business in
Italy,  Spain ,  France , Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece
and Turkey, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the contract hasn’t been announced yet.  Ferrero is a privately held company that makes the Nutella
hazelnut spread, Tic Tacs and Kinder chocolates in addition to
gold-foil-wrapped chocolates that bear the Ferrero Rocher label.
Giovanni Ferrero, son of founder Michele Ferrero, runs the
company after his brother, the former chief executive officer,
died in an accident in April.  Publicis and Ferrero declined to comment.  The company’s past television ads featured an ambassador’s
reception and labeled the Ferrero Rocher chocolates “A sign of
good taste.” Pierce Brosnan, an actor who has played spy  James
Bond , has also appeared in the ads eating the candy in casinos
and on yachts.  Publicis fell 5.3 percent to 30.45 euros at 5:30 p.m. in
Paris, where the company is based. The shares have declined 22
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
