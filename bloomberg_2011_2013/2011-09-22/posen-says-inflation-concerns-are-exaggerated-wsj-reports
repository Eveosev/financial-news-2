Bank of England  policy maker  Adam
Posen  said the risks that higher inflation expectations will get
entrenched are “exaggerated,” the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview.  “The likelihood of it happening in the current economic
environment seems extremely low,” he said.  He said central banks should take a “roughly coordinated”
move to ease policy, though “at the moment there is no sign
that this will happen.”  Central bank officials have a “tendency to err on the side
of being too tight” and operate in an environment where “there
are all kinds of incentives to reward you for being sober and
conservative and prudent,” he said.  Policy makers who misunderstood the depth of the impact
from the financial turmoil “made an honest mistake,” he said.
“They just underestimated the extent of the shock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
