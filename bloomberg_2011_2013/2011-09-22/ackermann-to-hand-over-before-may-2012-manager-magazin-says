Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  will hand over responsibility for the
German lender before he officially leaves the post in May 2012,
 Manager Magazin  said, in a preview of an article due for
publication tomorrow.  Ackermann will give up responsibility for the bank to joint
chief executives Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen early next
year,  Manager Magazin  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The new co-CEOs will focus on costs and improving the
bankâ€™s internal control systems, the German magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
