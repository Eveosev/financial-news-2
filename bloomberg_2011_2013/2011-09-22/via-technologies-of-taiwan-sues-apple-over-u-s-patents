Apple Inc., the world’s biggest
technology company by value, was sued by Taiwan’s  Via
Technologies Inc. (2388)  for allegedly infringing three U.S. patents
for microprocessors used in mobile phones and tablet computers.  Via, a semiconductor maker based in Taipei, seeks a  jury
trial  and an order to prohibit Cupertino, California-based Apple
from selling products containing the inventions in the U.S.,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  “The products at issue generally concern microprocessors
included in a variety of electronic products such as certain
smartphones, tablet computers, portable media players and other
computing devices,” Via said in the complaint.  Apple will dominate tablet-computer sales this holiday
season, and global media tablet sales this year may reach more
than 63 million units, according to researcher Gartner Inc.  Apple officials didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Via Technologies v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
