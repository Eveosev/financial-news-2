Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
advanced, pushing yields to the lowest level in a week, on
investor concern that the  Federal Reserve ’s bond purchase plan
may be insufficient to spur economic growth.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.57
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the lowest since
Sept. 14. The rate on the 5.5 percent bond maturing in January
2022 fell three basis points to 4.75 percent. The benchmark
TA-25 Index of shares fell 4.3 percent, the most since Sept. 4.  Federal Reserve policy makers said yesterday “there are
significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including
strains in global financial markets.” The bank will extend the
average maturities of the Treasuries in its portfolio by
purchasing $400 billion of long-term debt while selling an equal
amount of shorter-term securities, the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said in  Washington  after ending a two-day meeting.  “The Fed plan was much expected,” Alex Zabezhinsky, chief
economist at DS Securities & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said
by telephone. “The plan is not bringing a solution to improve a
faltering U.S. economy, which is also impacting Israel’s growth
prospects.”  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  this week voiced
concern about the possible effects a prolonged economic slump in
the U.S. and  Europe , the country’s main export markets. The
central bank today lowered its economic growth forecast to 4.7
percent for this year and to 3.2 percent for 2012, compared with
Aug. 2 predictions of 4.8 percent and 3.9 percent.  Shekel Drops  The shekel weakened 0.6 percent to 3.7280 against the
dollar at 4:59 p.m., bringing the loss this month to 4.3
percent. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds fell 0.9
percent.  The  Bank of Israel  said today its staff forecast is for the
benchmark interest rate to fall to 3 percent from 3.25 percent
in 12 months. Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of
investor expectations for rates in the next two years, dropped
seven basis points to 2.93 percent, the lowest in a week.  The central bank will maintain the rate at 3.25 percent for
a fourth month at its policy meeting on Sept. 26, according to
19 of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The central bank
can cut the rate if needed, Fischer said at a Sept. 18 press
conference.  “The threat of a global economic slowdown increases the
chance the central bank will cut  interest rates  next week as
inflation has eased and is less of a concern,” said
Zabezhinksy, who expects the rate to be lowered to 3 percent.  Consumer prices are expected to rise 2.3 percent in the
next 12 months compared with 2.7 percent in the previous
estimate, the average of forecasters surveyed by the central
bank showed, the Bank of Israel said Sept. 20. The annual
inflation rate in August was 3.4 percent, the same as in the
previous month.  The yield on the inflation-linked bond due June 2013
dropped three basis points to 1.13 percent, the lowest level
since Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
