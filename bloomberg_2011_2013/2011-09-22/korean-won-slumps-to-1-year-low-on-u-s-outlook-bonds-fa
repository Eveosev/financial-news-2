South Korea’s won sank to a one-
year low after the  Federal Reserve  said there are “significant
downside risks” to the  U.S. economy , dimming the outlook for
Korean exports and deterring risk-taking. Bonds advanced.  The Fed said yesterday it will replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to
reduce borrowing costs and counter the rising risk of a
recession. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Bank of America
Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.’s long-term credit ratings and
Citigroup Inc.’s short-term rating yesterday, saying the
government is “more likely” to allow a large bank to fail than
it was during the financial crisis.  The won slid 2.6 percent to 1,179.85 per dollar at the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, extending this week’s loss to 5.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,180.19
today, the weakest level since September 2010, after overseas
investors pulled $918 million from Korean stocks this month
through yesterday, according to exchange data.  “The Fed’s emphasis on economic downside risks raised fear
among investors, boosting dollar demand” said Yun Se Min, a
Seoul-based currency dealer at Busan Bank. “There was
speculation the government intervened to prevent the won from
weakening below the 1,180 per dollar level.”  The potential outflow of foreign capital from  South Korea 
is a major concern, Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Seok Dong said today in a CBS radio interview. The current
global economic difficulties will likely drag on for “quite a
long” period, Kim said.  Bonds Rise  South Korea’s three-year bonds advanced. The yield on the
3.5 percent debt due June 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.50 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show.  Overseas investors boosted their holdings of South Korea’s
local-currency bonds by 164.8 billion won ($139 million) this
month through Sept. 21, according to the Financial Supervisory
Service. European investors cut their holdings by 888.3 billion
won during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
