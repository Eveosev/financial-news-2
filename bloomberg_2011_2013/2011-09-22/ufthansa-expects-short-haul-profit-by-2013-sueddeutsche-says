Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  expects its
short-haul flight network to be profitable as of 2013,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with Carsten Spohr, head of the company’s German airline operations.  Short-haul services out of Frankfurt and Munich will be
profitable as of next year, Sueddeutsche cited Spohr as saying.
The airline is also building up intercontinental connections,
with new flights from Dusseldorf to  Asia  to be introduced in the
next summer schedule, and routes from the city to Tokyo and
Delhi “very high on the list,” the executive said, according
to the Munich-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
