Following is the text of the
monthly McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge report.  August Construction Climbs 8 Percent  At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $424.7 billion, new
construction starts in August advanced 8%, according to McGraw-
Hill Construction, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies. The
gain followed a 10% decline in July, and continued the
fluctuating pattern that’s been present in recent months. The
pickup for total construction in August was the result of
greater activity for each of construction’s three main sectors -
nonresidential building, residential building, and nonbuilding
construction. For the first eight months of 2011, total
construction on an unadjusted basis was reported at $274.8
billion, down 6% from the same period a year ago.  The August statistics lifted the Dodge Index to 90 (2000=100),
up from July’s 83. “During the first five months of this year,
total construction had trended downward, but over the next three
months an up-anddown pattern has emerged,” stated Robert A.
Murray, vice president of economic affairs for McGraw-Hill
Construction. “This suggests that construction starts are
beginning to stabilize after the earlier loss of momentum. At
the same time, total construction remains on track to register a
moderate decline for 2011 as a whole, after leveling off in 2010.
While August showed some improvement for institutional building
and public works, each of these sectors will be subject to
funding cutbacks at the federal and state levels of government.
Single family housing continues to see homebuyer demand
restrained by the sluggish economic environment and more
restrictive lending standards. And, what appears to be the early
signs of recovery for commercial building may well end up being
deferred by rising investor concern about employment growth and
the near term prospects for the  U.S. economy .”  Nonresidential building in August grew 7% to $153.6 billion
(annual rate). The institutional side of the nonresidential
market showed a strong gain for healthcare facilities, which
jumped 107%. Lifting the healthcare total in August was the
start of a $385 million U.S. Army medical center at Fort Hood TX.
Additional support came from the start of two large hospital
projects in California, valued at $270 million and $164 million
respectively, and a $220 million hospital project in  Maine . The
public building category climbed 55% in August from its low July
amount, reflecting the start of a $115 million courthouse
building in Philadelphia PA. The amusement-related category in
August increased 18%, helped by the start of a $45 million
sports arena in Bangor ME and a $45 million convention center in
Cedar Rapids IA. Heading downward in August was the educational
building category, which fell 7% despite groundbreaking for a
$95 million high school in  Maryland  and an $86 million
biomedical research facility in  Minnesota . Also retreating in
August were churches, down 11%; and transportation terminals,
down 8%.  The commercial side of the nonresidential market showed a mixed
pattern by project type. Hotel construction surged 125% from a
weak July, helped by the start of a $154 million convention
center hotel in Nashville TN. Warehouse construction grew 30%,
with the push coming from the start of a $150 million
distribution center in Martinsburg WV, while store construction
advanced 18%. Moving in the opposite direction was office
construction, which fell 18% in August. A steeper decline was
reported for the manufacturing building category, which
retreated 62% from July which included the start of a $1.5
billion semiconductor plant in  Arizona .  Residential building, at $128.0 billion (annual rate), increased
4% in August. Most of the upward movement came from multifamily
housing, which rose 15% in August, continuing the trend that has
been present for much of 2011. Large multifamily projects that
reached groundbreaking in August included the $362 million
Gotham West apartment complex in New York NY, a $137 million
apartment complex in Marina Del Ray CA, and a $90 million
apartment building in Boston MA. Through the first eight months
of 2011, the top five metropolitan areas in terms of the dollar
amount of multifamily projects were - New York NY, Washington DC,
Boston MA, Chicago IL, and Los Angeles CA. Single family housing
in August managed to edge up 1%, as the pattern of recent months
suggests that activity is stabilizing at a low volume after the
declines witnessed earlier in 2011. The pace for single family
housing in August, in dollar terms, was still 2% below the
average monthly pace that was shown during 2010.  Nonbuilding construction in August climbed 13% to $143.0 billion,
making a partial rebound after plunging 23% in July. The dams
and river/harbor development category surged 283%, reflecting
the boost coming from $1.5 billion for work on the Olmsted Dam
in  Kentucky , as well as $260 million for the Calaveras Dam
replacement project in California. Sewer and waste disposal
construction was also strong in August, advancing 64%, with
support coming from the start of a $463 million chemical weapons
storage and disposal facility in  Colorado . Other types of public
works retreated in August, including a 21% drop for highways and
bridges. Murray noted, “Of the various project types, highway
and bridge construction received the most support from federal
stimulus funds over the past two years, but that support has
diminished substantially during 2011.” August declines were also
reported for “miscellaneous” public works (e.g., site work, rail
lines, pipelines), down 8%; and water supply systems, down 14%.
For the electric utility category, contracting continued to be
strong with a 16% gain in August. Large electric utility
projects that reached the construction start stage were led by
two located in  California  - a $750 million solar power facility
and a $500 million natural gas fired power plant.  The 6% shortfall for total construction on an unadjusted basis
during the January-August period of 2011 reflected a mixed
performance by sector. Nonresidential building fell 8% year-to-
date, as a 17% drop for institutional building outweighed a 4%
gain for commercial building and a 72% gain for manufacturing
building. Residential building decreased 5% year-to-date, with
single family housing down 7% while multifamily housing advanced
8%. Nonbuilding construction year-to-date slipped 4%, as public
works retreated 23% while electric utilities soared 129%. By
region, total construction starts showed the following year-to-
date performance - the Midwest and Northeast, each down 13%; the
South Atlantic, down 6%; the South Central, down 4%; and the
West, up 4%.
