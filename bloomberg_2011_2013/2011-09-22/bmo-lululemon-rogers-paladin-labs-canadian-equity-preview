Canadian stocks fell to the lowest
since August 2010 after economic data from  Europe ,  North America 
and  China  indicated the global recovery may be slowing and fuel
and metal prices dropped on a stronger  U.S. dollar .  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
declined 6.4 percent, sinking with precious metals as the U.S.
Dollar Index surged to the highest since February.  Royal Bank of

points, or 3.3 percent, the most in six weeks, to 11,562.51.  “Nothing has changed with respect to Europe and there’s
still a response in the marketplace to the  Federal Reserve ,”
which cited significant risks to growth yesterday, said Gareth Watson, at Richardson GMP Ltd. in Toronto. Watson is vice
president of  investment management  at Richardson GMP, which
oversees about C$16 billion ($15.5 billion). “In terms of the
Canadian market, the Chinese PMI number this morning isn’t
helping sentiment amongst resource names, so we’re being hit
from all sides.”  Canada ’s stock benchmark has slumped 13 percent this
quarter as energy and financial stocks dropped on concern the
world’s economy will grow at a slower pace than previously
forecast.  Forecasts Cut  The  International Monetary Fund  estimated on Sept. 20 that
world gross domestic product will increase 4 percent this year

and 4.5 percent for 2012. The S&P/TSX is set to decline for a
seventh straight month, the longest streak since 1984.  Canadian retail sales fell twice as fast as economists

manufacturing growth contracted for the first time in more than
two years this month. China’s manufacturing may shrink for a
third month in September, the longest contraction since 2009.  Gold, Silver Retreat  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
