Gold fell to a four-week low in
London as the dollar’s rally cut demand for the metal as an
alternative asset after the  Federal Reserve  said it will buy
longer-maturity  U.S. debt . Palladium slid to a nine-month low.  The dollar climbed to a seven-month high against six major
currencies after the Fed moved to lower long-term borrowing
costs and said there are “significant downside risks” to the
economic outlook. Commodities including copper and crude oil
slid today. Gold touched a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6.  “We’re seeing the dollar strengthen and that’s weighing
down on the whole commodity complex,”  Dan Smith , an analyst at
Standard Chartered Plc in London, said today by phone. Still,
“we don’t see a huge downside for gold in this environment.
There will be a rebound at some point.”  Immediate-delivery gold declined as much as $26.38, or 1.5
percent, to $1,755.97 an ounce, the lowest price since Aug. 25,
and was at $1,756.93 by 11:19 a.m. in  London . Gold for December
delivery was 2.7 percent lower at $1,759.20 on the Comex in  New
York .  The metal fell to $1,765.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,793 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 24 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  Fed Purchases  The Fed said yesterday it will buy $400 billion of bonds
with maturities of six to 30 years through June, while selling
an equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less. It will
also reinvest maturing mortgage debt into mortgage-backed
securities instead of Treasuries. The action “should put
downward pressure on longer-term  interest rates  and help make
broader financial conditions more accommodative,” the Fed said.  “We see the stronger dollar weighing on all commodities
including gold,” Lv Xiaowei, an analyst at First Futures Co.,
said from Tianjin,  China . “If the global economy continues to
deteriorate, there will come a point where we’ll see both gold
and the dollar going higher together as people look for least
risky assets.”  Open interest in the Comex option to buy gold at $1,800
that expires on Sept. 27 is 10,133 contracts, Bloomberg data
show. That’s “gaining attention” and as the expiry date nears
“prices may increasingly gravitate towards the $1,800 strike
level,”  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG, wrote
today in a report.  Gold exchange-traded-product holdings were little changed
at 2,236.7 metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Assets reached a record 2,298.4 tons on Aug. 8.  Silver for immediate delivery fell as much as 3.7 percent
to $38.2225 an ounce, the lowest price since Aug. 12, and was
last at $38.285. Platinum slid 1.7 percent to $1,731.88 an ounce
after dropping to $1,730.15, the lowest price since Aug. 9.
Palladium was 4 percent lower at $664 an ounce, the lowest level
since Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter for this story:
