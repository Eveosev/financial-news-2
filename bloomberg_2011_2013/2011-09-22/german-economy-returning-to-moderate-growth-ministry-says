The German economy shrugged off
near-static expansion in the second quarter to return to a
“moderate growth path” in the third, driven by private
consumption and industrial orders, the  Finance Ministry  said.  “Industry’s favorable start in the third quarter turns out
to be somewhat surprising,” the Berlin-based ministry said in
its monthly report released today. Domestic manufacturing orders
in July led by car production marked an “energetic” start to
the third quarter, the ministry said.  Germany ’s economy,  Europe ’s biggest, grew 1.3 percent in
the first quarter before weaker global demand and the debt
crises in Europe and the U.S. helped sap growth in the second
three-month period. The economy may expand by 2.6 percent this
year after 3.6 percent in 2010, the government estimates.  Weaker global economic growth may ease  oil prices , helping
German industry factor costs and reducing consumer price
inflation that reached 2.6 percent in August, the ministry said.  Tax revenue growth that is helping the government narrow
its deficit this year is losing pace, expanding 4 percent in
August compared with July, the ministry said. The federal
deficit, one of three components making up the national deficit,
will probably decline to about 30 billion euros ($41.1 billion)
from 44.3 billion euros last year, it said.  The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden will  publish  its
provisional forecast for third-quarter growth on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
