The upper Great Plains and  Rocky
Mountains  may warm while the rest of the U.S. has moderate
temperatures into the first week of October, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Rogers said computer forecast models have been consistent
in the past two days, so today’s 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day
outlooks aren’t much different from yesterday’s.  “The models offered few surprises overnight,” Rogers
wrote in a note to clients.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
