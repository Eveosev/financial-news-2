Brazil’s largest banks don’t hold
Greek sovereign debt and have only “minimal” holdings in
European sovereign bonds, Bank of America Corp. said.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  holds 3.7 percent of its market
value in European debt,  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  holds 0.9 percent,
Banco Santander Brasil SA holds 0.7 percent and  Banco Bradesco
SA (BBDC4)  holds 0.2 percent, analysts including Jorg Friedemann wrote
in a note to clients dated yesterday.  While Brazilian lenders are insulated from  Europe ’s debt
crisis, quickening inflation may hurt asset quality, offsetting
the benefits of interest-rate cuts by the central bank, the
analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
