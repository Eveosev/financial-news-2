U.S. used vehicle prices decreased 
in August according to Manheim Auctions, the worldâ€™s largest
reseller of used vehicles.  The used vehicle index decreased 1.7 percent in August from 
a month earlier. From a year earlier, the index was up 4.1 percent.
The latest U.S. government CPI report estimates that the yearly
change in used car prices is 5.3 percent. Used car prices have
about a 2 percent weighting in the overall consumer prices.
Manheim computes the index based on more than five million
auction transactions annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
