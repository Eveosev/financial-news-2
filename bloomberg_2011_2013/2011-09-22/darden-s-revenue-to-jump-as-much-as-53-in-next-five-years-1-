Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) , operator
of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster dining chains, said annual
revenue will increase by as much as 53 percent by fiscal 2016.  Revenue will be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion in
2016, Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis said today during a
webcast of the  Orlando , Florida-based company’s annual meeting.
In the next five years, Darden will increase profit by as much
as $3.50 a share, he said.  Darden dropped 68 cents to $44.56 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 4
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent drop for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company, which has about 1,900 restaurants, also owns
LongHorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Seasons
52. New restaurant brands, which may be developed internally or
acquired, will help boost sales, Otis said. Darden may add as
many as 520 new restaurants by 2016, he said.  Sales rose 5.4 percent to $7.5 billion in the fiscal year
ended May 29, the company said in June. Net income increased 18
percent to $476.3 million, or $3.39 a share in the period, from
$404.5 million, or $2.84, the year earlier.  Darden will release first-quarter earnings on Sept. 28
before the market opens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
