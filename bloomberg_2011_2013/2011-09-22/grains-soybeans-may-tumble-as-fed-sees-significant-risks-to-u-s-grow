What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 18 cents to 22 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the Federal Reserve
said that the U.S. economy faces “significant downside risks,”
eroding the prospects for global commodity demand, Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview today.  -- Soybean futures may open 27 cents to 30 cents a bushel lower
on speculation that global demand for vegetable oils, animal
feed and fuel made from the oilseed is falling faster than the
weather-related supply reductions in the U.S., Schultz said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open down 1 cent to 1.3
cents a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $6 to $7 lower
for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open down 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that larger world crops and a
global slowdown will curb demand for U.S. supplies, Schultz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
