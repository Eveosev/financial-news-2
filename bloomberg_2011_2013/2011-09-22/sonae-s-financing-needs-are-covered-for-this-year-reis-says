Sonae (SON)  SGPS SA, a Portuguese
retailer, said its financing needs are covered until the end of
this year.  The Portuguese retailer’s 2012 financing needs are also
“practically closed,” board member Luis Reis told reporters
today at a conference organized by  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  in Cascais,
Portugal.  Sonae’s debt is expected to remain below the 3 billion
euros reported for 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
