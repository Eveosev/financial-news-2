As many as 42 vessels were waiting
to load sugar at ports in top global producer  Brazil , 10 more
than a week ago, according to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  The vessels were waiting to load 1.16 million metric tons
of the sweetener from Recife, Suape, Maceio, Paranagua and
Santos, Williams data showed. On Sept. 14, 32 vessels were
lining up to load 905,648 tons, the shipping agency said.  Sugar will be loaded in 10 vessels in ports in the
Northeast region, while the other 32 will depart from Center
South, the nation’s main producing area, the data showed. Santos
is the country’s largest port.  Center South’s cane crop will fall for the first time in a
decade to 510.2 million tons, said industry group Unica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
