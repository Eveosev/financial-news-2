Indian government bonds gained for
a second day on speculation the central bank will halt interest-
rate increases as the global economy weakens.  The yield on the most-traded 7.8 percent note due April
2021 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.31
percent as of 9:06 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the lowest level this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
