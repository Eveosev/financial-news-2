Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC, the
operator of  Carrefour SA (CA)  stores in the  Middle East , reported a
first-half loss after a profit a year earlier as it wrote down
the value of properties amid falling prices in Dubai.  The loss was 164.9 million dirhams ($45 million), compared
with a profit of 195.9 million dirhams a year earlier, it said
in a  statement . The property valuation loss was 317.1 million
dirhams, from 233.7 million dirhams a year earlier.  Majid Al Futtaim Holding raised $1 billion from a group of
banks in July to refinance debt and to boost liquidity. The
company earlier that month delayed a plan to sell five-year
bonds after price bids did not meet its expectations.  Dubai’s property market had one of the world’s biggest
reversals following the global credit crisis three years ago,
with  home prices  slumping 64 percent since they peaked in mid-
2008, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank AG.  Majid Al Futtaim’s first-half revenue rose 9.2 percent to
9.36 billion dirhams. It also booked an impairment provision of
287.2 million dirhams in the first half, compared with 4.5
million dirhams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
