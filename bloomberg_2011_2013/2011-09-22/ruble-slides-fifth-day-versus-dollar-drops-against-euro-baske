The ruble declined for a 10th day
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket, extending
its longest losing streak since January 2009, as  oil prices  fell
after the  Federal Reserve  said there are “significant downside
risks” to the  U.S. economy .  The ruble depreciated 1 percent to 37.0436 versus the
basket by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest level since
December 2009. The ruble sank 1.8 percent to 32.0475 against the
dollar and dropped 0.2 percent to 43.15 per the euro.  Crude slumped as much as 6.6 percent to $80.25 a barrel as
the Fed said it will buy $400 billion of long-term debt in an
attempt to keep the economy of the biggest oil-consuming nation
from recession.  Russia  is the world’s largest crude producer.  “There are no signs of the bottom yet for emerging-market
currencies, and that includes the ruble,”  Benoit Anne , head of
emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA in  London , said
by e-mail today. “Bank Rossii will intervene, but it is not
clear at this stage whether this will make a huge difference --
it will all depend on the bank’s commitment to defending the
ruble, which I am not sure is on top of the policy priorities
right now.”  The central bank uses the basket to smooth currency
movements that can hurt exporters. The regulator sells more
dollars and euros the closer the ruble gets to the weaker end of
a so-called floating corridor that stood at 32.15 to 37.15
rubles as of Sept. 20, according to  Renaissance Capital .  Defending the Ruble  The country’s gold and currency reserves fell $6.8 billion
in the week to Sept. 16, the biggest decline in three months, to
$532 billion, Bank Rossii said in a statement on its website
today. The central bank may be selling $400 million to $500
million of its reserves every day to curb the drop, according to
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s estimates.  The bank should increase its intervention thresholds and
make defending the ruble a higher priority, Anne said today,
“as a sharp selloff will seriously dent investor confidence
towards Russia.”  Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 32.5655 per
dollar in three months, compared with 31.7928 yesterday. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency shifts.  Urals crude oil, Russia’s main export blend, fell for a
fifth day, losing 3.2 percent to $107.95 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
