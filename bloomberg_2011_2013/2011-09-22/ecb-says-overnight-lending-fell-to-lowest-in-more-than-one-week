The  European Central Bank  said
financial institutions reduced emergency overnight borrowing to
the lowest level in more than a week.  Euro-area banks tapped the ECB for 179 million euros
($242.6 million) last night at the marginal rate of 2.25
percent, down from 1.1 billion euros the previous day and the
lowest since Sept. 12, the Frankfurt-based central bank said
today. Lenders deposited 121.4 billion euros with the ECB
yesterday, up from 114.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
