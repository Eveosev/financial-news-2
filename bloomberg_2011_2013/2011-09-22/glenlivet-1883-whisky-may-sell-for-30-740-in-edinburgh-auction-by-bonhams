A bottle of 1883 Glenlivet whisky
sold at auction in Edinburgh for 18,750 pounds ($29,530) as
collectors continue to pay up for rare malts.  The Scotch, sold by Bonhams in the Scottish capital today,
was distilled on May 19th, 1883, and bottled in December 1931,
the company said. The bottle had an auctioneer’s guide price of
15,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds.  A bottle from the Glenfiddich distillery with whisky
matured for 64 years sold for 25,200 pounds at Bonhams in
Edinburgh on June 16 last year. That price compared at the time
with a world record of 29,400 pounds for a bottle of Scotch set
in Glasgow in 2007. The prices include the auctioneer’s fee.  To contact the writer on the story:
