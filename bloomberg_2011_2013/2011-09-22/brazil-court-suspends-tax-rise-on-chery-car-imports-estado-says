A Brazilian federal court passed an
injunction yesterday temporarily exempting Venko Motors, which
imports cars made by Chery Automobile Co. Ltd., from paying a
higher rate of so-called industrial products tax, O Estado de S.
Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  Venko will be exempt from the 30 percentage-point IPI tax
increase for 90 days, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
