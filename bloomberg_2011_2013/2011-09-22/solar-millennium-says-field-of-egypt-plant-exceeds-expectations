Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , a developer of
solar-thermal power plants from  Germany , said the solar field in
its 250-million euro ($336 million) hybrid development in Egypt
helped generate 8 percent more energy than forecast.  Output from the 53,000 parabolic mirrors of the Kuraymat
plant, south of Cairo, “considerably” exceeded expectations,
the Erlangen-based company said in a statement today.  The 150-megawatt site was one of the first solar and gas-
fired hybrid generators when operations began in June. It makes
energy for almost 2 million households, combining a gas turbine
with parabolic trough technology, in which mirrors concentrate
solar energy to heat liquids and power turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
