Nigeria , a favored supplier of
crude to U.S. refiners, plans to boost its daily exports of 19
major crude grades by 1.1 percent in November, according to
loading plans obtained by Bloomberg News.  The largest oil producer in  Africa  will ship 69 cargoes
totaling 62 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels a day. This
compares with next monthâ€™s plan to export 68 consignments with a
daily volume of 2.04 million barrels.  The country will export 12 shipments of Qua Iboe, seven
Agbami, six Forcados, six Bonny, five Akpo, five Bonga, five
Brass River, five Escravos, four Erha, three Yoho, three Amenam,
two Antan, two Okono, one Okwori, one Pennington, one Abo and
one Oso in November, the plan showed. No EA and Oyo will be
exported in November. Cargo sizes range from 100,000 barrels to
1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
