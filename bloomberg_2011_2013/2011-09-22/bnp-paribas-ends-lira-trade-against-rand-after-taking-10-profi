BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  France ’s largest
bank, closed a trade buying the Turkish lira against the South
African rand after making a 10 percent profit in two weeks, said
 Bartosz Pawlowski , head of emerging markets strategy.  BNP bought the lira at 4.06 versus the rand two weeks ago
and sold it at 4.53 today, Pawlowski said in response to
questions by instant message. The trade may have generated more
profit as the lira, which was previously the world’s worst-
performing major currency to date, catches up to other emerging
market currencies, Pawlowski said.  “It’s not that I think the lira cannot go further up
against the rand, but 10 percent on this cross in two weeks is
more than enough,” he said.  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.8218 per dollar at 12:20
p.m. in Istanbul. The rand rose 0.6 percent to 8.2031 against
the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
