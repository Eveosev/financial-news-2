Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer, are stepping up the pace of
sales from the new crop after the local currency plunged 16
percent this month, boosting revenue from dollar-denominated
exports, the Celeres crop-research group said.  Growers have sold about 20 percent of the crop to be
harvested next year, up from a five-year average of about 17
percent to 18 percent, said Leonardo Menezes, an analyst for the
Uberlandia, Brazil-based group. Celeres will release a report on
sales on Sept. 26.  “From Mato Grosso to Parana state, growers all over Brazil
are speeding up sales,” Menezes said in a telephone interview
today. “The dollar’s rise has been surprisingly steep and it
didn’t go unnoticed by farmers.”  The Brazilian real’s drop against the dollar this month
makes it the second-worst performer among 17 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil will produce a record 75.2 million tons of soybeans
next year, up from 74.9 million tons this year, Celeres said.
Planting starts this month and the harvest begins by January.
The dollar’s rally “more than compensates” for a drop in
soybean prices, Menezes said.  “By selling next year’s crop in advance, farmers are
securing a profit margin of as much as 40 percent,” he said.
“That’s pretty amazing.”  Soybean futures have fallen 11 percent this month on
concerns that  Europe ’s debt crisis will curb demand for food and
animal feed. Contracts for November delivery fell 37.5 cents, or
2.8 percent, to close at $12.83 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the eighth decline in nine sessions.  The U.S. is the world’s largest soybean producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
