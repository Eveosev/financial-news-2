Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011 against the dollar, fell to an
18-year low after a pledge by the U.S.  Federal Reserve  to buy
$400 billion of long-term debt drove the dollar higher.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 3.7 percent to 2,890 per dollar at 4:26 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, the weakest level since at least June 1993,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dollar rose to a seven-month high against a six-
currency basket as investors sought haven investments after the
U.S. central bank said there are “significant downside risks to
the economic outlook, including strains in global financial
markets.”  “The market has been driven by the general sentiment about
the dollar strength after the Federal Reserve announced its
position,” Ahmed Kalule, the head of  currency trading  at Bank
of Africa Uganda Ltd. said by phone from Kampala. “People are
now finding it safe to invest in the dollar as the pound
sterling and the euro have weakened.” Speculative buying may
also be blamed for the volatility in the Ugandan exchange market
today, he said.  Uganda’s shilling has depreciated 20 percent this year
against the dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing
currency during the period.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
