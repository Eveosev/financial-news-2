China ’s production of nickel pig
iron, a low-cost alternative to refined nickel, should increase
to at least 300,000 metric tons next year from an expected
260,000 tons this year, said Xu Aidong, chief analyst at Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  Nickel pig iron production should account for almost 60
percent of China’s total primary nickel output this year,
according to Antaike. China should import about 30 million tons
of lower-grade nickel ore next year to produce nickel pig iron,
the company estimates.  “The most important risk for nickel pig iron production is
ore supply,” Xu said today at the China Metal Forum in
 Stockholm . “High nickel content ore is limited and more and
more low grade nickel grade ore is exported to China.”  Production of the substitute may reach about 400,000
tons by 2015, according to Xu.  Nickel for delivery in three months fell $1,050, or 5.2
percent, to $19,350 a ton by 4:03 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
