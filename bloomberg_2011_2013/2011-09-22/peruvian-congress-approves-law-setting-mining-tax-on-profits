Peru ’s Congress passed a law
increasing a mining windfall tax by sixfold as the Andean
country seeks to tap metals prices to boost public spending.  The 130-member legislature approved the law today by 80
votes to one with 21 abstentions. Peruvian mining companies
agreed to pay about 3 billion soles ($1.1 billion) in an annual
tax on profits, Cabinet Chief Salomon Lerner said Aug. 25. Peru
is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer and
second-largest silver producer.  “The fact that it’s mostly attached to profits and not
revenues is looking quite reasonable,” Joanne Freeze, chief
executive officer of Canadian metals exploration company
Candente Resource Corp., said today at the Bloomberg Mila
conference in  New York .  The company makes its business plan with a forecast of
copper costing $2.25 a pound and “if we’re selling copper at $4
a pound and paying more tax, that’s OK,” Freeze said  Peru’s President  Ollanta Humala , a former army rebel, won
the June 5 election on pledges to raise mining royalties and
tighten state control over natural resources. The country
boosted first-half mining export revenue by 31 percent to $13.2
billion as copper jumped 46 percent and gold rose 21 percent
from a year earlier.  The tax replaces a previous levy during former President
 Alan Garcia ’s mandate from 2006-2011, when mining companies paid
2.5 billion soles in tax over five years. The tax will enable
miners to remain competitive,  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) ’s Chief
Executive Officer Oscar Gonzalez Rocha said in a Sept. 13
interview.  The Andean country is relying on $50 billion in investments
by companies including Southern,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , and
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  to halt a decline in minerals output as aging mines
deplete. First-half copper output in Peru fell 3 percent to
589,684 metric tons and gold declined 7 percent to 79,738
kilograms, according to the Energy & Mines Ministry.  The expansion of copper and zinc mines will boost
production next year, Mining Minister Carlos Herrera said Sept.
9.  Copper futures for December delivery fell 27.55 cents, or
7.3 percent, to $3.4885 a pound on the Comex in New York. Gold
futures for December delivery dropped $66.40, or 3.7 percent, to
$1,741.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
