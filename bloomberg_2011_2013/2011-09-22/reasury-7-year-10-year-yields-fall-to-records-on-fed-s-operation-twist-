Treasury seven-, and 10-year bonds
surged, pushing the yields to a record low, after the  Federal
Reserve  said it will purchase longer-term debt and sell shorter
maturities to sustain the economic recovery.  The yield on the 2.125 percent note maturing in August 2021
touched 1.8491 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The rate on the 1.5 percent security maturing August
2018 fell to as low as 1.2992 percent, the data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
