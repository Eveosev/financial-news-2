Fulcrum BioEnergy Inc. , a closely
held company that produces ethanol from garbage, is seeking to
raise $115 million through an initial public offering.  The number of shares to be offered and the price range
haven’t been determined yet, the Pleasanton, California-based
company said today in a statement. The shares would be listed
under the symbol FLCM, though an exchange hasn’t yet been
selected, according to Fulcrum’s filing.  The company plans to use proceeds to fund construction of
its first commercial plant, a 10 million-gallon-a-year facility
near Reno,  Nevada . The $180 million plant is expected to begin
production in the second half of 2013.  Waste Management Inc. (WM)  and
 Waste Connections Inc. (WCN)  will supply the municipal solid waste
feedstock, and Tenaska Biofuels LLC will purchase all of the
fuel, according to the filing.  Fulcrum uses a  plasma gasification  technology  licensed  from
 InEnTec LLC  of Bend,  Oregon , to convert trash into synthesis
gas, which is composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The
company converts those gases into ethanol using a catalyst
licensed from Nipawin Biomass Ethanol New Generation Co-
operative Ltd. and the  Saskatchewan Research Council .  Fulcrum hasn’t yet generated any revenue and had a deficit
of $63.8 million as of June 30, 2011, according to the filing.
US Renewables Group LLC owns 72.7 percent of Fulcrum’s shares,
and Rustic Canyon Partners owns 23.4 percent, according to the
filing.  UBS Securities LLC is the underwriter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
