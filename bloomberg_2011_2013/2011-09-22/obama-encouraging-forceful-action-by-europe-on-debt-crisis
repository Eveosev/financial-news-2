President  Barack Obama  has
encouraged European leaders to take “forceful and decisive”
action to stem the sovereign-debt crisis that is threatening
global growth, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner both have
talked with their counterparts in Europe and expressed
confidence that European governments “have the capacity and
wherewithal” to deal with the issue, Carney told reporters
traveling with Obama on Air Force One to Ohio.  The global economy was among the topics when Obama met in
New York yesterday with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama spoke by telephone
earlier this week with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  The president has “encouraged them to take forceful and
decisive action to do just that,” Carney said.  Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
nations gather in  Washington  for the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where the European
crisis will be a focus.  The administration is “monitoring” financial markets as
stocks tumble, Carney said.  Amid concern central banks are running out of tools to
prevent another recession the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost
as much as 4.1 percent to 1,118.55 as of 2:04 p.m. in New York.
The MSCI All-Country World Index sank 4.9 percent, extending
losses from its May peak to 23 percent, and emerging-market
stocks plunged the most in almost three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
