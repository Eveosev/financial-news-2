Kenya ’s trade deficit widened in
July as imports of food, fuel and industry products rose at a
faster pace than exports, the country’s statistics agency said.  The gap climbed 27 percent to 58.2 billion shillings ($597
million) from a year earlier, the Nairobi-based  Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics  said in statement on its website today.  Kenya’s shilling fell 11 percent in the year through July,
driving up the cost of imports and adding to price pressures in
 East Africa ’s biggest economy. Inflation accelerated for the
10th consecutive month in August to 16.7 percent as food and
fuel costs rose.  Imports surged to 102.9 billion shillings in July from 80.6
billion shillings a year earlier. Exports advanced to 44.7
billion shillings, compared with 34.9 billion shillings.  Uganda was the biggest buyer of Kenyan products, followed
by Tanzania and the U.K. Most of the country’s imports
originated from the  United Arab Emirates ,  China  and  India , the
statistics office said, citing Kenya Revenue Authority data.  Kenya exported 33,629 metric tons of tea in July, down from
40,687 tons a year earlier. It is the world’s largest grower of
the black variety of the leaves. Sales of coffee dropped to
2,857 tons from 4,872 tons, while horticulture exports jumped 30
percent to 15,412 tons, the agency said.  Sugar output in the country rose to 35,884 tons in July
compared with 33,495 tons a year ago, the agency said.  The shilling weakened to 97.75 against the dollar today,
its lowest level since March 1994, when currency controls were
abolished. It was trading at 97.45 by 12:12 p.m. in Nairobi
compared with a close of 96.65 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
