The  Dallas Stars , the bankrupt
National Hockey League team, won court permission to sell itself
at an auction in which hotelier Tom Gaglardi may compete with
lawyer  Chuck Greenberg , a former co-owner of the Texas Rangers.  Greenberg plans to bid for the team when the auction is
held Nov. 21 in Dallas, his attorney, Thomas Lauria of White &
Case LLP, said during a court hearing today in Wilmington,
Delaware.  “We have a level playing field,” Stars bankruptcy
attorney  Martin Sosland  said in court. Bids for the auction are
due 30 days from today, under rules approved by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Peter Walsh.  The Stars filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15 with a plan pre-
approved by its lenders to sell the team at an auction with a
so-called stalking horse bid from Gaglardi, a Vancouver-based
businessman, who, with his family, owns Sandman Hotels, Inns &
Suites; Denny’s Restaurants; and the Kamloops Blazers Hockey
Team.  The case is  Dallas  Stars LP, 11-12935, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
