Chinese property developer Dalian
Rightway Real Estate’s situation highlights the increasing
financial strain on real-estate companies and may result in
falling property prices by the fourth quarter, according to
Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  A slump in property prices may spur the government to
loosen its tighter monetary policies, along with slowing
inflation and export growth below 10 percent, Shen Jianguang and
Michael Luk, Mizuho’s economists, wrote in a report today.
Dalian Rightway Real Estate is in restructuring talks with
lenders, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper
reported Sept. 9, citing three unidentified people involved in
the situation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
