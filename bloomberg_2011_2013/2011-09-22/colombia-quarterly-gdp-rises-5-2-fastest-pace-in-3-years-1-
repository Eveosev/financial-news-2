Colombia ’s economy expanded at the
second-fastest pace in three years in the second quarter, led by
mining, commerce, and transportation.  Gross domestic product rose 5.2 percent in quarter from a
year earlier and 2.1 percent from the January-through-March
period, the statistics agency said today. Growth matched the
median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
agency revised year-on-year GDP for the fourth quarter of 2010
to 5.4 percent from 4.8 percent and to 4.7 percent from 5.1
percent for the first quarter of 2011.  The central bank last month kept its 2011 GDP forecast at
4.5 percent to 6.5 percent as declining unemployment helped fuel
domestic demand and household consumption. Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry on Aug. 30 said GDP may rise 5 percent in the
second quarter and 6 percent to 7 percent in the third quarter.
President Juan Manuel Santos today said the economy will grow
5.5 percent in 2011, which would be the biggest annual jump
since the 6.9 percent gain in 2007.  “Compared to the rest of the region, it’s a very good
number,” said Camilo Contreras, analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA.
Contreras said the growth rate may lead the central bank to
consider raising  interest rates  again as soon as next month.  The economy’s year-on-year growth in the second quarter was
the second fastest pace since the April-through-June period of
2008, when GDP rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier.  Inflows, Tame Inflation  Foreign mining and energy investment have fueled the
economy’s expansion this year, according to the government,
pressuring the bank to keep inflation expectations anchored
around its target.  Increased inflows into the economy helped boost the
currency 7.3 percent in the first eight months of the year, the
best performance against the dollar among the seven major Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso fell 1.9 percent to 1,910.00 per dollar at 2:37
p.m. New York time, boosting its decline this month to 6.9
percent, the fourth-worst performance regionally.  The  central bank  unexpectedly paused last month after six
straight increases this year, voting unanimously to keep the
benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent on concern that global
market turmoil may slow the Colombian economy.  Policy makers seek to anchor inflation  expectations  within
their 2 percent to 4 percent target range as bank lending
continues to accelerate. The bank last raised the rate to 4.25
on June 17.  The central bank’s next two meeting are scheduled for Sept.
30 and Oct. 28.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.27 percent in August, from
3.42 percent the previous month, as monthly prices fell 0.03
percent. The country’s urban unemployment rate fell to 11.3
percent in July.  Mining, Construction  Economists covering the Colombian economy lowered their
2011 inflation forecast to 3.21 percent from 3.3 percent,
according to a central bank survey of analysts published this
month. Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe last month said that
inflation will be close to 3 percent at year-end.  From a year ago, growth was led by a 10.3 percent rise in
mining, a 7.2 percent climb in commerce and 7.1 percent increase
in transportation. From the previous quarter, growth was led by
construction and mining, which expanded 4.7 percent and 3.6
percent respectively, the statistics agency said.  Still, some indicators suggest that  South America ’s fourth-
biggest economy may be cooling. Retail sales rose 11.8 percent
in July from a year earlier -- the 15th straight month that
year-on-year sales rose 10 percent or more -- while industrial
output rose 3.9 percent.  Colombia’s foreign debt is rated as investment grade by
 Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings,
as economic growth accelerates and after Congress passed laws
that seek to cut the nation’s budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
