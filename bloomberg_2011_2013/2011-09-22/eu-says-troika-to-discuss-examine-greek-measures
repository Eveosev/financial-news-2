Greece ’s latest deficit-reduction
steps will be examined “in detail” by the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund , the EU said.  “We have to look in detail at the measures,” European
Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told reporters in Brussels
today.  Bailly said the troika -- representing the commission,
 European Central Bank  and IMF -- aims to return to  Athens  early
next week.  “I can confirm it is our objective,” he said. “We’ll see
whether or not it’s reasonable.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
