Sonae (SON)  SGPS SA, a Portuguese
retailer, said it plans to start operations in Angola in 2013 if
that country’s investment agency, known as Anip, approves the
project within a “reasonable” timeframe.  “If ANIP approves the project within a reasonable
timeframe, we will be ready to operate our first hypermarket and
logistics center in 2013,” Sonae board member Luis Reis told
reporters today at a conference organized by  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  in
Cascais, Portugal.  During the first stage of the project, Sonae plans to
operate three to five hypermarkets in Angola, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
