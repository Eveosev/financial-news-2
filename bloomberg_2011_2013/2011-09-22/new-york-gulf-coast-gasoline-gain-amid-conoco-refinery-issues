New York  and Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened after ConocoPhillips reduced rates at its
Pennsylvania refinery after a crude oil leak and is conducting
maintenance at its Lake Charles plant in Louisiana.  The Lake Charles refinery is undergoing planned work,  Rich
Johnson , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. He declined to
identify the units involved. Conocoâ€™s Trainer, Pennsylvania,
plant shut a unit as a precaution after the leak, he said in a
separate message.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 0.87 cent to 3.25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:39 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
7.69 cents to $2.6134 a gallon.  The Trainer refinery can process 190,000 barrels a day of
crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount for the same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed
0.88 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
