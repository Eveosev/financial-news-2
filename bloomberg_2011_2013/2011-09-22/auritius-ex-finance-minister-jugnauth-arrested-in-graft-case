Former Mauritius Finance Minister
Pravind Jugnauth, the son of President Anerood Jugnauth, was
arrested by the country’s anti-graft agency under provisional
charges of a conflict of interest in a government tender.  Jugnauth approved a state contract for MedPoint Ltd., in
which a family member had a stake, according to the charge sheet
filed today in a court in  Port Louis , the capital.  “I have nothing to do with MedPoint clinic,” he said in a
speech in the city today. “I disclosed my interests when the
matter was discussed at Cabinet level and withdrew from the
meeting.”  Jugnauth, who is also a former vice prime minister in the
Indian Ocean island’s government, and four other ministers from
his Mouvement Socialiste Militant party resigned from Cabinet in
July after Santi Bai Hanoomanjee, the former health minister and
a party member, was charged with graft in relation to the same
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
