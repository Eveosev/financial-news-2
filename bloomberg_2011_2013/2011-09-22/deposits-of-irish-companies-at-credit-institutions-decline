Deposits by Irish private sector
companies at credit institutions in Ireland fell an annual 17
percent to 81.1 billion euro at the end of the June, the Irish
central bank said in a report today.  The net outflow of deposits from Irish private sector
enterprises was 2.4 billion in the second quarter, following a
drop of 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter.   Credit to all non-financial non-property related companies
dropped 2 percent in the second quarter from the previous three
months and dropped 7.5 percent from the year-ago year, the
Dublin-based central bank said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
