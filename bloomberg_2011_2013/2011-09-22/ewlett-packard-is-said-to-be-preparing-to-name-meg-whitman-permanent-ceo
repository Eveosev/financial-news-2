Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  is preparing to
name former EBay Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  as its
next CEO today, ousting Leo Apotheker after less than 11 months,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Hewlett-Packardâ€™s board, which is meeting today, is
expected to name Whitman as permanent CEO, countering earlier
reports that she was being considered as an interim leader, said
one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks
are private. The AllThingsD blog previously reported on the
change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
