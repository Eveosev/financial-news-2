The  European Central Bank  bought
Spanish government bonds today, according to two people with
knowledge of the transactions, who asked not to be identified
because the deals are confidential.  The Frankfurt-based central bank also bought Italian debt,
according to four people with knowledge of the trades.   A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
