Apple Inc (AAPL) , the world’s biggest
technology company by value, will dominate Christmas sales of
tablet computers as rival products based on Google Inc.’s
Android system are not competitive enough, researcher Gartner
Inc. said.  “Apple delivers a superior and unified user experience
across its hardware, software and services,”  Carolina Milanesi ,
research vice president at Gartner, said in an e-mailed note
today. “Unless competitors can respond with a similar approach,
challenges to Apple’s position will be minimal.”  Worldwide media tablet sales will probably more than triple
this year and reach 63.6 million units and Cupertino,
California-based Apple is likely to keep a market share of more
than 50 percent until 2014, Gartner said. Apple’s iPad may
account for 73 percent of sales in 2011, after 83 percent in
2010. Apart from Apple and Android, no platform will have more
than 5 percent of the market in 2011, according to Gartner.  “So far, Android’s appeal in the tablet market has been
constrained by high prices, weak user interface and limited
tablet applications,” Milanesi said.  Android tablets are predicted to account for 17 percent of
the market this year, up from 14 percent in 2010. Gartner said
it lowered its Android forecast by 28 percent from last
quarter’s projection.  Apple dropped 0.3 percent to $412.14 yesterday in New York
trading. The stock is up 28 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
