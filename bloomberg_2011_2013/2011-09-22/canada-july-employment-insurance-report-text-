The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for July released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits decreased by 24,800 (-4.4%) in
July to 535,700, the largest of 10 consecutive monthly
declines.  There were notable percentage decreases in all
provinces except New Brunswick, where it was little
changed, and Newfoundland and Labrador, where the number
of beneficiaries was up slightly.  Downward trend in the number of Employment Insurance
beneficiaries continues in July  More claims in July  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  While there were fewer people receiving benefits in
July, the number of initial and renewal claims rose by
8,800 (+3.8%) to 243,300, the third increase in four
months.  Number of claims up in July  There were more claims in several provinces in July,
with the highest percentage increase in Ontario (+19.0%).
This increase follows a period of little change in the
number of claims in Ontario since January. In Newfoundland
and Labrador, the number of claims fell for the second
consecutive month, down 10.0% in July.  Fewer beneficiaries in most provinces  There were fewer people receiving regular EI benefits
in July, with the largest percentage decrease occurring in
Manitoba, down 9.1% to 11,700.  The number of beneficiaries also fell in  Quebec  (-
5.8%), Ontario (-5.7%), Alberta (-5.4%), Saskatchewan (-
5.3%), Nova Scotia (-5.2%) and British Columbia (-4.2%).
The declines in July extend the downward trends in these
provinces that began in the fall of 2010.  Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.2%), which was the lone
province where there were more beneficiaries in July,
posted a second consecutive increase.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  EI data by sub-provincial region, sex and age are not
seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-
over-year basis.  Most large centres show year-over-year declines  Between July 2010 and July 2011, the number of people
receiving regular benefits at the national level fell by
147,000 (-22.3%). Declines occurred in nearly all 143
large centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, there were fewer
beneficiaries in four of the five large centres. The
largest percentage decline occurred in St. John's (-
16.3%), extending the trend of monthly year-over-year
decreases that began in April 2010. There were also
notable percentage declines in the 12 months to July in
Grand Falls-Windsor and Corner Brook.  All large centres in Nova Scotia had fewer
beneficiaries in July compared with July 2010. The most
notable percentage decline was in Halifax, where the
number fell by 17.9% to 5,200 people.  In  New Brunswick , five of the six large centres had
fewer beneficiaries in the 12 months to July, with the
fastest pace of decline in Moncton (-11.5%) and Saint John
(-8.6%).  The number of regular beneficiaries fell in 31 of the
33 large centres in Quebec. The fastest pace of decline
occurred in the census metropolitan area of QuÚbec, where
the number of beneficiaries was down 30.0% to 8,100. In
MontrÚal, there were 25.2% fewer beneficiaries, continuing
the trend of year-over-year monthly declines that began in
March 2010. There were also notable declines in
Sherbrooke, Saint-Hyacinthe, Magog, Granby, Saint-Jean-sur-
Richelieu and Victoriaville.  All large centres in Ontario had year-over-year
declines in the number of beneficiaries, with the largest
percentage decrease occurring in Greater Sudbury. In
Toronto, the number fell by 26.9% to 64,100, extending the
trend of year-over-year declines that began in March 2010.
Other large centres with marked percentage decreases in
July include Thunder Bay, Tillsonburg, Guelph, Port Hope,
Chatham-Kent and North Bay.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular
benefits fell in all four large centres in the 12 months
to July. In Winnipeg, the number of beneficiaries declined
by 32.5% to 6,000, the largest of 11 consecutive
decreases.  In Saskatchewan, there were year-over-year declines in
all eight large centres. The fastest pace of decline
occurred in Regina, where the number of beneficiaries was
down 41.7% to 1,100, prolonging the trend of monthly year-
over-year decreases which started in July 2010. In
Saskatoon, the number of beneficiaries fell by 35.0% to
2,000, the largest of eight consecutive declines.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with July 2010. In Calgary, the
number fell 36.4% to 9,700. At the same time, it fell in
 Edmonton  by 35.5% to 9,900. Other large centres with
notable year-over-year declines include Red Deer, Cold
Lake,  Grande Prairie  and Medicine Hat.  The number of beneficiaries fell in all 25 large
centres of British Columbia. The number fell by 32.8% in
 Vancouver  and by 23.1% in Victoria. Prince Rupert,
Campbell River, Kamloops, Powell River and Terrace were
also among those large centres with marked percentage
declines.  Demographic groups  In July, the number of men receiving regular benefits
fell 22.5% from 12 months earlier to 272,100. There were
declines of 24.6% for men aged 25 to 54 and 23.6% for
those under 25 years of age. The number of male
beneficiaries aged 55 and over also fell in the 12 months
to July, down 15.2%.  During this year-long period, the percentage decline
for women was similar to that for men. The number of women
receiving benefits fell by 22.1% to 239,500. It decreased
by 23.4% for women aged 25 to 54 and by 22.6% for those
under 25. The decline for women 55 and over was 17.0%, the
largest of five consecutive decreases for this group.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and characteristics of those affected by
changes in the labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service Canada and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for June and July are preliminary. In this release, large
centres correspond to those with a population of 10,000 or
more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from July 10 to 16. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
