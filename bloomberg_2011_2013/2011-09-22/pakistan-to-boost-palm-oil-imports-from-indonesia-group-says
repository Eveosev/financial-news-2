Pakistan , the world’s third-largest
buyer of palm oil, may boost purchases from  Indonesia  next year
after it agreed to slash a tax on imports under a free-trade
treaty, reducing dependence on  Malaysia .  Purchases from Indonesia, the biggest producer, may
increase to as much as 30 percent of Pakistan’s annual imports
of about 1.9 million metric tons from an estimated 5 percent
this year, Abdul Rasheed Janmohammad, vice chairman of the
 Pakistan Edible Oil Refiners Association , said in an interview.  The free-trade agreement with Indonesia, effective from
Jan. 1, will help Pakistan lower its reliance on Malaysia for
supplying its cooking oil needs. Under the treaty, the South
Asian nation will reduce by 15 percent the duty it levies on
 palm oil , Commerce Secretary Zafar Mahmood said on Sept. 17.  “Pakistan’s industry will benefit because of the different
options,” Janmohammad said on Sept. 20. “We will have two
regions to deal with and competition will become tough.”  Pakistan meets about 80 percent of its needs through
imports mainly from Malaysia, with which it signed a similar
agreement three years earlier, Janmohammad said.  Importers from Pakistan may continue to make bulk of their
purchases from Malaysia as it has better port facilities,
Janmohammad said. Crude palm oil imports this year may increase
as much as 30 percent from 492,000 tons last year, he said.
Purchases totaled 442,000 tons in the eight months through Aug.
31, he said.  “We will be importing more of crude this year,”
Janmohammad said. “It’s a lot cheaper than refined.”  Prices Decline  Palm oil futures in Malaysia have declined 20 percent this
year on speculation global production may expand. The December-
delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange slumped
as much as 2 percent to 3,006 ringgit ($951) a ton, the most
since Aug. 9, in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Pakistan imported 1.25 million tons of edible oils in the
eight months ended Aug. 31, compared with 1.175 million tons a
year earlier, according to the refiners’ association. The
country bought 1.93 million tons of palm oil in 2010.  Rapeseed imports may total 776,000 tons in the year ending
Dec. 31, more than the 700,000 tons forecast in July,
Janmohammad said. The nation bought 1.16 million tons of the
oilseed in 2010.  Damage to cotton crop from flooding in the nation’s Sindh
province may reduce cotton-seed oil supplies by about 100,000
tons, Janmohammad said.  Flooding in Sindh in Pakistan, the fourth-biggest cotton
grower, damaged an estimated 3 million bales of fiber, Agha Jan
Akhtar, agriculture secretary for Sindh, said on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
