Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the  Hong Kong 
commercial landlord and owner of the city’s biggest airline, is
considering a spinoff and listing of Swire Properties Ltd. a
year after the real-estate unit shelved an initial offering.  Swire Pacific will distribute a 17 percent stake in its
property unit to public shareholders of the listed company and
controlling shareholder John Swire & Sons Ltd., according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.  Swire sold the Festival Walk shopping center to a unit of
 Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings Pte for HK$18.8 billion ($2.4
billion), the biggest property transaction for the Hong Kong
landlord. The proceeds give the real estate unit “sufficient
capital for its current funding requirements,” Swire said.  “Swire’s property development in  China  needs a lot of
money as well,” Wee Liat Lee, an analyst at Samsung Securities
Co., said in a phone interview yesterday. “The separate listing
may be for preparation further down the road if this property
arm needs further funding.”  Swire Properties last year scrapped a planned IPO to raise
as much as HK$20.8 billion because of “deteriorating market
conditions,” the statement said.  Stock in Swire fell 3.7 percent to close at HK$91.55 in
Hong Kong yesterday, before the announcement. It has dropped 28
percent this year, compared with the 22 percent decline in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
