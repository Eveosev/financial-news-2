The Hungarian government may
reconsider a planned debt consolidation at state public
transport companies MAV Zrt. and BKV Zrt., an Economy Ministry
official said.  The government is “reviewing” its initial plan to
consolidate the debt of the two companies this year as a result
of the global economic crisis, Deputy State Secretary Beno Peter
Banai said on the ministry’s website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
