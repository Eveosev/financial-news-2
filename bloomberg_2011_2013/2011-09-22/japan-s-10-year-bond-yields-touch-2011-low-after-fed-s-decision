Japan ’s bonds climbed after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will take steps to lower longer-term
 interest rates  as the  U.S. economy  falters.  Twenty- and 30-year yields slid to levels unseen this year
as Asian stocks extended a global rout of shares and 10-year
Treasury rates touched a record low. The extra yield investors
demand to hold 30-year Japanese debt instead of two-year notes
retreated to the least in almost a year after the Fed said it
will replace some of the short-term bonds in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries.  “The drops in Treasury yields and stocks have spurred
purchases of Japan’s bonds,” said Daisuke Uno, Tokyo-based
chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., which manages
$964 billion in customer deposits. “The Fed’s new measure won’t
be enough to stimulate the economy” in the U.S., he said.  Twenty-year yields retreated five basis points to 1.675
percent as of 3:41 p.m. in  Tokyo , the lowest since Oct. 12, at
Japan Bond Trading Co. The 1.8 percent security due September
2031 added 0.757 yen to 101.871 yen. Thirty-year yields dropped
as much as five basis points to 1.85 percent, a level unseen
since Oct. 7. The benchmark 10-year yield touched 0.965 percent,
the lowest since Nov. 9.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate declined to as low as
1.8081 percent today, a record based on Federal Reserve data.  The yield spread between 30-year debt and two-year notes
sank to 1.73 percentage points, the least since October. Ten-
year bond futures for December delivery dipped 0.07 to 142.66 at
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The U.S. central bank will buy bonds with maturities of six
to 30 years through June while selling an equal amount of debt
maturing in three years or less, the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said yesterday. The action “should put downward
pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader
financial conditions more accommodative,” the FOMC said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares tumbled 3.7 percent,
after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 2.9 percent
yesterday. Ten-year Treasury yields sank to the record low of
1.8081 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
