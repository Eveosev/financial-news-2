Vista Equity Partners, a private-
equity firm focused on enterprise software and technology
businesses, agreed to buy  Sage Group Plc (SGE) ’s U.S. healthcare
division.  The sale of Sage Software Healthcare, which offers practice
management and electronic health-record offerings, is expected
to be completed in November, the U.K. company said in a
statement. Sage will make a loss of up to 70 million pounds
($108.4 million) through the sale and redistribute cash proceeds
of $320 million to shareholders by buying back shares.  Vista Equity, based in  San Francisco , has about $5 billion
invested in technology companies including library software
maker SirsiDynix. The company aims to generate “exceptional
returns” and only makes a limited number of investments per
year, according to Vista Equity’s Website. Sage said the
disposal will help the company to focus on its other U.S.
activities.  “The sale of Sage Healthcare allows management in the
North American region to focus on the considerable opportunities
that exist within our core U.S. customer base,” Guy Berruyer,
chief executive officer of  Newcastle Upon Tyne , England-based
Sage, said in the statement.  Sage’s Healthcare unit had sales of 72 million pounds in
the six months through March 2011.  Sage dropped 2.5 percent to 258.6 pence in London trading
as of 9:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
