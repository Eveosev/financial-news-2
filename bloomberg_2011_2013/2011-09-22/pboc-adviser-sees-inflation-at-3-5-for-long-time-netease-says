China may face “mild” inflation
of 3 percent to 5 percent for a “long time,” Li Daokui, an
adviser to the People’s Bank of China, said in an interview with
internet portal  netease.com. (NTES)   The pace of the nation’s economic growth will see a
“noticeable” decline in the 2011 to 2015 period compared with
the previous 10 years, Li was quoted as saying.  It would be unrealistic to expect growth of above 9 percent
in the next three years although expansion may be above 8
percent, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
