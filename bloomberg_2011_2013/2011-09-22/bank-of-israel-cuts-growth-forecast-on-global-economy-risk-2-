The Bank of  Israel  cut its
forecasts for economic growth this year and next, citing
increased uncertainty about the global economy and a decline in
the rate of growth in world trade.  Israel’s economy will expand 4.7 percent in 2011 and 3.2
percent in 2012, the central bank said, compared with its Aug. 2
predictions of 4.8 percent and 3.9 percent. The bank said its
staff forecast is for the benchmark  interest rate  to fall to 3
percent from 3.25 percent in 12 months.  “Uncertainty regarding the recovery of the global economy
has increased considerably since the previous forecast was
made,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement. “Forecasts by
investment houses and international institutions have been
lowered, along with the assessment that the possibility of a
global recession has increased.”  Governor  Stanley Fischer  said this week that Israel’s
monetary tightening cycle is probably over and that there is
room to cut the benchmark rate if needed as growth slows and
risks in the global economy increase. Fischer left the benchmark
interest rate unchanged in his past three decisions after
increasing it 10 times in the past two years.  He is likely to leave the benchmark unchanged in his next
rate decision on Sept. 26, according to 19 of 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exports Fall  Exports excluding diamonds and startup companies are
expected to expand 1.7 percent in 2012, compared with a forecast
3.9 percent this year and 10.6 percent in 2010, the bank said.
Exports make up some 40 percent of the economy.  Inflation is likely to slow to 2.3 percent during the next
12 months, from an annual 3.4 percent for August, according to
the bank forecast. Housing will continue to create inflationary
pressures, easing significantly only near the end of 2012, it
said.  The  International Monetary Fund  this week cut its forecast
for global growth and predicted “severe” repercussions if
 Europe  fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S. policy makers
deadlock over a fiscal plan. The world economy will expand 4
percent this year and next, the IMF said, compared with June
forecasts of 4.3 percent in 2011 and of 4.5 percent in 2012.  Fischer said this week he is concerned about the possible
effects of a global slump on Israeli exports, as well as
geopolitical tensions. The IMF forecast for Israel predicts
growth will slow to 3.6 percent in 2012 from 4.8 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
