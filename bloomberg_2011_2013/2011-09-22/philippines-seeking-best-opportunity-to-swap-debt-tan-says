The Philippines is still seeking
the “best opportunity” for a debt exchange amid volatility in
financial markets, Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said.  Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in July the Southeast
Asian nation is studying the possibility of swapping dollar-
denominated bonds into global peso notes to reduce foreign-
 currency risk  and better manage debt. The government earlier
this quarter completed a record peso bond exchange, extending
maturities by an average of two years.  “We are monitoring the markets,” Tan said in an interview
in  Washington  yesterday. “Right now, we are still looking at
the best opportunity to launch it depending on market behavior
given the recent volatility particularly because of the European
events. We’re hopeful there may be a time we can launch it with
expectations of success.”  The government expects to increase spending for the rest of
2011, Tan said.  “The spending program for the rest of the year will be
heightened given now there is an agreement among economic
managers to speed up infrastructure and social expenditure,” he
said. “We expect an uptick in expenditures for the rest of the
year.”  The government plans to narrow the 2012  budget deficit  to
2.6 percent of gross domestic product, or about 286 billion
pesos ($6.5 billion), from a target of 3 percent, or about 300
billion pesos, this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
