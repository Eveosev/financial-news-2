South Africa ’s stock gauge fell the
most in 16 months, led by retail stocks as the rand plunged to a
two-year low and after a slump in commodity prices hurt mining
companies.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index slid 3.2 percent to
30,323.04 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, its largest
retreat since May 2010. The FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers
Index declined 4.1 percent, while the FTSE/JSE Africa Mining
Index fell to the lowest in a week, dropping 3.6 percent.  The rand suffered its biggest five-day plunge since 2008,
and commodities erased this year’s gains after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said the world’s biggest economy faces “downside
risks.” Retailers import about 70 percent of their apparel and
the rand’s decline will raise costs, Nedbank Capital retail
analyst Syd Vianello said. Overseas investors own 66 percent of
 Truworths International Ltd. (TRU) ’s stock and 63 percent of The
 Foschini Group Ltd. (TFG)  and the exit from riskier markets has led to
a selloff of these stocks, he said.  “When they exit they exit quickly,” Vianello said by
phone. “If the rand carries on tanking you may very well see
interest rates going up instead of down. That’s one way to
protect your currency.”  The rand retreated 4.6 percent to 8.2749 per dollar, making
it the worst performer worldwide among 176 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. Foschini dropped 5.3 percent, the biggest daily fall
since April 2009, and Truworths lost 4.1 percent.  Sales, Commodities  South African retail-sales growth accelerated to 2.8
percent in July as interest rates at a 30-year low helped to
support  consumer spending  in Africa’s biggest economy. The
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a 30-
year low of 5.5 percent today to help support economic growth as
the global recovery stalls.  Copper fell to a one-year low in  New York  and headed into a
 bear market  in  London  after a China factory index signaling
contraction added to speculation of slowing metals demand.
Prices in London have dropped 23 percent from the record $10,190
on Feb. 15, qualifying for a bear market if they close at or
below $8,152.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the mining company that makes up about
9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , declined to its lowest
in more than a week, sliding 4.4 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining group, slumped 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
