U.S. pork stockpiles rose 13
percent at the end of August from a year earlier as meatpackers
increased output, the government said.  Warehouses held 440.7 million pounds of the meat on Aug.
31, up from  388.3 million  pounds a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories
fell 3 percent from the end of July. August pork production may
have been 5 percent larger than a year earlier, said  Bob Brown ,
an independent market analyst. The USDA will release output data
for the month on Sept. 23.  “This year production’s up so far, and stocks are up,”
Brown said before the report in a telephone interview from
Edmond,  Oklahoma . “There’s a lot to that correlation.”  Meatpackers will produce about 22.6 billion pounds of pork
this year, up 0.8 percent from 2010, the USDA forecast on Sept.
12.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 1.45 cents, or 1.7
percent, to 82.65 cents a pound at 12:51 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained 5.5 percent
this year.  As of Aug. 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, more than doubled from a year earlier
to 15.1 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 4.7 percent to 148.8 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of August were 0.5
percent smaller than a year earlier at 702.2 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies rose 11 percent to 429.2 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
