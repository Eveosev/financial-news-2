Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  and  Vivendi SA (VIV)  are
leading the race to buy  Poland ’s largest television network  TVN
SA (TVN) , Puls Biznesu reported, citing unidentified people close to
the Polish company.  “A large, international” media group will be the likely
buyer of TVN, Wojciech Kostrzewa, head of ITI Group, the
majority shareholder that is selling its stake, told the Warsaw-
based newspaper. The economic situation outside Poland is the
“only threat” to the transaction, he said, Puls reported.  The deal should be completed this year, Puls said, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
