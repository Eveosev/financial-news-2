Billionaire  Sam Zell  said he
doesn’t see the “volume opportunity” to invest in distressed
real estate that he’s witnessed in past property slumps as
lenders extend troubled loans.  Real estate markets may experience “measurable turmoil”
in the next few years, Zell, chairman of Chicago-based Equity
International, said today at a conference hosted by BMO Capital
Markets Ltd.  “The pretends and extends are coming due,” he said. “In
previous periods, the opportunity hit you in the face.”  Zell said “every single distressed asset I have seen” has
been 25 percent to 40 percent overpriced. While U.S. office
occupancies have risen over the past year and will continue to
climb, Zell doesn’t expect rents to go up, he said.  The investor sold Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007
for $39 billion as the U.S. real estate market was peaking.
Commercial property prices fell as much as 49 percent from their
October 2007 high, according to the Moody’s/REAL Commercial
Property Price Index, after credit contracted and the economic
slump boosted the  unemployment rate  to more than 9 percent.  Zell said he doesn’t think the economy is in recession and
that it will “muddle through” with low growth rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
