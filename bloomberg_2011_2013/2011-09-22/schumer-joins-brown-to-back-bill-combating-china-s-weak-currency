Senators  Charles Schumer  of New
York and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, both Democrats, urged support
for legislation pushing China to raise the value of its currency
as a way to stem U.S. job losses.  China’s currency policies cost more than 2.8 million U.S.
jobs since 2001, the lawmakers said today at a Washington news
conference. The legislation would let U.S. companies seek duties
on imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak
yuan, which lawmakers said gives Chinese companies an unfair
advantage against U.S. manufacturers.  “They get away with economic murder,” Schumer told
reporters. “We are fed up; we are not going to take it
anymore.”  Schumer proposed similar measures in each of the past six
years. None has received a Senate vote.  The bill also is supported by Democratic Senators Robert Casey of  Pennsylvania  and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and
Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,  Richard Burr  of
North Carolia and Jeff Sessions of Alabama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
