JinkoSolar Holding Co., a Chinese
maker of solar panels, says no customers have canceled orders
since pollution from a plant prompted protests and production
was halted, said Chief Financial Officer Zhang Longgen.  JinkoSolar plans to resume output at the plant in Haining,
in eastern  China , “as soon as possible” after fluoride waste
may have killed fish in a nearby river, Longgen said today on a
conference call with analysts and investors. All contract
obligations will be met by using excess cell production capacity
at competitor’s plants, he said.  JinkoSolar’s American depositary receipts rose 40 cents, or
6.9 percent, to $6.16 at 10:54 a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite trading, the first gain in more than a week. They have
dropped more than 69 percent this year. Each ADR represents four
of the company’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
