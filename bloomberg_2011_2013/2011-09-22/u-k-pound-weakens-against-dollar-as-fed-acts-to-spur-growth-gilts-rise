Gilts rose, pushing the yield on
two-year notes down to a record, as the  Federal Reserve  signaled
“significant downside risks” in the  U.S. economy .  The 10-year gilt yield dropped the most in two weeks as the
Fed said yesterday that it will buy longer-dated U.S.
securities. The 30-year rate also fell to a record low. The
pound weakened to the least in more than a year versus the
dollar and reached an all-time low against the yen. The Debt
Management Office sold securities due in 2017. U.K. stocks fell,
with the  FTSE 100 index (UKX)  dropping 5 percent.  “Gilts are higher as they shadow the move in Treasuries,”
said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in London. “The market was surprised by the
Fed’s downbeat assessment of the economy. The move in the yield
curve is led by the Fed, because of the relationship between
long-dated gilt yields and Treasury yields.”  The 10-year gilt yield slid nine basis points to 2.33
percent at 4:47 p.m. in  London , after falling as much as 13
basis points, the steepest drop since Sept. 5. The 3.75 percent
security due September 2021 rose 0.805, or 8.05 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount ($1,535), to 112.58.  The two-year gilt yield was little changed at 0.53 percent,
after falling to 0.477 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
collecting data on the securities in 1992.  German Records  The 30-year gilt yield fell as much as 15 basis points to
3.502, the lowest on record according to Bloomberg data, before
settling at 3.53 percent, down 12 basis points from yesterday.  German and U.S. 10-year bond yields dropped to their lowest
on record, Bloomberg data show.  The U.S. central bank will extend the average maturities of
bonds in its portfolio by purchasing $400 billion of long-term
debt and selling an equal amount of shorter-term securities to
push down yields on longer-dated Treasuries.  The statement came after  Bank of England  officials said
they may need to buy more bonds to keep U.K. borrowing costs
capped as the recovery falters.  Most of the bank’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
said an expansion of the 200 billion-pound bond-purchase program
was “increasingly probable,” minutes of their September
meeting showed yesterday. The committee voted 8-1 to maintain
the current size of the plan and was unanimous in keeping the
benchmark  interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent.  U.K. Sale  Gilts have returned 10 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German debt has gained 8.3 percent
and U.S. Treasuries rose 9.2 percent, the indexes show.  The U.K. sold 4.75 billion pounds of 1.75 percent gilts due
January 2017 at an average yield of 1.394 percent. Investors bid
for 1.29 times the amount of securities on offer, the Debt
Management Office said today. That compares with a bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.35 at a previous auction of the same bonds on Aug.
18, which were sold at 1.507 percent.  Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  RBC Capital Markets 
see the Bank of England starting to buy 50 billion pounds of
assets by November. JPMorgan economist Malcolm Barr in London
said weak survey data could prompt a move in October.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2011 and 2012 U.K.
economic growth forecasts this week to 1.1 percent and 1.6
percent. The Washington-based IMF previously projected expansion
of 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively.  Factory Orders  Sterling declined 1 percent to $1.5351, after dropping to
$1.5328, the least since September 7, 2010. It fell as much as
1.3 percent to 116.97 yen, before settling at 117.13. The pound
slipped 0.2 percent to 87.70 pence per euro, after strengthening
as much as 0.5 percent to 87.10 pence.  A U.K. index of factory export orders declined to minus 12
this month from zero in August, the lowest level since October,
led by consumer-goods companies, the  Confederation of British
Industry  said today. A measure of total orders fell to minus 9
from 1. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 14
economists was minus 5. The U.K.’s biggest business lobby said
both measures remain above their long-term averages.  The pound has fallen 4.4 percent in the past 12 months, the
worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
