The Swiss economy is being pushed
toward deflation as the euro region’s debt crisis prompts
investors to pile into the franc, Bank Sarasin said.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the decline in Swiss and
Japanese core inflation rates, which exclude volatile costs such
as food and energy. Both economies have been hurt by a “chronic
appreciation” of their currencies, said Jan Poser, chief
economist at the Zurich-based bank.  The franc, considered a haven in times of turmoil, reached
a record 1.0075 versus the euro on Aug. 9, increasing the threat
of deflation. While the Swiss central bank on Sept. 15
reiterated its pledge to defend a currency ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro imposed earlier this month, Poser said the franc
remains overvalued.  “While the rest of the world avoids doing its homework, no
one should be surprised that  Switzerland  is being flooded with
capital,” Poser said. “We call this the ‘curse of the model
student.’ The franc appreciation has placed an excessive burden
on the economy” and pushed it to “the brink of deflation.”  The  Swiss National Bank  said last week that consumer prices
may decline 0.3 percent in 2012, revising a previously projected
price growth of 1 percent. That would be the first drop since
2009, when the economy failed to grow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
