Estonia’s government agreed to
raise alcohol taxes from January to keep the  budget deficit 
within European Union rules.  Alcohol tax rates will be raised by 5 percent to boost
revenue by about 10 million euros ($13.4 million), according to
an e-mailed statement from Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip ’s office.
The increase must be approved by parliament as part of a budget
that targets a 2.1 percent deficit in 2012 after an expected
surplus this year.  Next year’s shortfall is mainly due to spending the
proceeds from selling spare United Nations carbon permits, which
Estonia is required to do by the end of 2012, Finance Minister
Juergen Ligi told a news conference in Tallinn today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
