Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods company, reported first-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as revenue surged in  North America ,
its largest market.  Net income in the quarter ended Aug. 31 rose 15 percent to
$645 million, or $1.36 a share, from $559 million, or $1.14, a
year earlier, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts projected $1.21 a share, the average of 18
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nike’s profit has surpassed
analysts’ projections in 20 of the past 21 quarters.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker has been trying to
overcome rising costs for raw materials and transporting goods
by cutting operating expenses. Nike’s gross margin, the
percentage of sales left after the cost of goods sold, narrowed
by 2.7 percentage points, less than the company’s projection for
a 3 percentage point decline.  “This is a fantastic quarter,” said Camilo Lyon, an
analyst for Canaccord Genuity Corp. in  New York  who has a "hold"
rating on Nike shares. “Nike understands how to reach the
consumer with relevant product, and this is further evidence of
that.”  Nike rose $4.52, or 5.4 percent, to $88.70 at 5:30 p.m. in
trading after the close of the New York Stock Exchange. The
shares had dropped 1.5 percent this year through the end of
today’s regular trading.  Orders Rise  Orders for the Nike brand from September to January
increased 13 percent, excluding currency fluctuations. That
topped the average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg for a gain of 9.8 percent.  First-quarter revenue rose 18 percent to $6.08 billion.
Analysts projected $5.75 billion, the average of 16 estimates.
Sales in North America advanced 16 percent to $2.2 billion.
Revenue from Nike brand apparel also gained 16 percent to $1.59
billion, or 30 percent of the brand’s total sales.  “They are the 800-pound gorilla in athletic footwear, and
if they can become that in apparel, that’s a significant market
opportunity for them,”  Matt Arnold , an analyst at Edward Jones
& Co. in  Des Peres ,  Missouri , said in a phone interview. Arnold
recommends buying Nike shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
