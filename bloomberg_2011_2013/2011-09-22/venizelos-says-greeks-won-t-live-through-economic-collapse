Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos told lawmakers in  Athens  today that he preferred
Greeks to suffer wage and pension cuts rather than endure the
complete economic collapse of the country.  Greeks must take the decisions to meet fiscal targets,
Venizelos said, in comments televised live on state-run Vouli
TV. Referring to austerity measures announced yesterday, he said
that there was no time for delay and that what was being decided
now was the fate of the July 21 second financing package for
 Greece , not simply the sixth tranche of loans from the first
bailout.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
