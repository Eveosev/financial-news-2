Candente Copper Corp. (DNT)  “would be
happy” to develop its Canariaco copper deposit in Peru if it
doesn’t reach an agreement to sell the property, Chief Executive
Officer Joanne Freeze said.  Vancouver-based Candente has signed confidentiality
agreements with “at least” 10 prospective buyers, Freeze said
today at the Bloomberg Mila conference in  New York . A mining tax
law being debated by Peru’s Congress this week “is quite
reasonable,” Freeze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
