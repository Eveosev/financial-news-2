The U.S. Treasury Department sold
$11 billion of 9-year 10-month inflation-indexed notes at a
yield of 0.078 percent, as demand fell relative to the last
auction of securities with the same maturity.  Demand was weaker than at the last auction, judging by the
bid/cover ratio, which compares the number of bids with the
amount of securities sold. The ratio was 2.61, compared with
2.62 at the previous sale.  Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central
banks, bought 30.4 percent of the amount sold, compared with
41.6 percent in the prior auction. Primary dealers bought 33.9
percent, compared with 44.6 in the previous sale. Direct bidders
purchased 35.7 percent.  The securities are intended to provide a hedge against
rising consumer prices. At the previous auction, last July 21,
the notes drew a high yield of 0.639 percent.  Inflation-indexed notes rise or fall in value tracking
changes in the  consumer price index  calculated by the Labor
Department. Inflation adjustments will be added to the notes’
principal and be payable at maturity.  Investors value inflation indexed securities by measuring
the yield of the inflation indexed notes against the yield of
the nominal notes minus the rate of inflation, a measure known
as the real yield.  In financial market trading after today’s sale, the yield
on the standard 10-year note was 1.77 percent, while the two-
year note yielded 0.21 percent.  The Treasury said 48.46 percent of the bids were allotted
at the high yield of 0.078 percent, while the low yield
submitted was -0.1 percent and the median yield was 0.01 percent.  The coupon rate was 0.625 percent. The equivalent price was
105.582684.  Tenders totaled $28,715,040,300. Treasury accepted
$11,000,001,300 of the bids.  Auction Details  Notes sold competitively, mainly to investment firms for
sale to investors in the secondary market, totaled
$10,959,236,000. Notes sold on a non-competitive basis, mainly
to individual investors, totaled $40,765,300.  The notes will be issued, or settle, Sept. 30, and mature
July 15, 2021. The CUSIP, or identification number will be
912828QV5.  Inflation-indexed notes are eligible for the Treasury’s
Strips program. Strips stands for Separate Trading of Registered
Interest and Principal of Securities. Coupons are separated from
a note or bond and become a security. The remaining face value
bond becomes another security that is known as a zero-coupon
bond.  The strips minimum is $100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
