Malaysia’s ringgit fell to the
weakest level in almost 10 months after the  Federal Reserve  said
there are “significant downside risks” to the  U.S. economy ,
damping demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency extended this month’s slide on concern the
rising risk of a recession in the U.S. will hurt Malaysian
exports. A government report yesterday showed inflation slowed
to 3.3 percent in August from 3.4 percent in July, lessening the
need for interest-rate increases. Government bonds dropped.  “The market expected more stimulus from the Fed and was
disappointed,” said Wong Kah Guan, a currency forwards trader
at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “People are
unwinding risk positions and buying back the U.S. dollar.”  The ringgit dropped 0.4 percent to 3.1540 per dollar as of
4:29 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has slumped 5.8 percent so far this
month and touched 3.1673 today, the weakest level since Dec. 1.  Bank Negara Malaysia kept its overnight rate at 3 percent
at reviews on July 7 and Sept. 8. Policy makers hold their final
scheduled meeting of this year on Nov. 11. The  International
Monetary Fund  cut its growth estimates for the global economy on
Sept. 20 and predicted “severe” repercussions if  Europe  fails
to contain a debt crisis.  Malaysia’s three-year bonds fell for a second day. The
yield on the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014 rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.20 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia. The rate touched 3.40 percent on Sept. 19, the
highest level since April.  Weak economic data and reduced risk appetite led to a sell-
off in emerging-market assets after the Fed statement,  Barclays
Capital  said in a research note today. Rates on higher-yielding
bonds in Asia are expected to climb, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
