Hong Kong stocks dropped, with the
benchmark Hang Seng Index poised for its worst monthly loss in
almost three years, as the U.S.  Federal Reserve  and Europe’s
risk watchdog warned of growing threats to global financial
markets and a gauge of  China ’s manufacturing slowed.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s No. 1 lender by market value,
slid 3.6 percent after the  International Monetary Fund  said
banks in Europe face “funding challenges.”  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the
biggest supplier of clothes and toys to retailers including Wal-
Mart Stores Inc., sank 6.1 percent after the Fed said downside
risks to the  U.S. economy  are “significant.” Jiangxi Copper
Co., China’s largest producer of the metal, slumped 12 percent
after copper futures dropped.  The Hang Seng Index slumped 4.9 percent to 17,911.95 at the
close, its lowest close since July 2009. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong
tumbled 6.3 percent to 9,202.70, its biggest drop since March
2009, as a report showed China’s manufacturing may contract for
a third month in September as measures of export orders and
output fall.  “Under the surface, we are moving quickly into a secondary
credit crisis,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more than $300
million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “All underlying
measures of credit risk are rising and there are numerous
examples of banks having to resort to unusual measures to obtain
funding. The Fed delivered no surprises, leaving markets facing
sovereign-debt issues in Europe to which there is still no clear
solution.”  No Stocks Rise  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  is poised for a 13 percent
decline this month, the biggest drop since October 2008, amid
concern global economic growth will falter as Europe’s debt
crisis worsens and the U.S. economic recovery stalls. None of
the 46 member-companies in the benchmark Hang Seng Index rose.  A preliminary reading of 49.4 for a manufacturing index in
China released by HSBC and Markit Economics today compares with
the final reading of 49.9 for August and 49.3 for July. A
reading below 50 indicates a contraction.  Banks dropped after the Federal Reserve said there are
growing “strains in global financial markets” and the European
Systemic Risk Board said threats to the financial system have
increased “considerably” amid a worsening debt crisis in
Europe. The IMF said the sovereign-debt issue has generated as
much as 300 billion euros ($410 billion) in credit risk for
European banks.  HSBC Holdings sank 3.6 percent to HK$60.65.  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s third-biggest lender by market value,
slumped 4.2 percent to HK$157.80.  ‘Less Than Hoped’  Exporters fell as the Federal Reserve’s plan to replace
$400 billion of short-term debt with longer-term Treasuries in
an effort to further reduce borrowing costs was seen largely to
have little effect in reviving the world’s biggest economy. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index had the biggest drop in a month on
the Fed’s plan, dubbed “Operation Twist” after a similar Fed
action in 1961.  Li & Fung plunged 6.1 percent to HK$12.98.  Yue Yuen
Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which makes shoes for Nike Inc.,
dropped 4.6 percent to HK$19.18.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) ,
maker of Ryobi power tools and Hoover vacuum cleaners that
counts  North America  as its largest market, slipped 6.9 percent
to HK$6.04.  “Even though Operation Twist delivered more than expected,
the end result on the economic recovery could be less than
hoped,” said Belinda Allen, a senior investment analyst at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management in Sydney, which
oversees about $150 billion.  Bear Market  Raw-material producers declined after a gauge of metal
prices in  London  and crude oil futures in  New York  extended
declines amid speculation demand for the commodities will fall
as U.S. economic growth falters. Copper tumbled into a so-called
bear market, declining more than 20 percent from its record set
on Feb. 15.  Jiangxi Copper Co. slumped 12 percent to HK$14.08. Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer of the metal,
sank 9.4 percent to HK$3.75.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s No. 1 offshore
oil producer, declined 7.7 percent to HK$11.96.  The Hang Seng Index tumbled 25 percent from its November
high through yesterday on concern the global recovery will
falter amid Europe’s debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy.
Shares on the index traded at 10.1 times estimated earnings,
compared with 12.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Chinese Developers  Chinese developers listed in Hong Kong plummeted on
speculation China may be limiting funding for real-estate
companies. A Reuters report that the China Banking Regulatory
Commission ordered trust companies to inform the regulator of
their dealings with  Greentown China Holdings Ltd. (3900)  may be a sign
that China is trying to restrict financing sources for
developers, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Jinsong Du wrote in a
report today.  Greentown China tumbled 16 percent to HK$4.49.  Agile
Property Holdings Ltd. (3383) , the builder of villas and apartments in
China’s southern city of Guangzhou, plunged 15 percent to
HK$5.91.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled
developer, slumped 7 percent to HK$8.49.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 4.8 percent to 17,826.
The HSI Volatility Index jumped 19 percent to 41.58, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 12 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
