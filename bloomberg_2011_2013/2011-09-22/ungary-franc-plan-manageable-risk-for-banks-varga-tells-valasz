A Hungarian regulation allowing
foreign-currency mortgage holders the early repayment of their
loans at below-market rates poses “manageable” risks for
banks,  Heti Valasz  reported, citing Mihaly Varga, the prime
minister’s  chief of staff.  The plan “poses certain risks for banks but the burden is
bearable,” Varga said in an interview published today. “It
wouldn’t be a such a big tragedy if two or three banks left the
country,” he said.  The 2.5 percent budget deficit target for 2012 is “set in
stone,” Varga said.  State pension and health spending will only be financed
from fees and taxes paid for these purposes in 2012 and no extra
funds will be allocated from the central budget, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
