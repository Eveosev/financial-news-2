China ’s Ministry of Railways, the
nation’s biggest issuer of corporate debt, plans to sell 20
billion yuan ($3.1 billion) of bonds, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The notes will be split into seven-year and 10-year
tranches, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
details are private. Guotai Junan Securities Co. is the main
underwriter for the sale and the timing is yet to be determined,
the person said.  The ministry last sold bonds on Sept. 7, when it issued 5
billion yuan of five-year notes priced to yield 5.93 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ten-year borrowing
costs for the rail operator have surged 51 basis points to 6.1
percent since a high-speed train crash left 40 people dead on
July 23, as investors question the viability of the nation’s
bullet-train network.  China slashed spending on railway construction 50 percent
last month as it slowed building work following the crash near
the eastern city of Wenzhou. The ministry has removed three top
regional railway officials from their posts and suspended
approvals on new projects nationwide, while 54 high-speed trains
were recalled.  The operator was unable to find buyers for all its one-year
notes in a 20 billion-yuan sale on July 21. The extra yield
investors demand to the ministry’s one-year debt instead of
similar-maturity  government bonds  has widened 45 basis points
since the crash to a record 197 basis points, according to
Chinabond data on Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
