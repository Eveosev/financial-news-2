Overseas investors bought a net
3.34 billion rupees ($68 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
taking their total investment in stocks this year to 28 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 20.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
17.3 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold a net 71 million rupees of bonds, paring
their flows into debt this year to 201.1 billion rupees.  The BSE India Sensitive Index has dropped 20 percent this
year, the worst performer in  Asia  after  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng
Index (HSI) , amid concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt
crisis may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.  Overseas funds withdrew a net $2.4 billion from Indian
stocks in August, the most since October 2008, according to data
from the nation’s regulator. That caused the Sensex to decline
8.4 percent last month, making the gauge’s worst August in at
least a decade, according to Bloomberg data.  India ’s $1.3 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the wworld’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign funds have placed 4.5 trillion rupees in stocks and
987.7 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
