The  Federal Reserve  may introduce a
third round of quantitative easing early next year as U.S.
inflation cools,  Alain Bokobza , head of asset-allocation
strategy at  Societe Generale , said at a press conference in
Beijing today.  Global equity markets will remain weak for “days to come”
as investors are disappointed with a lack of full-scale QE3, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
