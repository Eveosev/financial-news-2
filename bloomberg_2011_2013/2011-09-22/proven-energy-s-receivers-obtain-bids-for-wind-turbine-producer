Proven Energy Ltd.’s receivers have
offers to buy the Scottish wind-turbine maker after a defect in
the company’s main model forced it to halt trading this month.  Interest in Proven Energy is “encouraging,” Blair Nimmo,
 KPMG  LLP’s restructuring chief in  Scotland , said in a statement,
after the discovery of the faults in three Proven 35-2 turbines
led to the company’s sales being suspended. The indicative bids
are for certain assets or most of the business, KPMG said.  The close of unconditional bidding is at 5 p.m., Sept. 27,
KPMG said. Ayrshire-based Proven makes turbines for homes and
farms, and has more than 3,000 products installed worldwide.
Fifty-five workers were sacked and 20 retained to help prepare
the business for a sale, KPMG said in an earlier statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
