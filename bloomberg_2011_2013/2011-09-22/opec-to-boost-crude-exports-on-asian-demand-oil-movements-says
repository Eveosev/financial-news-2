The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will keep shipment levels unchanged through
to the middle of next month because of limited demand from
refiners in  Asia , according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will export about 22.69 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Oct. 15, the same amount that it shipped in the
month to Sept. 17, the Halifax, England-based company said today
in a report. Shipments often rise at this time of year as
refiners prepare to boost production of winter fuels. The
figures exclude Ecuador and Angola.  “There’s no pressure on OPEC to produce more,” Roy Mason,
Oil Movements’ founder, said by telephone. “Movements from the
Gulf are above year-ago but not excitingly so. The east doesn’t
look very hungry. Chinese demand in the summer was pretty
subdued.”  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will also be unchanged to Oct. 15 from
the previous period at 17.39 million barrels a day, according to
Oil Movements estimates.  Crude on board tankers will average 470.09 million barrels
in the four-week period, up 0.6 percent from 467.24 million
barrels in the period to Sept. 17, the researcher said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya ,  Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization will meet next on Dec.
14 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
