The Spanish energy regulator
postponed a decision on whether  Petroleos Mexicanos  must request
permission for its increased stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  under rules
governing investment from outside the European Union, according
to a spokeswoman who asked not to be named.   Mexico’s state-owned oil company, known as Pemex, increased
its holding in Repsol this month after agreeing to an alliance
with  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , Repsol’s biggest shareholder with 20
percent.  Under Spanish law, non-European Union companies investing
in national energy companies need permission to acquire a stake
of more than 20 percent or one that is judged to be
“significant.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
