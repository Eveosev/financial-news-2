Bioethicist Art Caplan said his
challenge to Republican presidential candidate  Michele Bachmann 
for evidence that a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer caused
mental retardation ended without Bachmann acknowledging it.  Caplan, director of the center for bioethics at the
 University of Pennsylvania , offered to pay $10,000 to a charity
of Bachmann’s choice if she could find such a patient by noon
today. Bachman claimed in television interviews on Sept. 13 that
a woman told her that the shot, usually given at age 12,
triggered mental retardation in the woman’s daughter.  The day before her claim, Bachmann chastised Texas Governor
Rick Perry during a Republican debate for requiring girls in his
state to get Merck & Co.’s Gardasil vaccine to ward off a
sexually-transmitted disease that can cause cancer. Caplan said
the statements by Bachmann, a U.S. representative from
 Minnesota , may cost lives by frightening parents away from
vaccinating their daughters.  “I never heard back from her or her staff but I know she
knew about it since she was asked about it by reporters,”
Caplan said in a conference call today. He encouraged people to
donate to the  Vaccine Education Center  at the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia. He said he plans to donate to the
center, without saying how much he would contribute.  Caplan announced the wager on the social media site Twitter
on Sept. 14.  Neither Bachmann nor Alice Stewart, her spokeswoman, have
returned telephone calls or e-mails from Bloomberg seeking
comment on Caplan’s remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
