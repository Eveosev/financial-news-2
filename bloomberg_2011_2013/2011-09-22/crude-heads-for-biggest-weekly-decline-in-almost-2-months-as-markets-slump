Oil in  New York  headed for the
biggest weekly decline in almost two months as investors
speculated that fuel demand will falter amid a plunge in
financial markets and signs of a weakening global economy.  Futures were little changed after sliding 6.3 percent
yesterday to a six-week low. Equities fell, pushing the MSCI
All-Country World Index of 45 nations into a  bear market  for the
first time in more than two years, after a worsening European
debt crisis and threat of a U.S. recession. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its forecast for oil in New York.  Crude oil for November delivery was at $80.55 a barrel, up
2 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 9:15 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday slid
$5.39 to $80.53, the lowest settlement since Aug 9. Prices are
8.3 percent lower this week and down 12 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement fell $4.87, or 4.4
percent, to $105.49 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 9. The European
benchmark contract closed at premium of $24.98 to U.S. futures,
compared with a record $26.87 on Sept. 6.  Goldman Sachs lowered its three-month forecast for oil in
New York by 15 percent to $97.50 a barrel. The bankâ€™s previous
target was $115 a barrel, analysts led by Samantha Dart in
 London  said in a report yesterday.  U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the weakest
point since the recession ended in June 2009, according to the
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index yesterday. Euro-area services
and manufacturing output contracted for the first time in more
than two years in September and Chinese manufacturing may shrink
for a third month, other reports showed.  Oil options volatility surged to the highest level in six
weeks. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 51.4 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
the highest level for the contract nearest to expiration since
Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
