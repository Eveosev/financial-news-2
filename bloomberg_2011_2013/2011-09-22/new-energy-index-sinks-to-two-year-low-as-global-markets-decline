The Wilderhill New Energy Global
Innovation Index sank to the lowest since March 10, 2009, as
global economies face slower growth and incentives for clean
technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines decline.  The index of 99 companies including  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and
battery maker  Ener1 Inc. (HEV)  today sank as much as 5.5 percent to
138.17, and has dropped 35 percent this year.  The S&P 500 Index slumped 3 percent, extending this weekâ€™s
decline to almost 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
