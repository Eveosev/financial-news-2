Sage Group Plc (SGE) , the U.K.’s biggest
software maker, has “enough firepower” for its acquisition
targets even after a number of failed bids, Chief Executive
Officer Guy Berruyer said today.  Sage, which last month lost out to Bain Capital LLC in its
bid for  Australia ’s MYOB Pty Ltd. in what would have been its
largest ever purchase, is targeting “plenty of other deals,”
Berruyer said today in an interview.  The earlier “unsuccessful bids were not because of a lack
of firepower, but our reasonable approach to pricing,” Berruyer
said. “We know it’s not a firepower question.”  Sage, which today sold its U.S. healthcare unit for $320
million, will spend the proceeds by buying back shares rather
than retaining cash on the balance sheet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
