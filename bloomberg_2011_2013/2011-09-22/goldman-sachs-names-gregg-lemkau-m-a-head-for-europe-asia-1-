Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
second-ranked adviser on global mergers this year, promoted
Gregg Lemkau to become head of mergers and acquisitions in
 Europe  and the Asia-Pacific region, a newly created position.  Lemkau, 42, who has been co-head of technology, media, and
telecommunications since 2008, will keep responsibilities for
many of his current clients, the New York-based bank said in an
internal memorandum to employees obtained by Bloomberg News.
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in  London ,
confirmed the contents of the memo.  Lemkau, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1992, became a partner
in 2002. He previously worked as chief operating officer of the
investment banking division. He will join a global mergers team
overseen by co-heads Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, with Richard Campbell-Breeden as head of mergers for  Asia  outside Japan and
Dusty Philip and Michael Carr as co-heads for the Americas.  Goldman Sachs has advised on 208 announced transactions for
a total value of $405 billion so far this year, second only to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.â€™s $428 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The bank was the top-ranked merger adviser in
2010, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
