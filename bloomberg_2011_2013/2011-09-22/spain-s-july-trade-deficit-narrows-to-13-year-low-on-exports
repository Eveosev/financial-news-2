Spain ’s trade deficit narrowed in
July to its lowest level for 13 years as exports surged and the
number of foreign tourists hit a record in August, providing a
boost for the government is it tries to spur the economy.  The trade shortfall was 1.64 billion euros ($2.2 billion),
down 62 percent from a year earlier and the lowest since July
1998, the Spanish Ministry of Industry in Madrid said in a
statement today. Exports rose 13.8 percent and imports fell 1.9
percent.  Spain received 7.64 million foreign visits in August, the
most since the data series began in 1995, the Industry Ministry
said in a separate statement. Tourist arrivals rose 9.4 percent
from the same month a year earlier. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on March 2 that the Spanish tourist
industry was benefiting from unrest in North Africa.  Zapatero’s Socialist government is counting on exports and
tourism to support a fragile recovery as the euro area’s highest
unemployment rate weighs on  consumer spending  and investment.
Growth slowed in the second quarter as exports contracted and
public spending shrank amid the deepest austerity measures in
three decades.  The trade deficit for the first seven months of the year
fell 15.8 percent from a year earlier to 25.7 billion euros as
capital goods and the automobile sector led a 17.8 percent surge
in exports, the ministry said. Between January and July, the
deficit for energy increased by 18.2 percent while the deficit
for other products declined by 82.3 percent, the ministry said.  Mortgage data today underlined the fragility of an economy
where unemployment stands at 21 percent. The number of home
loans fell 47 percent from a year earlier, the most since the
series began in 2004, after a 42.4 percent drop in June, the
National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement.
Total capital lent on all mortgages fell 48.3 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
