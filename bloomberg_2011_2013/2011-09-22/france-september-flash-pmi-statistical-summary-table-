Markit Economics today released the September Flash
CDAF purchasing & services managers’ index for  France .
The PMI’s are designed to provide a single figure snap-shot for France.
It is based on a survey of about 700 companies in the French private sector
and is designed to provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions.
Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below 50, a contraction. The greater
the divergence from 50, the greater the rate of change.
