OPEC will make a collective
decision on whether to cut supply after monitoring the global
economy over the next two months and the pace of  Libya ’s output
recovery, an OPEC official with knowledge of the matter said.  Saudi Arabia will likely keep pumping at the highest rate
in three decades to meet global demand that’s increasing at
least 1 million barrels a day this year so long as economic woes
in  Europe  and the U.S. don’t spread to emerging nations where
consumption grows faster, said the official from one of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ 12 nations, who
is not authorized to speak publicly and declined to be
identified by name.  Brent crude oil prices, trading at $107.56 a barrel at 9:05
a.m. today on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, have
declined from April’s 2-1/2 year high of $127.02 as economic
growth stutters, after rallying 33 percent during the first four
months of the year when Libyan exports collapsed.  OPEC meets next on Dec. 14 in Vienna. At its June meeting,
the group rejected a Saudi proposal to raise production to
replace lost Libyan crude amid objections from  Iran  and other
members.  Saudi Arabia  nevertheless boosted production to 9.85
million barrels a day last month, from 9.3 million in June,
according to Bloomberg data, and has offered new blends that
more closely mirror Libyan crude.  The official spoke by telephone late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
