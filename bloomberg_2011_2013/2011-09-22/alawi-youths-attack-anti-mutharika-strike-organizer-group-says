Malawian youths attacked an
organizer of an anti-government strike in the country’s eastern
region, said Benedicto Kondowe, national coordinator of the
Coalition of Civil Society on Quality Basic Education.  Denizio Bisika was beaten by ruling Democratic Progressive
Party supporters yesterday in Zomba, 60 kilometers (37 miles)
south of the commercial capital, Blantyre, because of his
involvement in planning a three-day strike to protest against
government policies, Kondowe said by phone today from Lilongwe,
the capital. Police spokesman Thomeck Nyaude confirmed Bisika, a
member of the Human Rights Consultative Committee, was attacked.  “We are living in fear but this will not make us cower,”
Kondowe said.  Bingu wa Mutharika, the southern African nation’s
president, demanded yesterday that the strike end after many
workers stayed at home. Civil-society groups called for the
stayaway after United Nations-backed talks to end a dispute with
Mutharika broke down last week. Nineteen protesters died in
clashes with police during demonstrations in July against
government policies and continuing shortages of fuel and foreign
currency.  Any violence is condemned and the attack wasn’t by members
of the ruling party, Hetherwick Ntaba, a spokesman for
Mutharika, said by phone.  “Our youths are disciplined and would not beat up people
for any reason,” he said.  While many people had returned to work today, the national
strike is “still in force,” Kondowe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
