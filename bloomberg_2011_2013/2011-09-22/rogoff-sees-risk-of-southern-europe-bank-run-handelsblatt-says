Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief
economist at the  International Monetary Fund  and now an
economics professor at Harvard University, said the biggest risk
to the eurozone at present is a run on southern European banks,
 Handelsblatt  reported today.  In an interview with the newspaper, Rogoff said people may
move their deposits to banks in safer countries such as Germany.
A sovereign debt restructuring in some euro area states
shouldn’t be “a taboo,” Handelsblatt cited Rogoff as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
