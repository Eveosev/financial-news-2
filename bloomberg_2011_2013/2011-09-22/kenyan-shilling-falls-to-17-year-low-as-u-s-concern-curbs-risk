Kenya ’s shilling fell to the
weakest in 17 years after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
“significant downside risks” to the world’s largest economy,
cutting demand for riskier assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
1.1 percent to 97.75 per dollar by 12:44 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, for a fifth day of decreases, the longest losing streak
since Aug. 9.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped the most in six
weeks after Fed policy makers said yesterday they plan to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in the central bank’s
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to cut borrowing costs and
spur economic growth.  “The statement by the U.S. Federal Reserve triggered risk
aversion in emerging markets,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  The Kenyan currency is  Africa ’s third-worst performer this
year after neighboring Uganda’s shilling and  South Africa ’s
rand.
