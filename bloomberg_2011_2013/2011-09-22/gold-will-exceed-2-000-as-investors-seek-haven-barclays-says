Gold will exceed $2,000 an ounce as
the economic crisis in Europe boosts investor demand for a
haven, said  Kevin Norrish , managing director of commodities
research at  Barclays Capital  in London.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to a record $1,921.15
on Sept. 6 and is heading for an 11th annual consecutive gain,
the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in London. Prices
more than doubled since the end of 2007 as stock markets
slumped, economies contracted and central banks and governments
pumped more than $2 trillion into the global financial system.  “The last few weeks there has been a flow back into
physical gold,” Norrish said. “Gold will continue in its
current environment. It’s a volatile haven. We think it will
trade above $2,000 an ounce before too long and will move
higher.”  Bullion fell $53.38, or 3 percent, to $1,728.97 an ounce at
3:42 p.m. in  London  trading.  Gold prices may be at risk from an increase in holdings of
exchange-traded products, Norrish said at a separate conference
in London today.  “Investors have a large amount of gold,” Norrish said.
“It may well be that a lot of it gets dumped on the market”
when the opportunity costs of holding gold change, he said,
referring to  interest rates .  To contact the reporters on this story:
