Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  will give Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  an
ultimatum at Sept. 24 talks in Moscow in their dispute over gas
deliveries, Kommersant reported.  Yanukovych, who will meet both Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev, will be told that Ukraine must join a customs union
with Russia, Belarus and  Kazakhstan  or it won’t get a chance to
renegotiate its current gas contract, the Moscow-based newspaper
said, citing unidentified Kremlin and Russian Foreign Ministry
officials.  Ukraine has said it wants to reduce by two-thirds its
imports of Russian gas in a phased three-year move from Jan. 1.
Russia is prepared to go to international arbitration to enforce
a 10-year contract signed in 2009 that doesn’t allow Ukraine to
cut purchases of Russian gas, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
