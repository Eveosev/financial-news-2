FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the
world’s biggest cargo airline, dropped the most in 2 1/2 years
after cutting its full-year profit forecast amid declining
demand in the U.S. and  Asia .  Per-share earnings for the year will be $6.25 to $6.75, 10
cents lower than the previous range, the  Memphis , Tennessee-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts had projected
$6.35, the average of estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  FedEx, an economic bellwether that delivers goods ranging
from mobile devices to financial documents, saw U.S. shipments
fall for the second quarter in a row as the economy grew at a
lower rate than it estimated. Demand dropped for Asian
technology products, especially from  China , hurting the express
international division.  “From talking to our customers, -- the retailers, the
manufacturers and so forth -- the primary driver of the reduced
demand is the lower sales of electronic products,” Chief
Executive Officer  Fred Smith  said on a conference call. “We
expect sluggish economic growth will continue.”  FedEx fell $5.92, or 8.2 percent, to $66.58 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline
since March 6, 2009. Rival  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  slipped
3.4 percent to $62.17. FedEx has declined 28 percent this year,
while UPS has dropped 14 percent.  No Double-Dip  FedEx’s comments were another sign that retailers and
manufacturers may be anticipating a slower holiday season this
year, after carriers such as United Continental Holdings Inc.
and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  reported sagging cargo shipments.  Retailers are keeping inventory levels low and FedEx isn’t
expecting its peak season to show as much volume as 2010.  “While there’s been considerable speculation that the
economy has or will soon enter a recession, this is not our view
at present,” Smith said on the call.  His comments echoed those of UPS Chief Financial Officer
Kurt Kuehn, who said last week that the company expects “subpar
growth” in the world’s largest economy.  U.S. shipments declined 3 percent at FedEx last quarter, as
the global economy “grew at a slower rate than we
anticipated,” Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said. Volumes
for packages sent between countries fell 4 percent, FedEx said.  Sales climbed 11 percent to $10.5 billion as yields gained
and domestic shipments in countries outside the U.S. climbed 38
percent.  Fuel Costs  Net income for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31 rose
22 percent to $464 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with a
mean estimate of $1.45 a share from 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Profit was $380 million, or $1.20, a year earlier.  The company also has been spending more on  jet fuel , whose
cost advanced 40 percent in the period. FedEx typically has a
two-month delay in recovering fuel costs through surcharges.  The company said per-share earnings for the quarter ending
Nov. 30 will be $1.40 to $1.60, compared with 89 cents a year
earlier. Analysts had projected $1.56, the average of 23
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
