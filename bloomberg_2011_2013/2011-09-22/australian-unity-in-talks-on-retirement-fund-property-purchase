The funds management arm of
financial, health care and retirement services provider
 Australian Unity  is in talks to purchase a property for its
Retirement Village Fund, its first real-estate vehicle targeting
institutional investors.  Melbourne-based Australian Unity Investments is in the
process of acquiring a second property for the fund and is
seeking to raise capital to complete the purchase in the next
four weeks to six weeks, said Mark Pratt, general manager for
property, mortgages and capital markets at Australian Unity. He
declined to name the property or the seller.  “We’ve been looking at assets over the course of this
year, and we’ve felt only the two have been right for the type
of fund we’re looking to create,” Pratt said in a telephone
interview from  Melbourne  yesterday.  Australian Unity is aiming to expand its property unit,
which will manage A$1.9 billion ($1.9 billion) after completing
its acquisition of Morgan Stanley-owned Investa Property Group’s
unlisted funds management business next week. The group, which
also bought  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ’s Diversified Property Fund a
year ago, will continue to raise equity, both for its retirement
fund and across its other property vehicles to make improvements
on some existing assets and to reduce debt, Pratt said.  The retirement fund bought its first property, the Geelong
Grove Retirement Village in Victoria state, earlier this month.
It aims to invest in properties worth a total of as much as
A$200 million, Pratt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
