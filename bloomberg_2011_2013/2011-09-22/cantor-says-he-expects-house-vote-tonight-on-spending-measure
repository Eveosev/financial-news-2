House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor ,
a Virginia Republican, said he expects the House will vote
tonight on a new version of a U.S. spending bill that was
defeated yesterday.  The measure is needed to keep the government operating
until Nov. 18, and it also will include aid for victims of
natural disasters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
