Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank with operations in 14 Sub-Saharan African countries, said
it appointed Peter Baird as head of private equity for Africa.  The lender aims to “identify, support and invest in
Africa’s increasing number of entrepreneurial leaders and growth
companies, who are looking to expand on the continent, or
internationally,” Baird, 45, said in a statement today. The
bank’s team in Africa has invested $300 million throughout the
continent to date, Standard Chartered said.  Standard Chartered said on May 5 it plans to pursue growth
on the continent, which is home to about 1 billion people. Many
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are forecast to grow faster than
developed economies with financial firms including  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  expanding their
businesses there.  Baird was most recently an adviser to Vantage Capital and
has also worked for McKinsey & Co. Inc and  Brait SA (BAT) , South
Africa’s largest private equity company, Standard Chartered
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
