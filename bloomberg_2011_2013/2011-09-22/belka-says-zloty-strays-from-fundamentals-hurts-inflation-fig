The zloty is straying from  Poland ’s
“healthy” fundamentals and making the central bank’s job of
controlling inflation harder, central bank Governor Marek Belka
was quoted today as saying on the Narodowy Bank Polski’s
 Obserwatorfinansowy.pl  website.  Belka’s comments published in an article are given below.  “The zloty is straying from the Polish economy’s healthy
fundamentals. Zloty depreciation has a negative impact on prices
and makes it more difficult for the  National Bank of Poland  to
control inflation. The high volatility of the zloty  exchange
rate  makes forecasting difficult and increases uncertainty for
participants in the economy, which in turn reduces their
propensity to invest and hurts potential growth. The zloty’s
exchange rate to foreign currencies is now largely determined by
external circumstances, which are exerting a negative influence
on the Polish economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
