Four leading German business
associations urged lawmakers to pass changes to strengthen
 Europe ’s rescue fund for indebted nations, Handelsblatt
reported, citing an open letter by the groups’ presidents.  The letter by the BDA employers group, the BDI industry
federation, the DIHT chamber of commerce and industry and the
ZDH skilled trades group called specifically on members of
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition who have doubts about the
changes to vote for the legislation, the newspaper reported in
an e-mailed summary of an article to appear tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
