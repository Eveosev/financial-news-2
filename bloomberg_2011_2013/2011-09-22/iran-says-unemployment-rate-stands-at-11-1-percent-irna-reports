Iran ‘s unemployment rate is 11.1
percent based on the latest figures, the official  Islamic
Republic News Agency  reported, citing the head of Iran’s
Statistics Center, Adel Azar.  The rate is down from the 11.9 percent cited by Iranian
officials for 2010. The country’s population is nearing 75.5
million, Azar said, according to IRNA.  Local analysts say real unemployment rates are higher than
the official figure. Several parliament members have criticized
statistics provided by the government of President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , saying they are distorted to give a better image of
his achievements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
