Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said “it is very important that we look
at the possibility of leveraging the EFSF ressources and funding
to have a stronger impact and make it more effective.”  “We have to do one thing at the time,” Rehn said at a
panel discussion in Wahington. “Now we are completing the
ratification in the parliaments and then we move to the next
phase of reinforcing economic governance in  Europe .”  The enhanced European Financial Stability Facility will be
“up and running” in the second half of October, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
