Standard Chartered Plc prefers
stocks in the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and  India 
to those in North Asia, said Clive McDonnell, head of emerging
equity strategy at Standard Chartered Bank.  India is preferred because it “entered the downturn a lot
earlier than many of the other economies,” said McDonnell said
in a Bloomberg Television interview in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
