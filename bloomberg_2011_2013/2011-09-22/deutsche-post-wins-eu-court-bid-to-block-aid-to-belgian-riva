Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  won its bid to
block 297.5 million euros ($400.3 million) in state aid to Bpost
SA,  Belgium ’s state-controlled mail company, in a ruling by the
European Union’s top court.  The  EU Court of Justice  in Luxembourg today rejected a
challenge by Belgium to an earlier Deutsche Post court victory
that had blocked the state subsidies.  Belgium appealed after Deutsche Post, the world’s biggest
transporter of air and sea freight by volume, won a lower-court
ruling to annul EU backing for the aid. The February 2009 ruling
triggered an in-depth review by the European Commission into all
Belgian aid to the national postal operator partly owned by CVC
Capital Partners Ltd.  Both court decisions “focus on procedural flaws,” Bpost
said in an e-mailed statement. “Today’s judgment does not touch
on the substance of the file, nor does it take a definitive
position on the question of the repayment.”  “Bpost will continue to cooperate closely” with the
commission “through submissions of required data and
clarifications of open issues,” the company said.  Deutsche Post  sued  the Brussels-based commission in
November 2003 after the regulator approved the capital injection
by the Belgian government.  “We are happy that our legal position has been
confirmed,” Dirk Klasen, a spokesman for Deutsche Post, said by
telephone. “We hope that this means that the commission bears
the judgment in mind when it looks at other instances of state
aid.”  The case is: C-148/09 P, Belgium v. Deutsche Post and
Others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
