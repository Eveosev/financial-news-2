Corn yields in the U.S., the
worldâ€™s largest grower and exporter, will be smaller than
forecast because of unusually dry conditions,  Commodity Weather
Group  LLC said.  Farmers will collect 147.3 bushels an acre this year, down
from an August estimate of 148.7 bushels, the Bethesda,
Maryland-based forecaster said in a blog posting yesterday. On
Sept. 20, Commodity Weather Group pared its soybean forecast to
40.7 bushels an acre from 41.3 bushels.  Corn production will total 12.37 billion bushels, the
company said. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Sept. 12
said the harvest would total 12.497 billion bushels, with an
average yield of 148.1 bushels an acre, down from 152.8 bushels
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
