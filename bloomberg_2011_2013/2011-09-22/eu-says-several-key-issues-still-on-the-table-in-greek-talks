The European Commission said
“several key elements” of  Greece ’s budget-cutting package
remain to be resolved.  “There are still technical discussions going on between
the experts that are in  Athens  from the commission and the Greek
authorities about several key elements that were supposed to be
in place when the task force was expected to come back to
Athens,” commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told reporters in
Brussels today. “‘These elements were not finalized last week
nor earlier this week, so they are still on the table and need
to be finalized before the task force goes back.’’  Bailly didn’t give details on the unresolved issues.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
