OMV AG (OMV) , central Europe’s biggest
oil company, is in talks with Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS to supply OMV’s Turkey unit with fuel to sell in the country.  OMV  Petrol Ofisi (PTOFS)  AS currently is supplied by Tupras,
Turkey’s only refiner, and by imports from suppliers in the
region, including OMV’s Romanian refinery, Chief Executive
Officer Gerhard Roiss told reporters in Istanbul today. The
talks are to determine how much fuel Petrol Ofisi will get from
Tupras and other sources, Roiss said, adding that this had no
“strategic dimension” and that there wasn’t a time frame for
the completion of the talks.  OMV took over Petrol Ofisi, Turkey’s biggest fuel retailer,
earlier this year by increasing its stake 97 percent for 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion). The unit isn’t as profitable as
anticipated and will require “better segmentation,” he said.  The Vienna-based  oil company  has no intention to change the
free-float structure at Petrol Ofisi, Roiss said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
