A Phoenix man alleged to be a
member of the LulzSec hacking group was arrested by the FBI on
charges he broke into Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.’s
computer systems in May and June.  Cody Kretsinger was arrested yesterday, the  Federal Bureau
of Investigation  said in an e-mailed statement. Kretsinger, 23,
belonged to Lulz Security, or LulzSec, a group of “elite
computer hackers” that undertook cyber attacks on the computer
systems of businesses and government entities in the U.S. and
around the world, according to an indictment unsealed yesterday
in federal court in  Los Angeles .  Kretsinger, who used the alias “Recursion,” and other
unidentified hackers probed the Sony Inc. unit’s computer
systems for vulnerabilities and obtained confidential
information that was posted on a LulzSec website and on the
group’s twitter account, according to the indictment.  LulzSec is affiliated with an international hackers group
called “Anonymous,” the FBI said in the statement.  Kretsinger faces as long as 15 years in prison if convicted
of conspiracy and unauthorized impairment of a protected
computer, the FBI said.  The name of Kretsinger’s lawyer wasn’t immediately
available.  LulzSec Posted Statements  LulzSec in June posted statements online saying it had
broken into SonyPictures.com and downloaded unencrypted personal
information, including passwords, e-mail addresses and dates of
birth from 1 million user accounts.  The attack followed earlier ones this year in which Tokyo-
based Sony had said more than 100 million accounts were
compromised after hackers broke into its networks. Sony
suspended operation of the PlayStation Network in the U.S. and
 Europe  for six weeks after the earlier attacks.  Sony said in May there was some evidence linking Anonymous
to the PlayStation hack. There have been no arrests in that
case.  LulzSec, following the attack on Sony Pictures’ systems,
posted customer information online from what appeared to be
sweepstakes and loyalty-program databases, including one tied to
the long-running soap opera “The Young and the Restless.” The
group also took information from Sony music operations in
 Belgium  and the Netherlands, it said.  The group, which has also claimed credit for hacking into
websites of the U.S. Senate and Central Intelligence Agency,
said later in June that it was ending its cyber attacks. The
CIA’s public website was taken down on June 15.  Hacker activist groups gained attention after Anonymous,
made up of hundreds of members in several countries, in December
targeted  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal unit, Visa Inc. and other companies
deemed hostile to WikiLeaks, an organization that posts secret
documents on the Web.  U.S. prosecutors in July arrested and charged 14 people
with involvement in the PayPal attacks.  The case is U.S. v. Kretsinger, 11-848, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
