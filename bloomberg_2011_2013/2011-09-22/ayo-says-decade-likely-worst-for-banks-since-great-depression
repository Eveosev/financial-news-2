This decade is likely to be the
worst decade for U.S. banks in terms of revenues since the
decade of the Great Depression, said Mike Mayo, an analyst at
CLSA Ltd.  Banks have to get “tougher” on expenses, May said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. He said that while Asia banks
won’t be immune to a downturn in the U.S. they have stronger
growth prospects than their American peers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
