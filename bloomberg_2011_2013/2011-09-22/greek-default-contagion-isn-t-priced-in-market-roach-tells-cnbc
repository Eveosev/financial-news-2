Contagion from a potential Greek
default isn’t priced into financial markets, said  Stephen Roach ,
non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley  Asia .  “ Greece  will default,” Roach said in an interview on CNBC
today. While the risk of such an event is “pretty close” to
being priced in by investors, he said the potential knock-on
effects are “definitely not baked in.”  Stocks and the euro have fallen and the cost of insuring
sovereign and bank bonds has risen across  Europe  as the global
economy slows and policy makers struggle to contain the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. Shares of French banks have tumbled and
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government in  Germany  are debating
how to shore up the country’s banks should Greece default.  “We’ve heard rumors about the exposure of French banks and
German banks, and then what happens to the banks around the
world who are exposed, like in the U.S., to European banks?”
Roach said. “I don’t think we have a clear sense of what the
whole web of counterparty risk is in the event of a Greek
default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
