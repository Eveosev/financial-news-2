Benchmark European coal fell to the
lowest level in almost five weeks as  oil prices  slipped.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year dropped $1.35, or 1.1 percent,
to $125.40 a metric ton at 10:35 a.m. in London, the lowest
since Aug. 19, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coal tracks oil and equities, which can follow economic
production. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 3.6
percent to 217.26 at 10:40 a.m. in London, while  Brent crude 
dropped as much as 2.6 percent.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
