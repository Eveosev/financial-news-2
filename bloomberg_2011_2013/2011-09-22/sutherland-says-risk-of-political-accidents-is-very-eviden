Peter Sutherland, non-executive
chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said the “risk of
political accidents is very evident” regardless of comments by
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  that a break-up of the euro is
unthinkable.  Sutherland, a former European Commissioner and Irish
Attorney General, said in the text of speech given in Dublin
today that an unstructured Greek default could have contagion
effects for other bailed out countries and “possibly even Spain
and  Italy  as well.”  The coming weeks are “of great importance and potentially
dangerous” as euro member states vote on bolstering the
European Financial Stability Facility, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
