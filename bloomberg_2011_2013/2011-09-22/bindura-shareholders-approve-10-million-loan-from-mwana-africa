Bindura Nickel Corp. shareholders
today approved a $10 million loan from parent company  Mwana
Africa Plc (MWA)  to keep the company’s mines on care and maintenance,
Kala Mpinga, Mwana’s chairman, told a shareholder meeting in
Harare today.  Uncertainty around a local ownership law prevented Bindura 
from completing its own fundraising, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
