Czech stocks tumbled, led by  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG) , after the U.S. Federal Reserve said the world’s
largest economy faces “significant downside risks,” hurting
demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The PX gauge dropped as much as 3.1 percent to 900.10, its
lowest since July 2009. It traded down 3 percent by 10:57 p.m.
in Prague. Austria’s Erste slumped 6.3 percent to 453.8 koruna
and coal miner New World Resources Plc slid 5.7 percent to 139
koruna.  Global stocks and commodities fell as investors fled to the
relative safety of U.S. Treasuries after the growth warning from
the  Federal Open Market Committee  and as Moody’s Investors
Service cut credit ratings on three U.S. banks.  “Emerging-market assets have sold off extremely sharply
overnight, extending the fall in U.S. equities following the
release of the FOMC statement and its downbeat assessment of
economic prospects,” analysts at  RBC Capital Markets  wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Negative sentiment was further
exacerbated by the release of preliminary PMI data from  China .”  Manufacturing in China may shrink for a third month in
September, the longest contraction since 2009, according an
index of purchasing managers released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
