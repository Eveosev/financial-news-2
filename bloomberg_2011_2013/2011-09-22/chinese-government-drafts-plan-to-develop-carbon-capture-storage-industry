China  is drafting a development
plan for the  carbon capture , utilization and storage industry as
the country takes steps to cut emissions, Minister of Science
and Technology Wan Gang said.   The government plans to double its spending on projects
capturing and storing carbon in the five years ending 2015 to
400 million yuan from the preceding five-year period, Wan told a
conference in Beijing today.   The spending may attract 2.3 billion yuan of investments in
the industry during that period, compared with the 1 billion
yuan invested between 2006 and 2010, according to Wan.   Alstom SA, the third-largest maker of power equipment, and
China Datang Corp. agreed to develop two trial projects to
capture carbon dioxide from  power plants  and store it in Chinaâ€™s
two biggest oilfields, the Levallois-Perret, France-based
equipment company said yesterday.   China is willing to share its experience and expertise on
carbon capture and storage with other developing nations, Wan
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
