European  consumer confidence 
tumbled in September to the lowest in two years as a worsening
debt crisis sparked concerns that the economy may slide into a
recession.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 18.9 from minus 16.5 in August, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today.
Economists forecast a drop to minus 18, the median of 29
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Europe’s manufacturing and services output contracted in
September for the first time in more than two years and
employment growth slowed, adding to signs that tougher austerity
measures are hurting economic growth. The  European Central Bank 
on Sept. 8 kept borrowing costs at 1.5 percent, and Paris-based
 L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest maker of cosmetics, last month
reported first-half earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  “We see a material and rising risk of outright gross
domestic product contraction in the fourth quarter,”  Marco Valli , chief euro-region economist at UniCredit Global Research
in Milan, wrote in an e-mailed note before the report. Signs of
a slowdown “will probably increase pressure on the ECB to cut
rates soon.”  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
