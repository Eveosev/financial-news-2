Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest luxury carmaker, proposed terms on a 6 billion-
euro ($8 billion) credit line, according to two people with
knowledge of the deal.  The five-year revolving facility will pay 35 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate on drawn funds, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The loan can be extended a maximum of two additional
years, coordinators BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche
Bank AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said in a statement today.  The lenders began syndicating the deal to other banks
today, according to the statement.  BMW will also pay a utilization fee of 20 basis points to
draw more than one-third of the facility, and 40 basis points
for more than two-thirds, said the people.  A spokeswoman at the Munich-based company declined to
comment.  The interest margin is in line with the rate banks charged
similarly-rated rival Volkswagen AG in July for a 5 billion-euro
 credit line , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BMW’s new credit line will renew a $8 billion financing
signed in November 2005, according to the statement today. It
agreed to pay interest of 15 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate to draw funds under that credit line
maturing next year, according to Bloomberg data. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Standard and Poor’s rates BMW at A-. Moody’s Investors
Service in July upgraded the company by one level to A2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
