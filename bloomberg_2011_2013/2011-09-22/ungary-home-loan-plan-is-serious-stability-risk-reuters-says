Early repayments of foreign-
currency mortgages at below-market rates poses a “serious
stability risk” for  Hungary , Reuters  reported , citing an
interview with central bank Vice President Julia Kiraly.  “On the systemic level, we see that the amount of
repayment can reach a point where it could pose a serious
stability risk,” Kiraly said, according to Reuters. The
repayments put pressure on the forint, Reuters cited Kiraly as
saying.  Hungary is offering homeowners the chance to repay
predominantly Swiss franc-denominated mortgages ahead of
schedule at exchange rates more than 20 percent below market,
forcing lenders to absorb losses.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
