Washington Governor Christine Gregoire said she’ll call the Legislature back into session on
Nov. 28 to cut $2 billion of the $32 billion biennial budget
because of falling revenue.  The target is $600 million more than the $1.4 billion
 shortfall  projected by the state’s Economic and Revenue Forecast
Council on Sept. 15, to provide a reserve, the governor told
reporters at a briefing today in Olympia, the capital.  “Our work will be brutal,” said Gregoire, 64, a Democrat
who has said she won’t seek a third term. “My only option is
across-the-board cuts, and that option is unacceptable. Solving
this  budget crisis  will require the Legislature to act.”  About 77 percent of spending is off-limits to reductions
because of requirements in state and federal laws, the governor
said. That means most of the cuts will come in the $8.7 billion
of the budget earmarked for programs including education, social
services, health care and prisons, Gregoire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
