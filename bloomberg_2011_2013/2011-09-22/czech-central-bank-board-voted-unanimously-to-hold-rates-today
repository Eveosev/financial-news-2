Czech central bank Governor
Miroslav Singer said the next move in  interest rates  “doesn’t
necessarily have to be up” after policy makers voted
unanimously to leave the two-week repurchase rate at a record
low for an 11th meeting.  Risks to the central bank’s inflation forecast are tipped
toward slower inflation and “markedly” in the direction of
lower interest rates, Singer told journalists today in Prague.  The Ceska Narodni Banka left the two-week rate at 0.75
percent, half of the  European Central Bank ’s main rate,
maintaining stable borrowing costs since May 2010. The decision
was in line with forecasts of all 19 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  The outlook is consistent with stable market interest rates
and an increase at the turn of the year, the central banker
said.  The bank’s monetary-policy inflation rate is expected to
hold close to its target, while headline inflation will be
influenced by an increase in the value-added tax in January and
rise for a period of more than 3 percent, it said.  Main inflationary risks are a weakening of the koruna while
the main anti-inflationary risks are a lower outlook for foreign
interest rates and the state of the financial industry and
public finances in developed countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
