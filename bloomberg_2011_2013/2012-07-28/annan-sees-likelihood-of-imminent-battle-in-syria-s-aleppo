United Nations special envoy  Kofi
Annan  said he is concerned about reports of growing numbers of
Syrian troops and heavy weapons around Aleppo in anticipation of
an imminent battle in the country’s largest city.  “I remind the parties to the conflict of their obligations
under international humanitarian law and human rights law, and
urge them to exercise restraint and avoid any further
bloodshed,” Annan said in an e-mailed statement from Geneva
today.  “The escalation of the military build-up in Aleppo and the
surrounding area is further evidence of the need for the
international community to come together to persuade the parties
that only a political transition, leading to a political
settlement will resolve this crisis and bring peace to the
Syrian people,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
