Setting up Russian naval bases in
foreign counties is “not the navy fleet’s job,” Vice-Admiral
Viktor Chirkov said in an interview with Echo Moskvy radio
station.  “This is a job for the Foreign Ministry’s executive
management,” said Chirkov, the navy’s commander-in-chief. “The
fleet is meant to provide the country’s stability in any part of
the ocean.”  Russia is in talks to establish naval bases in former Cold
War allies Cuba and  Vietnam , Chirkov said in an interview with
state-run RIA Novosti news service published yesterday.  The  Defense Ministry  refuted Chirkov’s remarks, news agency
Interfax reported yesterday, citing the ministry’s press
service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
