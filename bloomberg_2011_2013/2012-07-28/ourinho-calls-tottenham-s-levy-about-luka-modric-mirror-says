Jose Mourinho  has personally asked
Tottenham chairman  Daniel Levy  to let Luka Modric join Real
Madrid, the Mirror said.  The Real coach called Levy to try and soothe things after
Modric left Spurs last week without permission, the Mirror said.
The midfielder is angry because Tottenham promised to let him go
this summer after refusing to sell him to Chelsea last year, the
newspaper said.  Levy wants 40 million pounds ($63 million) for Modric and
Real President Florentino Perez has said he won’t pay more than
27 million pounds, the Mirror said. Paris Saint-Germain has also
offered up to 40 million pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
