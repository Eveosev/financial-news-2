Spain’s government bonds rose, with
10-year yields dropping the most in seven months, amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will accelerate efforts to
ease the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Italy ’s securities also rallied after German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President  Francois Hollande  pledged to
do everything to keep the 17-nation currency bloc intact,
echoing comments the day before from ECB President  Mario Draghi .
 Germany ’s bunds declined after Moody’s Investors Service cut the
outlook on the nation’s Aaa rating, citing concern the country
will have to support weaker euro-region members. The ECB meets
to review monetary policy on Aug. 2.  “A lot of it is down to Mr. Draghi’s comments, which
convinced the market that come next Thursday the ECB will be
providing us with some support” for bonds, said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London .
“The language he used was pretty forceful. If he fails to
deliver on that promise the market is going to make them pay and
big time.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell 52 basis points, or 0.52
percentage point, this week to 6.74 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, the biggest weekly drop since the period ended
Dec. 2. The 5.85 percent bond due in January 2012 gained 3.38,
or 33.80 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,237) face amount, to 93.83.  The Italian 10-year bond yield declined 21 basis points
this week to 5.96 percent after rising to 6.71 percent on July
25, the highest level since Jan. 16.  ‘Deepest Duty’  Germany and France are “bound by the deepest duty” to keep
the euro bloc intact, Merkel and Hollande said in a joint
statement after they spoke by phone yesterday. The two sought
“quick” implementation of resolutions made at a June 28-29
European Union summit, they said.  Draghi said on July 26 that the ECB is ready to do whatever
it takes to preserve the single currency. He spoke after yields
on Spain’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year  government securities 
surged above 7 percent this week, the level that spurred  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts.  Bunds fell for the first time in four weeks as investors
sought higher-yielding assets and Moody’s changed its outlooks
on the Aaa credit ratings of Germany, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg to negative on July 23, citing an “increasing
likelihood” of collective support for countries such as Spain
and Italy.  The  10-year bund yield  rose 23 basis points this week to
1.40 percent. The yield declined to an all-time low of 1.127
percent on both June 1 and July 23.  ECB Meeting  ECB policy makers next meet on Aug. 2. They will keep their
benchmark  interest rate  a record low 0.75 percent, according to
the median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Italy plans to sell as much as 5.5 billion euros of notes
due from 2015 to 2022 on July 30. Germany will auction 4 billion
euros of five-year securities two days later. Spain and Belgium
will also sell bonds next week.  “Something really had to be done” before the bond sales,
Lloyds’s Wand said. “If we get something decent next week, then
it could be something that changes the whole landscape.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
