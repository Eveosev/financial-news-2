Curtis Granderson  hit his fifth
career grand slam and Raul Ibanez and  Russell Martin  added two-
run homers as the New York Yankees defeated the Boston Red Sox
10-3 in the fastest meeting of the rivals in seven years.  Granderson’s grand slam scored Ichiro Suzuki, who was
making his debut in a New York uniform at Yankee Stadium,
Russell Martin and  Derek Jeter  in the eighth inning. It followed
Ibanez’s home run in the first that gave the Major League
Baseball-leading Yankees a 3-1 advantage and Martin’s homer in
the fourth that put New York ahead 6-3.  Last night’s game ended in 2 hours, 41 minutes, the fastest
Yankees-Red Sox contest since a 1-0 New York win on Sept. 11,
2005, which took 2 hours, 29 minutes. Since the start of the
2009 season, five of the 61 games between the clubs finished in
under three hours.  Dustin Pedroia,  Carl Crawford  and Jarrod Saltalamacchia hit
solo home runs in the first, third and fourth innings off Yankee
starter  Phil Hughes .  “We’re two games under .500,” Pedroia told reporters.
“We’re the Boston Red Sox, so if anyone’s thrilled with where
we’re at they better re-evaluate because I don’t like losing.”  Hughes (10-8) allowed three runs on five hits and struck
out five in seven innings. He retired 10 of his final 11
batters.  “He did a nice job after we got the lead to 6-3,” Yankees
manager  Joe Girardi  said. “He settled down nicely.”  ‘Very Frustrating’  Red Sox starter Aaron Cook (2-4) surrendered six runs on
seven hits in four innings.  “It’s very frustrating,” Cook said. “But the one thing
we’ve got to be able to do is forget about this, wash it off,
come back tomorrow.”  The Yankees (60-39), who have a 1-0 lead in the three-game
weekend series against the  Red Sox , top the five-team American
League East with Boston (49-51) in last place, falling 11 ½
games behind New York.  The paid attendance of 49,571 was the highest regular-
season figure at Yankee Stadium since Sept.25, 2010, when 49,588
fans bought tickets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
