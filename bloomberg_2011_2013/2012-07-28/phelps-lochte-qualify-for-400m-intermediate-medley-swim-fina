(Corrects race name in first paragraph.)  Americans  Michael Phelps  and  Ryan
Lochte  qualified for tonight’s men’s 400-meter individual medley
swimming final at the London Olympics.  Phelps won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds, the
slowest of the eight final qualifiers. Lochte had the third-
fastest time of 4:12.35 as he finished second to South Africa’s
Chad Le Clos in his heat. Japan’s Kosuke Hagino had the top time
of 4:10.01.  Phelps is trying to win seven gold medals in London. He won
eight golds in Beijing four years ago and six in Athens in 2004,
setting 400 IM world records in each.  Lochte beat Phelps in the event in last month’s U.S. trials
and also won the race at the 2011 world championships.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
