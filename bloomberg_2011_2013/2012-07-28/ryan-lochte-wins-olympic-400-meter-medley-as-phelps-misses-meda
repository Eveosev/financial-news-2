Ryan Lochte  dethroned two-time
champion  Michael Phelps  to win the 400-meter individual medley
on the first night of swimming at the  London Olympics .  Phelps finished fourth, the first time he hasn’t won a
medal in an Olympic race since 2000.  Lochte, a 27-year-old American, won the first final at the
Aquatics Centre in 4 minutes, 5.18 seconds. The event includes
100 meters each of butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and
freestyle. Lochte led from the start and extended his advantage
after the second leg. He won by 3.68 seconds.  “Going into these games I always knew I was capable of
getting the win so I’m happy that I was able to do that,”
Lochte told reporters.  Among those in the crowd was  Michelle Obama , the wife of
the U.S. president. The crowd cheered “USA, USA,” after Lochte
won the race, and  Bruce Springsteen ’s “Born in the USA” played
before the medal ceremony, the first golf medal of the games for
the American team.  “I heard the fans screaming all throughout the whole race
and definitely had my family there,” Lochte said. “It
definitely helped me out a lot.”  Phelps, Lochte’s friend and teammate and also 27, had been
trying to become the first man to win the same individual event
at three straight games. The winner of a record 14 gold medals,
Phelps finished fourth after barely qualifying for the last spot
in the final. Thiago Perreira, 26, of  Brazil  took the silver and
Kosuke Hagino, 17, of  Japan  won the bronze.  No Medal  The only other time Phelps walked away from an Olympic
final empty-handed was in the 200-meter butterfly at the 2000
Sydney Games, when he finished fifth as a 15-year-old. Phelps
will retire after the  London  Olympics.  “They swam a better race than me,” Phelps told reporters.
“They were better prepared than me. That’s why they’re on the
medal stand.”  Phelps remains two short of tying the record 18 Olympic
medals won by former Soviet gymnast Larissa Latynina.  Phelps took two years out after winning a record eight gold
medals in Beijing before returning to the pool in 2010. At that
time he said he wouldn’t return to the 400 medley before
changing his mind a year later.  Lochte, a Floridian who’s 11 months older than Phelps, has
credited his recent successes to a fitness plan that includes
rolling large tires, tossing kegs and dragging heavy chains. The
two men are due to square off again in the 200-meter individual
medley on Aug. 2.  Phelps’s Shadow  Although Lochte won two gold medals in Beijing in 2008,
he’d been overshadowed by Phelps.  The tables turned after Beijing, as Lochte won 15 gold
medals at the following three world championships. Lochte, who
took bronze in the 400 individual medley in Beijing, won the
event at the 2009 and 2011 world championships. At last month’s
U.S. swimming trials in Omaha,  Nebraska , he beat Phelps in the
event in a personal best of 4:07.06.  “I know he gave it everything he had,” Lochte said. “I
guess that’s the only thing you can ask for. I mean I’m going to
talk to him and see how he felt about that.”  Lochte made the Olympic final in London with a time of
4:12.35 in the heats early today. Phelps qualified in 4:13.33,
and swam the final in 4:09.28. He won the 400 medley in Beijing
in a world record of 4:03.84.  The men’s 400-meter freestyle was won by Yang Sun, 20, of
China in a time of 3:40.14.  South Korea ’s Park Tae-Hwan finished
second, while Peter Vanderkaay of the U.S. got the bronze.  Protest Upheld  Park, the Olympic champion in Beijing, had earlier today
successfully appealed his disqualification for a false start in
winning his heat.  The Korean Swimming Federation lodged a protest that was
upheld by the technical commission of FINA, international
swimming’s governing body.  China ’s 16-year-old Shiwen Ye won the women’s 400-meter
individual medley in a world-record time of 4:28.43. It was the
first world record set in the London swimming competition.  Australia 's team of Alicia Coutts, Cate Campbell, Brittany
Elmslie,18, and Melanie Schlanger, 25, won the women’s 400-meter 
freestyle relay in an Olympic-record 3:33.15. The Netherlands,
2008 champion, took the silver medal and the U.S. the bronze.  Campbell, 20, will also take part in the 50-meter and 
100-meter freestyle. Coutts, 24, is swimming in the 200-meter 
individual medley in two days. She finished 5th in that race 
in Beijing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
