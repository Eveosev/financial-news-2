U.K. government bonds  fell for the
first time in four weeks as European leaders said they would do
whatever is needed to preserve the single-currency bloc, damping
demand for safer assets.  Ten-year gilt yields climbed to the highest level in two
weeks as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  said yesterday they were  “bound by the
deepest duty” to protect the euro. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said the day before that policy makers
will do what is required to bring down surging borrowing costs
in countries like Spain and  Italy . The pound rose to a five-week
high versus the dollar.  “We read Draghi’s comment as suggesting the bond-buying
program is likely to be reactivated if pressures continue to
build, and risk assets have bounced,” said  John Stopford , head
of fixed income at Investec Asset Management Ltd. in London.
“At these levels government bonds, including gilts, look fairly
fully priced.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 1.54 percent at 5 p.m.  London 
time yesterday, after dropping to a record 1.407 percent on July
23. The 4 percent bond maturing in 2022 fell 0.56, or 5.60 per
1,000 pound ($1,572) face amount, to 121.92.  Gilts have returned 4.1 percent this year as of July 26,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. They outperformed
German bunds, which gained 3.7 percent, after investors sought
U.K. assets as a haven from the debt crisis.  Merkel and Hollande urged the “quick” implementation of
resolutions made at a June 28-29 summit of European Union
leaders, according to a joint statement after they spoke by
telephone yesterday.  Pounds Gains  The pound rose for a third week against the dollar as
speculation the  European debt crisis  will be contained improved
the outlook for Britain’s economy.  The U.K. currency appreciated 0.6 percent this week to
$1.5721 after rising to $1.5768 yesterday, the highest since
June 20. Sterling dropped 1 percent to 78.62 pence per euro.  A decline in  inflation expectations  may give the  Bank of
England  more scope to increase stimulus when it meets next week.
The  difference in yield  between 10-year U.K. bond yields and
index-linked securities of a similar maturity, used as a measure
of inflation expectations, narrowed four basis points this week
to 2.34 percent.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the Bank of
England will keep asset purchases at 375 billion pounds and
leave its benchmark rate on a record-low 0.5 percent on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
