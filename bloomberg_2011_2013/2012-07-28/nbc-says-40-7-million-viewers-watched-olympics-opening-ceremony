Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal said
40.7 million U.S. viewers watched last night’s tape-delay of the
2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony in London, making it the most-
watched ceremony ever.  The gain in viewers was about 6 million more than watched
the opening ceremony in Beijing in 2008 and 15 million more than
the 2004 Athens opening ceremony, the network said in an e-
mailed statement. The highest viewership for an opening pageant
at the  Summer Olympics  had been 39.8 million for the 1996 Games
in Atlanta, NBC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
