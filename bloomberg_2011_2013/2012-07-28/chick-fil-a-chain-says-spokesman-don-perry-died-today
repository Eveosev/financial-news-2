Chick-fil-A Inc., overseer of 1,600
fast-food chicken restaurants in the U.S., said Don Perry, vice
president of public relations, died today.  Perry, who worked for the company for almost 29 years,
“passed away suddenly this morning,” the Atlanta-based chain
said on its  website , without disclosing the cause of Perry’s
death. Perry “was a well-respected and well-liked media
executive in the Atlanta and University of Georgia
communities,” the company said.  Gay-rights groups have urged a boycott of the chain and
mayors of cities including  Boston  and San Francisco have spoken
out against the company, after Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy
took a position against same-sex marriage, the  Associated Press 
reported. Cathy said last week the closely held company is
“guilty as charged” for backing what he called the biblical
definition of the family unit, the AP reported.  “The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our
restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and
respect -- regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual
orientation or gender,” the company said in a statement, the AP
reported on July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
