Estonian Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said  Germany â€™s top court takes too much time to rule on the
lawsuits pending over the European Stability Mechanism,
 WirtschaftsWoche   reported , citing an interview.  All information has long been available and the Federal
Constitutional Court could have ruled earlier, the magazine
cited Ligi as saying in a preview of an article for its next
edition. The delay and uncertainly are embarrassing for the
government and parliaments, he said, according to WiWo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
