Officials in Tehran plan to set up
375 counseling centers for married couples across the city
within two years in an effort to “protect the family unit,”
Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported .  Thirty percent of marriages in the Iranian capital end in
divorce, the Tehran-based newspaper reported, citing Morteza
Talaei, head of the social and cultural committee of the Tehran
Council. A further 50 percent of couples stay together amid
tensions, it said. Only 20 percent of marriages in the city are
“balanced,” the paper cited Talaei as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
