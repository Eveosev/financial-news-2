U.S. men’s gymnastics squad members
say they are confident of winning their first Olympic gold medal
in the team event in 28 years after qualifying ahead of  Russia 
and Britain in London today.  “We did a really good job,” 26-year-old Jonathan Horton
told reporters at North Greenwich Arena. “Obviously it is a
confidence boost. We’ve got one more day to go and we’re pumped
about it.”  The U.S. team, which includes Horton, Danell Leyva, Jacob
Dalton, John Orozco and Samuel Mikulak, scored 275.342 in the
second session of the qualifying event today. That beat Russia’s
272.595 and the U.K.’s score of 272.420. Both of those teams
also qualified.  The U.S. won the gold medal at the Los Angeles Games in
1984 and Horton was on the squad that finished third in Beijing
four years ago. The top three will be joined in the  team final 
by  Germany , Japan, China, Ukraine and  France .  “We just need to keep confident,” the 19-year-old Mikulak
said after the event. “I think we’ll be able to do some big
stuff in a few days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
