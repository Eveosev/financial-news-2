American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) 
began a process to review merger offers yesterday by sending
potential suitor  US Airways  Group Inc. an agreement to allow an
exchange of confidential financial information.  American developed the non-disclosure agreement along with
the unsecured creditors committee in its bankruptcy, the airline
told managers in a memo yesterday. The airline declined to name
others that will receive the agreement, said  Andy Backover , a
spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based American.  The document was created “to govern a fair and objective
process of comparing all strategic alternatives” to American’s
own plan to emerge from bankruptcy on a stand-alone basis,
according to the memo.  US Airways, which first expressed interest in merging with
American during its restructuring in January, declined to
comment beyond confirming it had received the agreement.  American Chief Executive Officer  Tom Horton  said July 10
the company was ready to consider alternatives after determining
expected future revenue and costs under its plan to remain
independent.  US Airways hasn’t made a formal merger offer because
American holds the exclusive right to propose a restructuring
plan to the bankruptcy court through the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
