Italians bought most of the newly
built flats sold by  EA Shaw  in  London â€™s Bloomsbury,  Covent
Garden , Soho and Holborn districts in the second quarter, the
Times reported, citing the property adviser.  About 83 percent of the properties sold by the firm in the
period were bought by Italians transferring money from their
home nation, the London-based newspaper said. EA Shaw sold no
homes to Italians in the same period last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
