French Industry Minister  Arnaud Montebourg  is planning talks with ArcelorMittal’s management on
strategy and the future of the Florange steel plant.  The minister “wants to quickly clarify” the situation at
Florange because the site needs “rapid and significant
investment” to remain competitive, according to a statement
late yesterday from the ministry charged with turning around
 France ’s industrial decline.  Montebourg was handed a report from Pascal Faure, vice
president of economic adviser CGEIET, on the industrial
prospects for ArcelorMittal’s idled steel plant in eastern
France, the ministry said. The report concluded that there is a
future for the site because it is located near car manufacturers
and produces value-added products.  Florange, located in Lorraine, makes steel slabs, coils and
plated sheets and was already being considered for shutdown in
2002, before Mittal Steel Co. took over Arcelor SA in 2006.
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  is the world’s biggest steelmaker.  The future of Florange shouldn’t depend on a carbon capture
and storage project at the site that is “uncertain,” according
to the statement. If talks with ArcelorMittal’s management fail
to produce a solution, “nothing will be excluded to ensure
lasting industrial activity at the site,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
