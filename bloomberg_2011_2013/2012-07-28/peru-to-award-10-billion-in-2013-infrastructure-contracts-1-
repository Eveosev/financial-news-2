Peru ’s government plans to award
$10 billion in infrastructure contracts for roads, airports and
natural-gas pipelines next year in a bid to make the Andean
nation’s exports more competitive, President  Ollanta Humala 
said.  Private companies will be able to use infrastructure
investments as a tax write-off, Humala said. Projects will
include a second gas conduit linking the coast to production
fields in jungles in Peru’s south, irrigation for 100,000
hectares (247,000 acres) of arable land, and 500 kilometers (300
miles) of roads, he said.  “We’ve launched an aggressive concession program to reduce
the infrastructure deficit,” Humala said yesterday a speech to
the nation’s congress. “The participation of the private sector
in public projects is crucial for the country’s development.”  Peru, which boosted exports fivefold in the past decade on
surging metals prices, posted its biggest trade deficit since
2008 in May as a faltering global recovery curbed demand for
copper and gold. Falling metal prices will trigger a decline in
Peru’s exports this year for the first time since 2009, the
central bank said June 15, and the government increased its
stimulus package by $750 million last month.  Private investment climbed 12 percent in the first half,
while bank lending rose 16 percent and construction expanded 15
percent, Humala said. Mining investment commitments including
projects by  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  total $30 billion
through 2017, he said.  Inflation, which was running at a 4 percent annual rate
through June, will slow to between 1 and 3 percent this year,
the central bank’s target, Humala said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
