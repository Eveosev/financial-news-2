Greece  will start the process of
selling a 25 percent stake in  Opap SA (OPAP) , Europe’s biggest listed
gambling company, to a private investor in early September,
 Proto Thema  said, without citing anyone.  While representatives of Greece’s international creditors
had agreed on an early October start date, the Greek government
decided to bring it earlier so it can be finished before
mid-2013, the Athens-based newspaper said in a preview of an
article to be published in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
