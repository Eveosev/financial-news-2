Alexandr Vinokurov of  Kazakhstan  won
the gold medal in the Olympic men’s road cycling race in London
after breaking away from the lead group with Rigoberto Uran Uran
of Colombia.  Vinokurov, who won silver at the Sydney games in 2000,
outsprinted Uran on the final straight away after the pair spent
the last several kilometers on their own. Uran finished second,
and Alexander Kristoff of Norway got the bronze, winning a
sprint against a group of 22 riders in the chasing group. Taylor
Phinney of the U.S. finished fourth.  The favorite,  Mark Cavendish  of Britain, finished in 29th
place, 40 seconds off the pace. His teammates, Tour de France
champion Bradley Wiggins and runner-up Chris Froome, couldn’t
deliver Cavendish to the front, where he would have been the
favorite in a sprint. He was the 2011 road race world champion.  “I knew we needed to attack because I knew I wouldn’t win
a sprint,” Vinokurov told the British Broadcasting Corp.  Vinokurov, 38, and Uran, 25, broke away in the last 10
kilometers of the 155-mile race that finished near  Buckingham
Palace . The Kazakh darted ahead with some 300 meters left when
Uran turned to look behind him.  Vinokurov’s Astana team pulled out of the 2007  Tour de
France  after the rider tested positive for blood doping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
