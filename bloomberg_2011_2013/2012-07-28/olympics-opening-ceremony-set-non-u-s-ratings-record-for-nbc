NBC’s telecast of the opening
ceremony of the London Olympics drew the largest U.S. audience
in history for the event, the  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  network said.  NBC said in a news release that last night’s ceremony
attracted an average of 40.7 million viewers, topping the
previous record of 39.8 million for the start of the 1996 Games
in Atlanta.  The telecast earned a 21 national rating, the best for a
non-U.S.  Summer Olympics  and the second best for any non-U.S.
Olympics since the Innsbruck  Winter Games  in 1976, which had a
23.2 rating, according to the network.  “This audience number for the London opening ceremony is a
great early sign that our strategy of driving people to watch
NBC in prime time is working,” Mark Lazarus, NBC Sports Group
president, said in the release. “We look forward to the next 16
nights of compelling Olympic competition.”  NBC televised the ceremony in a tape-delayed prime-time
show. Comcast is carrying all sports events from the London
Games live on internet streams and its broadcast and cable TV
outlets.  NBC paid about $1.18 billion for the U.S. television rights
to the London Games.  Brian Roberts , Comcast’s chairman, said
yesterday in an interview with CNBC that  NBC Universal  will
receive about $1.2 billion in total revenue from the Olympics,
moving closer to breaking even on the games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
