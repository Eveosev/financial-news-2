China  is forecast to get more rain
in the next three days, increasing the risk of renewed flooding
as water levels of the Yellow River, the countryâ€™s second-
biggest, rise to the highest in decades, the government said.  Heavy rains will fall in regions stretching from
northwestern Heilongjiang province to northwestern Gansu, and to
southwestern Yunnan from today to July 31, the official National
Meteorological Center said in a statement on its website
yesterday. Torrential rains measuring as much as 120 millimeters
(4.7 inches) may hit some regions, it said.  About 40,000 people in the northern provinces of Shanxi and
Shaanxi have been evacuated as water in the Yellow River, which
runs west-east across northern China, swells to the highest
levels in decades, China Radio International said yesterday.
Rain in Shanxi left six people dead and four missing, according
to Xinhua news agency.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
