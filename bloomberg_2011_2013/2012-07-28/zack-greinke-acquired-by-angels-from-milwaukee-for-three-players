Zack Greinke, the 2009 American
League Cy Young Award winner, has joined the  Los Angeles Angels ,
who sent three players to the  Milwaukee Brewers  in exchange,
Angels General Manager Jerry Dipoto said.  The 28-year-old right-hander is 9-3 with a 3.44 earned run
average in 21 starts for the Brewers this season. Last year, he
was 16-6 for  Milwaukee , with his wins matching his career-high
set with  Kansas City  in 2009 when he tallied 242 strikeouts.  “It should be fun. They are a great team,” Greinke said.
“After the first month of the season, they have been one of the
best teams in baseball. There is a lot of talent there, a lot of
great players. The pitching staff will be pretty incredible.”  The Angels’ pitching rotation also includes All-Stars Jered Weaver and C.J. Wilson, and Dan Haren. The team (55-45) is in
second place, four games behind the  Texas Rangers  in the four-
team American League West division.  “We hope that this move will be not just a short-term
gain, but one that’s good for the organization,” Dipoto said.
“We’re excited to see what kind of a difference he can make.”  Under baseball’s new collective bargaining agreement, the
Angels will not receive draft-pick compensation if Greinke
leaves as a free agent after the season ends.  Greinke owns a career Major League Baseball record of 85-76
with a 3.79 ERA in 259 games over nine seasons.  The Angels sent infielder Jean Segura, and right-handed
pitchers Ariel Pena and Johnny Hellweg to Milwaukee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
