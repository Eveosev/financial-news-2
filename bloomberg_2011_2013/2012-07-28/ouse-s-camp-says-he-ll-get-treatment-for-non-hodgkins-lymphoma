U.S. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman  Dave Camp , a Michigan Republican, said he will begin
chemotherapy treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma that he said
was discovered during a routine annual physical examination.  Camp said in a statement today that he will continue to
represent his constituents and work as chairman of the committee
that develops U.S. tax policy.  “My treatment will take place every three weeks over the
next few months,” Camp said. “My doctors and I expect a full
recovery and cure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
