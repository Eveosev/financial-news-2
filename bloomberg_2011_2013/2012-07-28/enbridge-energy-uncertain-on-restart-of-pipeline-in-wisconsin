Enbridge Energy Partners LP (EEP)  said it
remains uncertain how soon it can restart a pipeline that
released about 1,200 barrels of crude oil in  Wisconsin 
yesterday.  Officials from the Transportation Department’s  Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  are leading an
investigation on site, said Lorraine Little, a spokeswoman for
Enbridge, in a telephone interview. She said it’s “too early”
to estimate when the line will be back in service.  The leak was on Line 14 near Grand Marsh, Wisconsin, about
60 miles north of the state capital of Madison. Enbridge said in
a statement the pipeline has a capacity of 317,600 barrels a
day, and the light crude oil from it goes mainly to Chicago-area
refineries. The line was installed in 1998.  The cause of the leak has yet to be determined, Little
said. She said it’s unlikely the volume of the leak will exceed
the initial estimate of 1,200 barrels.  Enbridge said the oil was contained mostly on the
pipeline’s right-of-way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
