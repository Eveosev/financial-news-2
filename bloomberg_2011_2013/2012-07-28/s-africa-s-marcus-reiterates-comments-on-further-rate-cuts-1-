South African  Reserve Bank  Governor
Gill Marcus said the prospect of a further reduction in  interest
rates  can’t be taken for granted, reiterating comments she made
two days ago.  “There is speculation whether this is the beginning of a
trend,” Marcus said in a speech to the South African National
Editors’ Forum in Durban,  South Africa  yesterday. “We regard
this as the beginning of a cycle, but we cannot take this for
granted.”  The Reserve Bank on July 19 cut its key interest rate by
half a percentage point to 5 percent, the first reduction since
November 2010, after inflation eased into the bank’s 3 percent
to 6 percent target range while the economy faltered. The debt
crisis in  Europe , which buys about a third of South Africa’s
manufactured goods, is threatening the growth outlook, Marcus
said.  On July 27, Marcus said any further easing of South African
monetary policy “is not automatic and will be highly dependent
on global and domestic developments.”  Investors have increased bets Marcus will lower the
benchmark rate again before the end of the year. Yields on
forward-rate agreements due in December dropped 50 basis points,
or 0.5 percentage point, in the past month to 4.75 percent on
July 27 in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
