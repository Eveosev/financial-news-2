Asian currencies fell this week as a
deepening global economic slowdown curbed risk-taking and hurt
demand for the region’s assets.  Taiwan’s dollar had the biggest drop in eight weeks and
Indonesia’s rupiah declined for a third week. Data released July
26 showed South Korea’s second-quarter economic growth was the
least in almost three years, and the Bank of  Thailand  cut its
2012 growth forecast to 5.7 percent from 6 percent a day earlier.
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s currencies, pared losses after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  pledged to preserve the euro.  “Risk-taking appetite has been low this week,”  Albert Lee ,
a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co.,
said yesterday. “Economic slowdown is happening in many
countries, and although there are some hopes for  Europe , you
never know if Draghi’s comments will turn into concrete
actions.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.4 percent to NT$30.10. The
rupiah slid 0.2 percent this week to 9,472 per dollar, show
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s
ringgit slipped 0.1 percent to 3.1548.  India ’s rupee was little
changed at 55.53.  Global funds sold $1.2 billion more Indian, Philippine,
Taiwanese and Thai stocks than they bought this week, according
to exchange data.  China Concern  Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell 1.7 percent from
a year earlier to 467.2 billion  yuan  ($73 billion) in June, a
third month of declines, government data showed yesterday.  Song Guoqing, a central bank adviser, said on July 21 that
growth in the world’s second-biggest economy may slow to 7.4
percent this quarter because of “problems on the export side.”
That would be the slowest pace since the first three months of
2009, according to official figures.  The yuan declined 0.11 percent this week to 6.3807, and
touched 6.3967 on July 25, the weakest level since Sept. 29.  “The current slowdown has undoubtedly inflicted a lot of
pain on the corporate sector,” Yao Wei, a  China  economist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong , said yesterday. Taxes and
wages are squeezing companies “from both ends” and the limited
room private businesses have for expanding is helping push China
“into a state of profitless growth,” Yao said.  Philippine Rate Cut  The  Philippine peso  rallied for a second day after the
central bank unexpectedly cut borrowing costs July 26, boosting
optimism policy makers are stepping up efforts to help the
country weather the global slowdown. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
lowered its overnight rate to a record low of 3.75 percent from
4 percent.  The peso’s weekly loss was pared to 0.1 percent, aided by a
0.5 percent rally yesterday to 41.908. The currency has
strengthened 4.5 percent this year, the biggest gainer among
Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht gained 0.4 percent to 31.52 and
South Korea’s won climbed 0.3 percent this week to 1,138.25.
Vietnam’s dong declined 0.2 percent to 20,880.  To contact the reporters on this story:
