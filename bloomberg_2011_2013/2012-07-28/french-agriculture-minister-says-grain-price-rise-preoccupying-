French Agriculture Minister Stephane
Le Foll said a surge in grain and soy prices is a “major
preoccupation” worldwide.  “The current situation must be watched carefully,” Le
Foll said in an e-mailed statement. He warned against provoking
“speculative” price movements.  The French government has asked that crop forecasts and
market outlooks be monitored at the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization, according to the statement.  If the drought situation worsens in the U.S. and  Russia , a
rapid reaction forum put in place by G-20 countries could
comment or hold a formal meeting, Le Foll said.  Wheat, corn and soybean futures have climbed as dry weather
in the U.S. and Russia reduces global supplies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
