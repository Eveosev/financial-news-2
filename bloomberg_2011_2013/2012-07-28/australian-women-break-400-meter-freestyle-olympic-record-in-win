The Australian women’s 400-meter
freestyle relay team is taking home a gold medal and an Olympic
record from the London games.  The Australians’ time yesterday at the Aquatics Centre of 3
minutes 33.15 seconds, capped by Melanie Schlanger’s final leg
of 52.65, was 0.61 seconds better than the mark set by the
 Netherlands  in Beijing four years ago.  The Dutch took the  silver medal  this year at 3:33.79 and
the U.S. finished in 3:34.24 to win the bronze.  “When I saw we were in the lead when I got in, I just
really put my head down,” said the 25-year-old Schlanger.  Ranomi Kromowidjojo, 21, pressured Schlanger by swimming
her portion in 51.93 seconds, the fastest split in the event’s
history and the first time any woman had gone inside 52 seconds.  Schlanger’s teammates Alicia Coutts, 24, Cate Campbell, 20,
and Brittany Elmslie, 18, embraced on the side of the pool as
the winning red beacon shone.  “I’ve never had so much fun in my life,” Campbell said.
“We’ve all dreamed of standing on the podium singing the
national anthem. It’s beyond incredible.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
