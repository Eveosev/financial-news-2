Greece  shouldn’t get additional
financial aid, according to Michael Meister, the deputy leader
in parliament of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union ,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
reported.  Greece’s problem is its government’s inability to carry out
domestic changes, the newspaper cited Meister as saying in an
interview. While advising against Greece being forced to exit
the euro region, Meister called it “very difficult” to rebuild
the country’s ability to pay its bills, FAS reported in a
preview of an article for tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
