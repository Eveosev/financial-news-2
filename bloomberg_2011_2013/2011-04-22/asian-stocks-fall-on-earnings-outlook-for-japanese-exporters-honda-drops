Most stocks fell in  Asia  as Chinese
shares slipped on speculation the country’s central bank may let
the yuan strengthen to cool inflation.  China ’s currency touched
a 17-year high against the dollar, gold climbed to a record and
shares in  Russia  rose.  Declines by technology and materials stocks were offset by
gains in automakers and industrial shares leaving the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index unchanged at 138.82 even as six stocks retreated
for every five that advanced. The Shanghai Composite Index slid
0.5 percent, while the yuan gained 0.2 percent to 6.5067. Gold
increased to $1,512.47 an ounce, before trading at $1,506.85 at
5:25 p.m. in  London . Russia’s Micex jumped 0.8 percent.  More rapid appreciation of the yuan may be a tool for
curbing prices, Wang Yong, a professor at the People’s Bank of
China’s training center in the city of  Zhengzhou , wrote in a
commentary published in today’s Securities Times newspaper.
Stocks in Asia pared declines after  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , a
Japanese chipmaker, said it will restart operations at a plant
damaged by the quake. Most markets in Europe and the Americas
were closed today for Good Friday.  “It’s a difficult environment for investors to take a
proactive stance right now,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in  Tokyo  at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “There are still a lot of
uncertainties for the global economy.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific gauge advanced 2.2 percent this week.
Samsung Electronics Co. slid 2.6 percent today. The memory-chip
producer said it sued Apple Inc. claiming patent infringement, a
week after the iPhone maker filed a complaint in  U.S. federal
court  alleging the South Korean company copied its products.  Toyota, Honda  Renesas Electronics advanced 1.4 percent after the
chipmaker that supplies  Japan ’s carmakers said it plans to
resume operations at its Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, Honda Motor
Co. and Nissan Motor Co. gained more than 2 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index extended this week’s decline
to 1.3 percent, its worst week in three months. The yuan gained
after the central bank set the currency’s reference rate 0.11
percent stronger at 6.5156 per dollar, the highest level since
July 2005. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.38
percent to 6.3235 per dollar.  Four interest-rate increases and higher bank reserve
requirements have failed so far to curb prices, with the
consumer-price index rising 5.4 percent in March. A stronger
currency makes the country’s exports less competitive.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced 1.4 percent so far
this week. Silver for immediate delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$47.25 an ounce, the highest price since 1980.  Emerging  Europe   Higher precious metals prices lifted OAO Polymetal, a
Russian gold and silver producer, 2.1 percent higher, helping
the biggest advance in the Micex. Benchmark equity indexes in
 Hungary  and the  Czech Republic  declined, snapping three days of
gains.  Japan’s bonds rose, pushing 10-year yields to a four-week
low, after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s government compiled a 4
trillion yen ($49 billion) extra budget that didn’t include new
debt sales. The yield on the 2021 bond fell 1.5 basis points to
1.21 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
