Japan  bought 6,950 metric tons of
food wheat and 31,000 tons of food barley through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.  Of the total wheat, 6,350 tons were from  Canada  and the
remainder was from  Australia , Masafumi Otsuka at the ministryâ€™s
grain-trade division said today by phone in Tokyo.  All barley was from Australia, Otsuka said. The shipments
for the grains must be made by July 31, he said.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
