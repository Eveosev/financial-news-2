Treasuries rose for a second week
as investors speculated that efforts to cut the Federal  budget
deficit  may damp economic growth and awaited a policy statement
next week from the  Federal Reserve .  Ten-year note yields fell to the lowest level in a month
even as  Standard & Poor’s  put the U.S. government on notice that
it risks losing its AAA credit rating. Gains were tempered by
advances in stocks. The U.S. will sell $99 billion in notes in
the coming week, and the  Federal Open Market Committee  opens its
two-day meeting on April 26.  “You are looking at an economy that’s just getting off low
levels,” said David Coard, head of fixed-income trading in New
York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “The market is looking for guidance from the FOMC.
We’re looking for clues as to when the Fed may possibly begin to
change course with respect to monetary policy.”  Two-year note yields dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.66 percent in  New York , from 0.69 percent
on April 15, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 0.75
percent security due in March 2013 rose 7/32, or $2.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 6/32.  Ten-year note yields fell one basis point to 3.40 percent,
from 3.41 percent on April 15.  Treasuries were headed for their first monthly gain since
January, a 0.54 percent return, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch Treasury Master index.  Shortened Week  Volume declined in a shortened week. Treasuries  trading 
closed at 2 p.m. in New York on April 21 and were shut April 22
for the Good Friday holiday under a Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association recommendation. About $980 billion
in  U.S. debt  changed hands this past week, compared with $1.5
trillion in the five days ended April 15, according to Icap Plc,
the world’s largest interdealer broker.  Fed policy makers will leave the target rate for overnight
lending between banks unchanged in the coming week at zero to
0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008, according to
all 80 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Officials, who last met
on March 15, may discuss what path the central bank will take
when its program to purchase $600 billion in Treasuries ends in
June.  “The last time the Fed met it was right after the
catastrophe in  Japan , so there could have been a sense the Fed
held back to see how the markets and economies reacted to those
troubling circumstances,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt
research at FTN in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , referring to Japan’s
record earthquake on March 11. “The Fed may be freer to discuss
their general economic outlook. That will have people tuned to
the FOMC.”  Economic Data  Treasuries gained on Thursday, April 21, as the
Philadelphia Fed’s general economic index tumbled to 18.5 in
April, the lowest level since November, while initial claims for
 unemployment benefits  decreased to 403,000 in the week ended
April 16, Labor Department data showed. Bloomberg surveys
forecast an index reading of 36.9 and a jobless-claim decline to
390,000.  U.S. gross domestic product slowed to a 1.8 percent annual
growth pace in the first quarter, according to the median
forecast of 32 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, down from
3.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.6 percent in the third.
The Commerce Department reports the data on April 28.  Treasury gains were limited this past week as stocks rose
on better-than-estimated corporate earnings reports. The  S&P 500
Index (SPX)  gained 1.3 percent, while the MSCI World Index climbed 1.6
percent, the biggest weekly gain in a month.  The dollar fell against all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts, in part on speculation the Fed will lag behind
other central banks in boosting  interest rates . The  European
Central Bank  raised its key rate on April 7 to 1.25 percent from
a record low 1 percent.  Treasury Auctions  The Treasury Department said it will sell $35 billion in
two-year notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in
seven-year securities at auctions on three consecutive days
beginning April 26. The sizes in the trio of offerings have been
unchanged since October, and matched the average forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of nine of the Fed’s primary dealers.  The five-year auction on April 27 has been  rescheduled  to
11:30 a.m. New York time, before the Fed releases its statement
at 12:30 p.m., followed by a public briefing by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  at 2:15 p.m. under a new system. Bids are usually due
by 1 p.m.  The U.S. sold a record $14 billion of five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities yesterday, drawing a negative
yield for a second straight offering. The yield was negative
0.180 percent, compared with the forecast of negative 0.1825
percent in a survey of 6 primary dealers.  ‘Paying a Premium’  “People are paying a premium to own protection against
inflation,” said James Golden, head of government trading in
New York at Jefferies Group Inc., which as one of the 20 primary
dealers is obligated to bid at U.S. debt auctions.  A bond market measure of inflation expectations the Fed
uses to help determine monetary policy was at 3.06 percentage
points, compared with 2.82 percentage points on March 23. It
reached a 10-month high of 3.28 percentage points in December.
The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate projects what
the pace of consumer price increases may be beginning in 2016.
It averaged 2.78 percentage points over the past five years.  The benchmark 10-year note’s real yield, its yield minus
the year-over-year core consumer price index, was 2.27 percent
yesterday, compared with a 10-year median of 2.14 percent.  Treasuries also advanced this past week on speculation
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may worsen.  Greece ’s fiscal
problems pushed yields on the nation’s two-year notes up to
record highs. The yield climbed April 21 to 23.3 percent, the
highest since before the euro was introduced in 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
