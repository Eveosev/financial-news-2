Turkish bond yields fell to their
lowest in more than two months on bets the central bank will
keep rates on hold. The lira gained as higher reserve
requriements tightened liquidity and stocks were little changed.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt dropped 7 basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.26 percent at 5:00 p.m. close in
Istanbul, the lowest level since Feb. 16. The yield has
retreated for three consecutive weeks, the RBS Istanbul
benchmark bond index showed.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci is trying to slow
economic growth without raising the benchmark interest rate and
drawing in short-term capital. The central bank in Ankara
yesterday said it left its benchmark rate at a record low 6.25
percent while boosting the  reserve requirements  for short-term
lira deposits for the fourth time in six months, reducing money
available for lending.  “Foreign investors are buying bonds because they expect
the lira will appreciate as the central bank reduces
liquidity,” Serhan Yenigun, a trader at Finansbank AS in
Istanbul, said by telephone today. ‘Our expectation is that the
policy rate will stay the same through 2011.’’  The Turkish lira is likely to rise to 1.49 against the
dollar in the first quarter of 2012, according to the median
estimate of 17 banks surveyed by Bloomberg. The benchmark
interest rate will increase to 6.75 percent in the final quarter
of this year, the average forecast of seven economists showed.  ‘Double-Digit Returns’  Foreign investors will have “double-digit returns,”
should the currency appreciate to 1.40-1.45 per dollar and
yields hold at about 8 percent on lira-denominated bonds,
Yenigun said.  Foreign investors’ holdings of Turkish bonds reached a
record high of $43.5 billion in the week ending April 15, after
rising for seven consecutive weeks since Feb. 25, central bank
data showed on April 21.  The lira advanced 0.2 percent to its strongest in one week
at 1.5175 per dollar. The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  gained 0.2
percent to close at 68,691.77, rising for a fourth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
