The Sri Lankan military’s offensive
against the Tamil Tigers in 2008 and 2009 may have killed as
many as 40,000 civilians, the Washington Post reported, citing a
United Nations panel set up by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.  Most of the dead may have been victims of indiscriminate
shelling by Sri Lankan forces, the Post said, citing the
committee.  The panel has recommended setting up an “independent
international mechanism” to probe allegations of  war crimes  by
the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
