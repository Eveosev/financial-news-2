Slovenia’s budget gap will be
larger than previously forecast this year after the government
contributed the bulk of a capital increase for Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d., the country’s biggest lender.  The shortfall will amount to 2.01 billion euros ($2.9
billion), or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product, from a
previous estimate of 4.8 percent, the  statistics office  in
Ljubljana said on its website today. The government’s general
deficit for 2010 was also revised to 5.6 percent from a previous
5.5 percent, the statistics office said.  Slovenia, which like other European Union nations must
bring its budget gap to below 3 percent by 2013 in line with
stability rules, contributed 243 million euros in a capital
increase for loss-making Nova Ljubljanska. The unlisted lender,
in which the state has an indirect majority, needs money to
strengthen its capital before EU stress tests after the worst
slump in two decades caused a surge in its bad-loan provisions.  NLB, as the bank is known, may need more capital after it
raised 250 million euros on March 30, central bank Governor
Marko Kranjec has said. The Ljubljana-based lender had 2.16
billion euros of bad loans last year, or 14.5 percent of all
outstanding loans, the bank said on April 13.  The government aims to cut the budget gap to 4.5 percent
this year and 3.6 percent in 2012, according to Finance Minister
 Franc Krizanic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
