Jim Larranaga , the men’s basketball
coach who led  George Mason University  to the Final Four in 2006,
is leaving to coach the  University of Miami , the Washington Post
reported without citing its source.  George Mason spokeswoman Maureen Nasser didn’t immediately
return calls left on her office and mobile phones. Miami
spokeswoman Margaret Belch wouldn’t confirm the report.  Larranaga, 61, who flew to Miami to meet with school
officials this morning according to the Post, will replace Frank Haith, who left for the  University of Missouri  on April 4.  Miami expressed interest in Harvard University coach Tommy Amaker, who went 23-7 last season and led the school to a share
of its first Ivy League title. He elected to stay at Harvard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
