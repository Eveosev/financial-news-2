Burkina Faso ’s president, Blaise Compaore, appointed himself as defense minister in a new 29-
member Cabinet, a week after he dissolved the government in a
bid to quell an army mutiny.  “The president of Faso, supreme chief of the armies,
assumes the functions of defense minister,” according to a
statement read on  Radio Television du Burkina , the state-owned
broadcaster, in the capital, Ouagadougou, late yesterday.  Compaore on April 18 appointed Luc Adolphe Tiao as prime
minister, replacing Tertius Zongo as part of an effort to stop
protests by soldiers over their  living conditions . The 60-year-
old leader, who has ruled since seizing power in a 1987 coup,
also dismissed the chiefs of staff of the army, air force and
police.  Burkina Faso, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer,
has been in turmoil since February, when five people were killed
during demonstrations against police following the death of a
student in their custody. On March 22, soldiers protested a
court decision sentencing five officers to prison after their
involvement in a dispute with civilians.  Tiao said on April 20 new Cabinet members would be
appointed based on their “competence” to deal with the political
crisis. Only 13 members of the previous Cabinet were retained in
the new administration.  Gold miners including Montreal-based  Semafo Inc. (SMF)  and
London-based  Avocet Mining Plc (AVM)  have operations in Burkina Faso.
Semafo said on April 18 the unrest hasn’t disrupted operations
at its Mana mine, while Avocet said the same on April 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
