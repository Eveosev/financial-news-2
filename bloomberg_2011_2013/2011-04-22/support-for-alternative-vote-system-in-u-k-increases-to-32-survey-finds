Support is growing in the U.K. for
a new election system that would allow voters to rank candidates
in order of preference, a poll showed today.  The Australian-style alternative vote, which will be put to
a referendum on May 5, has the support of 32 percent of likely
voters compared with 34 percent who prefer to keep the current
first-past-the-post system, the  Independent newspaper reported .
The results represent a shift in favor of AV after the “no”
camp had a lead of more than 10 percentage points.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  agreed to hold the referendum
to lure the Liberal Democrats, Britain’s third-largest political
party, into a coalition after no party won enough seats to
govern on its own in last year’s general election. Cameron is
campaigning against the new system while  Nick Clegg , Liberal
Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister, backs its adoption.  Twenty-one percent of people polled said they don’t know
which system they prefer, and 13 percent said they probably
won’t vote. Sixty percent disagreed with the statement that
politicians have done “a good job” at explaining the issue,
and more than half said they don’t understand how the new system
would work.  Under the alternative vote system electors’ second and
further preferences for candidates are taken into account. In
first-past-the-post, the candidate with the most votes is
elected after a single count.  The poll was conducted by research agency TNS, which
surveyed 1,318 adults from April 14-18. The Independent’s report
didn’t give a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
