The U.S. is discussing with  Iraq 
whether some U.S. troops will remain in the country to assist
with security even though no requests for assistance have been
made, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  “We are on schedule to withdraw the remaining U.S. forces
that are in Iraq by the end of the year,” Carney told reporters
traveling with the president aboard Air Force One today. “We
are also in negotiations, discussions with the Iraqis about what
their security needs are and will be in the future.”  Carney said no decisions have been made about what U.S.
troops might remain in the country to assist with security. The
Wall Street Journal reported today that U.S.-Iraqi discussions
about keeping 10,000 American troops in Iraq beyond the
scheduled withdrawal date face difficulties amid concern their
presence may fan unrest.  Iraq is concerned that allowing the U.S. to stay in the
country longer may spark sectarian violence and protests, the
newspaper reported, citing unidentified U.S. officials.  Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said Iraq must decide whether it will request troops
within weeks, Reuters reported.  “We would entertain any request from the Iraqi government
for cooperation or assistance,” Carney said. “We’re obviously
in discussions with Iraq about its future writ large.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
