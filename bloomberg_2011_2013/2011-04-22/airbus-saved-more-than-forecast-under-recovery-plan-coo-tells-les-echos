Airbus SAS made bigger savings than
forecast under its ‘Power 8’ recovery plan,  Les Echos  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Operating Officer Fabrice
Bregier.  The planemaker has booked 2.5 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in
net savings, compared with the planned 2.2 billion euros, and has
10 billion euros of extra cash, against the 5 billion euros
forecast, Bregier said, according to the newspaper.  The company has cut 7,900 jobs out of the 10,000 originally
planned, Les Echos cited Bregier as saying,  The recovery plan “has allowed us to remain competitive,
in spite of a euro that has gone from $1.08 in 2006 to $1.30-
1.40 today,” Bregier told Les Echos. “That 30 centime drop in
the dollar cost us about 3 billion euros in operating profit.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
