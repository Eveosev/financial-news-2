IHS ISuppli cut its forecast for
iPad shipments this year by 9 percent after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  failed to
meet demand in the first quarter.  The electronics maker will probably ship 39.7 million iPad
tablet computers this year, according to ISuppli, which made an
estimate of 43.7 million in February. A shortfall in iPad 2
production during the first three months of 2011 prompted the
cut, the El Segundo, California-based research company said
today in a statement.  Apple, the largest technology company by market value,
probably faced issues including quality concerns over liquid-
crystal displays and shortages of speakers, which disrupted
supply of the tablets, ISuppli said.  Problems during the quarter weren’t related to the record
March 11 earthquake that struck Japan, while quake-related
component constraints may limit Apple’s production in the second
half, the researcher said.  Cupertino, California-based Apple appears to have moved
more aggressively than peers to secure components after  Japan ’s
earthquake, leaving many competitors scrambling for needed
components such as touch screens, ISuppli said.  Apple will likely maintain its dominance in the tablet
market until 2012 because of advantages in marketing, content
and pricing, the researcher said. Shipments of other media
tablets will likely reach 111 million units in 2013, overtaking
the estimated 81 million iPad sales, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
