Turkey  won’t be hosting a Formula
One grand prix next year after a request by Chief Executive
 Bernie Ecclestone  to double race fees was rejected, Haberturk
said.  The government said the $26 million payment sought by
Ecclestone to keep the race in Istanbul was too high, the
newspaper reported. The current cost is $13 million, it said.  “Formula One says goodbye to Istanbul,” the headline in
Haberturk read.   Eccelestone is increasing the fee to levels that Turkey
won’t accept because he wants to host a race in Moscow in 2012
instead, the newspaper reported.  “It looks like the Formula One race won’t be held in
Istanbul next year,” said Murat Yalcintas, head of the city’s
chamber of commerce, according to Haberturk.    Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
