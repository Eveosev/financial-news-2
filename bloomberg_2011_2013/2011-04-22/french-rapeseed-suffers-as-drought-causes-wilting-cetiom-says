French rapeseed crops in the
northeast of the country are suffering from a drought that is
causing plants in some fields to wilt, the country’s technical
center for oilseed crops said.  A lack of rain is reducing the yield potential for the
oilseed crop, the Paris-based center, known as Cetiom, said in a
 report  on its website today.  Rapeseed for August delivery rose 5 percent on NYSE Liffe
in Paris this week, the biggest weekly gain since the contract
started trading in February 2010, amid concern dry weather in
 France  will affect production. Northeast France accounts for
about 60 percent of the country’s rapeseed production.  “Numerous” areas have flowering difficulties related to
water stress from a lack of moisture or poor rooting, damage to
buds from freezing in March and a lack of supply of crop
nutrients nitrogen and sulfur, Cetiom said.  Farmers shouldn’t plow over their rapeseed fields to plant
spring crops such as corn or sunflowers because doing so is
“rarely profitable,” while the replacement crops will need a
return of rains to sprout, the center said.  “The return of the rains, provided it doesn’t come too
late, will allow the plants to compensate, even if the yield
potential is diminished,” Cetiom said.  French rapeseed production is forecast to rise to 4.9
million metric tons this year from 4.8 million tons in 2010,
according to European farmers’ organization Copa-Cogeca. The
organization estimated the sunflower crop would be 1.7 million
tons, little changed from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
