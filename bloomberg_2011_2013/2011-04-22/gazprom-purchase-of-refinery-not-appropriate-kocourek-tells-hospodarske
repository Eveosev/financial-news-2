Gazprom OAO (GAZP) ’s possible purchase of
a stake in Ceska Rafinerska AS, a Czech-based refinery, would
not be “appropriate at this time,” Czech Industry and Trade
Minister Martin Kocourek told  Hospodarske Noviny  in an
interview.  Still, it is necessary to wait for “clear” signals that
the purchase may happen before evaluating possible impacts of
the Russian investor entering the company, Kocourek told the
newspaper.  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s biggest oil company, may be in talks to
sell its 32.5 percent stake in Ceska Rafinerska to Gazprom.
Ceska Rafinerska is controlled by Poland’s Unipetrol AS.  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  also holds a stake in the refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
