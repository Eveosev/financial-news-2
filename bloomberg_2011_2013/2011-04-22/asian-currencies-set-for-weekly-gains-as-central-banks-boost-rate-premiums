Asian currencies strengthened this
week, with  Singapore ’s dollar reaching a record and Malaysia’s
ringgit a 13-year high, on speculation regional central banks
will keep raising borrowing costs to curb inflation.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar index rose to its
highest level since 1997 as overseas investors bought a combined
$1.7 billion more stocks than they sold in  India ,  South Korea ,
Taiwan and Thailand this week, according to exchange data. The
Bank of Thailand lifted  interest rates  on April 20 for the sixth
time in less than a year, and signaled more tightening is likely.
Malaysia reported the same day that consumer prices rose 3
percent in March from a year earlier, the most since April 2009.  “Inflation pressure raises the possibility of a rate
increase next month, which supports the ringgit,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, foreign-exchange strategist at Kuala Lumpur-
based CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “U.S. dollar funding costs are
still low, and investors are going long Asian currencies.”  Singapore’s dollar gained 1 percent for the week to
S$1.2333 against its U.S. counterpart and touched S$1.2329, the
strongest level since at least 1981. The ringgit rose 0.6
percent to 3.0045 in  Kuala Lumpur  and reached 3.0034, the
highest level since October 1997.  Asian currencies also gained after rising earnings at
companies including Apple Inc. boosted confidence in the global
economic recovery and U.S. spending.  Apple, the maker of the iPhone, said this week that second-
quarter profit almost doubled. Of the 76 companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that posted earnings since April 11,
75 percent have beaten analyst estimates for per-share profit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Intervention Concern  The won slipped 0.1 percent yesterday to 1,080.80 per
dollar on speculation the central bank would intervene to curb
appreciation. Gains halted at 1,078.30 on April 21, matching the
highs set on Sept. 8, 2008, and Aug. 28, 2008, creating
resistance for the local currency, or a level at which sell
orders are clustered. For the week, the won appreciated 0.8
percent.  “The won benefitted this week mainly as improved earnings
and the global economic outlook boosted investment into higher-
risk assets,” said Byeon Ji Young, a currency analyst at Woori
Futures Co. in  Seoul . “Concerns that authorities may step in to
curb the won’s appreciation are limiting further gains.”  Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said yesterday the
government will step up monitoring of financial markets as
global capital flows into South Korea may see more volatility
with U.S. quantitative easing nearing an end. Yoon also said an
increase in short-term external debt at some financial companies
led to a probe into foreign-exchange derivatives trading.  Yuan Appreciation  China’s yuan climbed to the highest level since 2007 on
speculation the central bank will allow faster currency gains to
help temper inflation.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 6.5067 per dollar
in the spot market yesterday and touched a 17-year high of
6.5067, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade System.  More rapid appreciation may be a tool for curbing prices,
Wang Yong, a professor at the People’s Bank of China’s training
center in the city of  Zhengzhou , wrote in a commentary published
in yesterday’s Securities Times newspaper. The central bank set
the yuan’s reference rate 0.11 percent stronger at 6.5156 per
dollar, the highest level since July 2005.  “The frequent record highs in the reference rate are
pushing up appreciation bets in the offshore market,” said  Liu Dongliang , a Shenzhen-based senior analyst at China Merchants
Bank Co., the country’s sixth-largest lender by market value.
“There won’t be any one-off move in the foreseeable future,
especially when the trade surplus narrows.”  Record Export Orders  Taiwan ’s dollar rose to the strongest level in more than
two months after the government reported April 20 export orders
climbed 13.4 percent to a record $38.9 billion in March as a
drop in shipments to  Japan  was compensated for by increases to
the U.S. and China.  “The export orders figures showed Taiwan’s exports remain
competitive,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The appreciating
trend will probably continue next week, and the currency may
test the NT$28.7 level.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.4 percent this week to
NT$28.930, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched
NT$28.860 yesterday, the strongest level since Feb. 10.  Elsewhere,  Indonesia ’s rupiah gained 0.5 percent this week
to 8,623 per dollar and  Thailand ’s baht strengthened 0.7 percent
to 29.94. India’s rupee and the Philippine peso were little
changed at 44.3675 and 43.285.  To contact the reporter on this story:
