Wolfgang Franz, head of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers,
estimates that 100,000 workers from eastern  Europe  will come to
Germany after the country’s job market opens up in May,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing an interview with Franz.  While pressure on wages stemming from the influx of eastern
European workers is unlikely, some industries, companies and
regions may be affected, the magazine cited Franz as saying in a
preview of an article that will run tomorrow.  Germany and Austria will open their labor markets for
workers from 10 eastern European countries on May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
