China ’s top energy industry
regulator raised its forecast for the nation’s electricity
demand in 2011 because of faster-than-estimated economic growth.  The country’s power use may increase as much as 12 percent
to 4.69 trillion kilowatt-hours this year following a “good
start” in economic expansion, the National Energy
Administration said in a statement today. That compares with the
9 percent growth forecast made by the agency in January.  China’s economy  expanded 9.7 percent in the first quarter,
boosting its demand for energy and raw materials. The country’s
power use grew by 15 percent to a seven-month high in March as
industrial output rose more than expected, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics said on April 15.  China’s electricity use may climb 11 percent to 2.2
trillion kilowatt-hours in the first half, the National Energy
Administration said today.  The country may add 30 gigawatts of power capacity between
January and June, and 80 gigawatts for this year, it said.  China’s apparent fuel demand may rise 9 percent to 130
million tons in the first half and gain 8 percent to 265 million
tons this year, it said. Natural gas output for the full year
may jump 7.5 percent to 104 billion cubic meters, the agency
said.  The nation spent 24.3 billion yuan on nuclear and wind
power projects in the first quarter, it said. Its wind-power
generation gained 60 percent to 18.8 billion kilowatt-hours and
nuclear electricity output rose by 17 percent to 20.6 billion
kilowatt-hours in the first three months of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
