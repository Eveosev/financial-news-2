German consumers will have to pay
33 billion euros ($48 billion) more for energy if the country
makes a full exit from nuclear power by 2018,  Welt am Sonntag 
reported, citing a study by r2b energy consulting GmbH.  That would increase a typical householdâ€™s energy costs by
137 euros to 977 euros per year, the newspaper reported in a
preview of a story that will be published on April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
