Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped
this week by the most in five months as banks refrained from
purchasing debt on concern the government will further tighten
monetary policy to combat surging inflation. The dong gained.  The government is due to report consumer prices as early as
tomorrow. Inflation accelerated to 13.89 percent in March from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since February 2009. Bond yields
are set to keep rising, Luu Hai Yen, an analyst from Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co., wrote in a research report today.
The government aims to keep prices from rising more than 7
percent this year.  “The consumer prices index this month is expected to
remain high and we expect more monetary tightening to be
introduced right after the release of the inflation data,” said
Hanoi-based Yen. “Transactions in the  bond market  are almost
frozen.”  Yields rose 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage point, for
the week to 12.33 percent, according to a daily fixing price
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest increase
since the period ended Nov. 12.  The dong gained 0.06 percent to 20,913 per dollar as of
2:19 p.m. in Hanoi, and was up by the same margin from a week
ago, Bloomberg data show.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,718, compared with 20,723 yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
