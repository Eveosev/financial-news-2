Japan’s stocks rose for a third
day, erasing earlier losses, as exporters climbed after the yen
fell from a three-week high. Carmakers gained after a key
supplier said it will restart a plant damaged in last month’s
earthquake.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan’s top three carmakers, gained at least 2.1 percent.
 Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , a chipmaker that has 30 percent of
the world market for microcontrollers used in cars, surged as
much as 6.2 percent after saying it will restart a damaged
factory ahead of schedule.  Yaskawa Electric Corp. (6506)  jumped 7.3
percent after Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its investment
rating on the motor maker.  “Renesas’ production restart is good news for the
market,” said  Tsutomu Yamada , a market analyst at Kabu.com
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’s good for semiconductors and also
for carmakers. Investors are looking forward to the supply chain
getting back to normal.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 0.3 percent to 9,709.52
as of 2:16 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its fourth weekly gain in
five as Japan’s stock market rebounds from losses in the wake of
last month’s disaster. The broader Topix advanced 0.2 percent to
843.59. Stock markets in  Australia ,  New Zealand ,  Hong Kong  and
 Singapore  are closed today for a holiday.  Renesas’ Factory  The Topix declined 9.6 percent through yesterday after a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11 devastated
Japan’s northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant, and
disrupted supply chains at companies from Toyota to Renesas. In
the same period the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 3.3
percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.9 percent.  Renesas gained 1.3 percent to 717 yen after saying it plans
to restart operations at a quake-halted plant in northern  Japan .
Shares reversed earlier losses and rose as much as 6.2 percent
after the announcement.  Carmakers had the biggest advance among the Topix’s 33
industry groups, rebounding after declines during the morning
trading session. Toyota gained 3 percent to 3,290 yen. Honda
rose 2.1 percent to 3,140 yen, while Nissan increased 3.5
percent to 772 yen.  Retailers dropped after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  proposed a
4-trillion yen ($49 billion) reconstruction budget that may
entail a higher consumption tax. Economic and Fiscal Policy
Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said this week that reconstruction
“must” be backed by higher levies.  Retailers Slump  Seven & I Holdings Co., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-
store brand, slid 1.1 percent to 2,016 yen, while Yamada Denki
Co., an electronics retailer, slumped 1.7 percent to 5,330 yen.  Exporters also gained after the yen weakened. Japan’s
currency depreciated to 81.88 as of 2:14 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
weakening from 81.67 earlier. Against the euro, the currency
fell to 119.33 from 118.83, boosting the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Yaskawa Electric jumped 7.3 percent to 926 yen, the most in
the Nikkei 225, after Credit Suisse Group AG boosted the
company’s investment rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”
Yaskawa secured alternative part supplies faster than expected
after the earthquakes, Credit Suisse analyst Shinji Kuroda said
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
