Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  said it will pay the
Guinea government $700 million under a mining settlement in a
bid to start iron ore shipments by mid-2015.  The Simandou project in the west African nation will
require more than $10 billion of investment,  Sam Walsh , chief
executive officer of Rio’s iron-ore unit, said in a  statement 
yesterday. The terms of the agreement won’t be affected by
current or future mining reviews by the Guinea government,
according to the statement.  Rio, the world’s second-largest mining company by sales,
has said the project will demand tens of thousands of workers
and will create 4,000 full-time jobs when production starts. The
settlement between the London-based company and Guinea comes
after President  Alpha Conde  ordered a drafting policy giving the
country at least a one-third stake in mining projects.  The agreement “gives us the certainty we need to allow us
to invest and move forward quickly,” Walsh said in the
statement. The Guinea government has the right to as much as 35
percent of the project, Rio said.  Rio has been involved in a dispute with Guinea since 2008,
when the government ordered it to hand over part of the Simandou
venture, a stake later acquired by rival Vale SA of  Brazil . Rio
said last month it had already spent $700 million on the
project.  Rio runs the Simandou project through the company’s Simfer
SA subsidiary. Rio has agreed to sell a 44.65 percent stake in
Simfer to Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., or Chinalco, as the
state-owned company is known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
