Gold advanced for a third week as a
weaker dollar and debt concerns boosted the metal’s appeal as an
alternative investment. Silver gained to the highest level in 31
years.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 1.4 percent this week and
was little changed at $1,506.85 an ounce at 6:48 p.m. in Paris
after climbing to an all-time high of $1,512.47 earlier today.
June-delivery futures touched a record $1,509.60 yesterday on
the Comex in  New York , the 10th all-time high this month. The
exchange is closed today for the Good Friday holiday.  “The weak dollar is having the most influence on gold at
the moment,” said Chae Un Soo, a Seoul-based trader at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. “The market is getting more jittery
now that we have sovereign-debt concerns about the U.S. in
addition to Europe and the Middle East problems, which
increasingly boosts safe-haven demand for gold.”  The dollar slid to the lowest level since August 2008
against a basket of six major currencies this week on
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be slow to raise
borrowing costs. The Dollar Index is little changed today and is
set for a 0.9 percent weekly drop. The Fed has kept the
benchmark rate between zero percent and 0.25 percent since
December 2008 and pledged to purchase $600 billion in Treasuries
through June to stimulate the economy.  Standard & Poor’s this week cut its debt outlook for the
U.S. to negative from stable. Violence in the Middle East,
sovereign-debt turmoil in  Europe  and  Japan ’s nuclear crisis have
helped propel bullion 31 percent higher in the past year.  “Overall trade for gold and other precious metals was
extremely thin due to the market holiday in the U.S. and U.K.,”
said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at IDO
Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed 2.1 percent to $47.25
an ounce, the highest price since 1980. The metal has climbed 11
percent this week, a fifth weekly advance and the biggest weekly
gain since Feb. 18.  Spot palladium fell 0.1 percent to $767.50 an ounce, while
cash platinum was 0.3 percent higher at $1,822.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
