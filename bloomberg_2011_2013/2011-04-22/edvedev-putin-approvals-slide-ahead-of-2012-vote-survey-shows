The approval ratings of Russian
President  Dmitry Medvedev  and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  fell
to near historical lows this month, according to an opinion poll
conducted less than a year before 2012 presidential elections.  Medvedev’s approval dropped to 46 percent from 47 percent
in March and Putin’s rating declined to 53 percent from 55
percent, the Public Opinion Foundation said in a report
published on its  website  yesterday. The pollster surveyed 3,000
Russians April 16-17. No margin of error was given.  The ruling  United Russia  party, which has a two-thirds
majority in the State Duma after receiving about 64 percent of
the vote in 2007 elections, saw its rating fall to 43 percent
from 44 percent a month earlier, the survey showed. The next
nationwide parliamentary poll is due in December, three months
before the presidential election.  Putin, a 58-year-old former KGB officer, handed over the
presidency to his 45-year-old protege, Medvedev, in 2008,
because of a constitutional ban on serving more than two
consecutive terms. Putin, who has remained at the center of
power as prime minister, hasn’t ruled out standing for election
as president. This would potentially give him almost a quarter
century in power under new, six-year presidential mandates.  Medvedev, a lawyer from Putin’s hometown of  St. Petersburg ,
said April 12 he is nearing a decision on whether to seek re-
election, and a day later Putin said it was too early to decide
which of them will run in the vote.  The president’s rating stood at 62 percent in January 2010
and the prime minister’s at 71 percent in the third quarter of
2009, according to Public Opinion Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
