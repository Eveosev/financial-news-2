Ed Miliband , leader of the U.K.
opposition  Labour Party , will have an operation on his nose to
improve his voice, the  Daily Mirror  reported, citing
unidentified people in the party.  He will have the adenoids, the fleshy tissue behind the
nose, removed during Parliament’s summer break to make him sound
less “bunged up,” the newspaper said. The surgery is usually
performed under general anesthetic and requires about a week to
recover from, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
