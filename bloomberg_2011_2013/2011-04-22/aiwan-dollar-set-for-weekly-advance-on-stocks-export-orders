Taiwan ’s dollar rose this week and
reached a two-month high after overseas investors poured funds
into local stocks on optimism the island’s economic growth
remains intact after Japan’s earthquake.  Global funds bought $858 million more shares than they sold
this week, bringing net purchases for the month to $2.3 billion,
exchange data show. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said April
20 export orders climbed 13.4 percent to a record $38.9 billion
in March as a drop in shipments to Japan was compensated for by
increases to the U.S. and China.  “The export orders figures showed Taiwan’s exports remain
competitive,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The appreciating
trend will probably continue next week, and the currency may
test the NT$28.7 level.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.4 percent this week to
NT$28.930 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was little changed
today and touched NT$28.860, the strongest level since Feb. 10.  Government bonds  were little changed this week. The yield
on the 1 percent note due January 2016, the most-active
government security, was 1.076 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
