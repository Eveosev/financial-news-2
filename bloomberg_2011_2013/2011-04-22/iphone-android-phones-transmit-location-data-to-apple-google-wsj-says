Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android smartphones transmit location data from the
handsets back to the companies, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing documents seen by the newspaper.  Apple “intermittently” collects information about iPhone
users’ whereabouts, transmitting the data back to itself every
12 hours, the Journal reported, citing a letter it said the
company sent to U.S. lawmakers last year.  Google’s Android phones send location data to the company
several times an hour as well as information about local Wi-Fi
networks and a code identifying the particular handset,
according to the report. Google declined to comment, the Journal
said.  Apple and Google may be using the data to study how to
start providing location-based services, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
