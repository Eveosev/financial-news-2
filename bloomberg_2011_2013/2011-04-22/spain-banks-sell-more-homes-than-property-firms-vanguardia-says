Spain ’s largest banks sold three
times as many properties as the biggest real-estate companies
did in 2010, La  Vanguardia  reported, citing data from the market
regulator and the companies.  The country’s 11 largest lenders, which hold real estate as
a result of debt swaps and foreclosures, sold 20,453 properties
last year, compared with the 5,904 properties sold by the eight
largest property developers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
