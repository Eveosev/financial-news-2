China ’s Jilin province, the top
corn-growing region, has good soil moisture and farmers should
take advantage of the conditions and quicken planting, the local
weather forecaster said.  Moisture readings averaged 60 percent to 90 percent across
the region after rains earlier this week, the Jilin
Meteorological Administration said in a report on its website.
The condition is enough for corn seedlings to emerge, it said.  More rain is forecast for Jilin today and tomorrow, the
forecaster said separately. Farmers in the province completed
about 80 percent of rice planting, the report said.  Jilin is located in China’s northeastern cornbelt, which
accounted for 39 percent of China’s corn output last year,
according to the China National Grain & Oils Information Center.  --William Bi. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jarrett Banks  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
