Ivory Coast ’s president,  Alassane Ouattara , has begun negotiations with militias that backed his
ousted rival,  Laurent Gbagbo , and still control parts of
Abidjan, the defense ministry said.  Pro-Gbagbo militias still control some parts of Yopougon, a
Gbagbo stronghold in the commercial capital, where clashes took
place April 19-20.  “We have asked them to lay down arms, so as to end the
clashes,” Allah Kouakou, spokesman for the defense ministry,
said by phone.  Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer, is attempting
to restore calm to the city following the April 11 capture of
Gbagbo by Ouattara’s fighters. The ex-leader had refused to cede
power to Ouattara after losing a November election, sparking a
civil war that ended with a 10-day siege of the city and his
arrest on April 11.  Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres said in a statement
yesterday that its doctors had treated 32 people for wounds in
the general hospital in Yopougon. On April 20, 14 of the 20
patients treated there for violent trauma had bullet wounds, it
said. Staff at the MSF-supported Abobo Sud Hospital treated 60
injured patients that day, 12 of them with gunshot wounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
