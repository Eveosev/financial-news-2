Arnold Schwarzenegger , who ended
his term as governor of California in January, may run for the
presidency of the European Union, the  Daily Mirror  reported,
citing an advisor to the Austrian-born former actor.  The EU is “looking for a much more high-profile
president,” the Mirror cites Terry Tamminen as saying, after
current head of the 27-nation bloc  Herman Van Rompuy  steps down.  Van Rompuy was named the first leader of the EU in November
2009. The role has a 2 1/2 year-term, renewable once.  To contact the reporter on this story:
