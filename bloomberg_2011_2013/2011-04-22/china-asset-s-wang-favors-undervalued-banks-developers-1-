Chinese banks and developers are
“undervalued” and may extend gains as the government contains
inflation, said Wang Yawei, who manages the flagship fund of
 China ’s biggest mutual fund company.  The nation’s equities, the best-performing major Asian
stock market this year, may post “small gains” in the second
quarter as the outlook for earnings remains “positive,” Wang
said in a quarterly report. “The short-term inflationary
factors will be effectively offset by the government’s
tightening measures and stay under control.”  China AMC Large-Cap Select Fund (CHAMCLC) , the $1.2 billion fund of
China Asset Management Co., has beaten 97 percent of rivals over
the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of financial companies including banks and
developers in the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  has rebounded 8.5 percent this
year, the second-most among the 10 industry groups. Lenders
rallied as higher borrowing costs boosted their net-interest
margins, spurring record annual profits for the four-biggest
banks. The gauge plunged 27 percent in 2010 as the central bank
started tightening monetary policy to tame inflation that
accelerated at the fastest pace since 2008 last month. The
measure trades at 10.6 times estimated earnings, compared with a
four-year average of 17.7 times, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Property shares have a chance to see a fairly big rise
after sufficient corrections and on condition the government
softens its tightening measures in the real estate industry,”
Wang said.  Wang Holdings  Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Co., which sells and leases real
estate properties, was Wang’s biggest holding as of March 31,
according to the fund’s quarterly report. The stock jumped 3.2
percent to 25.97 yuan today in  Shanghai , paring this year’s drop
to 7.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.5 percent
to 3,010.52 today.  Bank of Communications Co., Wang’s fourth-biggest holding,
slid 0.8 percent to 5.94 yuan. The bank trades at 7.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with 14 times for the benchmark
Shanghai Composite.  The China AMC Large-Cap Fund returned 24 percent in 2010,
after a 116 percent jump the previous year. In 2008, the fund
fell 36 percent as the index plunged 65 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
