Jim Larranaga , the men’s basketball
coach who led  George Mason University  to the Final Four in 2006,
is leaving to coach the  University of Miami .  In 14 seasons at the Fairfax, Virginia, school, Larranaga
led the Patriots to three Colonial Athletic Association
championships, five National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament appearances and a 273-164 overall record.  The team’s defeats of Michigan State,  North Carolina ,
Wichita State and  Connecticut  in the 2006 men’s basketball
tournament earned the school national attention and put
Larranaga on a short-list of top coaching candidates.  “Coach Larranaga is the real deal,”  University of Miami 
President Donna E. Shalala said in a press release. “He’s a
winner, an inspirational leader, and he cares deeply about his
players and staff.”  Larranaga, 61, will replace Frank Haith, who left April 4
to coach the men’s basketball team at the  University of Missouri .  George Mason went 27-7 this season, tying the 2006 school
record for victories, and earned an at-large berth in the NCAA
tournament. It rallied from a double-digit deficit to beat
Villanova 61-57 before falling to top-seeded Ohio State, 98-66.  Miami initially expressed interest in Harvard University
coach Tommy Amaker, who went 23-7 last season and led the school
to a share of its first Ivy League title. He elected to stay at
Harvard.  Terms of Larranaga’s contract were not released. The
Washington Post reported that he received a contract extension
from George Mason in the spring of 2008 that increased his base
salary to $525,000. This past season, his incentives boosted his
pay to $700,000.  Larranaga inherits a Hurricanes squad that returns four
starters including the top three scorers from a team that went
21-15 and advanced to the quarterfinals of the National
Invitation Tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
