Telekom Srbija AD, Serbia’s
national phone company, said its net income last year rose 1.5
percent to a record 15.8 billion dinar ($228.5 million) on
rising revenue from internet and multimedia services.  The Belgrade-based company said its mobile phone unit MT:S
“kept its leading position on the market” with 5.5 million
users, while the number of clients for its ADSL internet service
rose 53.1 percent to 416,000. The number of customers for its
Open IPTV offer tripled to 82,000, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Telekom Srbija reduced debt by 8.3 billion dinar to 55.1
billion dinars, while 2010 revenue totaled 88.5 billion dinar.  The company is also the majority owner of  Telekom Srpske 
in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina and  M:Tel  in Montenegro. It
said that consolidated sales rose 3.9 percent to 117.4 billion
dinar last year, while net income for the whole group reached 17
billion dinar, 27.6 percent more than in 2009.  Telekom Austria AG has offered as much as 950 million euros
in cash and 450 million euros in investments over three years to
buy a 51 percent stake in the Serbian company from the state.
The government gave Telekom Austria until May 3 to work on its
offer before deciding whether to reject or accept it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
