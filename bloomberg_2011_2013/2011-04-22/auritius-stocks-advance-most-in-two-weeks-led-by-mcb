Mauritian stocks advanced the most
in two weeks, led by the Mauritius Commercial Bank, the Indian
Ocean islandâ€™s biggest lender by market value.  The 37-member SEMDEX index climbed for a second day, adding
0.6 percent to 2,061.6 points by 12 p.m. in Port- Louis, the
biggest gain on a closing basis since April 8.  MCB, which accounts for about 24 percent of the benchmark
index, increased 1.1 percent or two rupees to 178 rupees. A
close at this price will be its highest in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
