Asian stocks rose for the fourth

global growth.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the largest seller of home

gas explorer, jumped 3.4 percent after commodity prices rose.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2.2 percent to 138.83

and Japan.  “U.S. companies, especially tech stocks, are doing well,
and that’s helping to instill confidence,” said Mitsushige
Akino, who oversees about $600 million in assets in  Tokyo  at

“Earnings are going to continue to surprise on the plus side.”  U.S. companies reported higher-than-expected earnings and
forecasts, fueling optimism the world’s largest economy is
