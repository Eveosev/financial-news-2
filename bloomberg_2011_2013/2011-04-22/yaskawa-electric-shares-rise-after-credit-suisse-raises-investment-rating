Yaskawa Electric Corp. (6506) ,  Japan ’s
first maker of industrial robots, climbed the most in more than
a month in Tokyo trading after Credit Suisse Group AG raised the
stock’s investment rating.  Yaskawa gained 5.9 percent to 914 yen as of 11:00 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest increase since
March 16 and the highest since April 8. The benchmark Topix
index fell 0.7 percent.  The Kitakyushu-based company has made strong progress in
switching replacement parts and suppliers after last month’s
earthquake, said Shinji Kuroda, a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit
Suisse, who raised his rating on the Yaskawa to "outperform’’
from “neutral” yesterday.  “Yaskawa seems to have more orders than I expected even
after the earthquake,” Kuroda said by telephone. Yaskawa
postponed its fiscal year 2011’s net income forecast on March 20
because of the earthquake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
