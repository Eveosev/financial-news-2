Graffiti artist Banksy’s depiction
of two policemen kissing will be auctioned in  New York , the
 Guardian reported , citing the owner of the Brighton pub where it
was first painted.  The original graffiti was transferred onto canvas in 2008
and replaced with a facsimile on the outdoor wall of the
building in the English seaside town, the newspaper said. The
work may fetch up to 1 million pounds ($1.6 million), the
proceeds of which will go to the pub, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
