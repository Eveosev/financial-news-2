Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
will probably rule out a plan to tax sugar exports to spur more
ethanol production and lower prices, O Estado de S. Paulo
reported, citing an unidentified government official.   Rousseff is likely to discard the idea next month after
receiving criticism from groups including Unica, the Brazilian
Sugar Cane Industry Association, the newspaper said. A levy on
sugar exports could end up making  Brazil  less competitive, O
Estado said.  Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi said the government is
studying other ways to contain ethanol prices, according to O
Estado.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
