Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said that he decreed a law to transfer oil revenue directly to
an off-budget development fund known as Fonden when
international oil prices are above $70 a barrel, El Universal
reported.   The law stipulates that the percentage of oil revenue
transferred to Fonden will rise incrementally along with the
price of crude with the maximum transfers when oil is above $100
a barrel, Chavez said, according to El Universal.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
