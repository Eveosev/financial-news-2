Spain ’s borrowing costs surged at
its first auction since becoming the fourth euro member to seek
a bailout, with the Treasury paying the most for at least eight
years to sell debt for one year.  The Treasury sold 2.4 billion euros ($3 billion) of 12-
month bills at an average rate of 5.074 percent, 2.1 percentage
points more than the 2.985 percent paid on May 14. It also sold
639.3 million euros of 18-month debt at 5.107 percent, compared
with 3.302 percent last month, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain
said today.  The euro area’s fourth-largest economy, which is due to
sell 2 billion euros of bonds on June 21, is urging European
authorities to act so it doesn’t lose access to financial
markets. Its bonds have dropped to euro-era lows since
requesting as much as 100 billion euros of aid to shore up its
banks on June 9.  “The market is getting towards a distressed situation,”
 Harvinder Sian , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in  London . “There will be nerves ahead of the bond
auction and we would expect to see most of it absorbed by the
domestics.”  ECB Call  The Treasury aims to sell bonds maturing in 2014, 2015 and
2017 on June 21. Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro yesterday
called on the  European Central Bank  to prop up the nation’s bond
market as 10-year borrowing costs surged to more than 7 percent
for the first time since the creation of the euro. That yield
traded at 7.057 percent at 2 p.m. in Madrid, down from 7.105
percent before the sale and 7.158 percent yesterday.  Spanish banks hold 29 percent of the nation’s outstanding
debt, up from 17 percent at the end of last year. Non-residents
hold 37 percent, down from 50 percent at the end of 2011,
 Treasury  data show.  Demand at the auction today for the 12-month securities was
2.16 times the amount sold, compared with 1.84 times last month.
The ratio on the 18-month debt rose to 4.42 times from 3.23.  The Treasury sold a total of 3.04 billion euros of the
securities, just more than the 3 billion-euro maximum set for
the auction. The debt agency has sold 58.8 percent of the 86
billion euros of medium- and long-term debt it plans to issue
this year, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
after the auction.  Bank Audit  Investors are concerned the nation may need further
European aid as it has struggled to clean up lenders for three
years. At the same time, the government needs to curb the euro
area’s  third-largest budget deficit  just as the economy is mired
in its second recession since 2009.  As part of efforts to restore confidence, Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s government, in power since December, has
commissioned an independent stress test of banks to help it
determine how much of the 100 billion-euro European loan it will
need to tap. The reports are due on June 21.  In a second test, four auditors will carry out a detailed
assessment of lenders’ books. Those reports, initially due at
the end of July, won’t be published until September, a person
familiar with the plans said today. An official at the Economy
Ministry, who asked not to be named, declined to comment on the
timetable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
