China   Development Bank  Corp. will
lend 350 million euros ($442 million) to Energy Financing Team
Group to build a 300 megawatt coal-fired power plant in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, London-based EFT said in a statement today.  The 14-year credit, including a four-year grace period,
will finance the construction of the Stanari plant near Doboj in
northern Bosnia, which will rely on lignite from a nearby mine
run by EFT, the Anglo-Swiss group said in the e-mailed
statement.  EFT contracted Chinaâ€™s  Dongfang Electric Corp. (1072)  in 2010 to
build the power plant, whose completion is anticipated for early
2016. The agreement for the 350-million euro structured credit
facility will be signed tomorrow in Banja Luka, capital of the
Serb region of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the company said. The entire
project is valued at 550 million euros, EFT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
