Farmers in the U.K. are facing
“direct consequences” from the  European debt crisis , as the
weakening euro against the pound erodes the appeal of British
exports, the National Farmers Union said.  About 77 percent of the U.K.’s exports last year went to
European markets, the NFU said in a  statement  dated June 15 and
posted on the organization’s website today. Direct payments made
to U.K. farmers by the 27 member states of the European Union
may also decline because the euro has weakened against the
pound, the Stoneleigh, Warwickshire-based union said.  “This uncertainty means volatility in the pound and euro
exchange rates, and ultimately will have direct consequences for
U.K. agriculture,” the NFU said. “The  euro zone  is by far our
biggest trading partner and the  exchange rate  between the pound
and euro is the critical determinant of total farm income and
profitability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
