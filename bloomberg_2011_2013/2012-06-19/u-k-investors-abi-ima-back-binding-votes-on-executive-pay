The  Association of British Insurers 
and the  Investment Management Association , which represent U.K.
investors with 5.5 trillion pounds ($9 trillion) of assets, said
they favor legally binding shareholder votes on executive pay.  Requiring companies to gain shareholder approval for
compensation plans would give investors more control over how
and how much executives are paid, the heads of the ABI and IMA
told parliamentarians at a Treasury Committee hearing in London
today. Votes on pay are currently advisory in the U.K.  “When you talk about a binding vote on future pay policy,
I think the opportunity is created for investors to express a
view on the appropriateness of the balance that’s being struck
in the incentivizing of senior executives,” said Otto Thoresen,
director general of the ABI.  Investors at FTSE 100 firms including  Aviva Plc (AV/) ,  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  and  WPP Plc (WPP)  rebelled against or rejected pay reports at this
year’s annual general meetings for being too generous and not
reflecting the companies’ performance. U.K. Business Secretary
Vince Cable backed binding shareholder votes earlier this year.  “Binding votes are a potentially helpful development,”
said Richard Saunders, the IMA’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
