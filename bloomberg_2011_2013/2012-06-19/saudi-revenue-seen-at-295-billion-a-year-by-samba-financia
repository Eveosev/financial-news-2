Saudi Arabia will collect $295
billion a year in government revenue from 2012 to 2016 as the
Arab world’s biggest economy benefits from high  oil prices ,
 Samba Financial Group (SAMBA)  said.  Hydrocarbon earnings are expected to be $265 billion a year
in the same period, Riyadh-based Samba said in an e-mailed
report today. Real gross domestic product growth will average 5
percent for the period, while inflation will be stable at an
average of 5.5 percent, it said.  “Under our oil price and production assumptions we expect
that the government will have plenty of money to spend during
the forecast period,” the bank said. “ Government spending  will
remain the engine of economic growth.”  Saudi Arabia boosted spending last year as it sought to
avert the political unrest that spread through other Arab
countries. The government spent 804 billion riyals ($214
billion) and collected 1.11 trillion riyals of revenue,
according to the Ministry of Finance.  Economy Minister Muhammad al-Jasser said in May he hoped
the kingdom’s real gross domestic product growth will be at
about 6 percent this year. The  International Monetary Fund 
forecast in April that economic growth will slow to 6 percent 
from 6.8 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
