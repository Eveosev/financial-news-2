Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said his government hasn’t made any concessions as part
of its invitation to join negotiations for a Pacific-region
trade agreement, though the country will have to accept any
progress that has already been made.  Canada , the largest U.S. trading partner, was invited today
to join nine nations negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
a day after  Mexico  received a similar offer.  “Canada has not agreed to any specific measures in terms
of an eventual” agreement, Harper told reporters today in Los
Cabos, Mexico, where he was attending a meeting of Group of 20
leaders. “There is an accession process so we don’t disrupt the
negotiations.”  “We’re obviously not going to try and undo what’s been
done but these negotiations in our judgment are at fairly
preliminary phases right now,” Harper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
