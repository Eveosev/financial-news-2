The European Union intends to alter
the planned new capital rules for European insurers following
criticism from the industry and national regulators,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported in a preview of a story to be
published in tomorrowâ€™s edition, without saying where it got the
information.  The EU may decide to exempt for seven years all existing
insurance contracts from the new Solvency II rules, which will
come into force in 2014, the newspaper said. About 40 percent of
German life insurers would have problems complying with the new
rules, FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
