Russian stocks fell after two days
of advances as oil, Russia’s biggest export, retreated and
rising bad loans in Spain stoked concerns Europe’s debt crisis
is worsening.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.3 percent to 1,384.53 by 10:17 a.m.
in Moscow, the biggest intraday drop since June 8, after gaining
1 percent yesterday. OAO Novolipetsk Steel, Russian billionaire
 Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, lost 1.4 percent and OAO Severstal,
Russia’s second-largest steel producer, slipped 1.2 percent. OAO
RusHydro receded as Kommersant reported Rosneftegaz may invest
85 billion rubles ($2.62 billion) for a 25.8 percent stake in
Russia’s largest power producer.  Crude fell 0.3 percent in New York, retreating for the
second day. Spain’s borrowing costs soaring to a euro-era record
after bad loans jumped to the highest proportion of total
lending since 1994 in April overshadowed electoral gains pro-
bailout parties made in Greek elections over the weekend.  “The Spanish banking sector remains a source of deep
market concerns,” Alexei Zabotkin, an analyst at VTB Capital,
said in an e-mailed note. “Deeper-rooted problems, which are
contributing to the crisis remain unresolved.”  The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  of London-traded stocks added
1 percent to 1,517.27 yesterday. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index was little changed at 1,347.30.  G-20 Meeting  President  Vladimir Putin  held a meeting with his U.S.
counterpart  Barack Obama  at the G-20 summit in Mexico yesterday
where world leaders discussed Europe’s debt crisis for the
second day.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose 0.1 percent to 934.81,
gaining for the third day. Russian stocks trade at 5.1 times
 estimated earnings , having lost 1.2 percent this year. That
compares with a 2 percent gain for the  MSCI Emerging-Market
Index (MXEF)  which trades at 9.6 times projected earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
