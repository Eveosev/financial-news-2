agreements  and TADs yesterday, tightening  money supply  more than
it did today. The shilling strengthened 0.7 percent to 84.33 per

at a discounted yield, according to a research note from
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd e-mailed June 11.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,490 per dollar,
