Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  paid the lowest
premium by a South Korean bank this year for its record $700
million bond sale as borrowing costs fell after  Greece ’s
election eased global financial turmoil.  The country’s fifth-largest commercial lender by assets
sold 3.125 percent, five-year notes at a yield of 255 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. KEB paid 10 basis points less than
higher-rated Hana Bank, which issued $500 million of 2017
securities in April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Average  spreads  on Korean dollar debt fell to a 2 1/2-month
low yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes, after
gains by pro-bailout parties in Greece reduced concern the
country will exit the euro. KEB said it took advantage of
optimism in the markets after the election.  “Investors need to put money to work as we’ve only seen a
few windows for new issuance over the past couple of months,”
William Mak, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by
phone today from  Hong Kong . “It will depend on individual
companies’ funding needs, but we may see more issues as a
result.”  Asian issuers outside  Japan  sold $3.8 billion of dollar
bonds in June, the least since December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to $15.5 billion in April,
the busiest month on record, the data show. The region’s
companies and sovereigns have sold $63.8 billion of U.S.
currency debt this year, more than volumes for all of 2011.  Hana Bonds  “Korea Exchange Bank’s pricing is reasonably decent as it
gives some pick-up on where Hana Bank’s existing bonds are
trading,” Mak said.  Hana’s notes due in October 2017 yielded 232.6 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries as of 10:59 a.m.  Seoul 
time, ING Groep NV prices show. The borrower is rated A1 by
Moody’s Investors Service and A by  Standard & Poor’s , one level
above KEB, which was acquired by  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , Hana
Bank’s parent, in February.  KEB’s new notes were trading at about 246.7 basis points
more than benchmark Treasuries as of 12:49 p.m. in Seoul,
according to prices from Credit Agricole SA. Investors sought an
average yield premium for South Korean borrowers of 253 basis
points yesterday, the lowest since April 3, JPMorgan indexes
show.  KEB got orders for $5.5 billion of debt, about 7.8 times
the amount offered, the Seoul-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Investors in  Asia  made up 55 percent, while
U.S. and European buyers comprised 28 percent and 17 percent,
respectively.  It last issued a benchmark dollar note in July 2010,
selling $500 million of 4.875 percent January 2016 securities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark typically
means a sale of at least $500 million. KEB has the equivalent of
$4.64 billion of bonds  maturing  by 2017, the data show.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc,
ING Groep NV, KEB Asia Finance and Morgan Stanley managed the
sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
