U.S. and Afghan forces have lost
track of hundreds of night-vision goggles used to hunt the
Taliban, raising the odds of the high-technology eyewear falling
into enemy hands, according to the Pentagon’s inspector general.  A lack of adequate supervision of the goggles, which were
purchased for the Afghan Army and police, means U.S. and Afghan
soldiers “may be at greater security risk during night missions
in  Afghanistan ,” according to a report from the inspector
general dated June 18.  “Improving accountability will decrease vulnerabilities to
theft or loss of night-vision devices,” Jacqueline Wicecarver,
assistant inspector general for acquisition and contract
management, said in a memorandum accompanying the report.  Defense and NATO officials, Afghan security forces and
defense contractors “did not maintain complete accountability”
for 7,157 night-vision goggles and spare parts purchased for
Afghan forces, the report found. Those goggles are now “more
vulnerable to theft or loss,” the GAO said.  The report cited hundreds of missing serial numbers, 518
“discrepancies” and 75 goggles that were “unaccounted for
during our physical inventory.”  Defense officials said they would “continue to improve
accountability procedures,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
