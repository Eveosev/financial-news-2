Nick Abendanon scored a first-half
hat trick as  England  beat the SA Barbarians North 57-31 in a
midweek rugby tour match before facing the Springboks in their
Test series finale.  Jonny May scored two tries and Ben Morgan and Anthony Allen
had one each last night as England, which also got a penalty
try, touched down eight times in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
Charlie Hodgson kicked seven conversions and a penalty to finish
with 17 points.  May had replaced England winger Ugo Monye, who was knocked
out as he attempted to tackle Barbarians scrum-half Shaun Venter
in the 27th minute before being taken off on a stretcher after
receiving treatment. He was taken to the hospital for scans on
his neck and was cleared of injury, the Rugby Football Union
said on its website.  Venter touched down twice for the Barbarians, with Joubert
Engelbrecht and Deon Scholtz scoring one try each.  England, which beat the SA Barbarians South 54-26 on June
13, concludes its tour June 23 against  South Africa  in  Port
Elizabeth . The Springboks won the first two Test to clinch a
series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
