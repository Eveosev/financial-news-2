peers, with the euro strengthening 0.9 percent to $1.2688. The

because of hot, dry weather. Oil rallied 0.9 percent.  Signs of faltering growth with inflation below a 2 percent

April 2 through June 1 amid signs economic growth was slowing as
 Europe  struggled to contain its debt crisis. It has rebounded
more than 6 percent since then after the slump dragged the
gauge’s valuation to 12.9 times companies’ reported earnings,
the cheapest level since November, and investors speculated
global policy makers will take additional steps to spur growth.  ‘Clearly Unsure’  The Fed is scheduled to release its statement on  interest
rates  and the economy tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. in Washington. The

November 2008 and shifting $400 billion into longer-term debt.  “There is no doubt the economy stinks but the Fed is quite

global strategist at BTIG LLC in  New York , said in a note to
clients.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the U.S. currency against six

before September, a European official told reporters in Brussels
today.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index climbed 1 percent, gaining
