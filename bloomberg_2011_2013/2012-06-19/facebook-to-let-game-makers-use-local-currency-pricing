Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
largest social network, will let game developers sell virtual
goods based on local-currency prices, instead of Credits, the
digital tokens now used for purchases on the site.  With the change, which is being rolled out this year,
developers that sell items within their games, such as a
digitized animal or beach ball, can now tailor pricing for
countries around the world, the company said in a blog posting
today. Credits was started in 2009 and most game developers have
made their own virtual currencies, so they no longer need the
system, according to the  Menlo Park , California-based company.  Facebook is working to attract more users by streamlining
the purchasing process for developers. While the company will
move away from Credits, it will still process digital-goods
transactions and take a cut of 30 percent on the sales.  Starting next month, Facebook also plans to offer monthly
subscriptions for buying virtual goods rather than relying on
one-time payments by users. The early games using this feature
include  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) ’s “Pioneer Trail” and “FarmVille.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
