Kenya  coffee prices slumped for the
third successive week in reaction to inferior beans and a
bearish global market, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  Average prices for all the coffee sold fell 4.5 percent to
$148.79 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $155.73 a week
earlier, the exchange said today by e-mail from Nairobi, the
capital.  The exchange, a trading platform for the Kenya Coffee
Producers and Traders Association, said the average price for
the benchmark AA grade fell 5.9 percent to $263.34 a bag. The
grade sold for as much as $301 a bag compared with $305 at the
previous sale.  “Prices at  New York  were down,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee
trader at Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “The
quality of the coffee was inferior and these could be the lowest
prices this season.”  Superior beans were sold earlier in the season leaving
behind inferior grades, according to the association. The
country will start its annual auction break on July 18 because
of reduced stocks, the association said yesterday.  Germany , the
U.S.,  Canada , the U.K.,  Belgium , the Netherlands,  Luxembourg ,
 Sweden  and  Finland  are some of the main importers of Kenyan
beans, according to the Coffee Board of Kenya.  Sales at the auction climbed 42 percent to 7,875 bags
valued at $1.42 million from 5,542 bags valued at $1.05 million
last week, the exchange said.  Supplies at the auction rose 31 percent to 19,157 bags from
14,584 bags last week, the exchange said. Kenya harvests its
early crop from May through July, while the main crop is reaped
from September through December.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
