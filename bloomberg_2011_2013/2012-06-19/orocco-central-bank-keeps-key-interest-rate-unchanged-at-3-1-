Morocco ’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged, saying economic growth is
slowing amid the debt crisis in  Europe .  The Rabat-based bank, which meets every three months to
review monetary policy, said it held the key rate at 3 percent,
after cutting it in March from 3.25 percent in a bid to help an
economy squeezed by slumping agricultural output and the euro-
area crisis.  Gross domestic product will probably grow less than 3
percent, the bank said on its website today, citing “risks from
economic slowdown in the main partner countries and lower cereal
production,” and slowdowns in foreign direct investment and
remittances from abroad.  Finance Minister Nizar Baraka, in an interview on June 6,
predicted that growth may slow to 3.4 percent this year from 5
percent. He said inflation probably won’t exceed 2 percent, even
after an increase in the price of subsidized fuel aimed at
narrowing the  budget deficit .  “The latest increase in fuel prices should be of contained
impact and therefore not require a move from the central bank,
at least at this stage,” Mohamed Abu Basha, a Cairo-based
economist at investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, said in
response to e-mailed questions. At the same time, “cutting
again won’t necessarily support growth given that the weaker
growth is mainly the result of lower agricultural production and
a weak Europe.”  The country’s foreign exchange reserves are equivalent to
more than four months of imports, after declining almost 15.5
percent since May 2011, the central bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
