shareholder of Cementos Argos, increased 2.6 percent to 15,800
pesos. The spread between the company’s share price and the
market valuation of its investment portfolio “suggests that
there is an opportunity to buy the stock as there is currently a
big discount being offered by the market,” Interbolsa SA
analysts Jorge E. Zuñiga and Alejandro Isaza wrote in a report.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  , a Calgary-based  oil company 
that operates in the Andean region, jumped 3.9 percent to 21,820
pesos. The Canadian-traded shares rose 3.5 percent yesterday
after the company said in a statement it found oil in its Guala-
1 well and provided a production update on Bromelia on Block 25.
The increase yesterday “reflects both the positive news on the
Guala-1 discovery and the favorable new log analysis for
Bromelia-1,” Raymond James Ltd. analysts Rafi Khouri, Ana Wessel and Cynthia Yee wrote in a report today.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , the country’s largest oil
company, increased 2.5 percent to 5,420 pesos as crude advanced
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
