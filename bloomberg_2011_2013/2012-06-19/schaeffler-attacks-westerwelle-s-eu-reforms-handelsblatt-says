Frank Schaeffler , the parliamentary
finance spokesman for Germany’s Free Democratic Party,
criticized Foreign Minister and FDP member  Guido Westerwelle ’s
reform plan for the European Union, saying it’s not compatible
with liberal principles,  Handelsblatt  reported on its website.  Europe doesn’t need “a centralized and planned economy,”
Handelsblatt cited Schaeffler as saying in a letter to FDP
members. The FDP should fight for a liberal Europe, not for the
illiberal ideas of other parties, the letter said, according to
Handelsblatt.  Westerwelle is discussing with nine EU colleagues reforms
that include shrinking the size of the European Commission, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
