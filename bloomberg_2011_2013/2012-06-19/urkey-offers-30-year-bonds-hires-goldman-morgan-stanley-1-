Turkey  is offering  $1 billion of
dollar bonds  maturing in 2041 in the first such sale since
February after yields dropped to a record low.  The bonds were priced to yield 5.75 percent, according to
two people with direct knowledge. Yields on the bonds have
tumbled as much as 108 basis points since January, before
climbing four basis points today to 5.73 percent as of 7:10 p.m.
in Istanbul. They fell to 5.69 percent yesterday, the lowest
since an initial sale in January last year.  Investors have been returning to Turkey after the economy
grew 8.5 percent last year, reducing the country’s debt to gross
domestic product ratio to about 42 percent, the lowest in  Europe 
after the  Czech Republic , Russia and Sweden. Banks including
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say Turkey’s current
account deficit, which reached a record in October, has peaked,
boosting confidence in the economy.  “I guess Turkey feels that demand is good, the cost is
acceptable and low, historically,” said Aziz Unan, who manages
$50 million of Turkish, Middle Eastern and east European assets
at Rennaisance Asset Managers in London.  The Treasury in Ankara hired Deutsche Bank AG,  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  for the sale, it said in a
statement on its website today.  Bond Sales  Turkey has sold $3.6 billion of bonds so far this year
against a target of 9.5 billion liras ($5.3 billion) for foreign
borrowing, which includes  World Bank  and other international
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten year bonds in liras dropped 13 basis points to 8.86
percent today, the lowest level since September.  The Treasury last sold 10-year dollar bonds in February,
issuing $1 billion to yield 5.75 percent. The country also sold
$1.5 billion of 10-year bonds on Jan. 18 at a 6.35 percent yield
and 90 billion yen ($1.1 billion) of 10-year Samurai bonds in
March.  Turkey initially sold $1 billion of the January 2041 bonds
at a 6 percent coupon in January 2011. The yield was 6.25
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the country’s debt Ba2, two
steps below investment grade, with a positive outlook.  Fitch
Ratings  ranks Turkey at BB+, one step below investment grade
with a stable outlook.  Standard & Poor’s  cut the outlook on
Turkey’s debt to stable from positive on May 1, maintaining the
BB rating, two steps below investment grade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
