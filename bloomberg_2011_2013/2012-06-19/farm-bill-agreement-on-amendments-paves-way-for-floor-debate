U.S. Senate negotiators reached a
deal on farm-bill amendments, paving the way for a possible vote
on legislation that would cut agricultural programs by $23.6
billion over 10 years.  “With the agreement that we have, members are saying,
’Yes, we should move forward,’” Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairwoman  Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat, said tonight on
the Senate floor.  The Senate tomorrow will begin voting on more than 70
amendments ranging from sugar subsidies to food stamps, Majority
Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said after announcing the
deal. Senators also will vote on amendments unrelated to U.S.
agricultural policy, including on  North Korea  and merit pay in
labor-union contracts.  Lawmakers are trying to pass a five-year reauthorization of
all U.S. Department of Agriculture programs before expiration on
Sept. 30. The bill, which would end direct payments to growers
as part of the biggest change in U.S. farm-subsidy policy in
decades, is a target for budget cutters because of farm profits
and the highest-ever expenditures on  food stamps .  Net  farm income  this year will be $91.7 billion, the
second-highest ever, according to the USDA. Spending on the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, the
department’s biggest expense, reached a record $75.7 billion
last year, double the level of four years ago.  The bill is S. 3240.  To contact the reporters on this story:
