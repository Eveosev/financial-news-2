ServiceNow Inc., the maker of cloud-
based software that helps companies manage information-
technology systems, plans to raise as much as $198.1 million in
its U.S. initial public offering.  The San Diego-based company plans sell 11.65 million shares
at $15 to $17 each, according to a regulatory filing today.
ServiceNow  announced  plans in March for an IPO to raise about
$150 million.  Intensifying concern over  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
and a global economic slowdown have damped IPOs around the world
in recent months, making this year’s second quarter the slowest
for initial sales since 2009. ServiceNow’s offering would follow
a month-long drought in U.S. IPOs, after  Facebook Inc. (FB)  sank last
month following its own $16 billion offering, a record for a
technology company.  Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are
leading ServiceNow’s IPO, according to the filing. The shares
will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NOW.  JMI Equity, the Baltimore-based firm that invests in
growth-stage Internet and software companies, owns more than
half of ServiceNow, the filing shows. Venture firms Sequoia
Capital and  Greylock Partners  also own stakes, the document
shows. Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman, previously a
partner at Greylock, joined ServiceNow in May 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
