Retail rents in Greeceâ€™s capital
fell almost 12 percent in the first half of the year from the
previous six-month period,  Kathimerini  reported, citing Colliers
International figures.  In the affluent central neighborhood of Kolonaki and in
Kifissia and Glyfada, wealthy suburbs north and south of  Athens ,
rents declined between 7 percent and 20 percent compared with
the same period a year earlier, the Athens-based daily said,
citing Panos Danos, the head of Danos International Property
Consultants & Valuers, which represents  BNP Paribas Real Estate (FORRECC) 
in Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
