Job openings in the U.S. decreased
in April by the most in almost four years, the latest sign that
the labor market is cooling.  The number of  open positions  dropped by 325,000, the
biggest decline since September 2008, to 3.42 million from 3.74
million the prior month, the Labor Department said today in
 Washington . Hiring slowed from the prior month and firings
climbed.  The decrease in openings coincides with the slowdown in
hiring seen in April and May, signaling employers are pulling
back as the economy cools. The number of jobs available is down
from an average 4.46 million in the two years before the
recession began, showing the labor market continues to struggle.  “The most worrisome development is this big drop in
hiring,” said  Harm Bandholz , chief U.S. economist at UniCredit
Group in  New York . “If you have the outlook that things are
getting little bit better, you eventually have to hire more
people. But the fact that this is not happening -- that’s
worrisome.”  Stocks climbed as the  Federal Reserve  began a two-day
meeting to decide whether more monetary stimulus is needed to
boost the economy. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1
percent to 1,358.11 at 10:54 a.m. in New York.  The number of openings in April was the lowest since
November.  Today’s U.S. jobs openings report helps shed light on the
dynamics behind the monthly employment figures.  Hiring Cools  Payrolls climbed by 69,000 workers in May, less than the
most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after a
revised 77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially
estimated, according to the June 1 data from the Labor
Department. The  jobless rate  rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1
percent.  The number of people hired declined to 4.18 million in
April from 4.34 million the previous month, today’s report
showed. The hiring rate fell to 3.1 percent, the lowest since
July.  Professional and business services led the drop in  job
openings  for the month, followed by manufacturers, retailers and
government agencies.  A separate survey from the  Institute for Supply Management 
on May 8 showed manufacturers projected employment will increase
1.4 percent for the rest of this year. Service companies
predicted a 1.9 percent gain, according to the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s semiannual forecast.  Quit Rate  About 2.09 million people quit their jobs in April, up from
1.93 million in March, before adjusting for seasonal changes,
today’s report from the Labor Department also showed. After
adjustments for seasonal changes, the number of quits fell to
2.07 million from 2.16 million.  The number of people fired climbed to 1.72 million from
1.65 million in March.  Companies looking to cut costs amid sluggish growth may add
to the lot of unemployed.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, offered exit packages to
1,700 technicians and call-center workers this month, a move
that may lead to hundreds of job cuts if enough employees don’t
volunteer.  In the 12 months ended in April, the economy created a net
1.8 million jobs, representing 50.9 million hires and about 49.1
million separations, today’s report showed.  Considering the 12.5 million Americans who were unemployed
in April, today’s figures indicate there are about 3.7 people
vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the recession
began in December 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
