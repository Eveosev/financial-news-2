The UN observer mission in  Syria 
will remain suspended until violence there declines enough for
the monitors to be able to move about the country and carry out
their activities, the commander of the operation said today.  “We need to see a change if the activities of the mission
in the current situation and under the current mandate are to be
meaningful,” Major General Robert Mood told reporters after
briefing the UN Security Council in New York.  The suspension will be reviewed daily with the aim of
returning the mission to full operation, said Li Baodong, the
Chinese ambassador to the UN, who holds the council’s rotating
presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
