  ZTE Corp. (763) , a Chinese phone
equipment maker under investigation by U.S. lawmakers, plans to
increase investment in the U.S. 10 percent a year, betting on
growth in the country’s smartphone market.  “Chinese investment in the U.S. is beneficial for
businesses in both countries,” Cheng Lixin, chief executive
officer of ZTE USA, said at a conference in Atlanta, according
to a statement distributed by Businesswire. ZTE supply-chain
partnerships in the U.S. total more than $13.7 billion and will
grow, he said.  ZTE and larger rival Huawei Technologies Co., both based in
the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, are being investigated by
the U.S. House Intelligence Committee to assess whether the
companies’ possible ties to  China ’s government represent
security threats given the sale of their phone equipment in the
U.S. Cheng urged U.S. businesses and government to foster open
communication, according to the statement, which didn’t mention
the congressional probe.  Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan
Republican, and the committee’s top Democrat, C.A. “Dutch”
Ruppersberger of  Maryland , sent letters this month to both
companies seeking details about ownership, operations in the
U.S., funding from the Chinese government and connections with
Chinese government officials.  ZTE, now the world’s  fourth-largest mobile-handset seller,
has opened 10 offices in the U.S., and ZTE USA has more than 400
employees across  North America , the company said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
