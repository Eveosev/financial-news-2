A Chinese submarine descended to
6,908 meters (22,600 feet) in the Mariana Trench today, breaking
the record for the nation’s deepest dive a day after astronauts
performed  China ’s first manned space docking.  The Jiaolong submersible began the descent in the trench,
located in the  Pacific Ocean , at 7 a.m. today and will try more
dives with the goal of reaching 7,000 meters, the Xinhua News
Agency said. The Jialong carries a crew of three.  An earlier dive attempt was aborted because of a
communications problem. A leaking hydraulic pipe was also fixed,
Xinhua said.  The dive occurred less than 24 hours after three Chinese
astronauts, including China’s first woman in space, docked their
spacecraft with an orbiting Tiangong space module. The docking
was broadcast live on state television.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
