Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  said it was
aware of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s plans to develop its own tablet
computer prior to the U.S. software maker announcing the product
yesterday.  “Our management did learn about that in a later stage” of
the product’s development, Nick Wu, a spokesman for the Taipei-
based company, said in a phone interview today. “It’s an
investment by Microsoft to grow and build the ecosystem for
Windows RT and we have no special opinion on that. We will
continue to deliver our products.”  Asustek on June 4 previewed a 10.1-inch tablet running
Windows RT, becoming the first company to announce a device
running Microsoft’s new operating system on chips based around
ARM Holdings Plc technology.  Microsoft unveiled plans for its Surface tablet yesterday,
with one version featuring ARM chips and another featuring an
Intel Corp. chip with Windows 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
