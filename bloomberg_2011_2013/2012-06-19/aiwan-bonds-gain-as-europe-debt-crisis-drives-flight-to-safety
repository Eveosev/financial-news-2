Taiwan ’s government bonds advanced
as rising Spanish borrowing costs added to concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen, increasing demand for safer assets. The
local dollar was steady.  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed to as much as 7.29 percent
yesterday, the most since the euro was introduced in 1999.
Official data due tomorrow will show Taiwan’s export orders
dropped 3.7 percent in May from a year earlier, the third
monthly decline, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The Financial Supervisory Commission is
ready to stabilize financial markets and to ensure companies can
satisfy their funding needs, it said in a statement yesterday.  “Europe’s problems will boost bonds in the medium term,”
said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc.
in Taipei. “ Spain  is a much bigger issue than  Greece  because of
its bigger economic size.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.188
percent as of 4:20 p.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The island’s dollar was steady at NT$29.890 against its U.S.
counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped 23 basis points to 5.10 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank will hold its benchmark  interest rate 
at 1.875 percent on June 21, according to 14 of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. One expects a reduction to 1.75 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.510
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
