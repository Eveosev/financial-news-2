South Africa  said $2 billion it
pledged to the International Monetary Fund will be considered
part of its foreign reserves and will only be drawn down in a
crisis and after other resources have been depleted.  “The funds will be invested and earn interest,” the
Pretoria-based South African presidency said in an e-mailed
statement today. “If the funds are drawn down, they will
ultimately be repaid.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
