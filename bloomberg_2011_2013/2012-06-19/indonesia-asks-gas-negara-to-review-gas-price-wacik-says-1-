Indonesia ’s government asked PT
Perusahaan Gas Negara to review a proposed gas price-increase,
considering the cost borne by industrial customers.  “We’ll calculate a gas price that will allow the industry
to carry on their business and still make a profit,” Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Jero Wacik told reporters in Jakarta
today. “It will be unfair to keep gas prices unattractive for
producers.”  Gas Negara, Indonesia’s biggest gas distributor, raised its
selling price by 50 percent last month to as much as $10.13 per
million British thermal units for industrial users in Jakarta,
West Java and Banten, Investor Daily reported May 15. The
company had previously agreed to buy natural gas at higher
prices from ConocoPhillips and state oil and gas company PT
Pertamina, the nation’s energy regulator BPMigas said May 8.  The government will announce a decision on the gas price
within a week, Wacik said.  Gas Negara shares rose 0.7 percent to 3,525 rupiah a share
at 2:28 p.m. Jakarta time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
