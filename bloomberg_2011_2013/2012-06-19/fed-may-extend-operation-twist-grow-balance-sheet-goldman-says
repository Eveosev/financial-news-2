The  Federal Reserve  is expected to
start a new asset purchase program at a meeting this week,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  chief economist Jan Hatzius said.  The Fed may expand its balance sheet, extend its so-called
Operation Twist and/or lengthen its short-term interest rate
guidance beyond late 2014, Hatzius said in an e-mailed report to
clients today.  “A decision not to ease is tantamount to a tightening,”
he said. “At this point we’d be quite surprised if we saw no
easing.''  The Fed committee is expected to lower its forecast for
real economic growth and raise its forecast for the unemployment
rate “significantly,” Hatzius said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
