Oil fell a second day in New York
after Greek leaders said they would form a group to renegotiate
the country’s international bailout.  Futures slid as much as 1.2 percent, extending a decline
yesterday that was the first in three days.  Evangelos Venizelos ,
the head of Greece’s Pasok party, said today the nation will
attempt to renegotiate some terms attached to its bailout.  West Texas Intermediate for July delivery retreated 74
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $82.53 in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 9:37 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
