Leon Cooperman , who runs the $6
billion Omega Advisors Inc. hedge fund, said  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  took a “prudent risk” when it traded in  credit derivatives 
that have cost the bank at least $2 billion in losses.  “We live in a very competitive economy, and banks need to
take a certain amount of risk,” Cooperman, whose New York-based
fund owns JPMorgan shares, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview with Stephanie Ruhle. “They took the risk and it was
a prudent risk.”  Congress’s inquiry into JPMorgan’s $2 billion trading loss
has reignited the question of whether a bank can grow too large
and complex for its own executives to oversee. JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  is appearing today in front of the
House Financial Services Committee to answer questions regarding
the loss. He appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on
June 13.  Cooperman, 69, said he hadn’t added to his stake in
JPMorgan even as the stock has fallen about 23 percent since the
end of March. Omega owned 2.2 million shares at the end of the
first quarter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. That position was valued at about $102 million at the
time.  Even so, he said the stock is trading at attractive values
now.  “For someone with a two- or three-year time horizon, you
would have a nice capital gain” if you bought the bank at these
levels, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
