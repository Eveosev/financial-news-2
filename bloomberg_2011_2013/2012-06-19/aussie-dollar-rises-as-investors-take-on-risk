The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose against their U.S. counterpart as stocks advanced
amid increased demand for higher-yielding assets after the
European Union said it may renegotiate Greece’s bailout.  The Aussie reached its highest point in more than a month
after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia said in minutes released
June 18 that recent domestic data hadn’t shown a “significant
weakening” compared with the prior month’s forecasts. The New
Zealand dollar strengthened for a fourth day.  “It’s just a generally risk-on type of environment, with
the dollar weaker across the board,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a
currency strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “The risk-sensitive or high-beta
currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars typically
do well in those types of environments.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.6 percent to $1.0189 yesterday
in New York. The currency traded 0.4 percent stronger at 80.44
yen.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed 0.8 percent to 79.82 U.S.
cents. It rose 0.6 percent to 63.02 yen.  Stocks gained,  boosting  the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 1
percent to its highest point in five weeks. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rallied 0.8 percent.  The RBA lowered interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.5
percent this month after a “finely balanced” discussion that the
domestic economy was holding up as global prospects worsened,
minutes of its June 5 meeting showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
