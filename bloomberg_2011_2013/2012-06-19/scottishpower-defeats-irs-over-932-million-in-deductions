ScottishPower Plc defeated the
Internal Revenue Services’s bid in U.S. Tax Court to disallow
more than $932 million in interest deductions.  The court in  Washington  ruled that stock provided by
ScottishPower to one of its units upon the acquisition of a
publicly held U.S. utility was a loan rather than a capital
contribution under federal tax law.  The unit, NA General Partnership & Subsidiaries, made
$932 million in payments on $4 billion worth of notes it issued
to Glasgow-based ScottishPower in exchange for the partnership’s
receipt of all outstanding stock in PacifiCorp & Subsidiaries.  “We hold that the advance was a loan, and the payments on
the loan notes are deductible as interest,” the court said
yesterday in a 38-page decision.  ScottishPower created NA General Partnership after it began
negotiating in 1998 for the acquisition of PacifiCorp, a power
supplier to  California , Washington, Oregon,  Utah ,  Idaho  and
Wyoming, according to the court’s ruling. The PacifiCorp
acquisition was completed in 1999.  Michelle Eldridge, a spokeswoman for the IRS, declined to
comment on the ruling.  The case is NA General Partnership & Subsidiaries v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 525-10, U.S. Tax Court
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
