The global financial sector needs
regulation to force banks to include sustainable development in
their business models,  Banco Santander  Brasil SA’s Chief
Executive Officer Marcial Portela said.  “We at capital markets need to find new risk models,”
Portela said at a seminar on sustainability in Rio de Janeiro
today. “At banks in general, we still work with models that are
from the past and don’t incorporate well what societies are
already dealing with.”  Portela said regulation is necessary to make sure
sustainability is “something that is inside the core business
of companies and sectors.”  Banco Santander is based in  Sao Paulo .  Representatives from 190 nations are working on a draft
agreement that provides a road map to balance economic
development with global efforts to protect the environment at
the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in  Rio de Janeiro 
this week.  The Rio+20 meeting involves 50,000 government officials,
company executives and research analysts.  -- Editors: Charles Siler, Tina Davis  To contact the reporter on this story:
