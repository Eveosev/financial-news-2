Germany  sold 300,000 European Union
spot carbon permits at 7.39 euros ($9.32) a metric ton in an
auction on the European Energy Exchange AG.  The country is selling as many as 21 million metric tons of
spot and 32 million tons of futures contracts in weekly sales as
part of its allocation of permits in 2012. The EUâ€™s emissions
trading system is in its second phase, which runs from 2008 to
the end of this year.  EEX has also auctioned Phase 2 permits on behalf of the
Netherlands and Lithuania, and is selling Phase 3 permits for
delivery in 2013 for the  European Investment Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
