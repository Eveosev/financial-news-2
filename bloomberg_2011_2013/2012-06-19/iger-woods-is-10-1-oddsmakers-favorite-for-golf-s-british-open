Tiger Woods remains the oddsmakers’
favorite to capture next month’s British Open even though he
isn’t among the 15 different players who have won golf’s past 15
major championships.  Woods’s drought in the four majors has reached four years
after tying for 21st place at the U.S. Open in  San Francisco ,
his worst four-round finish at the tournament. His next chance
to get within three of Jack Nicklaus’s record 18 Grand Slam
titles will be at the July 19-22 British Open at Royal Lytham &
St Annes Golf Club in northwest England.  Woods, 36, is listed as the 10-1 favorite for the season’s
third major, according to the Las Vegas Hotel and Casino’s
sports book. While Woods hasn’t won a major since the 2008 U.S.
Open, he remains popular with bettors. Woods last week had “by
far the most money on him,” according to  Jeff Sherman , LVH’s
assistant sports book manager.  “Betting support for Tiger helped contribute to his
favoritism for the British Open,” Sherman said in an e-mail.  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and England’s  Lee Westwood 
are tied as the second choice at 12-1. Englishman Luke Donald,
who’s No. 1 in golf’s Official World Ranking, has 20-1 odds to
win his first major championship.  Phil Mickelson has 30-1 odds to win the British Open, tied
with Justin Rose,  Sergio Garcia ,  Martin Kaymer ,  Rickie Fowler ,
 Jason Dufner , Graeme McDowell and Padraig Harrington.  Harrington won British Open titles in 2007 and 2008 and is
the last golfer to capture repeat major titles, with victories
at the British Open and PGA Championship four years ago. Those
wins came after Woods collected the last of his 14 Grand Slams
in 2008 at Torrey Pines in California.  Since the start of 2009, no golfer has more than one major
title. Of the past 14 majors, 12 were captured by golfers who
hadn’t previously won a Grand Slam, including the past nine.
Webb Simpson’s one-shot win at the  U.S. Open  two days ago
followed Bubba Watson’s playoff win at the Masters in April.  Simpson and Watson have 40-1 odds to win at Royal Lytham,
along with Ernie Els, Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and 2010
British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen.  Woods won his second and third British Open titles in 2005
and 2006. In the past five years, he missed the tournament twice
because of injury, failed to make the cut for weekend play in
2009, tied for 12th in 2007 and tied for 23rd in 2010.  Although he slipped out of contention at the U.S. Open by
shooting 8-over par during the final two rounds, he said he was
encouraged by his ball-striking at the Olympic Club. Woods will
play in two more events -- the AT&T National in Bethesda,
Maryland, from June 28 to July 1 and the Greenbrier Classic in
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, from July 5-8 -- before
traveling to Lancashire,  England , for the British Open.  “There’s a lot of positives to be taken away,” Woods said
after the U.S. Open. “I just gotta apply them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
