Deutsche Bahn AG estimates that the
delayed opening of the new airport in Berlin will cost the
German train operator at least 20 million euros ($25.4 million)
in lost sales and maintenance and staffing costs,  Die Welt 
reported in a preview of an article that will be published
tomorrow, without saying where it got the information.  Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt Airport, built at a cost of
2.5 billion euros, wonâ€™t go into service until March 17 next
year following the completion of fire-safety tests that already
led to the cancellation of a June 3 start, it said on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
