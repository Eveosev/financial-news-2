Guaranty Trust Assurance Plc (GTASSURE) , a
Nigerian insurer, gained for the time this month, as some
investors were “taking position” on the stock, according to
Vetiva Asset Management Ltd.  The stock rose 4.9 percent to 1.28 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, the first one-day advance since
May 31.  “We suspect that some strategic investors are taking
position on the stock,” Pabina Yinkere, head of research at
Vetiva, said by phone from Lagos today.  The stock has fallen 9.9 percent this year, compared with a
rise of 1.5 percent in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
