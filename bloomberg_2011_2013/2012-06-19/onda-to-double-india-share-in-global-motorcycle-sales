Honda Motor Co. (7267)  expects to more than
double  India ’s share in its global two-wheeler sales as the
company adds small-engined motorcycles and opens outlets to
widen reach in villages and towns.  “India will want more motorcycles as infrastructure grows,
technologies improve and people’s incomes rise,” Keita
Muramatsu, chief executive officer of  Honda Motorcycle & Scooter
India Pvt. , said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday. The Tokyo-
based automaker will add 100-cc models and increase its
penetration in rural markets, he said.  Honda, which in 2010 exited a 26-year partnership with  Hero
Group (HMCL) , sold 1.99 million two-wheelers locally in the year ended
March 31 surpassing  TVS Motor Co. (TVSL)  as India’s third-biggest
seller of motorcycles, according to data from the  Society of
Indian Automobile Manufacturers . The world’s biggest motorcycle
maker will increase its outlets and service centers in the
country to 2,000 by the end of March 2013 from 1,500 in the
previous 12 months, Muramatsu said.  Honda expects sales in India to contribute 30 percent of
its total two-wheeler volumes by 2020 from 13 percent at
present, Muramatsu said.  Two-wheeler sales in India, the world’s biggest market
after  China , may climb by as much as 13 percent in the 12 months
ending March 31, slowing from a 14 percent pace a year earlier,
according to SIAM. Industrywide sales was 13.4 million units in
the year ended March 31, according to the industry group. Hero
MotoCorp Ltd., renamed after Honda sold its stake, is the
nation’s biggest motorcycle maker.  Honda Motorcycle, which will open a new factory near
Bangalore, in southern India in the first half of next year,
introduced its cheapest motorbike in the Indian market, the 110-
cc Dream Yuga in Mumbai yesterday, starting from 48,028 rupees
($857).  The company expects to sell 300,000 Dream Yugas by March
31, Yadvinder Guleria, vice president for sales, said at a press
conference in  Mumbai  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
