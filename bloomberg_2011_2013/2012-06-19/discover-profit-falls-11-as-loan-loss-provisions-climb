Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
credit-card issuer that has expanded into mortgages and student
lending, said fiscal second-quarter profit fell 11 percent as
provisions for loan losses increased and expenses climbed.  Net income in the period ended May 31 dropped to $537
million, or $1 a share, from $600 million, or $1.09, a year
earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based company said today in a
statement. That matched the average  estimate  of 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Discover, led by Chief Executive Officer David Nelms, 51,
has stepped up stock repurchases and is acquiring businesses to
expand beyond the firm’s core credit-card operations. The
company started offering mortgages this month after buying the
assets of Home Loan Center Inc. for $55.9 million and last year
became the third-biggest private student lender in the U.S. with
the purchase of a portfolio from Citigroup Inc.  “The U.S. consumer has delivered and is now back in a less
cautious mode around purchases and spending,”  Chief Financial
Officer Mark Graf said in a telephone interview. There will be a
“continued modest recovery in the health of the U.S.
consumer.”  Revenue climbed 6.4 percent to $1.85 billion compared with
the same period in 2011, the company said. Provisions for future
losses on bad loans rose 32 percent to $232 million. Discover
released $110 million from the reserves, compared with a $401
million release last year.  Expenses Jump  Write-offs of credit-card loans deemed uncollectible fell
to 2.65 percent in May from 4.82 percent a year earlier,
regulatory filings show. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a gauge
of future losses, fell to 1.93 percent from 2.88 percent.  Expenses jumped 18 percent to $749 million, including a $71
million increase in legal costs, according to the firm. The
“bulk” of the gain is tied to a regulatory probe into
Discover’s marketing of fee-based products, including payment
protection, Graf said.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. plan to take a joint enforcement action
as a result of the probe, which could hurt net income, Discover
said in January. The matter is not yet resolved, Graf said.  Student Loans  Purchases made with Discover cards in the second quarter
increased 5 percent to $26.1 billion from a year earlier, the
company said. Net interest income climbed $122 million, or 10
percent, to $1.32 billion.  Credit-card loans rose 3.6 percent to $46.6 billion. Moshe Orenbuch, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst, had predicted $46.8
billion. Other consumer loans rose 38 percent to $10.5 billion,
the firm said, matching Orenbuch’s estimate. This portfolio
included Discover’s  student loans , which jumped to $7.5 billion
at the end of May compared with about $4.6 billion a year
previously, according to Graf.  Regulators are scrutinizing the marketing and interest
rates of private student loans as college costs spiral, which
Discover is watching “very closely,” Graf said. The firm
charges interest rates of between 6.79 percent and 9.99 percent
on fixed-rate student loans, he said.  Top Performer  “I feel very good about the way we tackle and approach
that business,” said Graf, who declined to say how much profit
Discover makes from student loans. “We feel very strongly that
the student loan business is a very good business.”  Discover gained 2.41 percent, or 79 cents, to $33.62 at
1:01 p.m. in  New York . The firm’s shares climbed 42 percent in
the past year through yesterday, the top performance in the  81-
company (S5FINL)  Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index.  “DFS remains our favorite name among card issuers,” Jason Arnold, a Royal Bank of Canada analyst, wrote in a June 14 note
to clients, referring to Discover’s ticker symbol. “We still
see no reason to expect credit trends to change course
meaningfully anytime soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
