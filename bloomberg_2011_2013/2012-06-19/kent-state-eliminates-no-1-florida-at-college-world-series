Kent State University earned its
first College World Series win in school history, beating the
University of  Florida  5-4 to eliminate the top-seeded Gators.  Kent State (47-19) jumped out to a 4-0 lead after two
innings yesterday in Omaha, Nebraska, by taking advantage of a
pair of errors by Florida.  The Gators, who also gave up a run on a wild pitch, scored
one run in the sixth inning and two in the seventh to pull
within 5-4. Florida then loaded the bases with one out in the
ninth before Kent State held on for the victory, ending the game
with a strikeout and a fly out.  Florida (47-20) is the second overall No. 1 seed to lose
its first two games at the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association â€™s College World Series since 1999.  The Flashes, from Kent, Ohio, next play two-time defending
champion South Carolina in an elimination game on June 20. South
Carolina had its 22-game NCAA tournament winning streak end with
a 2-1 loss to the University of Arkansas last night.  Arkansas now has a 2-0 record in the final round of the
College World Series for the first time since 1979, when the
Razorbacks lost in the championship game.  The  University of California ,  Los Angeles  plays Florida
State tonight in an elimination game in Omaha, with the winner
moving on to face the University of Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
