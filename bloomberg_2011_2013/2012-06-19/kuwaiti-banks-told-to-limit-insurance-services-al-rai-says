Kuwait â€™s central bank instructed
lenders to stop promoting insurance services other than those
directly tied to banking facilities for clients,  Al-Rai 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Lenders are not to renew contracts with insurance companies
to promote their services and must refrain from signing such
agreements, the newspaper said, citing a circular distributed to
banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
