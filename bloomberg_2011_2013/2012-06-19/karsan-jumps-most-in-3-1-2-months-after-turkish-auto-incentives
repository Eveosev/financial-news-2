Karsan Otomotiv Sanayii & Ticaret
AS (KARSN) , a light commercial vehicle maker for Peugeot SA and  Fiat
SpA (F) , rose the most in three and a half months after Economy
Minister Zafer Caglayan revealed details of the incentives
offered to Turkey’s automotive industry.  The  stock  advanced as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday leap since March 5, before paring its gain to 3.6
percent at 1.14 liras by 4:45 p.m. in Istanbul, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The volume of shares traded surged
to more than three times the stock’s three-month average. Karsan
was the third-biggest gainer on the benchmark ISE National 100
index.  Turkey will allow carmakers that add at least 100,000 units
annual capacity in the country to import additional vehicles
equaling 15 percent of that amount without tariffs, Caglayan
said in a speech in the capital today.  Producers making new investments in engine production will
be able to import the equivalent of 30 percent of the new car
capacity to  Turkey  duty-free, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
