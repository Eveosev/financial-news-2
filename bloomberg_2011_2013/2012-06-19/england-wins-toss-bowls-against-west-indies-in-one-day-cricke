England captain  Alastair Cook  won
the toss and decided to field against the West Indies in the
second one-day cricket international at the Oval in London
today.  England won the first rain-shortened match by 114 runs at
the  Rose Bowl  in Southampton three days ago.  Englandâ€™s team is unchanged, with Chris Gayle and Tino Best
coming into the West Indies side.  The game has been overshadowed by the death yesterday of
Tom Maynard, an Oval-based Surrey and England Lions batsman. He
was hit by a train in southwest London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
