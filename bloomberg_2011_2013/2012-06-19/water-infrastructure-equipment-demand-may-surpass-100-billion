Demand for water infrastructure
equipment globally may surpass $100 billion by 2016, buoyed by a
projected growth rate of 6 percent a year, according to reports
from Global Information Inc. Heightened maintenance required of
aging water systems in developed countries and the need for
water supplies and sanitation in developing regions are driving
the demand, the report said.  Materials leading the gains include plastic pipes, research
showed, according to a summary of the reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
