The  Land Bank  of the Philippines
said it agreed to a $275 million loan with the  World Bank  for
wastewater treatment improvements in the metropolitan Manila
area as well as to boost water quality in Manila Bay.  The funds will be split between the country’s two largest
water concessionaires, Manila Water Co. and Maynilad Water
Services Inc., according to terms of the agreement.  “The lack of proper wastewater systems significantly
damages the environment, especially our coastal waters, and
poses a genuine threat to the health of our citizens,” said
Landbank Chief Executive Officer Gilda E. Pico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
