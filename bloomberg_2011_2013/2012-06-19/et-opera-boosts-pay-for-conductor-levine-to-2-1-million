James Levine, the  Metropolitan
Opera ’s music director, earned $2.1 million in 2010, up 39
percent from a year earlier and more than the compensation of
the general manager,  Peter Gelb , according to the Met’s 2010-
2011  tax return .  Levine’s pay was “related to the increasing success of our
media program, including amounts attributable to prior years,”
said  Peter Clark , a Met spokesman, in an e-mail.  Clark referred in part to the Met’s high-definition
performance simulcasts in cinemas worldwide. Levine oversees the
orchestra, chorus, music staff and helps with artistic planning
and other activities, Clark said.  Levine conducted 31 times in the 12 months ending in July
2011, double that of a year earlier. The frizzy-haired maestro
withdrew from the podium in September 2011 after a fall damaged
one of his vertebrae. He won’t return until late 2013 at the
earliest.  Gelb earned $1.4 million in pay and benefits in 2010, up 4
percent. His base salary was $1.25 million and he sometimes flew
first-class, Clark said. Moreover, a car and driver is available
for business purposes seven days a week. When he uses the
chauffeured car for personal reasons, he must pay taxes on the
benefit, Clark said.  “He never asks the driver to work seven days a week,”
Clark said.  Levine and Gelb’s pay was roughly in line with other top
arts executives. Thomas P. Campbell, director of the
 Metropolitan Museum  of Art, earned pay and benefits of $1.04
million in 2010. Reynold Levy’s pay and benefits as president of
 Lincoln Center  for the  Performing Arts , including money for
retirement, was listed as $1.8 million, $133,333 of which was
reported in the prior year.  Surplus Seen  The Met, the largest U.S. opera presenter, spent $321
million during 2010-2011, up 8 percent. It had a $41 million
surplus, reversing a $25 million deficit the prior season, as
contributions and revenue surged, according to the return.  Master electrician, Paul Donahue, earned $516,577 in pay
and benefits in 2010, up 18 percent from a year earlier. The
stagehand’s compensation topped that of the best-paid stagehand
at  Carnegie Hall , Dennis O’Connell, who earned $436,097 that
year, according to the tax return of Carnegie Hall.  Clark said the increase for Donahue “had to do with
accrued vacation payments and the variable nature of the Met’s
work schedule, including its media activities.”  Joseph Volpe, the general manager who retired in July 2006,
received $406,101 in pension and health benefits.  Advertising agency  Serino/Coyne  received $3.9 million, up a
third from 2009. Clark said the increase was the result of the
timing of invoices.  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on music.  To contact the reporter on this story:
