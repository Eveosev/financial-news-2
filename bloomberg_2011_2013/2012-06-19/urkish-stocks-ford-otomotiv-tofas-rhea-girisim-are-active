Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  surged 1.7 percent to 59,299.68, the highest since April
30, at the close in Istanbul, resuming gains after yesterday’s
0.2 percent decline broke its longest winning streak since 1993.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  CarrefourSA Carrefour Sabanci Ticaret Merkezi AS (CARFA)  , a grocery store chain, added 4.3 percent to 15.80 liras
after part-owner Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS, Turkey’s second-
biggest group of companies, said it continues to assess buying
shares in the unit from parent Carrefour SA, whose chief
executive said yesterday it may exit Turkey.  Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO)  , the Turkish
unit of  Fiat SpA (F)  in partnership with  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , added 2.4
percent to 6.96 liras, the highest in almost a month, after the
government announced new incentives for motor vehicle producers.  Rhea Girisim Sermayesi Yatirim Ortakligi AS (RHEAG)  , a
venture capital investment trust, gained 2.4 percent to 2.13
liras, rising for the first day in four. Rhea applied to the
