Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  and  BT
Group Plc (BT/A)  are leading companies selling at least $8 billion of
 debt  in the U.S., marking the busiest day this month.  Occidental, the largest onshore crude producer in the
continental U.S., sold $1.75 billion of bonds at its lowest
coupons and London-based BT Group issued $1.25 billion in its
first dollar-denominated sale in more than four years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s issuance is more than
double the average daily volume in June, Bloomberg data show.  Companies have sold $655 billion of debt in the U.S. this
year, less than the $684 billion for the same period last year,
Bloomberg data show. Investment grade borrowers are making up a
larger share of issuers, increasing to 78.6 percent from 74.3
percent, as the  European debt crisis  curbs demand for riskier
assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own bonds from the most
creditworthy to the riskiest has dropped 7 basis points since
the end of last month to 313 basis points, according to the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master
index. While spreads have narrowed, they are above this year’s
low of 269 basis points reached on March 20.  Investment-grade notes yielded 3.4 percent yesterday,
compared with 3.44 percent at the end of May, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master index. High-
grade borrowers have sold $515 billion of debt this year,
compared with $508 billion during a similar period in 2011, as
yields fell to a record low 3.33 percent May 8, Bloomberg data
show.  Europe Turmoil  High-grade issuance in the U.S. has increased amid turmoil
in  Europe , with borrowing costs on  Spain ’s 10-year bonds rising
above 7 percent this week for the first time since the creation
of the euro. Yields rose even after Spain accepted a 100 billion
euro ($127 billion) bailout from the European Union to defend
the country’s banks and after Greek election winner Antonis Samaras raced to forge a government that keeps bailout aid
flowing.  Occidental, based in  Los Angeles , sold $500 million of 1.5
percent, 5.5-year debt that yielded 80 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $1.25 billion of 2.7 percent,
10.5-year securities at a spread of 110 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. The coupons were the lowest on record for similar-
maturity debt issued by the company, and compare with previous
records set in August 2011 of 1.75 percent for 5.5-year bonds
and 3.125 percent for 10.5-year securities.  The bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who asked
not to be identified because the terms are private.  Oil Debt  Other oil and gas companies in the market include state-
owned  Petroleos Mexicanos  with $1.75 billion of 32-year
debentures and The Woodlands, Texas-based  Newfield Exploration
Co. (NFX)  with a $1 billion offering of 12-year bonds, according to
people familiar with the transaction.  BT Group, the U.K.’s largest fixed-line telephone company,
sold $500 million of 18-month floating securities to yield 112.5
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate and $750 million of three-year, 2 percent debt at about
162.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds may be  rated  Baa2 by Moody’s, two
levels above junk, the data show.  BT last sold debt denominated in dollars in December 2007,
when the London-based company issued $1.1 billion of 5.95
percent notes due in 2018 and $850 million of 5.15 percent bonds
maturing in January, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
