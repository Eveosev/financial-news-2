World soccer’s ruling body FIFA
extended punishments worldwide to 13 people involved in match-
fixing in  South Korea  and  Croatia .  The action follows domestic investigations by those
countries’ soccer associations and is in accordance with FIFA’s
disciplinary code, the governing body said in a statement. The
bans range from five years to life.  The number of sanctions extended in South Korea will
increase, pending a review of additional cases, FIFA added. Some
of the people implicated in Croatia still face criminal
investigation.  “These cases prove once more that the threat of illegal
betting and match-fixing is not only confined to one part of the
world,” FIFA director of security Ralf Mutschke said in the
statement. “The integrity of sport, and especially football, is
hugely at risk and FIFA is firmly determined to combat this
threat.”  FIFA’s  latest action follows the extension of 45 domestic
sanctions in  Turkey  and Finland to have global effect in
February and April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
