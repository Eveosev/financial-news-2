Evangelos Venizelos , the head of
Greeceâ€™s Pasok party, said he agreed with the leader of the
Democratic Left party to speed up the process for forming a
coalition government for the country.  Venizelos said there was initial agreement on a policy
framework for the new government, as well as on the need to put
together a negotiating team, which can include people from
outside the government, to renegotiate some of the terms
included in an international rescue.   Venizelos spoke in  Athens  in comments carried live on
