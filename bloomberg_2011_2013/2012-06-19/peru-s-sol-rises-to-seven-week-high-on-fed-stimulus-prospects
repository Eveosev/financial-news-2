Peru’s sol climbed to its highest
level in seven weeks as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
take steps to boost U.S. growth spurred demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market currencies.  The sol appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.6355 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, matching the level on April 30, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Twelve of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed expect
some form of added stimulus from the Fed meeting today and
tomorrow, while nine expect no action. Europe’s situation poses
“significant risks” to the  U.S. economy , and America’s central
bank was prepared to take action if necessary, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 7.  “We don’t know what is going to happen with the Fed so
investors may have got a bit ahead of themselves,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc.
“If the Fed comes with easing,” Peru’s central bank will
probably resume dollar purchases to slow the gains in the sol,
Tuesta said.  Peru’s central bank has bought $8 billion this year and
last  purchased dollars  May 8 when the local currency traded at
2.6410. The bank sold $676 million last month to support the sol
as the euro zone’s deepening debt crisis curtailed demand.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.06 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.22 centimo to 118.30
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
