Pegatron Corp. (4938) , an assembler of
Apple Inc. iPhones, said it expects  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s new
Surface tablet computer to help promote the Windows ecosystem as
it competes with the iPad and Google Inc. Android devices.  “I think this is the major purpose of them doing a tablet,
as it can enhance their ecosystem, to help them promote and get
a lot of developers to make apps to share in their store,”
Charles Lin, chief financial officer for the Taipei-based
company, said in a phone interview today. “This kind of device
may help them to promote their Win8 solutions and demonstrate
the strengths and capabilities of the new Windows 8.”  Pegatron currently has as many as five tablet products in
development for both Windows and Android platforms, Lin said.  He declined to say whether Pegatron is a manufacturer of
the Surface tablet or name other customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
