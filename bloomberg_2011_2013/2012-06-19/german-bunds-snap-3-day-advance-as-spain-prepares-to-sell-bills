Spanish government notes climbed,
trimming seven days of losses, as the nation met its maximum
target at a bill auction even after speculation the country will
need a sovereign bailout pushed up borrowing costs.  Two-year  yields  fell from a six-and-a-half month high
reached yesterday as an European Union official said the
conditions attached to  Greece ’s aid program may be modified once
the nation has formed a government. German bunds fell,, with 10-
year yields rising the most in two months on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will do more to boost the U.S. economy, damping
demand for the safest assets. Greek bonds declined.  “The best thing about today’s bill auction is that they’ve
sold the target volume,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income
strategist at WestLB AG in London. At the sale, the “jump in
yields is huge and this isn’t sustainable,” he said. “While
there might be some knee-jerk relief that they’ve managed to
sell the paper, I doubt that will extend too far.”  Spain ’s two-year note yield fell 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 5.29 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time after
rising to 5.59 percent yesterday, the highest since Nov. 30. The
3.4 percent security due April 2014 advanced 0.27, or 2.70 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,262) face amount, to 96.73.  Spain sold 2.4 billion euros of 12-month bills at an
average rate of 5.074 percent, 2.1 percentage points more than
the yield paid at a May 14 sale, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain
said. It also auctioned 639.3 million euros of 18-month debt at
5.107 percent, compared with 3.302 percent last month.  Spanish Rates  Ten-year Spanish rates declined 12 basis points to 7.04
percent, while yields on similar-maturity Italian debt slipped
17 basis points to 5.91 percent.  Spain, which requested as much as 100 billion euros to
support its banks on June 9, plans to sell 2 billion euros of
notes due in 2014, 2015 and 2017 in two days.  “These decidedly elevated yield levels leave a question-
mark firmly in place as regards the sustainability of Spain’s
public finances while doing nothing to temper speculation as to
how long the country might hold out before looking for a more
comprehensive bailout,” Richard Mcguire, a senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in London, wrote in a note
to investors. It’s “certainly not a favorable precedent ahead
of Spain’s auctions.”  Austerity Changes  Group of 20 leaders meeting in  Mexico  focused their
response to  Europe ’s financial crisis on stabilizing banks as
the  International Monetary Fund  raised its lending capacity to
shield the rest of the world economy.  China ,  Brazil ,  India ,
Mexico and  Russia  boosted their pledges to the global firewall.  “Unless we see firm commitments from the G-20, things will
continue to deteriorate and yields will go higher,” said Niels From, chief analyst at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Copenhagen. “The focus
will probably shift back to the immediate situation in the euro
region and particularly in Spain.”  Greek election winner Antonis Samaras began a second day of
talks to form a coalition as he raced to forge a government that
keeps bailout aid flowing.  The nation’s economic-performance targets, linked to funds
pledged by international lenders, may be revised sometime before
September, a European official told reporters in Brussels today.  German Volatility  Greek 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield on the
securities 13 basis points higher to 26.43 percent. The price
declined to 17.115 percent of face value.  Volatility on German bonds was the second-highest in the
euro-area markets today following Finland’s debt, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities and credit-default swaps.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 7 that Europe’s
situation poses “significant risks” to the  U.S. economy  and
that the Fed was prepared to take action if necessary.  The central bank’s so-called Operation Twist program, in
which it’s selling $400 billion of Treasuries maturing in three
years or less and buying an equal amount of bonds with a
maturity of six years to 30 years to cap borrowing costs, is set
to expire this month.  German 10-year yields rose 12 basis points to 1.53 percent,
after touching 1.55 percent yesterday, the most since May 10.
They climbed as much as 13 basis points, matching the biggest
intra-day increase since April 11.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, slid to
minus 16.9 from 10.8 in May. That’s the steepest decline since
October 1998. Economists forecast a drop to 2.3, according to
the median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  German bonds handed investors a return of 3.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds gained 6.2 percent and Spanish debt lost 7.4 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
