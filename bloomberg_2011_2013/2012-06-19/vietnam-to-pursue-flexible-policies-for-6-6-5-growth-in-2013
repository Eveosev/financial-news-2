Vietnam  pledged to pursue “flexible
and cautious” monetary policies and an  exchange rate  that will
support exports in 2013, extending its efforts to revive an
economy hurt by  inflation  and a credit crunch in the past year.  The government aims to boost  economic growth  to about 6
percent to 6.5 percent next year, with “reasonable” levels of
credit growth to “efficiently help businesses,” Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung said in an instruction to ministries posted on
the state website yesterday.  “This means the government may loosen its monetary policy
further next year,” said Vu Thanh Tu, head of research at Viet
Capital Securities Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City . “It’s good as long
as the government ensures it will not ease policies too
quickly,” he said by phone today.  Vietnam is accelerating  government spending  and boosting
bank lending to bolster an economy that expanded 4 percent in
the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2009. Growth may be as
low as 5.2 percent in 2012, Deputy Minister of Planning &
Investment Cao Viet Sinh, said in an interview on June 5, which
would be the least expansion in more than a decade.  The government will strengthen its management of the
banking system, foreign exchange and gold markets, and continue
the revamping process to ensure stability of lenders, according
to the prime minister’s instruction. It will also accelerate
restructuring of state companies and reduce bad debts, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
