The euro fell against the yen,
halting yesterday’s gain, before  Spain  sells bonds tomorrow with
European leaders struggling to contain the region’s debt crisis.  Demand for the dollar was limited amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will decide on further stimulus when it
concludes a two-day meeting today. Twelve of 21 primary dealers
who trade with the Fed expect some form of monetary easing. New
Zealand’s dollar weakened against all of its 16 major peers
after data showed the nation’s current-account deficit widened
more than economists had estimated in the first quarter.  “Given that long-term Spanish yields are already above 7
percent, if rates rise further at the auction tomorrow, it may
cast doubts over the country’s funding ability,” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst in  Tokyo  at IG Markets Securities Ltd.
“That will probably spur some  risk aversion , which will prompt
some euro selling.”  The euro slid 0.2 percent to 100.01 yen as of 7:02 a.m. in
 London  from yesterday, when it advanced 0.7 percent. The shared
currency was little changed at $1.2679 from $1.2685 yesterday,
when it climbed 0.9 percent. The yen strengthened 0.1 percent to
78.89 per dollar.  Spanish 10-year yields on June 18 touched 7.29 percent, the
highest since euro was introduced in 1999. While yields eased
yesterday, they remained above the 7 percent level that pushed
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek rescue packages. The nation
is scheduled to sell debt tomorrow maturing in 2014, 2015 and
2017.  Policies Endorsed  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said Group of 20
leaders endorsed his government’s economic policies. He spoke to
reporters yesterday at the conclusion of the G-20 summit in Los
Cabos,  Mexico .  The euro is trading within a range of 98.55 and 100.93
versus the yen and may fall to 95.59 if it breaks below the
lower level, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note to clients
yesterday, citing trading patterns.  A dip below the range would “pave the way for a selloff”
taking it to an interim support of 97.05 before possibly falling
further to 95.59, according to analysts including  David Sneddon ,
Credit Suisse’s London-based head of technical analysis
research. Support is an area on a chart where orders to buy may
be clustered.  The euro touched 95.60 yen on June 1, the lowest level
since 2000.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, traded 0.3 percent from the lowest in almost
one month before the Fed meeting concludes.  ‘Something Stimulatory’  The central bank will review new forecasts as it contends
with continuing financial stress in  Europe  and a U.S.
 unemployment rate  that has stayed above 8 percent for 40
consecutive months.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Jefferies Group Inc. predict
policy makers will extend the Fed’s so-called Operation Twist.
The $400 billion program, announced in September, involves
selling short-maturity debt and buying longer-term bonds. The
Fed instituted the program following two rounds of quantitative
easing, or QE, in which it bought $2.3 trillion of debt to hold
down borrowing costs.  “Any stimulus from the Fed is bearish for the  U.S.
dollar ,” said Kurt Magnus, executive director of currency sales
in Sydney at Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage.
“We’re expecting something stimulatory, whether or not it’s in
the form of an extension of Twist, or a little bit of QE.”  The Dollar Index was at 81.391 from 81.400 yesterday, after
touching 81.161 on June 18, the lowest since May 22.  Japanese Trade  The yen briefly weakened, before erasing losses, after
Japan posted a wider trade deficit for May than predicted by any
economist in a Bloomberg News survey.  Japan’s trade gap was 907.3 billion yen ($11.5 billion), in
May, according to Finance Ministry data released today. The
median forecast in the survey was for a 544.4 billion yen
shortfall. Exports rose 10 percent from a year earlier, while
imports climbed 9.3 percent.  New Zealand ’s dollar declined after a government report
today showed the country’s current-account deficit in the three
months through March widened to 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product, up from a revised 4.2 percent in the previous quarter.  The so-called kiwi fell 0.3 percent to 79.55 U.S. cents and
dropped 0.4 percent to 62.76 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
