CC Sabathia tossed a complete game
as the  New York Yankees  beat the Atlanta Braves 6-2 for their
10th straight victory, their longest winning streak since 2005.  Sabathia struck out 10 batters and issued one walk two last
night at Yankee Stadium to join teammate Ivan Nova as the only
American League pitchers with nine wins this season.  The Yankees scored three runs in the fifth inning to erase
a 2-0 deficit, with Russell Martin hitting a ground-rule double
to drive in the first run and  Derek Jeter  following with a two-
run single. Mark Teixeira and Robinson Cano added solo home runs
for New York, which last had a run of 10 straight wins from May
7-17 of the 2005 season. The Yankees’ streak is the longest in
 Major League Baseball  this season.  “Our guys have just done a really good job of finding ways
to win,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said at a news conference.
“I’m proud of what they’ve accomplished.”  The Yankees host the Braves today in the second game of
their three-game interleague series. During their winning streak
-- with all 10 games against National League opponents --
Yankees pitchers have a 2.09 earned run average.  “It seems like it’s been on repeat here for the last
several weeks,” Jeter, who had two hits and three runs batted
in yesterday, told reporters. “Our starters have been good, our
relievers have been good. It’s just been one of those waves and
we’ll try to ride it as long as we can.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
