Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, is “well advanced” in discussions with Brazil on
as much as 5.64 billion reais ($2.77 billion) in outstanding
royalty payments, Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira said.  “I see the commitment from both sides to reach an
agreement,” Ferreira said today in an interview at a conference
in  Rio de Janeiro . “I want this to be concluded as soon as
possible.”  Ferreira declined to comment on how much the company would
end up paying. Vale  rose  2.6 percent to 39.71 reais at the close
in  Sao Paulo  today to the highest since May 7.  Vale, based in Rio, has been fighting Brazilian government
tax claims amid growth in its export volume and rising mineral
prices. The company and  Brazil ’s National Mineral Production
Department set up in August a group to discuss the amount of
disputed royalties and failed to reach an agreement by an
initial October deadline.  The talks were extended four times and Vale received in
April an additional 60 days. The company said April 17 that it
estimated the royalty dispute at about 5.64 billion reais as of
Dec. 31, including possible fines and interest payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
