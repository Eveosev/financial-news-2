JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s trading loss
of at least $2 billion strengthens the argument against
Republican efforts to cut the budget of the U.S. derivatives
regulator and ease Dodd-Frank Act swaps rules, said
Representative  Barney Frank .  “If in a very well-run bank, you can get this loss of
several billion dollars -- three and counting, we’re told -- in
a fairly short period of time, it’s an indication of the
problems with derivatives,” said the Massachusetts lawmaker,
the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee,
at a hearing today looking into the bank’s trading.  The House Agriculture Committee last month postponed a
committee meeting to vote on measures limiting the international
reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law’s swaps regulations
and allow more derivatives trading to occur in federally insured
banks. Financial Services approved the same legislation in
March, before JPMorgan’s derivatives losses were disclosed.  Frank criticized Republican efforts to ease swaps rules and
limit the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
“which will, incredibly to me, reduce the amount they have from
this year to next year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
