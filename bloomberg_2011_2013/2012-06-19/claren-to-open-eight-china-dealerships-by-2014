McLaren Automotive Ltd. plans to
have eight dealerships in  China  by early 2014 as the U.K.-based
supercar maker joins rivals including Ferrari SpA in betting on
rising demand in the world’s fastest growing major economy.  The maker of the $350,000 carbon-fiber MP4-12C plans to
sell 100 to 150 of the 592-horsepower coupes in the first 12
months after opening an initial four dealerships in Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu, said Ian Gorsuch, McLaren’s Asia
Pacific director. The first China showrooms will be added by
mid-2013 with four more opening in 2014, he said.  McLaren, the most successful Formula One racing team after
Ferrari, said in June 2011 it will spend $1 billion to unveil 13
models and variants in the coming years to lure buyers from
Ferrari and Lamborghini SpA. The carmaker, which has opened 35
showrooms in 19 markets, including  Japan , in the past year, is
holding off on China until it has more production, Gorsuch said.  “We chose the high brand-building market such as Japan,
and once we get that established we’ll start expansion” in
other parts of Asia, Gorsuch said today in an interview after a
press briefing in Tokyo. “We don’t have enough production;
that’s why we don’t have China from the start,” he said.  Luxury car demand is rising in China, the second-largest
market for Ferrari and the largest for Bentley Motors Ltd. as
economic growth increases wealth.  McLaren has also opened showrooms this year in  Hong Kong 
and  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
