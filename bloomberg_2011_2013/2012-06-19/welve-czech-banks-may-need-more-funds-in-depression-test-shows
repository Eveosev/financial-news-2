Twelve Czech banks would need a
capital injection if  Europe  falls into a prolonged economic
recession, while the banking industry as a whole would remain
stable, results of central bank stress tests showed.  The Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said it tested banks
under two outlooks, including economic developments according to
the bank’s own forecast and a stress scenario assuming “a
significant and long-lasting decline in economic activity over
the entire three-year horizon” covered by the tests.  “Even in the case of the extremely stressed variants of
the ‘Europe in Depression’ scenario, assuming collapses of large
debtors or problems in the parent banks of Czech units, the
capital-adequacy ratio of the sector remains above the 8 percent
regulatory minimum, although some banks would have to strengthen
their capital,” according to the central bank.  The  Czech Republic  didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as the amount of toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets and deposits
exceeded loans, according to central bank data. The economy
depends on demand from the euro area, which takes about 70
percent of all Czech exports.  Twelve lenders’s capital would fall below the 8 percent
regulatory minimum and would need a capital injection totaling
about 14.6 billion koruna ($721 million), or 0.4 percent of
gross domestic product, in the depression scenario, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
