The risk that the Czech koruna will
appreciate to levels hurting the economy has eased as investors
differentiate between central and east European markets, the
Czech central bank said.  The koruna held “relatively stable” in 2011 and in the
first months of 2012, and the prevailing market forecast is that
the currency will remain steady in the coming periods with a
“tendency for a very moderate appreciation,” the Prague-based
Ceska Narodni Banka said in the annual Financial Stability
Report published on its website today.  The koruna has weakened 5.8 percent in the past 12 months,
the sixth-biggest loss among 25 emerging-markets currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. While the bank said in last year’s report
that investors seeking quality assets and returns may put
unjustified pressure on the koruna to gain, it now sees a
smaller risk of such market moves.  “The main reason is an improved understanding of the Czech
economy’s characteristics among analysts and investors, and
their increased ability to assess risks of individual economies
in the region according to their fundamental indicators,” the
bank said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
