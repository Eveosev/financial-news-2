Indian  government bonds  rose for the
first time in four days on speculation the central bank will
purchase bonds to ease a cash crunch in the banking system.  The yield on the 10-year notes touched a one-week high
yesterday as the  Reserve Bank  of India unexpectedly held its
 repurchase  rate. The monetary authority has bought 432.9 billion
rupees ($7.7 billion) at open-market operation auctions in the
current fiscal year that began April 1. Lenders  borrowed  1.326
trillion rupees from the central bank’s repo window today, the
most since April 4, according to RBI data.  “There is some expectation of open-market operations,”
said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit
Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “That is probably pushing down yields.”  The yield on the government’s 8.15 percent bonds due June
2022 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.11
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The monetary authority last reduced the repo rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent in April after raising it 13 times
from March 2010 to October 2011.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.81 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
