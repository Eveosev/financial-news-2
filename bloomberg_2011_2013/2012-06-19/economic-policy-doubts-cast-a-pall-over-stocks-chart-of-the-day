Growing doubts about the direction
of U.S. economic policy may limit any stock-market gains in the
next few months, according to Myles Zyblock, chief institutional
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  The CHART OF THE DAY displays a policy-uncertainty index
that Zyblock cited in a note to clients yesterday. The gauge
rose in May after dropping for five months in a row, and the
increase offset most of the decline during that streak.  “Uncertainty has started to ramp up once again,” Zyblock
wrote. He mentioned three reasons for the shift: this year’s
presidential election, debate over increasing the federal debt
ceiling, and a so-called fiscal cliff that may result from tax
increases and spending cuts set for early next year.  Share prices may suffer along with consumer spending,
hiring and investing because of “this domestically focused
headwind” regardless of how the European debt crisis unfolds,
the Toronto-based strategist wrote.  The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index set a record last
August, when a near-failure to reach agreement on raising the
debt limit led  Standard & Poor’s  to reduce the country’s credit
rating from AAA for the first time.  The  indicator  is derived from estimates of U.S. economic
growth and government purchases, Google News search results, and
the number of expiring provisions in the federal tax code. Scott
R. Baker, a graduate student at  Stanford University , created the
gauge with Stanford Professor Nicholas Bloom and University of
Chicago Professor Steven J. Davis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
