Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
world’s largest maker of microcontrollers for cars, said its
alliance with  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  will help
boost market share and operating margin.  The Japanese supplier to companies including  Toyota (7203)  Motor
Corp. aims to raise its microcontroller market share to 35
percent in five years from 27 percent last year and will target
emerging-market countries, said Shinichi Iwamoto, a senior vice
president heading the microcontroller unit. The chipmaking and
development alliance with TSMC, extended last month, will help
reduce fixed costs and widen  profit margin , Iwamoto said in an
interview in Tokyo yesterday.  The partnership may also help double the ratio of products
other companies make for Renesas to about 30 percent in 2016
from 15 percent last fiscal year, Iwamoto said. TSMC, the
world’s largest custom chipmaker, will provide 40-nanometer
chips to Renesas for its single-chip microcontrollers used for
devices including airbags and brake systems, the two companies
said May 28.  “TSMC has flexible production capacity and technology,
which will broaden our business,” Iwamoto said. The two
companies will also consider cooperating in developing smaller
and more energy-efficient 28-nanometer chips, he said.  Renesas gained 1.3 percent to 324 yen at the close of  Tokyo 
trading, after jumping as much as 4.4 percent. TSMC added 1.4
percent to NT$81.6 in Taipei trading.  Capital Plan  Renesas, which hasn’t posted a profit since it was founded
in 2010, was said to be planning to raise  capital  of 100 billion
yen ($1.3 billion) and eliminate at least 10,000 jobs, a person
briefed on the matter said May 25. The job cuts would amount to
almost a quarter of the Kawasaki, Japan-based company’s
workforce of 42,800 people.  “We expect to get more orders from Renesas in the future
because of our collaboration on 40-nanometer and beyond,”
Elizabeth Sun, spokeswoman for Hsinchu, Taiwan-based TSMC said.  Falling orders for its system chips from consumer
electronics makers had worsened Renesas’s situation, Iwamoto
said, without naming any company involved. The semiconductor
maker’s  customers  include Sharp Corp.,  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Panasonic
Corp. (6752) , which posted a combined 1.6 trillion yen in losses last
fiscal year because of slumping demand for their televisions.  Renesas’s microcontroller business has operating profit
margin of at least 10 percent, said Ryuji Omura, the unit’s
general manager.  About 60 percent to 70 percent of chips used by Toyota and
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  are made by Renesas, according to Kunihiko Onuma, head of  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ’s automotive systems unit. Hitachi
 owns  30.6 percent of Renesas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
