Philadelphia Phillies second baseman
Freddy Galvis, who hasn’t played in two weeks because of a
fractured back, has been suspended 50 games for violating  Major
League Baseball ’s drug policy.  Galvis, 22, tested positive for clostebol, an anabolic
steroid, according to a statement yesterday from the office of
MLB Commissioner  Bud Selig .  “The Phillies continue to believe in and endorse Major
League Baseball’s drug policy,” the team said in an e-mailed
release. “We also support Freddy Galvis in his determination to
put this matter behind him and we look forward to his return as
a productive member of the Phillies as soon as possible.”  The team also released a statement on Galvis’s behalf in
which the second baseman said a “trace amount” -- 80 parts in
a trillion -- of the substance was found during the test.  “I am extremely disappointed in what has transpired,” he
said. “I cannot understand how even this tiny particle of a
banned substance got into my body. I have not and never would
knowingly use anything illegal to enhance my performance.”  Galvis apologized to fans, and accepted baseball’s
punishment.  A native of  Venezuela , Galvis is hitting .226 with three
home runs and 24 runs batted in over 58 games in his first MLB
season. He had been filling in at second base for the injured
 Chase Utley  until injuring his back, and has not played since
June 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
