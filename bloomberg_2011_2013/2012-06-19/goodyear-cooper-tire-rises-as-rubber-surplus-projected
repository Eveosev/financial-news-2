Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT)  and
 Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB)  rose as a global rubber deficit is
projected to turn into a surplus in the second half, driving
down the price tiremakers pay for the raw material.  Goodyear, based in Akron,  Ohio , increased 6 percent to
$11.58 a share at 10:46 a.m. in New York, the largest intraday
increase since May 16. Cooper Tire, based in Findlay, Ohio, rose
3.1 percent to $17.22 after increasing as much as 4 percent.  The rubber surplus will reach 402,000 metric tons in the
second half, from a 134,000-ton deficit in the first six months,
said Chris Pardey, a former commodities trader at Cargill Inc.
and Noble Group Ltd.  Futures, which entered a  bear market  last month, will drop
a further 20 percent to 200 yen a kilogram ($2,534 a metric ton)
in Tokyo by the end of the year, the lowest since October 2009,
according to the median of 15 analyst and trader estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. This quarterâ€™s 23 percent decline is the
worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
