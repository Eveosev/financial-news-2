Construction of residential housing
units in Tehran increased by 53 percent to a record high in the
last Iranian year,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported.  Some 229,000 residential units were built in the Iranian
capital in the year ending on March 19, the Tehran-based
newspaper reported. The last time the city’s housing market
recorded such a boom was five years ago where the number of
housing units reached an annual 183,000, the paper reported,
without citing anyone.  Last year’s boom in construction will increase Tehran’s
housing capacity by 10 percent, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
