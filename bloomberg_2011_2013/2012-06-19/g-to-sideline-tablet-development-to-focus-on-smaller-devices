LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s No.
4 mobile-phone maker, will sideline tablet computer development
to focus more on smaller devices rather than compete head-on
with Apple Inc.’s iPad.  “We’ve decided to put all new tablet development on the
back burner for the time being in order to focus on
smartphones,” Ken Hong, a spokesman for Seoul-based LG, said in
an e-mailed response to queries.  LG introduced its second tablet named Optimus Pad LTE
earlier this year as rivals including Samsung Electronics Inc.,
maker of Galaxy tablets and smartphones, sought to challenge the
iPad.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  unveiled a Windows-powered tablet called
Surface yesterday, entering an Apple-dominated market projected
to grow to $78.7 billion this year, according to an estimate by
research firm DisplaySearch.  “LG doesn’t see Surface competing with anything we’re
focusing on at the moment,” Hong said.  The electronics maker is trying to turn around its mobile-
phone business with its Optimus line of Android-powered
smartphones after being overtaken by  Apple (AAPL)  as the No. 3 handset
maker last year. LG, which also makes Windows-based PCs, is
still open to making phones using Microsoft software, Hong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
