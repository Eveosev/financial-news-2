South Korean taxi drivers began
their first nationwide strike today, demanding a fare increase
and the right to burn diesel amid rising fuel costs.  The 28 percent surge in the past three years in prices for
the liquid petroleum gas taxis are required to burn and a 2,400
won ($2.07) cap on initial fares since 2009 are squeezing
drivers’ income, according to Kim Do Gil, a spokesman for the
 taxi association  leading the walkout. The organization has
160,000 members and is coordinating the one-day strike with two
other labor unions and an association representing a total of
130,000 drivers.  Without cabs, traffic on Sejong road, a main artery through
Seoul’s downtown, flowed unobstructed at 11:20 a.m. in the city.
As of 9 a.m. only 16 percent of cabs were still operating
nationwide, said Kim Hak Weon, an official at the  transport
ministry . In Seoul, the nation’s capital, 8,800 taxis out of
73,000 units are in operation, he said.  “I plan to join the strike and a gathering of union
members,” said Shin Bong Seok, 61, who’s driven a  Hyundai Motor
Co. (005380)  Elantra taxi for 12 years in Seoul. “There are just so many
problems to solve.”  Transport agencies across the country scheduled more trains
and buses to help commuters.  In Seoul, where the subway and buses ran an hour longer
until 2 a.m. this morning, the transport ministry said plans
include the addition of 255 train services, plus 988 long-
distance buses and 2,773 local buses.  Negotiations Stalled  Talks between the government and taxi drivers last took
place on June 12 and ended without a resolution, according to
Kim at the taxi association. The government is examining the
demands, said Kim at the  transport ministry .  Cab drivers, required by the government to run their
vehicles on LPG, are also demanding they be allowed to use other
fuels such as diesel, according to the taxi association.  The starting fare for taxis in  South Korea  is 17 percent
cheaper than in  New York  City and 77 percent cheaper than in
 Tokyo , based on yesterday’s exchange rates. After the first 2
kilometers, the meter will add 100 won every 144 meters (157
yards) or 35 seconds, according to the  Korea Tourism
Organization ’s website.  City Hall  Drivers in Seoul will gather in front of  City Hall  to voice
their demands for higher fares, the stabilization of LPG prices,
the use of alternative fuels and to make taxis eligible for
state subsidies, said Kim at the association. They’re also
asking the government to reduce the number of taxi licenses and
compensate drivers who choose to leave the industry, he said.  As few as 20,000 Seoul taxi drivers may choose to give up a
day’s earnings and participate in the strike, according to
estimates by Kang Sang Wook, a researcher at the  Korea Transport
Institute , a government owned transport policy adviser.  The price drivers pay for LPG increased to 1,145 won per
liter in April, from 900 won per liter in March 2009, according
to a report on the taxi association’s website.  Prices for LPG increased 8.9 percent during the first four
months this year, according to data from  Korea National Oil Corp. 
That compares with a 4.6 percent increase in gasoline and 1.4
percent gain in diesel prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
