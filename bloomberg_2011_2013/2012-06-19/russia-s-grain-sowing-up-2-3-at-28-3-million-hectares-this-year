Russia’s spring grain and legumes
sowing grew 2.3 percent year-on-year to 28.3 million hectares
(70 million acres) as of June 1, the Federal State Statistics
Service said.  About 850,800 hectares, or 11 percent, of the area sown
with winter grains and legumes by large agricultural companies
was lost, the service, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s up from 7.8 percent, or 611,900
hectares, last year, it said.  The total area sown with spring and winter grains and
legumes by large agricultural producers rose 0.4 percent to 31
million hectares for the new season, the service said.  Sunflower planting dropped 15 percent to 5.9 million
hectares, and sugar beets fell 9.3 percent to 1.1 million
hectares, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
