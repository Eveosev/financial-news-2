Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim
Ortakligi AS (EKGYO) ,  Turkey ’s largest real-estate investment trust, may
not meet sales targets this year after May numbers disappointed,
Tera brokers said in an e-mailed report today.  “As of the first five months of the year, Emlak Konut
achieved 32 percent of our year-end unit sales estimate,” the
Istanbul-based brokerage said in the report to clients today.
“The upcoming launches of new projects will be crucial for
Emlak Konut’s sales to converge to our estimate; yet the risk is
on the downside.”  Emlak Konut, which is owned by the Turkish state housing
agency Toki, reported yesterday that it sold 489 housing units
in May, 27 percent fewer than in the same month last year. So
far this year, unit sales are down 45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
