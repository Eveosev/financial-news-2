Spanish  10-year bonds  erased a
decline after the nation sold 3.04 billion euros ($3.8
billion)of bills, compared with a maximum target of 3 billion
euros the Treasury set for the first auction since the nation
agreed to a European bailout for its banks.  The yield on the 10-year security was little changed at
7.15 percent as of 9:49 a.m. London time, after earlier rising
four basis points to 7.19 percent.  Spain â€™s two-year notes pared a drop. The yield was four
basis points higher at 5.49 percent after climbing as much as 10
basis points to 5.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
