Following are comments from Simpson,
Spence & Young Ltd., the world’s second-largest shipbroker, on
the effect of refining margins on demand for tankers hauling
crude oil.  The company’s consulting unit commented in an e-mailed
report today. Crude is referred to as dirty in the industry,
while clean denotes refined products such as gasoline.  “In many refining centers, product-price declines have not
kept pace with recent crude-price falls. Margins have remained
firm, and in many cases improved as feedstock costs have
dropped. With oil demand increasing along with seasonal
expectations, a sustained period of firm margins could prompt
refiners to boost utilization rates, adding to crude imports and
dirty tanker demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
