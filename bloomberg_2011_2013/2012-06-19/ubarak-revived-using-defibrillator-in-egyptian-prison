Ousted Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  had to be revived and have his  heart rate  stabilized
using a defibrillator, according to Brigadier General Mohamed
Elewa, a prison department spokesman.  Mubarak, 84, was placed on an artificial respirator and
transferred from a prison’s hospital to a military hospital,
Elewa said in a telephone interview.  The former president had been held at the Cairo prison
hospital since being sentenced to life on June 2 for failing to
prevent the deaths of protesters killed during last year’s
uprising against him.  Sami Manaa, head of the prison hospital, said earlier this
month that Mubarak should be transferred because his condition
was critical and the facility was ill-equipped to treat him,
according to the Al Shorouk newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
