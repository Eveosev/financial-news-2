Chicago gasoline fell to the lowest
level in three weeks after shippers moved fuel from the  Gulf
Coast  into the region as prices surged earlier in the month.  Gasoline at the hub fell for a sixth straight day. Chicago
differentials reached the highest level in a year last week, and
shippers booked space on pipelines to bring fuel north, Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
 Kansas City , Missouri, said in a note to clients.  “Now those guys are paying the price,” he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago weakened 1.25 cents to 9 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:33 p.m. in New
York. That’s widest discount since May 24. Prompt delivery
dropped 3.13 cents to $2.5521 a gallon today.  The fuel traded at a premium of 37.5 cents to New York
futures on June 11.  The rally peaked as  BP Plc (BP/)  restarted crude unit 11A at its
Whiting refinery in  Indiana . The company planned to start the
unit a week after part of it malfunctioned, a person familiar
with operations at the plant said on June 7.  Unleaded gasoline in the Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed its
premium 7.5 cents to 16.5 cents a gallon. It has declined for
three consecutive days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
