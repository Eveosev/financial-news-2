Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.16 percent to 0.2
percent, within the Federal Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.17 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.15 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $1.5 billion to $2 billion
Treasuries maturing from August 2022 to February 2031. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
