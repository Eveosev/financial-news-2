The  Philadelphia Eagles  are planning
upgrades to their 10-year-old stadium to keep it one of the
 National Football League ’s most “fan-friendly buildings,” team
spokesman Rob Zieger said.  The  SportsBusiness Journal reports  the upgrades to Lincoln
Financial Field would include more seats and new field-level
suites, and cost between $60 million and $100 million. It cited
a proposal the Eagles issued last month for pre-construction
management services.  Zieger said the Eagles are still very early in the process
and haven’t fully evaluated all their options.  “It’s sort of like a homeowner thinking about redoing a
kitchen and tearing pages out of a magazine,” Zieger said in a
telephone interview. “We want to make sure it remains one of
the NFL’s most exciting, loud and fan-friendly buildings.”  Zieger said the team would disclose specifics about the
stadium project when they’ve been determined. The SportsBusiness
Journal said upgrades would probably be done on the facility
over the next two offseasons.  The Eagles have made six playoff appearances since opening
69,000-seat Lincoln Financial Field in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
