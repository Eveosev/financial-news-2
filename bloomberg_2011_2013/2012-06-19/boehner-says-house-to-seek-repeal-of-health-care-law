House Speaker  John Boehner  said the
Republican-led chamber will move to repeal President  Barack Obama ’s health-care overhaul law if the U.S.  Supreme Court 
doesn’t strike it down.  “Unless the Supreme Court throws out the entire Obamacare
bill, the House will move to repeal all of it,” Boehner, an
Ohio Republican, told reporters in Washington today.  The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of this
month on the health-care law, passed by a Democratic-led
Congress in 2010. The court heard arguments on the case in
March.  The U.S. House voted to repeal the health-care law in
January 2011 soon after Republicans took control of the chamber.
The measure didn’t advance in the majority-Democratic Senate.  Boehner didn’t say when the House would act. He said it
would take a “step-by-step” approach to rewrite the health-
care law to reduce costs and “ensure that the American people
go to the doctor of their choice.” Republicans haven’t offered
details on what they would do to replace the law.  House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said House Democrats think
the Supreme Court will rule the health-care overhaul is
constitutional.  “It’s our conviction that the Supreme Court is going to
uphold our plan,” Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
