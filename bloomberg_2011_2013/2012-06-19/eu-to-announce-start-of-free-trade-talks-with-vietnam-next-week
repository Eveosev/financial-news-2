The European Union will announce the
start of free-trade negotiations with  Vietnam  next week, EU
Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said.  “We will announce this with Minister Hoang next week here
in Brussels, and the first negotiating round should take place
just after the summer break,” De Gucht said at a Friends of
Europe conference today, referring to Vietnamese Minister of
Trade and Industry Vu Huy Hoang. “The potential for both sides
is enormous.”  Trade between the EU and Vietnam, one of the 10 members of
the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations , reached 18 billion
euros ($22.7 billion) last year. The 27-nation EU began free-
trade discussions in 2010 with Singapore and Malaysia, also
members of ASEAN.  An agreement with Singapore is likely this year “if both
sides make a last effort to bridge the final gaps,”  De Gucht 
said, according to an e-mailed copy of his speech. While the EU
and Malaysia are “making progress,” they “will need some more
time to get closer to the finishing line,” he said.  “After that, my door remains open,” he said. “We are
continuing our contacts with a number of other ASEAN member
states, including Indonesia, the  Philippines  and Thailand, and
Europe will be ready to move whenever they are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
