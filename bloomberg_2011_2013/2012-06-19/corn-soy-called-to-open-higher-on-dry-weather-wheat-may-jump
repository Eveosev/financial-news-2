What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 19 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts for dry weather in U.S.
growing areas, said  Jeff McReynolds , owner of McReynolds
Marketing and Investments in Hays,  Kansas . The southeastern and
eastern Midwest will see little rainfall in the next seven to 10
days, Telvent DTN said in a report today.  -- Soybean futures may open up 40 cents to 45 cents a bushel in
Chicago as dry weather threatens production, McReynolds said by
telephone. The Department of Agriculture yesterday said about 56
percent of the U.S. crop was in good or excellent condition,
down from 60 percent a week earlier. Ratings may decline further
if no rain falls on fields this week, McReynolds said.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  because of the hot weather, McReynolds said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
