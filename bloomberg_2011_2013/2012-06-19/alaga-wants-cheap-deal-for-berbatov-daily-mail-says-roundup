The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Low Bid  Malaga is planning a low bid for Manchester United striker
Dimitar Berbatov, the  Daily Mail said .  The Bulgarian player has decided to leave United, and Arab-
owned Malaga wants to bring him in for next season’s  Champions
League , the newspaper said.  The Spanish club is considering Schalke’s Klaas-Jan
Huntelaar, who is available for 18 million pounds ($28 million),
the Mail said. Berbatov, 31, could be sold for less, the
newspaper said.  Royal Russian  Reading will try to sign Russian forward Pavel Pogrebnyak,
who impressed at Fulham last season,  the Sun said.   They’ll offer 65,000 pounds a week for four years in an
attempt to price out Fulham, the newspaper said. The 28-year-old
was part of the Russian national team that failed to advance at
the European Championship.  Moses to London  Wigan winger Victor Moses may move to Chelsea as the London
club takes advantage of the player’s refusal to extend his
current contract,  the Daily Mirror said.   Chelsea are planning a 10 million pound bid, and Moses’
arrival would likely mean the end of  Daniel Sturridge ’s time
with the London team, the newspaper said.  Nani’s Replacement  United is lining up a bid for Porto winger James Rodriguez
as a potential replacement for Nani, who is saying he might
leave Old Trafford, the Mirror said.  Rodriguez, and Porto may accept a bid of 25 million pounds
for the 20-year-old Colombian, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
