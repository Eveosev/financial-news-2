Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, plans to sell $1.75 billion of 32-year
bonds as soon as today as it seeks to take advantage of record-
low overseas financing costs to fund investments.  Pemex, as the company is known, plans to sell the debt to
yield 280 basis points, or 2.8 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, according to a person familiar
with the plans. Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  are managing the sale, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak
publicly on the matter.  State-owned Pemex is boosting investment to reverse seven
years of output declines. The company pumped 2.55 million
barrels a day on average last year, compared with as much as
3.38 million barrels a day at its peak in 2004. Pemex has
quadrupled investments during the past decade to about $23
billion a year.  Yields on Pemex’s $2.96 billion of notes due in 2021
touched a record low 3.72 percent yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are piling into higher-quality
emerging-market debt amid concern  Europe ’s sovereign crisis will
derail global growth.  Pemex last issued debt in April, selling A$150 million
($153 million) of five-year notes. The new debt may be graded
Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, three levels above junk, and
one grade lower at BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
