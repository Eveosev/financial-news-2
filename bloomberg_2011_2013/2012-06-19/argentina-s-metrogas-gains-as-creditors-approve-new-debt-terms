Metrogas SA (METR)  rose the most in three
weeks after holders of the Argentine company’s bonds approved a
debt restructuring for the bankrupt gas distributor.  Metrogas, which operates in the capital city of  Buenos
Aires , advanced 7.7 percent to 0.56 peso for the biggest gain
since May 24. The Merval index rose 3.6 percent.  Investors holding about $139 million of debt unanimously
approved the terms of the restructuring, the company said
yesterday in statements to the Buenos Aires exchange. The accord
includes swapping bonds for new debt to mature in 2018, and will
comprise haircuts of 53 percent for holders of class A bonds and
47 percent for holders of class B bonds, according to documents
posted in February on the company’s website.  “This solves one of Metrogas’s main problems,” Marcelo Olguin, chief economist at Grupo SBS, said in a phone interview.
Investors may also be betting that the company is in a good
position to renegotiate tariffs that the government has frozen
since 1999 to curb inflation, he said.  Metrogas, which filed for  bankruptcy protection  in 2010,
posted a loss of 18 million pesos ($4 million) in the first
quarter of the year.  Metrogas has total outstanding debt of 1.13 billion pesos,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The gas distributor is 70 percent owned by Gas Argentino
SA, which is 55 percent controlled by  BG Group (BG/)  and 45 percent by
 YPF SA (REP) , Argentina’s largest oil company, which the government
nationalized in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
