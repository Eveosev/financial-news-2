Cyprus’s finance minister, Vassos Shiarly, said the formation of a Greek government “which will
retain  Greece  within the euro area” will help recapitalization
of the Cypriot banking system.  “The establishment of a government in Greece is likely to
be very helpful to us, to see in which direction we are going,”
the minister told reporters in Nicosia today. “This is expected
to be a very positive development.”  Recapitalization of the island’s banks will go ahead as
planned, Shiarly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
