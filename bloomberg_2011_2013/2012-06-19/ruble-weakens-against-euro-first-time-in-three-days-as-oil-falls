The ruble lost the most against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket in almost a week as
Greek steps toward renegotiating its bailout austerity measures
hurt prices for oil,  Russia ’s main export.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 36.335
against the basket by the close in Moscow, the biggest loss
since June 14. The country’s 28 billion rubles ($858 million) of
bonds due 2027 fell, increasing the yield by three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.89 percent.  Urals retreated 0.5 percent to $93.88 per barrel after
 Evangelos Venizelos , head of  Greece ’s Pasok party, said he
agreed with the leader of the Democratic Left party to put
together a team to renogotiate some of the terms included in the
country’s international rescue.  “It’s in line with the headlines from  Europe , and the
major driver is oil,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp.,
said by e-mail. The selloff will probably continue unless global
sentiment improves, he said.  The ruble dropped 0.7 percent to 41.0925 per euro and was
little changed at 32.4425 per dollar. Investors pared bets on
the currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing
the ruble at 32.9212 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.9845 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
