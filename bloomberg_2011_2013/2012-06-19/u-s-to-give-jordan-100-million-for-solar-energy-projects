The U.S. will give Jordan a $100
million grant to finance a project to generate power from solar
energy, Al Arab Al Yawm reported.  The project will help the kingdom to save about 60,000 tons
of fuel derivatives a year that are used for power generation,
the Amman-based newspaper reported, citing an  unidentified
official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
