Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) , the third-largest
U.S. drugstore chain, said it agreed to pay as much as $20.9
million to resolve allegations that it misclassified certain
managers as being exempt from laws requiring they be paid for
overtime.  The accord, which is subject to court approval, resolves
claims for damages dating back as far as 2002 and covers more
than 6,000 current and former associates, the company said in an
e-mailed statement. The company faced 15 lawsuits.  “This is an excellent result for the present and former
Rite Aid assistant managers and co-managers who will
benefit from it because the settlement will provide a definite
and sure recovery long before any possible payment could be
achieved through continued litigation,” said Seth Lesser, lead
plaintiffs’ counsel. “The settlement, if approved, will avoid
the possibility of adverse rulings or even no recovery at all.”  The company and lawyers for the workers believe the
settlement is fair and reasonable, according to the company’s
statement.  Rite Aid said it believes that its previous classification
of assistant managers and co-managers as exempt was lawful and
denied any wrongdoing in the global settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
