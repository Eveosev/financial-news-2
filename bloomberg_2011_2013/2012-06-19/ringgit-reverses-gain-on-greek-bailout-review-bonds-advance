Malaysia’s ringgit fell, reversing
an earlier gain, after Greek leaders formed a group to
renegotiate an international bailout, adding to concern the
European debt crisis may worsen.  A national team will review the terms of the aid plan,
 Evangelos Venizelos , the head of Greece’s Pasok party, said in
Athens in comments carried live on state-run television today.
Emerging-market nations including China and Brazil formalized
funding pledges to the  International Monetary Fund  after a two-
day summit in Mexico, helping to almost double its lending power
to protect the world economy from a slowdown caused by Europe.  “There’s talk that Greek leaders are forming a group to
renegotiate the bailout austerity program and that rattled the
market,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a Kuala Lumpur-based
currency strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “This new
government is facing hiccups.”  The ringgit fell 0.1 percent to 3.1600 per dollar as of
4:49 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose as much as 0.2 percent earlier. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was little changed at 8.40 percent.  Government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 3.58 percent
notes due September 2018 declined three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.37 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
