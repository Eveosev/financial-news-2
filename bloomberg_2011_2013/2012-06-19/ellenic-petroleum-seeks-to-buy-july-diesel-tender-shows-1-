Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) , Greeceâ€™s
largest refiner, issued a tender to buy one cargo of diesel for
next month, according to a document received by Bloomberg News.  The company is seeking 30,000 metric tons of ultra-low-
sulfur  diesel  for delivery to either Aspropyrgos, Elefsis or
Piraeus from July 3 to July 10, according to the document. The
tender closes tomorrow at 1 p.m. local time.  The refiner will restore full commercial production at its
100,000 barrel-a-day Elefsis facility by the end of July, a
company official said earlier today by telephone from  Athens ,
declining to be identified in line with company policy.  Units are coming on stream gradually after improvements to
the refinery, and the plant is scheduled for a complete
resumption of commercial processing by the end of next month
after completing an upgrade which will reduce production of
heavy  fuel oil  and maximize yields of middle distillates, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
