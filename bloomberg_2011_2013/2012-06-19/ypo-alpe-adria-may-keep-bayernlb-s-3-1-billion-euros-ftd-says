Hypo Group Alpe Adria, a former unit
of BayernLB, is considering keeping the 3.1 billion euros ($3.9
billion) it received in its 2009 bailout from BayernLB, FTD
reported, citing the head of the supervisory board of HGAA,
Johannes Ditz.  HGGA has hired legal advisers to clarify whether the money
qualifies as “hidden equity” that wouldn’t need to be repaid,
FTD said. BayernLB insists on getting the funds back, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
