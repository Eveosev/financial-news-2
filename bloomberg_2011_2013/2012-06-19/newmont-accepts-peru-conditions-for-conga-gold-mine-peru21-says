Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  agreed to
relocate waste dumpsites from its Minas Conga gold and copper
project in Peru to meet conditions set by the government,  Peru21 
reported, citing unnamed government and mining industry
officials.  The accord aims to allow Newmont to resume output after
environmental protests halted operations at the mine for the
past 19 days, the Lima-based newspaper said.  Omar Jabara , a Newmont spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to telephone calls and an e-mail seeking comment.
Newmont hasn’t notified its Peruvian office of any decision,
Lima-based spokesman Roberto del Aguila said in a telephone
interview.  Roque Benavides, chief executive officer of  Cia. de Minas
Buenaventura SAA , Newmont’s partner in the Conga project,
declined to comment at a conference in  Lima  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
