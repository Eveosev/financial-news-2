New Jersey  Governor Chris Christie
said he supports a proposed $750 million bond referendum for
college capital projects that is moving through the Legislature.  The measure, which was advanced yesterday by the Senate
Budget Committee, would ask voters in November to approve
borrowing to fund the construction of classrooms, labs and other
academic buildings. Another bill would direct $540 million of
unused bonding capacity for the same purpose, bringing the total
investment to as much as $1.3 billion.  New Jersey sends more students to out-of-state colleges
than any other in the U.S. and has lost many of its best talent
when they remain in other cities after graduation, Christie said
at a town-hall meeting in Cedar Grove today.  “We need to make New Jersey better from a higher education
perspective,” said Christie, 49, a first-term Republican. “If
we do, not only will it be good for education, but we’d keep
families together.”  New Jersey last sold general-obligation debt to fund
college construction in 1988. This  bond ac t is sponsored by
Republican and Democratic leaders in both houses of the
Legislature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
