(Corrects time of Eurogroup meeting in first paragraph.)  A new Greek finance minister will
need to secure financing of as much as 31 billion euros ($39
billion) at a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in
 Luxembourg  this week, To Vima reported, without saying how it
got the information.  Greece will ask for payment of the remaining 1 billion
euros of the countryâ€™s latest loan tranche, withheld in May, and
push to secure 25 billion euros needed for the bank
recapitalization plan, the newspaper said.  This will give Greece enough cash to cover its financing
needs through the end of July and give it time for talks with
the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  to secure a further 5 billion euros
of funding, To Vima said.  Giorgios Zanias, the finance minister in the caretaker
government, is likely to accompany the new finance minister to
Luxembourg for the talks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
