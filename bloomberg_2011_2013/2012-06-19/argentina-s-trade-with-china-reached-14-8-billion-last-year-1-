Trade between  Argentina  and China
reached $14.8 billion in 2011, including $5 billion that the
Asian country bought in agriculture goods, said Yin Hengmin,
China’s ambassador to Argentina.  “You see the importance of agriculture trade between both
countries,” Yin told reporters today in Buenos Aires. “In the
future, there will be more trade in this sector because
Argentina has a potential to boost its exports to China.”  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will travel to Buenos Aires from
June 23 to June 25 to sign cooperation accords with Argentina’s
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Yin said. Wen will
also visit Brazil, Uruguay and Chile.  China is the biggest buyer of Argentine farm goods and its
second-biggest trade partner, Yin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
