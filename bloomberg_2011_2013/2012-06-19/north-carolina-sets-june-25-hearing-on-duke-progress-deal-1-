The North Carolina Utilities
Commission will hold a June 25 hearing on  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s
proposed $17.9 billion takeover of  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)   The hearing will allow NC Warn, an advocacy group, to
cross-examine company and regulatory staff witnesses, according
to an order issued by the commission today. The commission
rejected a request by NC Warn to present more testimony and
evidence and receive additional testimony.  The merger plan won approval from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission on June 8. The companies have said they
plan to complete the takeover by July 1.  Duke is still working to meet the scheduled deadline, Tom
Williams, spokesman for Duke, said in a telephone interview.  “We think the hearing will go well, and we will be able to
respond adequately to any concerns raised,” Williams said.  The deal would create the largest U.S. utility owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
