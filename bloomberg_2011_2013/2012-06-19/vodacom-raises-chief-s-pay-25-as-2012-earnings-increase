Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the biggest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, raised
Chief Executive Officer Pieter Uys’s pay 25 percent, in line
with an increase in fiscal-year earnings.  Salary, benefits and bonuses for Uys totaled 16.5 million
rand ($2 million) in the 12 months through March compared with
13.2 million rand a year earlier, Johannesburg-based Vodacom
said in its  annual report  published yesterday.  Vodacom, which is majority-owned by Newbury, England-based
mobile-phone company  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , posted a 23 percent
increase in full-year net income to 10.1 billion rand as
customer numbers in the company’s five national markets jumped
30 percent to 47.8 million.  Uys’s base salary was raised 5.3 percent to 7 million rand,
while the short-term bonus was increased 46 percent to 9.4
million rand.  South Africa ’s annual inflation rate is about 6.1
percent.  The company awarded Uys incentive performance shares to the
value of 9.3 million rand, exercisable starting in June 2015,
Vodacom said in a separate statement. Designated Chief Financial
Officer Ivan Dittrich received 7.3 million rand worth of shares,
also exercisable in 2015. Dittrich will join the company in
July, Vodacom said on Jan. 18.  Sipho Maseko, the former managing director of Vodacom’s
South African unit, received remuneration of 8.6 million rand
for the seven months of the fiscal year that he worked for the
group. Included in Maseko’s salary was a 2.7 million-rand
“sign-on” payment to compensate him for a bonus he would have
received at his previous employer, Vodacom said.  Maseko joined Vodacom in September from  BP Southern Africa
(Pty) Ltd. (BP/) , where he was CEO. He resigned on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
