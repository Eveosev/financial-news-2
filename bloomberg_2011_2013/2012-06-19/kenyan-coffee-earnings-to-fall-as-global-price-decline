Kenya ’s coffee earnings are forecast
to decline this year even as output will probably rise at least
37 percent as a drop in world prices curbs revenue, the head of
the country’s industry regulator said.  Coffee-export earnings in the year through September may
decline 8 percent to 22 billion shillings ($261 million),
Wanjira Njeru, the Coffee Board of Kenya’s managing director,
said in a June 18 interview in the capital, Nairobi. Production
is forecast to increase to more than 50,000 metric tons, Njeru
said. That compares with 36,629 tons last year.  “We expect production to increase because farmers are
using the money they earned last year to invest in inputs
including fertilizer, mostly, and fungicides,” she said. An
estimated one-fifth of the crop is smuggled out of the country
by middlemen seeking higher prices than those available at the
Nairobi auction and isn’t captured in the official statistics,
she said.  Kenya produces arabica, which has tumbled 33 percent since
the East African nation’s season started in October and touched
a two-year low of $1.501 a pound on June 18 on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York , on concern that  Europe ’s faltering economy will
curb demand as global supplies climb.  While Europe has traditionally bought about 70 percent of
Kenya’s coffee, imports into North Africa, the  Middle East ,  Asia 
and  Russia  are growing and the U.S. is boosting purchases of
specialty beans, Njeru said. The board is also trying to lift
domestic sales through marketing campaigns vying against the
widespread popularity of tea, she said.  Kenya, the world’s largest exporter of black tea, consumed
7.6 percent of the coffee it produced in 2010, according to the
 International Coffee Organization ’s  website .  Arabica coffee for September delivery gained 1.5 percent to
1.538 a pound by 5:34 p.m. in Nairobi yesterday. Kenya’s
benchmark coffee grade sold for an average of $263.34 per 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag at a Nairobi Coffee Exchange auction
yesterday, down from $279.86 a bag a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
