The former Soviet republics of
 Azerbaijan  and Turkmenistan exchanged barbs over a disputed
oilfield in the Caspian Sea.  Turkmenistan’s Foreign Ministry accused the Azeri Border
Service of taking “illegal action” against a Turkmen civilian
vessel carrying out seismic exploration in a Caspian section
that “had nothing to do with Azerbaijan.”  In a statement released by the Turkmen embassy in the Azeri
capital of Baku today, the ministry said Turkmenistan would take
“adequate measures” if Azerbaijan continued the
“provocations.”  In an e-mailed statement yesterday, the Azeri Foreign
Ministry accused Turkmenistan of violating a 2008 agreement on
suspending all exploration at the Kapaz field, also known as
Serdar, before the dispute is resolved. It threatened to take
“appropriate measures to defend Azerbaijan’s sovereign rights
in the Caspian” if Turkmenistan didn’t stop.  The field, located on the border between the Azeri and
Turkmen sections of the  Caspian Sea , has been claimed by both
countries after the disintegration of the former  Soviet Union  in
1991. The five littoral states, Russia, Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan ,
Turkmenistan and Iran, have failed to agree on the maritime
boundaries of the sea despite extensive talks in the past 20
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
