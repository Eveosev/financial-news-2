Australia’s dollar halted a two-day
advance against the yen as rising borrowing costs in  Spain 
renewed fears that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening.  The so-called Aussie failed to extend a four-day gain
versus the dollar before Spain sells bonds tomorrow. The  Federal
Open Market Committee  will conclude a meeting today, amid
speculation policy makers will signal additional measures to
support U.S. growth. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi,
fell against its U.S. and Japanese counterparts after data
showed the nation’s current-account deficit widened more than
economists estimated.  “I can’t see that the European developments are turning in
a very positive direction,” said  Thomas Harr , the Singapore-
based head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc. In currencies such as the Aussie and kiwi “I
don’t think you will see a sustained risk rally,” he said.  The Australian dollar slid 0.1 percent to 80.35 yen as of
3:47 p.m. in Sydney. It was little changed at $1.0185 from
yesterday, when it climbed to $1.0201, the strongest level since
May 8. The kiwi dropped 0.4 percent to 79.52 U.S. cents, and
fell 0.5 percent to 62.73 yen.  Australia ’s 10-year bond yield rose 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 3.09 percent. New Zealand’s two-year
swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose
2 1/2 basis points to 2.7 percent.  Yields Climb  Spanish 10-year yields were at 7.04 percent yesterday.
Greece, Ireland and Portugal sought bailouts when their
benchmark borrowing costs topped 7 percent. Spain is scheduled
to sell bonds due in 2014, 2015 and 2017 tomorrow.  Fed policy makers will review new forecasts as they
continue a two-day meeting today. A survey of 21 primary dealers
who trade with the U.S. central bank showed 12 expect some form
of added stimulus, while 9 expect no action.  “The market has built in strong expectations for some sort
of policy action from the FOMC,” said  Andrew Salter , a
strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in
Sydney. “If we get some sort of flag by the  Federal Reserve  to
additional purchases, then that would be a positive for the
Aussie.”  The Australian dollar has declined 0.7 percent in the past
three months, Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes show. Its
New Zealand counterpart has fallen 0.6 percent, according to the
gauge, which tracks 10 developed-nation currencies.  A report today by  Statistics New Zealand  showed the
nation’s current-account  shortfall  was 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31. That compares with
the 4.6 percent forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
