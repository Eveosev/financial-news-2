Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel returned a Hungarian state award after officials paid
homage to a writer who was a member of the Nazi-allied Arrow
Cross regime during World War II, the  Associated Press  reported.  “I hereby repudiate the Grand Cross Order of Merit”
received in 2004, the AP said yesterday, citing a letter Wiesel
wrote to Laszlo Kover, Hungary’s speaker of parliament. Kover
was among officials who attended a May 27 memorial ceremony to
honor writer Jozsef Nyiro in the ethnic Hungarian part of
 Romania , where Wiesel was born, the AP said.  “It is with profound dismay and indignation that I learned
of your participation,” along with Hungarian Secretary of State
for Culture Geza Szocs and Gabor Vona, the leader of the far-
right Jobbik party, the AP cited Wiesel as writing to Kover.  “I don’t believe in collective guilt, but I do believe in
taking a position about matters that happen today,” said
Wiesel, whose parents and sister were sent to Nazi death camps
by wartime Hungarian officials, according to the AP. “To
celebrate and honor leaders of fascist  Hungary  is wrong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
