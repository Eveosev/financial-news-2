OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  jumped to a
one-month high after  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding asked
the board to consider buying back as much as 2 percent of its
stock, according to two people with knowledge of the request.  Norilsk added 1.9 percent to 5,387 rubles by 2:23 p.m. in
Moscow, the highest intraday level since May 12.  Interros, which controls 28 percent of Norilsk, wants the
board to look at various measures, including a buyback, to boost
the capitalization of the world’s biggest nickel producer, the
people said, declining to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Interros also asked the board to have management start the
process of canceling a 10 percent stake in Norilsk that its
units hold after previous buybacks, the people said. Those
affiliates may be liquidated, they said.  Norilsk may have shareholders vote on canceling the stock
by the end of this year, Potanin told reporters in May.  The board will consider measures on supporting Norilsk’s
capitalization at a June 28 meeting, according to a company
regulatory filing late yesterday, which didn’t give details.  Anton Muravyev, an Interros spokesman, declined to comment,
as did Alisa Fialko, a Norilsk spokeswoman. United Co. Rusal,
which holds 25 percent of Norilsk, didn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
