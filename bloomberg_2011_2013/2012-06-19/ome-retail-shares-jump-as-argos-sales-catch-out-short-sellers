Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  rose the most
in more than three years in London trading as first-quarter
sales at the Argos chain beat estimates, catching out short
sellers.  The shares advanced as much as 16 percent, the steepest
gain since November 2008. According to  Data Explorers , about 22
percent of  Home Retail ’s stock is held by short sellers, who
borrow shares to sell in the expectation of buying them back
later at a lower price. That’s the highest level in at least
five years.  Sales at Argos stores open at least a year fell 0.2 percent
in the 13 weeks ended June 2, the  Milton Keynes , England-based
company said today in a statement. The median estimate of four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for a decline of 4 percent.
The retailer also said it’s “comfortable” with analysts’
profit estimates for this year.  “This morning’s update is much better than expected,
especially at Argos, which delivered a strong performance in
consumer electronics,” said Gillian Hilditch, an analyst at
JPMorgan Cazenove with an overweight recommendation on the
stock. She said the stock is vulnerable to a short “squeeze”
in which short sellers rush to buy the stock on positive news to
limit their losses.  Home Retail was up 15 percent at 85.40 pence as of 8:30
a.m. The stock is little changed this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
