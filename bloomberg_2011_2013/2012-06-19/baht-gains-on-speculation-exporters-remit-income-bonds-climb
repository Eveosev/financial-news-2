Thailand ’s baht approached the
strongest level in almost a month on speculation exporters are
converting income.  Government bonds  rose.  Overseas shipments rose 0.65 percent in May from a year
earlier after declining 3.67 percent in April, according to the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
government data that could be released as early as today. The
yield on five-year sovereign notes fell to the lowest in almost
four months as Europe’s debt crisis spurred demand for the
safest assets.  “The baht seems to get some support from companies
repatriating overseas profits,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“Sentiment itself remains fragile as  Europe ’s debt problem
still persists. That also means investors prefer bonds to
stocks, providing some support for local debt.”  The baht appreciated 0.1 percent to 31.43 per dollar as of
8:27 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 31.33 yesterday, the strongest level since
May 22. Its one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52
percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.32 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest
level since Feb. 26. It has dropped 20 basis points this month
as international funds  bought  $2.1 billion more sovereign notes
than they sold in the period through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
