Japanese companies want to set up
partnerships with Turkish enterprises operating in  Iraq ’s
energy and transport industries, said Keiichi Kohama, deputy
managing director and chief representative of the Iraq Desk at
the Japan Cooperation Center for the  Middle East  in Baghdad.  “There are so many projects on Iraq, in sectors like
transport, oil and gas, electricity and infrastructure,” Kohama
said in an interview today at the official opening of the JCCME
in Baghdad. Japanese business executives and government
officials will meet their Turkish counterparts on July 5 in
Istanbul to discuss partnerships, he said.  Japanese companies want to invest in power generation, the
oil and gas industry, health projects and infrastructure work,
Sami al-Araji, chairman of Iraq’s National Investment
Commission, said at the JCCME opening.  Iraq has the fifth-biggest gas reserves in the Middle East
and the world’s fifth-largest crude oil deposits, according to
data from  BP Plc. (BP/)  The government is seeking foreign investment
and expertise to help rebuild an economy and infrastructure
damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and underinvestment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
