U.S. auto thefts probably fell for
an eighth straight year in 2011 as security features made cars
more difficult to steal, an insurance-industry group said.  Thefts dropped 3.3 percent last year from 737,142 in 2010,
according to  preliminary data  released today by the National
Insurance Crime Bureau. Thefts fell 7.2 percent in 2010 to the
lowest levels since 1967, the NICB said, citing data from the
 Federal Bureau of Investigation .  “Manufacturers are providing much better theft protection
today, and the higher you move up the food chain with vehicles,
theft protection is enhanced,” Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the
Des Plaines, Illinois-based NICB, said in an e-mail.
“Technology is the game changer. What’s available on an entry-
level model is one thing, but what comes as standard equipment
on a high-end luxury car is quite another.”  Laredo, Texas, reduced thefts by 53 percent in two years,
according to the NICB. Laredo Police Sgt. Eduardo Garcia of the
auto-theft  task force  said the  district attorney  has helped
identify repeat offenders who are responsible for 90 percent of
vehicle thefts in the area.  “When we had a habitual offender coming in, the DA was
able to pinpoint car thieves and put them in jail for a while,”
Garcia said yesterday in a phone interview.  The New York City area, including northern  New Jersey  and
 Long Island , had 29,135 thefts last year, or about 153 per
100,000 people.  The  State College , Pennsylvania, region reported the fewest
thefts per capita of any U.S. metropolitan region for the 12th
straight year, with 47 incidents. The region with the most
thefts per capita was Fresno, California. It had about 808 cars
stolen per 100,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
