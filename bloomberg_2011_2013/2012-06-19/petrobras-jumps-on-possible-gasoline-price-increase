Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, rose to the highest in four weeks
after Energy Minister Edison Lobao signaled the government is
considering raising regulated gasoline prices.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
rose 4 percent to 19.65 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , the
highest price since May 22.  Lobao, who as recently as June 13 said Brazil wouldn’t
increase gasoline prices this year, told reporters in Rio de
Janeiro today that the government is constantly reviewing them.  “We’re permanently studying the topic and will have a
conclusion in some time,” Lobao said. “There are concerns from
Petrobras.”  Petrobras sells imported gasoline at a loss because of
price controls aimed at keeping inflation in check and will have
to raise prices at some point, Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters in  Rio de Janeiro  on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
