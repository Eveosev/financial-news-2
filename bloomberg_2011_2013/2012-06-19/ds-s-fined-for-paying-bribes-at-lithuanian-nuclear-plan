Data Systems & Solutions LCC, a U.S.
company that provides maintenance services for nuclear plants,
was fined $8.82 million for paying bribes at  Lithuania ’s
Ignalina nuclear power plant.  The company, based in Reston,  Virginia , paid officials at
Ignalina to secure contracts, the U.S. Justice Department said
in a  statement  on its website yesterday. Authorities will defer
charges in two years after the company enhances compliance and
internal controls, it said.  Lithuania closed its Soviet-built Ignalina plant in 2009 to
comply with European Union accession commitments.  DS&S was last hired to perform work at the plant in 2003,
Zilvinas Jurksus, chief executive officer at Ignalina, told the
 Baltic News Service  today. Ignalina will begin an internal
investigation of DS&S’s operations at the plant, which is still
being decommissioned, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
