Captain Alastair Cook struck a
century to lead  England  to an eight-wicket win against West
Indies in the second one-day cricket international today and an
unbeatable 2-0 series lead.  The opener scored 112, his fifth one-day ton for England,
as the hosts reached their victory target with five overs
remaining at the Oval in London.  Ian Bell hit 53 and Jonathan Trott 43 not out as England
finished on 239-2, in response to West Indies’ 238-9.  Ravi Bopara  was unbeaten on 19.  England remains unbeaten against West Indies this summer
following a 2-0 Test series victory, and a 114-run win in a
rain-shortened one-day match at the Rose Bowl in Southampton
three days ago.  Cook hit 14 boundaries in his 120-ball innings, including a
six off the ball before he was out. As he attempted to repeat
the shot he lofted the ball to Lendl Simmons off Darren Sammy’s
bowling.  Earlier, Dwayne Bravo led the visitors with 77 runs and
Chris Gayle scored 53. Gayle had 5 sixes and his departure
slowed down the Windies’ attack.  James Anderson ’s 2-38 led the English bowling attack, with
Stuart Broad 2-43.  The game has been overshadowed by the death yesterday of
Tom Maynard, an Oval-based Surrey and England Lions batsman. He
was hit by a train in southwest London.  The three-match series concludes on June 22 at Headingley
in Leeds on June 22, with a Twenty20 game two days later at
Trent Bridge in Nottingham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
