Airbus SAS may get certification
from the European Aviation Safety Agency for a new A380 wing
design by the end of June or early July, La Tribune reported,
without indicating where it got the information.  Discussions are tough and the goal is to win approval for
the new structure that will eliminate the problem of cracks in
the wing rib feet by July, the French newspaper wrote, citing a
person who wasnâ€™t identified.  To contact the reporters on this story:
