Brazil and  Argentina  may plant
record amounts of soybeans next season as improving profit
prospects spur farmers to switch fields to the oilseed and away
from grains, Oil World said.  Brazil , the world’s largest soybean grower and exporter
after the U.S., may plant 26.4 million hectares (65.2 million
acres) of the oilseed in the 2012-13 season, or 5.4 percent more
than a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said today in
an e-mailed report. The country may cut its corn planting to
14.5 million hectares, 4.1 percent less than a year earlier.  In Argentina, the world’s third-largest soybean  grower  and
exporter, farmers may plant 19.6 million hectares, up 5.8
percent from a year earlier. The country may produce a record
54.5 million to 55.5 million metric tons of soybeans. Wheat
planting may plunge by 22 percent to 3.6 million hectares, while
the corn area rises by 2.8 percent to 5.1 million hectares.  “Farmers in  South America  are getting more enthusiastic
about expanding soybean cultivation, taking advantage of the
comparatively lower production costs, in relation to grains, and
favorable price prospects,” Oil World said. “Many of them have
already started marketing their 2013 crops,” even though
harvesting won’t begin for another seven to nine months, it
said.  Soybean prices have climbed 10 percent this year on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn tumbled 20 percent and wheat
was little changed. The oilseed rallied as dry weather in the
past season hurt South American crops, while Chinese demand
increased for U.S. supplies.  Frost and Snow  Almost 1 million hectares of Argentina’s 2011-12 soybean
crop still need to be harvested, while some regions of the
country have experienced frost and snow, Oil World said. The
country’s output in the season may drop to 40 million tons, down
from 49.2 million a year earlier.  Brazil ’s 2011-12 soybean production was estimated at 65.8
million tons. Corn output at 67 million to 68 million tons will
surpass the soybean harvest “for the first time in recent
history,” Oil World said.  Argentina is the world’s second-largest corn exporter,
after the U.S., and Brazil ranks fourth, after Ukraine.
Argentina is the biggest wheat shipper in South America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
