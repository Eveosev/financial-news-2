The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  rose 1.6 percent to 38,688.65.  Mexican homebuilders jumped the most in five months as
valuations at almost a three-year low lured investors to the
industry amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may announce
more stimulus measures. The Habita index of six homebuilders
jumped 4.2 percent to 229.67 by the close of trading.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, surged 4.9 percent to 31.06 pesos.  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) ,

third-largest homebuilder, rose 5 percent to 11.78 pesos.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*)  , the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire Ricardo Salinas, surged 16
percent to 476.02 pesos. In filings today, Elektra said it has
cut by more than a third the shares represented by the
derivatives since it last disclosed the figure a year ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
