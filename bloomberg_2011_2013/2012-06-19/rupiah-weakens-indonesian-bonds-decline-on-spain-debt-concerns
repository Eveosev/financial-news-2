Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a second
day and  government bonds  declined after Spain’s borrowing costs
rose, adding to concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen and
damping appetite for emerging-market assets.  Spain’s 10-year yields surged above 7 percent to reach
euro-era records after it reported that bad loans jumped in
April to the highest since 1994. Greek politicians begin a
second day of talks to form a coalition government that can
implement austerity measures tied to a 240 billion euro ($303
billion) bailout.  “The concern has moved from  Greece  to larger economies
like Spain and Italy, which weighs on the rupiah,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia in Jakarta. “We see strong dollar demand constantly
as even domestic investors and corporates prefer the dollar over
the rupiah to avoid  currency risk  during uncertain times.”  The rupiah dropped 0.9 percent to 9,470 per dollar as of
4:24 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 12
percent.  Indonesia raised 6.85 trillion rupiah ($728 million) from a
 debt auction  today, exceeding its 5 trillion rupiah target, with
investors bidding for 1.9 the amount on offer, according to the
debt management office.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.38
percent, after reaching a one-month low of 6.36 percent
yesterday, according to the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
