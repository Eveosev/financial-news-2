Spain ’s government said it is
sticking to its plan to publish an audit of banks’ balance
sheets in July, denying it would postpone the report by two
months.  The government is keeping the initial deadline of July 31
for the publication of reports by four auditors, said an Economy
Ministry official, who asked not to be named in line with
government policy. Officials at the ministry in Madrid had
declined to comment earlier on reports by Expansion newspaper
and Bloomberg News that the audits would be delayed until
September.  Officials decided to give PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG Europe LLP more time to
carry out their assessment of the balance sheets of Spain’s 14
main banking groups, a person familiar with the plans said
today. The results of a separate  stress test  by Oliver Wyman
Ltd. and Roland Berger Strategy Consultants are due by June 21.  Spanish bank losses are climbing as a second recession in
three years pushes up unemployment. Officials will use the
results of the stress test to gauge how much of the 100 billion-
euro ($126 billion) rescue package agreed with the European
Union on June 9 they will need to deploy.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending jumped to 8.72
percent in April, the highest since 1994, from 8.37 percent in
March and 6.36 percent a year ago as 4.8 billion euros of credit
soured in the month, the Bank of Spain said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
