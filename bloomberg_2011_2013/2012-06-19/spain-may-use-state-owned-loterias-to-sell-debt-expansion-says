The Spanish government is
considering using the state-owned lottery operator Sociedad
Estatal Loterias y Apuestas del Estado to issue 6 billion euros
($7.6 billion) of debt, Expansion reported.  The gaming company, which makes 3 billion euros a year in
profit, may receive a higher  credit rating  than the Spanish
sovereign helping to reduce the stateâ€™s financing costs after
government bond yields reached a record yesterday, the newspaper
reported, citing people with access to the plans without
