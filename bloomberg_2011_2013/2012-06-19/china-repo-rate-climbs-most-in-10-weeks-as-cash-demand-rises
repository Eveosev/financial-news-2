China ’s benchmark money-market rate
jumped the most in more than 10 weeks on speculation demand for
cash is rising as banks prepare to meet quarter-end requirements.  The People’s Bank of China sold 20 billion yuan ($3.1
billion) of 28-day  repurchase agreements  today at a yield of
2.75 percent, unchanged from a week ago, according to a trader
at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions. The central
bank also auctioned 60 billion yuan of three-month deposits on
behalf of the Ministry of Finance at a yield of 3.23 percent,
compared with 6.15 percent at the last sale in September 2011.  “We think market cautiousness is likely to remain ahead of
the half year-end,”  Ju Wang , a strategist at  Barclays Capital 
in Singapore, wrote in a research report today. “We expect more
easing before growth sees sustained improvement.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, rose 41 basis points, the
most since April 5, to 2.98 percent in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That was the highest level since May 14.  Home values fell in a record 54 of 70 cities tracked by the
government in May, data showed yesterday, as the eastern city of
Wenzhou led declines with a 14 percent slump from a year earlier.
This data “continues to suggest sluggishness in the economy,”
Ju said.  Financial institutions’  yuan  positions stemming from
foreign-exchange transactions with the monetary authority rose
23.4 billion yuan in May, data showed today. That compared with
a decline of 60.6 billion yuan in April and a 2011 average
purchase of 231.6 billion yuan. When the PBOC buys dollars the
positions increase and when it sells the currency they fall.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, increased five basis points to
2.65 percent in Shanghai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the 2.87 percent government bonds due
February 2013 was little changed at 2.176 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
