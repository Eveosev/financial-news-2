Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the world’s largest
maker of enzymes used to produce biofuel, led today’s biggest
gainers among Copenhagen’s benchmark stocks after Morgan Stanley
said the biobusiness unit is undervalued.  Novozymes rose as much as 1.7 percent, making it the
biggest winner in the  OMKXC20 Index (KFX)  of 20 companies. The stock
advanced 1.4 kroner, or 0.9 percent, to 162.50 kroner at 11:07
a.m. in the Danish capital.  Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novozymes plans to boost the
unit’s revenue six-fold by 2018 partly through acquisitions. The
division, which makes microorganisms used for fertilizers and
wastewater treatment, may be worth as much as 50 kroner a share,
Allen D. Wells, a London-based analyst with Morgan Stanley, said
today in a note.  “Novozymes’ biobusiness is underappreciated as a key
medium-term growth and profit driver for the group,” Wells said
in the note. He increased his price estimate on Novozymes shares
to 200 kroner from 190 kroner and repeated a recommendation to
overweight positions in the stock.  The division, which also develops biopharmaceutical
ingredients for drugmakers, had sales of about 1 billion kroner
($170 million) in 2011, according to Novozymes’ annual report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
