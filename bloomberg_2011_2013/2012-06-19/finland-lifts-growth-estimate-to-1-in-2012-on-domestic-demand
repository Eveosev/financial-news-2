Finland  raised its forecast for
economic growth as private consumption is expected to offset
slowing exports.  Gross domestic product will expand 1 percent this year, 1.2
percent in 2013, and 2.1 percent in 2014, the Helsinki-based
 Finance Ministry  said today in a report. It had in April
predicted growth of 0.8 percent for this year. The Bank of
Finland, the country’s central bank, last week forecast that the
economy will grow 1.5 percent this year.  “Exports growth will remain subdued,” the ministry said.
“Growth will come almost entirely from private consumption.”  Finland is one of the four euro countries that still retain
AAA ratings at  Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings. Finland generates 40 percent of its output from
sales abroad and has been hampered by the debt crisis sweeping
through parts of the euro area.  Government debt will grow to 51.9 percent of GDP this year
and reach 53.7 percent by the end of 2014, the ministry said,
compared with the European Commission’s forecast of a euro-area
average of 92.6 percent next year. The general government will
have a deficit of 1.6 percent this year and 1 percent next year,
the ministry said.  Finland’s 1.4 billion-euro contribution to the European
Stability Mechanism will increase public debt by 0.7 percentage
point, the ministry said. The parliament is due to vote on the
payment and the rescue fund establishing treaty on June 21.  The government led by Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  plans
2.7 billion euros in spending cuts and tax increases to reduce
debt as a percentage of GDP by the end of its term in 2015. The
budget will be “close to balance” by 2014, the ministry said.  Finland’s 10-year benchmark bond yielded 1.84 percent today
as 11:18 a.m., compared with a record low of 1.442 percent on
June 1. The difference with a similar-maturity German bond was
little changed at 38 basis points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
