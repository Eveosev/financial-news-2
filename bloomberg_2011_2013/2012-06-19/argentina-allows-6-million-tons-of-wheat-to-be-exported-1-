Argentina  will allow the export of 6
million tons of wheat as the government eases restrictions on
foodstuffs, Argentine Vice President  Amado Boudou  said.  The quota “allows more certainty and predictability” for
farmers to sell their produce, Boudou said in a televised press
conference today.  Argentina’s wheat crop for 2012-2013 may decline as farmers
suffer drought in some areas and others elect to plant
alternative crops or cheaper seeds, the  Buenos Aires Cereals
Exchange  said in a June 14 report. Argentina’s 2011-2012 wheat
crop declined 16.5 percent to 13.2 million metric tons compared
with the year before, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her
predecessor and former husband Nestor Kirchner have restricted
exports of beef, corn and wheat since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
