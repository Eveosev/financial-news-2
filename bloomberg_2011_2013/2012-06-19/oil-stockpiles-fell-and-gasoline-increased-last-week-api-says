stockpiles rose 1.07 million to 204.9 million.  Crude at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , rose 625,000 barrels
to 48.1 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory

1.3 million barrels last week, according to the median of 11
responses in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Gasoline
