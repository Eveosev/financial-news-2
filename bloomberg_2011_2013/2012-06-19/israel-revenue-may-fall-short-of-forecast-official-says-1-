Israel ’s 2012 revenue may fall short
of the revised January forecast of 221 billion shekels ($57.3
billion), a  Finance Ministry  official said.  Revenue from January through May totaled 93 billion
shekels, 3 billion shekels less than the forecast for that
period, Frida Israeli, director of state revenue, told the
Knesset Finance Committee today.  “There is a reasonable chance that we won’t be able to
meet the forecast,” said Israeli. “We are lagging behind.”  Israeli growth is expected to slow to 3.2 percent for the
year from 4.8 percent in 2011, according to the Finance
Ministry’s January forecast. The ministry lowered its economic
growth forecast in January from 4 percent and its revenue
forecast from 232.3 billion shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
