Nigeria LNG Ltd., Africa’s biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas, tendered to sell two
additional cargoes of the fuel on the  spot market  next month,
three people with knowledge of the matter said.  The first shipment is scheduled to load at Nigeria LNG’s
Bonny Island plant in the Niger River delta from July 9 to July
10, the people said, declining to be identified because the
information isn’t public. A second tanker is due to load July 20
to July 22, they said.  The shipments are worth more than $59 million each, based
on the World Gas Intelligence spot prices published June 13 for
northeast Asia of $17.85 a million British thermal units.
Nigeria also offered cargoes on June 27, July 1 and July 5,
people familiar with the tenders said last week.  The deadline for bids for both cargoes is tomorrow. Each
shipment is for 140,000 cubic meters of LNG, the people said,
citing tender documents.  Siene Allwell-Brown, a spokeswoman for Nigeria LNG in
Lagos, couldn’t confirm the latest loadings when contacted today
by telephone.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 49 percent of
Nigeria LNG, according to the company’s  website .  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  has a 25.6 percent stake,  Total SA (FP)  owns a 15 percent
share and  Eni SpA (ENI)  has 10.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
