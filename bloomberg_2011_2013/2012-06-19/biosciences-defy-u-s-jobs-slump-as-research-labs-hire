Job growth in biosciences is defying
the slump in U.S. employment as a reliance by  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and
other drugmakers on outside research labs helped support the
industry through the past decade.  Biosciences added 96,000 jobs from 2001 through 2010, a
jump of 6.4 percent, the  Biotechnology Industry Organization  and
research firm Battelle said in report today during an industry
convention in  Boston . The  U.S. economy  lost about 3.6 million
private-sector jobs in that time, a decline of about 3 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Employment at laboratory companies, such as Princeton, New
Jersey-based contract researcher  Covance Inc. (CVD) , rose 24 percent
in the period and was the only area of biosciences to expand
during the 2007-2010 recessionary cycle, climbing 6.1 percent,
according to the report. Labs employed more than 450,000 people
in 2010, or almost 3 in 10 U.S. bioscience industry workers.  “This reflects the outsourcing of many research and
testing services previously done in-house by major
biopharmaceutical companies, as well as the rise of molecular
diagnostic testing,” Battelle and BIO said in the report.  A separate report by London-based Ernst & Young today found
biotechnology companies boosted research and development
spending in 2011 by 9 percent. That follows a 2 percent increase
in 2010 that was preceded by a 21 percent plummet in 2009.  Job Movement  Jeffrey Spaeder, a cardiologist, is among those who have
moved from pharmaceutical companies to contract research labs.
In 2011, he joined closely held Quintiles Transnational Corp.,
the biggest provider of testing and drug-trial services, as
chief medical and scientific officer, after working at  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  and  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)   “It is a very positive growth environment” that probably
will continue, Spaeder said in a telephone interview. “I was
very pleasantly surprised by the number of bright, experienced
people” at Quintiles, based in Durham,  North Carolina .  “Pharma companies have been downsizing multiple parts of
their organizations,” he said. “They are finding CROs are able
to provide therapeutic area expertise and clinical development
expertise that they previously had in house.”  Biosciences industry employment totaled 1.6 million in
2010, spanning 70,000 business establishments, according to the
BIO report. The five areas of the market include labs; makers of
lab equipment and medical devices; biological drugs and
diagnostic substances; fertilizers and biofuels; and product
distributors. Three areas saw employment levels drop in the
2001-2010 period.  Agricultural Biotechnology  Agriculture producers and fertilizer manufacturers, such as
Marysville, Ohio-based  Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (SMG) , fell the most
with a 5.9 percent decline, or 4,570 jobs. Employment among
medical device makers, such as Minneapolis-based  Medtronic Inc. (MDT) ,
dipped 0.3 percent, representing a loss of fewer than 1,000
jobs.  Employment at drug companies such as New York-based Pfizer
declined 3.1 percent, a loss of almost 9,400 jobs. Drugmakers
still had the highest annual wages of $99,000 in 2010, which is
20 percent more than the average biosciences worker and twice
the private sector average.  Distribution companies, including San Francisco-based
 McKesson Corp. (MCK) , saw job growth of 6 percent, adding almost
25,000 jobs.  The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June
2009, the worst contraction since World War II, took its toll on
the industry. Biosciences employment declined 1.4 percent from
2007 to 2010. All U.S. private industry jobs fell 6.9 percent
during the same period, according to the BIO report.  “While not immune from the global recession, the
bioscience industry has demonstrated that it is a generally
strong and steady job generator, growing jobs over the past
decade at a pace well above the national average,” Battelle and
BIO said in the report.  BIO, based in  Washington , is the largest lobbying group for
the biotechnology industry, with more than 1,100 members
worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
