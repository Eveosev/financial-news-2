Roularta Media Group NV (ROU) ,  Belgium ’s
biggest magazine publisher, fell the most in more than six
months in Brussels trading after saying lower  advertising
revenue  in the second quarter may cut earnings by as much as a
25 percent.  The shares fell as much as 10.7 percent in Brussels trading
and traded at 14.12 euros at 9:50 a.m. local time, down 10.3
percent on the day. The shares are down 3.3 percent so far this
year, trading at the lowest since Jan. 9.  The lower ad revenue could reduce Roularta’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 20
percent to 25 percent, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Roularta blamed “uncertainty” on financial markets
surrounding Greece and  Spain , as well as the European Football
Championship, which is having a “negative effect on advertising
for June.”  “The fact that advertising revenues are under pressure
does not come as a surprise; the apparent harshness at which
they are coming down is a surprise,” Siddy Jobe, an analyst at
Banque Degroof SA in Brussels, wrote in a research note. “Now
it seems that printed advertising has further dropped, while
also TV revenues are tumbling.” Degroof lowered its
recommendation on Roularta to hold from accumulate on the profit
warning.  Roularta said it anticipates an improvement after the
summer holidays and forecasts “spending rising again from
September onwards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
