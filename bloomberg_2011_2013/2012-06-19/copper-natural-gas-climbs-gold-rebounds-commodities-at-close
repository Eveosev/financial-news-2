The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.5 percent to 578.56 at 4:23 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.1 percent to 1431.572.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell a second day in  New York  as rising bad loans in
Spain fueled speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread
and threaten global economic growth.  Oil for July delivery, which expires tomorrow, fell as much
as 51 cents to $82.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . It was at $82.88 at 3:01 p.m.
Singapore time. It slipped 0.9 percent yesterday to $83.27, the
lowest close since June 13. The more-actively traded August
contract slid 35 cents to $83.25 a barrel today. Front-month
prices are 16 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures rose from the highest close in more
than three weeks on speculation that hotter-than-normal weather
will boost demand from  power plants  to run air conditioners.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  fell 29 cents to a premium of 42 cents
a barrel to Asian marker Dubai crude at 11:15 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
The gap narrowed for a second day.  Fuel-oil swaps for July dropped $10, or 1.6 percent, to
$600 a metric ton, PVM said. That’s the biggest decline since
June 4. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade, or the viscosity spread, was unchanged after
decreasing to $10.50. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with fuel oil used in power stations.  Naphtha swaps for July were down $11.75, or 1.5 percent, at
$757.75 a ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock slid for the first time in four days.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures lost
$12.50 to $33.36 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed for
the first time in four days.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday slumped to $18.83 a
barrel, the lowest since April 26, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. A narrowing reforming margin indicates it is less
profitable to make motor fuel.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude rose 3
cents to $15.93 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, ended a two-day losing streak.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed for an eighth day in the longest rally since
July as concern over Europe and speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will act to spur growth boosted demand for a store of value.
Futures in  India  surged to a record.  August-delivery bullion rebounded, climbing as much as 0.3
percent to $1,631.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York. It was
last at $1,630.80, after snapping yesterday the longest rally
since August. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said  Greece , which
concluded its second election in six weeks with a win by pro-
bailout parties, should not be granted leeway on bailout terms.  BASE METALS  Copper gained on speculation that a recovery in the Chinese
economy and more measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost
growth will stoke demand for commodities. Zinc and nickel also
advanced.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,544 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$7,530 at 11:27 a.m. Shanghai time. The September-delivery
contract on the Comex gained 0.2 percent to $3.4085 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Rubber fell, snapping a four-day winning streak, after
borrowing costs in  Spain  climbed to a euro-area record, fueling
concern the debt crisis is deepening.  The November-delivery contract dropped as much as 1.6
percent to 251.5 yen a kilogram ($3,184 a metric ton) before
trading at 253.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:50
a.m. The most-active contract has lost 22 percent this quarter,
the worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.  Corn was poised for its biggest two-day increase since the
start of April as U.S. crop conditions deteriorated because of
hot, dry weather in Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest producers.  Corn for December delivery rose as much as 1.6 percent to
$5.4275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
level since June 11, and traded at $5.40 by 2:08 p.m. in
Singapore. Prices have climbed 6.7 percent in two days, the most
since April 2.  Palm oil  climbed for a second day on concern that dry
weather in the main soybean growing regions in the U.S. may
damage the oilseed crop, lowering global supplies and boosting
demand for the tropical vegetable oil.  The September-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.5
percent to 2,943 ringgit ($932) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,940
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporter on this story:
