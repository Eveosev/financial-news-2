European stocks  gained for a third
day as  Greece  moved closer to forming a government and a Spanish
debt sale met targets, outweighing a bigger-than-forecast
decline in German investor confidence.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  surged 24 percent as sales at the
Argos chain beat estimates.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  jumped 6.4 percent as
first-quarter revenue increased.  SAP AG (SAP)  rose 2.1 percent after

yogurt maker cut its profitability forecast.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 1.6 percent to 248.27 at
the close in London, the highest since May 11. The benchmark
gauge has still dropped 8.9 percent from its peak on March 16
amid concern that the euro area’s debt crisis has triggered a
slowdown in global economic growth.  “The markets have stabilized now, and are waiting for more
discussion about the future of the euro zone, especially the
question of Spanish debt,” said Yves Maillot, director of
investments at Robeco Gestions SA in Paris. “The Greek election
result has been played last week, and now the markets expect a
new government, hoping for something better.”  Greek politicians are close to forming a governing
coalition and will seek relief from austerity measures imposed
as a condition for bailout loans, probable coalition partners
said.  Greek Government  “Agreement on a policy road map is the definitive point to
form a government,” Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis said
after meeting with Pasok leader  Evangelos Venizelos  in  Athens 
today. “The process is speeding up. It is possible that in the
next few hours, or within the day, a government can be
decided.”  Leaders at the Group of 20 summit in  Mexico  focused on
steps to stabilize euro-area banks, raising pressure on German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to expand rescue measures as Spain’s
borrowing costs soared to a euro-era record yesterday.  Euro members “will take all necessary policy measures to
safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve
financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns
and banks,” according to the draft provided by an official from
a G-20 government who asked not to be identified because the
statement is not yet public.  Spain sold 3.04 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of debt today,

the 18-month securities rose to 4.42 from 3.23.  FTSE, DAX  National benchmark indexes rose all the 18 western European
markets, except Iceland. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 1.7
percent, while Germany’s DAX increased 1.8 percent and France’s
CAC 40 advanced 1.7 percent.  The volume of shares trading on the Stoxx 600 today was 3.8
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  German  investor confidence  fell more than economists
forecast in June as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis weighed on

economy.  Home Retail   rallied  24 percent to 91.85 pence, the biggest
gain since the company split off from GUS Plc in 2006. Revenue
at Argos stores open at least a year fell 0.2 percent in the 13
weeks ended June 2, the  Milton Keynes , England-based retailer
said today. That compared with the median 4 percent drop of five
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Whitbread jumped 6.4 percent to 1,967 pence after saying
