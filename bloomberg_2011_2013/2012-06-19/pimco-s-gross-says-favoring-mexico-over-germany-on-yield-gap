Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said
he favors owning Mexican bonds over German bunds as the Latin
American country has lower debt levels and its notes offer
higher yields.  The data makes it a “duh” decision, according to comments
posted on the Pimco Twitter account and attributed to Gross.  To contact the reporter on this story:
