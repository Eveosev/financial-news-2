The Spanish government is planning a
second bailout of regional administrations and town halls,
lending them as much as 7 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to pay
suppliers that were excluded from an initial loan program.  The amount will be taken out of the 35 billion-euro envelop
initially set by the government to clear unpaid bills to public
suppliers, said an official for the Ministry of Regional and
Local Administrations who asked not to be named. It will cover
companies that provide goods and services to private companies
or public entities that have a contract with regions or
municipalities, he said.  The regions have already borrowed 17.7 billion euros from
the facility and the town halls 9.3 billion euros to pay direct
suppliers. The debt is guaranteed with the tax-receipt transfers
they receive from the central government. A guarantee system for
indirect suppliers will be presented in July, the spokesman
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
