A frying pan, four wooden
broomsticks and a bronze cast of instant noodles are a few of
the objects populating the “Everyday Abstract -- Abstract
Everyday” exhibition at  James Cohan Gallery  in  Manhattan ’s
Chelsea district.  Organized by Matthew Higgs, an artist and director of the
nonprofit art space White Columns, the show brings together 37
emerging, established or dead artists, working with plain
materials.  “Bleu Ciel” is an 8-by-12-foot sheet of crumpled sky-blue
paper attached to the wall. Created by Michel Francois, it fills
your entire field of vision and sets the tone for what lies
ahead.  Wolfgang Breuer folded four dry leaves and taped them to
the wall as if they were four edges of a frame, containing
nothing. Bill Jenkins’s “Bed with Rope and Fence” (2012)
consists of interlaced pieces of rusty wire and rope. The
concoction looks like a mattress spring and evokes calligraphy
and origami.  Blobs of chewing gum stuck onto four rows of rice-paper
sheets resemble a makeshift herbarium in Hannah Wilke’s 1975
“S.O.S. -- Starification Object Series (#2).”  Minimal in every way is a 4-inch branch of wisteria on a 4-
inch metal shelf by  Bill Walton  (1931-2010).  Prices range from $1,400 to $450,000. The show runs through
July 27 at 533 W. 26th St.; +1-212-714-9500;
 http://www.jamescohan.com   Brancusi Studio  Step into Romanian-born sculptor Constantin Brancusi’s
Paris studio in an exquisite exhibition at  Bruce Silverstein 
gallery.  More than 40 original gelatin silver prints made by the
artist (1876-1957) in the 1920s and 1930s depict his individual
sculptures, studio views, grouped works and self-portraits.  Arresting lighting and intimate close-ups turn these images
into an art form in its own right. Brancusi reveals, conceals
and exercises complete control over how his sculptures should be
viewed.  The carved wooden totems, cracks exposed and texture
palpable, leave a patchwork of shadows on the walls. The smooth
bronze heads gleam mysteriously. Marble “Sleeping Muse” seems
to be floating in a milky void.  Prices for individual prints range from $50,000 to
$250,000. “Brancusi: The Photographs” runs through June 23 at
535 W. 24th St.; +1-212-627-3930;
 http://www.brucesilverstein.com .  London, Tehran  Mitra Tabrizian’s large-scale photographs at  Leila Heller 
Gallery mix reality and fabrication to create an acute sense of
loneliness and displacement.  Staged in England and  Iran , they depict groups of people
and lone individuals in derelict or vacant settings.  In “City,  London , 2008,” bankers in dark suits stand in a
generic office building lobby; each stares in a different
direction as if alone.  “Untitled 2009” shows a group of mostly grim-looking
women and a few men, all in black clothes on a road by a
mountain slope. You have a sense that they are doomed but don’t
have the energy to care.  Prices for the artist, who lives and works in London, range
from 13,100 pounds ($20,587) to 42,000 pounds. The artist’s
first solo show at the gallery runs through July 7 at 568 W.
