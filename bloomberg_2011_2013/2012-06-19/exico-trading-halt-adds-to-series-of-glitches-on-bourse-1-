Mexican stocks ceased to trade for
more than 20 minutes because of what an official called
“communication issues,” the latest in a series of glitches to
halt activity on  Latin America ’s second-largest equity exchange.  Shares stopped moving at 2:11 p.m. local time and remained
inactive until 2:34 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  benchmark IPC  index of 35 Mexican companies ended
the day up 1.6 percent, after paring gains from an intraday
advance of as much as 1.8 percent.  The problem was “solved fast, but the process of rebooting
all the connections takes a little time,” Jorge Alegria, the
Mexico City-based head of markets and information at the
exchange, said in an e-mailed response to questions. He
attributed the stoppage to “communication issues.”  Today’s stoppage marked the latest in a string of
technology shortcomings, both at the bourse and at a now defunct
brokerage, that have brought Mexican  stock trading  to a
standstill at least three times since April 13. That day, late-
day transactions by Bulltick Capital Markets set off a circuit-
breaker mechanism that pulled the plug on trading. On May 31, a
surge of orders overwhelmed the exchange’s operating system and
forced it to pause trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
