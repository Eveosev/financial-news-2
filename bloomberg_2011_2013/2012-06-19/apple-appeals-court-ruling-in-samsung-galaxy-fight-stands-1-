Apple Inc. (AAPL)  can renew its bid for a
ban on U.S. sales of  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy Tab 10.1
tablet computer after an appeals court said it will let stand a
May ruling on a patent dispute between the two device makers.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit today
denied a petition by Samsung that it reconsider its ruling,
which said that Apple could pursue the ban while a patent-
infringement case is pending.  Notice  of the denial was posted on
the court’s website.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose,  California , on
June 4 refused to consider Apple’s request, because the case was
still before the Federal Circuit. With the denial today, the
appeals court will issue an order that formally sends the case
back to Koh.  Cupertino, California-based Apple claims Samsung copied the
look and features of its iPad and iPhone. It has another case
against Samsung in California in which it is trying to halt
sales of Samsung’s newest Galaxy smartphone while that lawsuit
is pending.  Apple and Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung have 30 patent
suits pending in 10 countries on four continents. It’s the
biggest fight in the global war for market share in smartphones
and tablet computers.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-1105,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.,
11-1846, U.S. District Court for the District of California ( San
Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
