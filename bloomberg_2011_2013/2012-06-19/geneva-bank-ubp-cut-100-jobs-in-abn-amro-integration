Union Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-
based wealth manager founded by Edgar de Picciotto, cut about
100 jobs after buying  ABN Amro  Bank NV’s Swiss private-banking
business last year.  “UBP is reducing staff mainly at operations level in
 information technology ” as part of its integration plan, the
firm said today in an e-mailed statement, adding that most of
the jobs affected are in Zurich.  UBP had client assets of 72 billion Swiss francs ($75.6
billion) at the end of last year following the acquisition of
ABN Amro’s Swiss unit. UBP in February agreed to buy Nexar
Capital Group, an alternative investment manager based in Paris
and New York with about $3 billion of assets under management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
