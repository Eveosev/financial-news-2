Fighting between Nigerian security
forces and Islamist militants in the northeastern city of
Damaturu continued for a second day, a police official said.  “I can’t confirm the number of casualties because the
operation is still on,” Salihu Adamu, a police spokesman in the
city, said today by phone. The Yobe state capital was hit by
multiple explosions and gunshots late yesterday during attacks
by the Boko Haram Islamist group, the military said.  The Yobe state government imposed a 24-hour curfew in
Damaturu following the attacks, Abdullahi Bego, a spokesman for
Governor Ibrahim Gaidam, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Boko Haram yesterday claimed responsibility for suicide
bombings at three churches in the northern cities of Kaduna and
Zaria on June 17 that killed scores of people. The group said it
was retaliating for alleged attacks on Muslims and mosques. The
militants began their violent campaign in 2009 and say they want
to impose Islamic law on  Africa ’s top oil producer, which is
roughly split between a mainly Muslim north and predominantly
Christian south.  About 152 people died in a similar attack on Nov. 4 in
Damaturu, said  Shehu Sani , president of the  Civil Rights
Congress . He estimated that 53 people died in the weekend
bombings in Kaduna and Zaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
