Crude-oil options volatility
declined to the lowest in three weeks as underlying futures rose
on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will do more to boost
the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.6 percent at 3:55 p.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange, down from 31.7 percent yesterday.
Volatility reached 40.6 percent on June 1, the highest level
since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for August delivery gained 75 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $84.35 a barrel on the Nymex.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  will issue
a statement following the conclusion of two days of meetings
that began today. The Fed’s Operation Twist program, in which
it’s selling $400 billion of Treasuries maturing in three years
or less and buying an equal amount of bonds with a maturity of
six years to 30 years to cap borrowing costs, is set to expire
this month.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were August $100 calls, which fell 2 cents to 8 cents a barrel
at 4:02 p.m. with 2,992 lots trading. August $90 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,986 lots changing hands as
they slipped 2 cents to 70 cents.  Calls accounted for 57 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of the 102,878 contracts
traded in the previous session. August $100 calls were the most
actively traded, with 7,380 lots changing hands. They fell 5
cents to 10 cents. The next-most active options, August $90
calls, lost 43 cents to 72 cents on volume of 5,779.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 49,971
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 39,880 lots and
December $70 puts with 37,684.  To contact the reporter on this story:
