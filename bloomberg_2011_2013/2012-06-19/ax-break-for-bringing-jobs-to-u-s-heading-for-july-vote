Senate Democrats  plan a vote next
month on a proposal to give a tax break to companies that bring
jobs and investment to the U.S and deny a deduction for those
moving jobs out of the country.  The bill, sponsored by  Debbie Stabenow  of Michigan, will
probably reach the Senate floor after lawmakers return from
their July 4 recess, said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat.  Stabenow’s legislation may serve as a counterpoint to
proposals in the Republican-led House of Representatives.
Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has said the House will vote in
July to extend for one year the expiring tax cuts on income,
capital gains, dividends and estates.  Reid hasn’t said if or when the Senate would vote on
expiring tax cuts. If Congress fails to act by the end of the
year, taxes will go up on more than 80 percent of U.S.
households.  Stabenow’s bill would give companies a 20 percent tax
credit for the expenses incurred in bringing jobs and investment
to the U.S. It would deny companies a deduction for the expense
of moving investment out of the U.S.  President  Barack Obama  has supported similar legislation
and included it in his budget.  The bill is S. 2884.  To contact the reporters on this story:
