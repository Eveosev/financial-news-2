OC Oerlikon Corp AG (OERL) , the Swiss
machinery maker that gets about half its revenue in Asia,
expects  China  sales to grow at a “double-digit” pace for the
next few years on demand for textiles equipment and gears.  The company has filled its orderbook in China for man-made
fiber machinery through 2015, Chief Executive Officer Michael Buscher said in an interview today in Shanghai, following the
opening of a new office that will oversee its global textiles
business. Oerlikon is also increasing sales of parts for drive
systems in the country, he said.  The machinery maker boosted China sales 22 percent in the
first quarter, according to a  statement , as rising wages and
production spur demand for factory equipment. The Pfaeffikon,
Switzerland-based company is also considering expansion in
Russia and  Brazil , Buscher said.  “We’re assessing other countries like Brazil, because they
have a good solid automotive industry,” he said. China, which
accounted for 28 percent of sales last year, will grow at a
“double-digit” rate, he said.  The company has no immediate plans for acquisitions or unit
sales, Buscher said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
