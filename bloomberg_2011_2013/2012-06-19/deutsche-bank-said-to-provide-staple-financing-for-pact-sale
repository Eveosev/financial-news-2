Deutsche Bank AG is advising and
providing staple financing for a potential sale of about 50
percent of Pact Group Pty, according to three people familiar
with the matter.  Under the agreement, Deustche Bank would fund at least 50
percent of the value of bids for the stake in the Australian
packaging maker, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the details are private.  Amanda Lee, an external spokeswoman for Pact Group at  FTI
Consulting Inc. (FCN) , declined to immediately comment when asked
about the sale and financing.  Reuters reported the sale on June 15, citing people it
didnâ€™t identify.  Staple financing is a pre-arranged debt package offered to
potential bidders in an acquisition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
