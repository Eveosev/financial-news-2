East African Breweries Ltd. (EABL) , the
region’s biggest beermaker, touched the highest level on record,
as investors speculated profit will increase in the year ending
this month.  The stock rose as much as 6.8 percent in intraday trading
to 235 shillings, the strongest level since at least May 1997,
before paring its advance to close at 223 shillings, the highest
price attained since Jan. 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The stock has generated good appetite from investors as
there is expectation of strong performance for the year ending
June on the back of turnaround for loss-making Serengeti
Breweries in Tanzania to breaking-even level,” Eric Musau, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview.  Kenya ’s biggest company by market value posted a 17 percent
increase in first-half profit, which advanced to 4.88 billion
shillings ($57.9 million) in the six months through December,
the Nairobi-based company said in February. Sales rose 36
percent to 27.8 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
