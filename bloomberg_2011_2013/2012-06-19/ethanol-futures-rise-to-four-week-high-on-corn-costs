Ethanol futures rose to the highest
level in almost four weeks in  Chicago  as a heat wave in the U.S.
raised corn costs for producers.  Futures jumped 1.7 percent as the dry, warm weather reduced
the yield potential for crops in the corn-rich U.S. Midwest. The
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported yesterday that about 63
percent of the nation’s corn was in good or excellent condition
as of June 17, down from 70 percent a year earlier. The grain is
the primary ingredient used to make ethanol.  “That’s exactly why the ethanol is on fire,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Futures Price Group in Chicago. “The corn is
absolutely flying. This is a weather-driven market.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery surged 3.5 cents to
$2.112 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
settlement since May 23. It has fallen 4.1 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in Chicago soared 5.5
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.095 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.155,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 3 cents to $2.18 a gallon
and in  New York  the biofuel rose 2.5 cents to $2.14.  Corn for December delivery increased 29.5 cents, or 5.5
percent, to $5.635 a bushel in Chicago. The futures have risen
11 percent in the past two sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
