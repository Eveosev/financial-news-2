Allianz SE (ALV) ’s Allianz Leben unit is
sticking to its “classical” life insurance business model
rather than sharing interest-rate risks with clients, Markus
Faulhuber, chief executive officer of the division, told
Financial Times Deutschland.  Allianz Leben’s competitors are struggling as low interest
rates make it difficult for insurers to earn enough to cover the
guaranteed payments owed to their clients, Faulhuber told the
German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
