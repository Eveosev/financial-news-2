OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest
producer of coal for steelmakers, traded at the biggest discount
in  New York  versus Moscow shares in a week, on prospects the
company will report slower growth in first-quarter sales.  Mechel (MTLR) ’s American depositary receipts slumped 2.9 percent
to $6.29 yesterday, to trade at a 0.5 percent discount to the

most-traded Russian companies was little changed at 87.78
yesterday, while the RTS  stock-index futures  dropped 0.3 percent
to 134,065.  Yandex NV (YNDX)  climbed to the highest level since March
after  Facebook Inc. (FB)  capped a three-day, 15 percent gain.  Mechel will probably report tomorrow that sales rose 0.1
percent in the first quarter, after surging 58 percent on
average during the first three months of 2010 and 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index rose at half the pace in the first quarter of
2012 compared with the previous year. The Stowe Global Coal

 Renaissance Capital , said by phone from  London . “Coal prices
have fallen globally. Everyone realizes we’ll see all that in

rallied after trading at 20.6 times estimated earnings on June

July 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer on the Bloomberg
Russia-US Index yesterday.  Yandex gained 11 percent to $18.56 in two sessions through
yesterday, the biggest such advance since January.  “Investors realize the stock is undervalued at these
levels as the ruble stabilized and Internet sector looks more

badly as people were selling both Russian risk and Internet
companies following Facebook’s unsuccessful IPO.”  The Russian currency added 0.2 percent to 32.4500 per

euro-era high yesterday.  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter and largest
producer of nickel and palladium, got almost 50 percent of
budget revenue from oil and gas sales last year.  “A correlation between the Russian markets and oil prices
is inevitable,” Andrey Trufanov, analyst at Troika Dialog in
Moscow, said by phone yesterday. “There is a direct impact of
global markets’s mood on Russian stocks, including utilities.”  Oil for July delivery fell 0.9 percent to $83.27 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices were down 19 percent
