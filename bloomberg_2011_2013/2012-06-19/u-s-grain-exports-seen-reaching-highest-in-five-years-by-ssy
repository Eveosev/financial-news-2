published June 19. Corrects  Japan  imports increase in fourth.)  Combined U.S. exports of wheat,
coarse grains and soybeans are poised to reach the highest level
since 2007 in the fourth quarter after ample harvests, said
Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd.  Shipments will come to 42.6 million metric tons, the
London-based shipbroker said in a report e-mailed today. Bumper
crops of corn, wheat and soybeans will lift exports by 12
percent from the prior period to 131.2 million tons for the
2012-13 marketing year through next June, it said, citing
figures from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . That would
still fall short of the 134.5 million tons shipped in 2010-11,
the report showed.  The predicted exports for the calendar year’s final three
months would be this century’s second-largest after the 44.1
million tons shipped in 2007’s final quarter, according to SSY.  Global imports of coarse grains and wheat by Japan will
rise by 1.3 million tons to 24.9 million for 2012-13, SSY
estimated. Coarse grains include barley and sorghum as well as
corn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
