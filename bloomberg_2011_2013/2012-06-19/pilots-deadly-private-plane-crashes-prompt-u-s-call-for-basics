The last fatal airline crash killed
50 people when a Colgan Air flight slammed into a neighborhood
near Buffalo,  New York , in February 2009. Private-plane wrecks
since then have killed 30 times as many.  The crash rate on private-pilot flights -- up 20 percent
since 2000 -- contrasts with a roughly 85 percent drop in
accidents on commercial jetliners, according to data from the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The disparity is a
dark spot on decades of aviation-safety improvements, and the
board is weighing how to make non-commercial flying less
hazardous in a two-day forum that began today.  Many so-called general aviation accidents have resulted
from pilots’ inattention to basics, according to research by a
group run jointly by industry and the federal government. Pilots
have overloaded planes, failed to check weather reports, and
made flying mistakes that caused planes to lose lift or go out
of control.  “In spite of the advances we have made in both commercial
and corporate aviation-safety records, the GA accident rate is
stubbornly stuck,” NTSB Chairman Debbie Hersman said at the
hearing. “GA pilots are not learning from the deadly mistakes
made by their brethren.”  Since the 1990s, commercial-airline crashes due to icing,
inadvertently hitting the ground, mid-air collisions, wind shear
and other causes have been almost wiped out with improved
technology and pilot training, according to NTSB accident
statistics.  Weather Report  By contrast, the types of accidents in non-commercial
flying recur even as the safety board has often called for
improvement, Hersman said.  In 2005, the board issued a study focusing on the role of
weather as a common cause of small-plane accidents, she said.  Hersman pointed to a May 20, 2011, crash in Taos,  New
Mexico , after a Beechcraft Bonanza flew into a cloud and slammed
into a mountainside. Investigators found that the pilot, who
died, hadn’t checked weather reports for the route he flew.  “Our investigators see crashes resulting from the same
causes over and over again,” Hersman said.  The accident rates for general aviation, including
corporate and instructional flights, have changed little since
2000, according to safety board  data .  12 Times  The accident rate for all general aviation was about seven
per 100,000 flying hours from 2007 through 2010. By comparison,
accidents involving private pilots in their own or rented
planes, mostly small, single-engine aircraft, averaged about 12
per 100,000 flight hours during the same period, according to
Jill Demko, an NTSB investigator who spoke at the forum.  Those numbers were broken out from the broader general-
aviation statistics. Private-flight crashes were 12 times higher
than the average rate for other types of general-aviation
flying, Demko said.  The rate of deadly wrecks in such private flying has grown
faster than accidents as a whole, up 25 percent since 2000, Earl Weener, an NTSB board member, said in an interview before the
forum. About 1,500 people have died on general-aviation flights
since the crash by  Pinnacle Airlines Corp. (PNCLQ) ’s Colgan, Weener
said.  “That’s part of the reason for the focus” of the NTSB’s
inquiry, Weener said. The board, which has no regulatory power,
recommends safety improvements to government agencies and
industry.  Losing Control  Seeking ways to stem the fatalities, industry groups and
the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration , which regulates
private flying and sets safety standards, last year used the
General Aviation Joint Steering  Committee  to study accidents.  The group found that the largest category of accidents are
those in which pilots lose control during flight, said Bruce Landsberg, head of the safety arm of the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, an advocacy group based in Frederick,
 Maryland .  Landsberg, co-chairman of the steering committee, said the
panel endorses working with the FAA to make it cheaper for small
planes to install a device that warns pilots when wings are in
danger of losing lift. Such devices are standard on commercial
airliners.  Other frequent crash causes are inadvertently flying into
the ground, loss of power and weather-related issues, Landsberg
said.  Airfield Buzzed  Human error underlies the majority of personal flight
crashes, Landsberg and Weener said.  An  accident  cited on Landsberg’s AOPA Air Safety
Institute’s website highlights how pilot miscalculations can be
deadly.  On Feb. 15, 2010, a Cessna T337G twin-engine plane crashed
near Monmouth County Executive Airport in Farmingdale,  New
Jersey , as family members of those on board watched. The three
adults and two children on the plane died.  After buzzing the airfield at high speed, the plane pulled
into a climb and a section of the right wing came off, according
to the NTSB’s findings. The plane was overloaded and flying too
fast for such a maneuver, the agency  found .  Education and training programs by Landsberg’s group and
flying clubs haven’t reached all pilots, Jonathan Greenway,
president of  HCC Insurance Holdings Inc. (HCC) ’s Avemco Insurance Co.
unit, told the forum. The firm insures aircraft owners.  “We’re not getting the dog food to the right dogs,”
Greenway said.  Technical Solution  The number of accidents in which pilots in poor visibility
fly into the ground appears to be decreasing, Tony Fazio, chief
of the FAA’s Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention,
told the forum.  The drop has coincided with increased use of handheld
devices that alert pilots when they get too close to mountains
or other obstructions, Fazio said.  Fazio, who helps lead the steering committee with
Landsberg, said safety may not improve as much in private flying
as it has with airlines. Private flying is less regulated and
the planes typically have fewer safety systems, he said.  Landsberg said the general-aviation community doesn’t see a
need for additional regulations.  “I don’t think you can crash an airplane unless you have
broken one and possibly two regulations,” Landsberg said. “If
everyone flew to the private-pilot practical test standards, we
would have a pretty good system.”  He also pointed to the fact that, however tragic, the
numbers of fatalities in plane crashes are far outstripped by
those in accidents on the nation’s highways -- 32,885 in 2010,
compared with 450 in general aviation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
