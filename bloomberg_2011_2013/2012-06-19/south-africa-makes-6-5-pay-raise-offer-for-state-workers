The South African government’s offer
to raise salaries for state workers will cost 8.1 billion rand
($982 million) more than was allocated in the annual budget, the
South African Press Association reported, citing Public Service
and Administration Minister Lindiwe Sisulu.  The government offered to boost state workers’ pay by 6.5
percent and other benefits by 2.5 percent. The budget, released
in February, provided for 5 percent increases, while unions are
demanding 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
