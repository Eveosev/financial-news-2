Sugar shipments from  Australia , the
third-biggest exporter, may climb to the highest in three years
as better yields boost production, swelling global supplies.  Exports may total 3.35 million metric tons in the year
starting July 1, up 13 percent from the 2.96 million tons
estimated in March, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences  said  today. That would be the
highest since the year ended June 30, 2010, according to bureau
data. Raw sugar production may be 4.4 million tons from 4.25
million tons forecast in March, the Canberra-based bureau said.  Raw sugar prices have slumped 15 percent this year,
extending last year’s 27 percent plunge, on expectations of a
global glut. Prices may drop to 17 cents a pound over the
remainder of this year, the lowest level since 2010, as world
supply is set to beat demand for a third season, according to
broker and researcher Kingsman SA. The surplus in the 12 months
starting October will be 9.3 million tons, up from a previous
forecast of 5.7 million tons, it said June 8.  “An uplift in estimates in Australian sugar production and
our export program, in conjunction with rising production
elsewhere, certainly does mean that prices are likely to come
under a bit of downward pressure,” said  Michael Creed , an
agribusiness economist at  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  “There’s
quite a lot of sugar around.”  Raw sugar for October delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent
to 19.82 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  today,
before trading at 19.87 cents by 6:21 p.m. Singapore time.  Australia, Brazil  Australia’s production estimate “is driven by an increase
in the area harvested and an assumed return to average sugar
yields,” the report said. Global prices may average 20 cents a
pound in the year starting Oct. 1, it said.  World sugar production may increase to a record 178 million
tons in the year starting Oct. 1 on “favorable” prices,
according to Abares. Output is forecast to increase in  Brazil ,
 China ,  India  and the U.S., it said.  Australia is set to harvest 31.5 million tons of sugar cane
in 2012, up from about 27.9 million tons last year as crops
recover from wet weather that curbed output for two years,
according to industry group Canegrowers.  Sugar output in the center-south region of Brazil, the
world’s largest producer, dropped 19 percent in the second half
of May to 1.96 million tons from a year earlier after rain
slowed harvesting, industry group Unica said June 14.  Sustained rains in Brazil may reduce the country’s crop and
pare the 3 million ton global surplus that’s been forecast by
the International Sugar Organization for 2012-2013, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in a June 11 report. The bank retained a
three- and 12-month forecast of 22 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter for this story:
