Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  climbed in New
York trading after reporting fiscal second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as fixed-income trading revenue rose 31
percent from a year earlier.  Jefferies  advanced  2.5 percent to $13.44 at 10:13 a.m.,
after reaching $13.84 earlier today, the biggest gain in three
months. Revenue from fixed-income trading jumped to $292.6
million from $223.1 million a year earlier.  “Our team has really established solid niches with our
clients, and we’re gaining a reasonable market share” in fixed-
income trading, Jefferies Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler, 51, said on a conference call.  Analysts had been lowering their estimates in recent weeks
amid a decline in fixed-income and equity markets and heightened
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis would spread. Revenue from
trading fell 16 percent from the first quarter.  Net income for the three months ended May 31 dropped 21
percent to $63.5 million, or 28 cents a share, from $80.6
million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based firm
said in a statement. That beat the  average estimate  of 27 cents
in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  Investment-banking revenue declined 9.6 percent from a year
earlier to $297 million as advisory revenue fell to $108.9
million from $144.6 million. Capital markets revenue climbed to
$188.1 million from $183.8 million.  “Both product-wise and geographically, we think we now
have a substantial portion of the long-term architecture of our
firm,”  Brian Friedman , chairman of the firm’s executive
committee, said today on the call. “Our emphasis is in
going deeper, growing our market share.”  Shareholders’ Reward  Jefferies set aside $423.5 million for compensation
expenses in the fiscal second quarter, 1.9 percent less than a
year earlier. Total non-interest expenses rose to $600 million
from $592.3 million.  “Jefferies is one of the few companies in our coverage
that is proactively using this protracted downturn to grow the
breadth and depth of its businesses,” Chris Kotowski, an
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said in a June 14
note. “We believe that shareholders will ultimately be
rewarded.”  The firm’s shares  slid  4.7 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 6.9 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
