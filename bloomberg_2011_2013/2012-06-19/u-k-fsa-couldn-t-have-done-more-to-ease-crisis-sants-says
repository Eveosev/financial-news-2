The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  couldn’t have done more to prevent the 2008 financial
crisis,  Hector Sants , the regulator’s chief executive officer,
said in what is likely to be the agency’s final annual report.  Sants said that “without our actions, it would have been
worse,” referring to the banking crisis triggered by the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. He said he
was proud of the way the FSA responded to “what has at times
felt like relentless criticism.”  The 56-year-old Sants, who headed the regulator for much of
the financial crisis, will step down this month before the FSA
is broken into two watchdogs next year. During his five-year
term, Sants led a crackdown on bank sales of payment protection
insurance and led an overhaul of the regulator following the
near collapse of Northern Rock Plc and  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc .  “We gave our utmost and I do believe that in the
circumstances there is nothing more the FSA could have done
which would have materially changed the outcome,” Sants said in
a  statement  introducing the regulator’s annual report.  Margaret Cole , who was appointed  executive director  for
enforcement in 2010, became the second-highest paid FSA employee
this year, after her pay rose to 616,000 pounds ($966,000) from
264,000 pounds, according to the report.  Cole left the FSA in March, joining PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as senior legal adviser. Sants remains the regulator’s
highest paid executive, with annual compensation rising 3.4
percent to 835,000 pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
