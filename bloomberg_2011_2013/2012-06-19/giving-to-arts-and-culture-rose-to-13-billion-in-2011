Donations to the arts in the U.S.
rose about 4.1 percent in 2011, to $13.1 billion, according to a
 report  released today by the Giving USA Foundation.  Such gifts fell 2.9 percent in 2009, the year following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., and then rose about
5.7 percent in 2010. Arts and culture organizations received 4
percent of U.S. charitable donations last year.  “We’re seeing giving to the arts recover and mega-gifts
return,” said Una Osili, director of research at the  Center on
Philanthropy at  Indiana University , which compiled the data for
the Giving USA study. “Gifts to the arts are basically
responding to trends in the economy.”  Total charitable gifts rose to $298.4 billion in 2011 from
about $286.9 billion the year before. International-affairs
organizations had the sharpest growth, a 7.6 percent increase to
$22.7 billion.  Gifts to religious organizations, which receive the largest
portion of charitable gifts at 32 percent, had a 1.7 percent
decline in donations to $95.9 billion. A decrease in church
attendance is partly responsible, Osili said.  Health-related nonprofits rose 2.7 percent to $24.8 billion
in 2011; human services had a 2.5 percent increase to $35.4
billion; and education went up 4 percent to $38.9 billion. Gifts
to environmental and animal organizations, which receive 3
percent of donations, rose 4.6 percent.  Modest Rise  The Center on Philanthropy’s executive director, Patrick
Rooney, said in a statement that giving in the U.S. has had its
second-slowest recovery “following any recession since 1971.”  “Giving is going up modestly along with a modest economic
recovery, but it’s going to take some time to recover,” Osili
said. “If giving continues at this rate, it may take a decade
before we recover and return to 2007 pre-recession levels of
giving.”  While some nonprofits saw individuals’ gifts improve,
corporate donations declined 0.1 percent to $14.6 billion.  At the  Los Angeles Philharmonic , some corporate sponsors
have reduced their donations, board chairman David Bohnett said
in a phone interview. Ticket sales cover 60 percent of its
budget with the rest coming from companies, individuals and
foundations.  “There’s no more normal in terms of corporate
philanthropy,” Bohnett said. “It remains very depressed.”  The Center on Philanthropy’s estimates are based on data
compiled from tax filings to the  Internal Revenue Service  and
information from other organizations such as the  Foundation
Center , the Council for Aid to Education and the  Bureau of
Economic Analysis .  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on music.  To contact the writer on this story:
