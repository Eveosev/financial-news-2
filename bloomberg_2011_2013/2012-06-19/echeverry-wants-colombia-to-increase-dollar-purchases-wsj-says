Colombia’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry reiterated that the central bank should
increase its daily dollar purchases in the  spot market , the Wall
Street Journal said, citing an  interview  with Echeverry.  Echeverry expects the peso to trade in a range of 1,750 to
1,950 per  U.S. dollar  in the coming months, the newspaper said
on its website today. Such levels would be reasonable for the
peso, even though the government is “not entirely happy” with
the lower end of the range, the Wall Street Journal cited the
finance minister as saying.  Echeverry said Colombia is ready to employ countercyclical
policies, such as an increase in public spending, to offset any
slowdown in the economy, the according to newspaper.  Colombia’s Finance Ministry did not immediately return a
call requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
