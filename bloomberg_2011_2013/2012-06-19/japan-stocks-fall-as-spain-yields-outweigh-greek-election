     June 19 (Bloomberg) --　Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
fell from a one-month high after borrowing costs in  Spain  surged
to a euro-area record and optimism faded that Greece’s election
of pro-bailout parties will help calm the debt crisis.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
revenue in  Europe , declined 1.2 percent.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) 
fell 1.8 percent after Reuters reported the brokerage was not
selected to help manage a state sale of Japan Tobacco Inc.
shares. JX Holdings Inc. gained 1.3 percent on a government plan
to outsource gas and crude drilling to the refiner’s unit.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 0.8 percent to 8,655.87 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo after yesterday rising 1.8 percent to the highest
since May 22. The broader Topix Index slid 0.6 percent to 734.69
today as the Group of 20 nation meet in  Mexico  to announce
contributions to the International Monetary Fund’s financial
firewall, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve starts a two-day
meeting.  “The market won’t be optimistic unless policy makers
produce a big surprise,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at
Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about 15 trillion yen
($190 billion). “There’s no reason for investors to buy,
judging from the yen’s level and current macro conditions.”  The Topix has fallen 16 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading. Shares on the index are
valued at 0.87 times book value, near levels seen after the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. A number below one
means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  Europe Risk  Shares extended declines after Bank of  Japan  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa told lawmakers the European crisis was the
biggest risk for Japan. Stocks also slipped after the Cabinet
Office said Japan’s leading indicator, the broadest gauge of
future economic activity, fell to 95.6 percent in April from
96.6 percent the previous month.  Volume on the Nikkei 225 was 23 percent below the 30-day
average. The value of shares  traded  on the first section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange was about 30 percent less than this year’s
daily average of 1.16 trillion yen.  “Even a slight concern drives investors to sell shares
because buying energy is very small in the market now,” said
 Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities Co. in Tokyo.  A measure of volatility on the Nikkei 225 has fallen 20
percent over the past two days, the biggest decline since the
record earthquake in March 2011.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge advanced just 0.1 percent yesterday as 10-year
Spanish bond yields soared to 7.16 percent, the highest since
1997, tempering optimism about  Greece ’s attempts to form a
coalition government.  Bad Debt  Spain, which has asked euro-region governments for as much
as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to shore up its banks,
reported a jump in bad loans in April to 8.72 percent of total
lending, the highest since 1994.  “The election of pro-bailout parties in Greece means
they’ve cleared a first hurdle, but there’s no fundamental
solution here,” said Tamiji Shinada, executive director of
investment research at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Unless
you think we’re headed for another credit freeze like the one we
had after the Lehman shock, shares are cheap. That’s providing
some support to the market.”  Canon lost 1.2 percent to 3,200 yen.  Ricoh Co. (7752) , an office-
equipment and camera maker that gets more than 20 percent of its
revenue in Europe, slipped 1.5 percent to 640 yen.  G-20 Meeting  Additional contributions to the IMF financial firewall from
major emerging-market nations will be similar to the amount
announced in April, when the Washington-based lender said it
received total pledges of $430 billion from members,  Brazil ’s
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said. Other countries including
Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and China agreed to contribute about $70
billion to that total without detailing their pledges.  Fed policy makers will begin a two-day meeting today to
contend with financial stress in Europe and a U.S. unemployment
rate that has remained above 8 percent for 40 consecutive months.
They are also expected to lower forecasts for growth.  Nomura fell 1.8 percent to 273 yen after Reuters reported
the Ministry of Finance left Japan’s biggest brokerage off the
list of companies selected to manage the government’s sale of
about $6 billion of Japan Tobacco shares.  JX Holdings gained 1.3 percent to 390 yen. The trade and
industry ministry said it plans to outsource trial drilling for
natural gas and crude off the coast of Niigata prefecture to a
unit of JX.  To contact the reporters on this story:
