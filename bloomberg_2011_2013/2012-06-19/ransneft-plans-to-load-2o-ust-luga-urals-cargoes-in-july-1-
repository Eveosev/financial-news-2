Russia  plans to load 2 million
metric tons of Urals crude from Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea in
July, the most since the terminal started operations in March,
according to OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline operator.  Transneft will offer 20 positions from Ust-Luga next month,
Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for the company, told reporters at the
terminal today. Each slot is for 100,000 tons.  Oil loadings from Ust Luga, the receiving point of
Transneft’s 100 billion-ruble ($3.3 billion) Baltic Pipeline
System-2, started on March 23 after a delay since November
because of engineering difficulties. The BPS-2 link will have a
capacity of 30 million tons a year, or 600,000 barrels a day,
and is expected to carry 10 million to 15 million tons of crude
this year, Dyomin said on Feb. 13.  Urals exports from Ust Luga are scheduled to drop to 1
million tons in June from 1.6 million tons in May after three
free positions went unfilled, according to loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Urals crude loaded from Ust-Luga is lower in quality and
about 0.1 percentage point higher in sulfur content than oil
shipped from the  Baltic Sea  port of Primorsk, Dyomin said
yesterday by phone from Moscow. It’s similar to oil from the
Druzhba pipeline and is still “within specification”, he said.  Primorsk Urals has density of 31 to 33 degrees on the
American Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of about
1.3 percent, according to Platts, the energy news and pricing
unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
