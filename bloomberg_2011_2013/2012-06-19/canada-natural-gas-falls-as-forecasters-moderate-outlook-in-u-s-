Canadian natural gas declined as
forecasters moderated their outlook for temperatures in the
U.S., which may lower demand for the power-plant fuel to help
run air conditioners.  July gas in  Alberta  declined 4.2 percent after MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, adjusted forecasts to be
cooler than previously predicted for the U.S. Midwest and
Northeast near the end of the month.  “They seem to be moderating some of the forecasts and,
given the thing has run 45 cents in two or three sessions, some
profit-taking would make sense,”  Martin King , an analyst with
FirstEnergy Capital Corp., in Calgary, said in a telephone
interview.  Alberta gas for July delivery dropped 8.5 cents to C$1.95 a
gigajoule ($1.82 per million British thermal units) as of 5 p.m.
New York time on NGX, a Canadian internet market. Gas traded on
the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the U.S. and
priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas is down 24
percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 9 cents to settle at $2.545 per million Btu.  “Temps were cooled slightly late within the Northeast,”
Eric Wertz, an MDA meteorologist, wrote in a six- to 10-day
forecast today. He predicted “some slight cool changes in the
Midwest and & East” in the 11- to 15-day outlook.  The high for New York on June 28 will be 72 degrees
Fahrenheit, (22 Celsius) 11 below normal, said AccuWeather.com
of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
14.23 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $2.6761 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 8.79 cents, or 4 percent, to $2.3027 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices gained 11.02 cents, or 4.7 percent,
to $2.4328.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet at 5 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.98 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.99 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 718 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.83 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent
of normal capacity of 2.55 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 3:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
