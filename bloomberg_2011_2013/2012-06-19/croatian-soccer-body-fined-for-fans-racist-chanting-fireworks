Croatian soccer’s governing body was
fined 80,000 euros ($102,000) by the organizers of the European
Championship because of racist behavior of supporters.  The Croatian Football Federation has three days to appeal
the fine,  UEFA , European soccer’s governing body, said today in
a statement on its website. Croatian fans set off fireworks and
used racists chants and symbols during the June 14 match against
 Italy .  The step comes after two monitors from UEFA-appointed
Football Against Racism Europe filed a report stating as many as
500 supporters in the Croatian section subjected Italy’s  Mario Balotelli , who is of Ghanaian descent, to monkey chants
throughout the 1-1 game. A banana was also thrown onto the
field.  UEFA earlier fined the Russian and German federations for
misbehavior by supporters. It also fined the Croatian federation
25,000 euros June 15 for fans throwing fireworks and other
objects, as well as a supporter running onto the field during a
match against Ireland on June 10.  The fine is lower than that given to Denmark striker
Nicklas Bendtner, who has to pay 100,000 euros and will miss one
match after showing an unofficial sponsor’s name on his
underwear while celebrating a goal at the regional championship,
which is being held in Poland and Greece.  The player will also miss a competitive match, which will
include qualifying games for the 2014  World Cup , UEFA said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
