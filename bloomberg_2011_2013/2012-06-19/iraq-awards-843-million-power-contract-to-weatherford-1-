Iraq awarded an $843 million
contract to  Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT)  to install six power
generation plants at the Zubair oil field in the south of the
country, State Minister Ali Al-Dabbagh said by telephone.  The plants will take 18 months to install, Dabbagh, also
the government spokesman, said in an earlier statement today.  Zubair produces about 200,000 barrels a day, Idris al
Yasiri, director general of state-run Iraq Drilling Co., said
Nov. 3. A group led by  Eni SpA (ENI)  won a contract in 2010 to boost
output at Zubair to 1.2 million barrels a day within six years
and maintain that level for an additional seven years, according
to a statement from the Rome-based company at the time.  Eni controls almost 33 percent of the group managing the
Zubair project, as Iraqâ€™s state-run Missan Oil Co. owns 25
percent,  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  holds 23 percent and  Korea
Gas Corp. (036460)  has almost 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
