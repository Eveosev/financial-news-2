OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  fell on a report that
 Russia ’s largest hydropower company may hold a secondary public
share sale to allow Rosneftegaz to acquire a 40 percent stake in
OAO Irkutskenergo from OAO Inter RAO UES.  RusHydro fell 1.8 percent to 87.56 kopeks by 10:42 a.m. in
Moscow, the first drop in three days and the biggest decliner on
the Micex Index.  “We believe this news will be taken quite negatively by
RusHydro minorities,” Alfa Bank analysts led by Alexander Kornilov said in an e-mailed note. “First of all, the volume of
the share placement in favor of Rosneftegaz is expected to be
huge, 40 percent of the current market cap of RusHydro.
Secondly, the pricing parameters of the placement are unclear at
the moment, which might imply a substantial dilution risk for
current minorities.”  Rosneftegaz may acquire RusHydro’s 40 percent stake in
Irkutskenergo from Inter RAO UES through a subsidiary,
Kommersant newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the
plan.  Rosneftegaz may then transfer the stake in Irkutskenergo
and invest 85 billion rubles ($2.62 billion) for a 25.8 percent
stake in RusHydro, for which the company would have to issue
additional shares, Kommersant reported.  -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
