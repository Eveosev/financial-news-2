The peak in  stock trading  during the
market’s decline after April was less than half the volume
triggered during the slumps in 2011 and 2010, a sign bears could
come back in force, according to Bank of America Corp.  About 4.67 billion shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange on June 1, the busiest trading since the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  started its retreat from this year’s high in
April, according to data compiled by Bank of America and
Bloomberg. That compared with peak volume of more than 9.5
billion in the previous two years, the data show.  The S&P 500 tumbled 9.9 percent from April 2 through June 1
and has since risen 6.3 percent. The relatively slow trading
during the retreat suggests a lack of “volume shakeout” and
means bears may still have the power to drive the market lower,
according to Mary Ann Bartels, a New York-based technical
analyst at Bank of America.  “While the short-term technicals support the case for a
rally, the risk is that sellers are not yet completely exhausted
and an adverse macro news event could trigger a future
shakeout,” Bartels wrote in a note dated yesterday.  Stocks rebounded this month amid speculation that central
banks will take further steps to spur global growth and contain
the sovereign debt crisis in  Europe . The  Federal Reserve  begins
a two-day meeting today to decide whether more monetary stimulus
is needed to boost the economy.  Volume surged last year as the  S&P 500  suffered its worst
decline since the  bull market  began in 2009. Trading on NYSE-
listed securities reached 9.89 billion on Aug. 8, when the
benchmark gauge was in the middle of a slide that pushed the
market to the brink of a bear-market decline of 20 percent. The
index tumbled 19 percent from April 29 through Oct. 3, 2011. The
so-called flash crash, on May 6, 2010, produced daily volume of
11.4 billion.  Trading on  all U.S. exchanges  showed a similar pattern.
Volume peaked at 8.87 billion shares this year in May, compared
with highs of 17.9 billion and 19.3 billion, respectively, for
the previous two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
on exchange-listed securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
