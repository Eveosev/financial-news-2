The  International Monetary Fund 
“will discuss recent developments” in  Greece  when a planned
review mission returns to Athens, a spokeswoman for the IMF said
today.  After an inconclusive May 6 election that led to the June
17 vote, European and IMF budget experts canceled a mission to
review Greece’s eligibility for the next aid installment and now
intend to carry out the assessment around the end of June. That
plan assumes a new Greek government is in place by then.  “We will discuss recent developments when the mission
returns and then go from there,” IMF spokeswoman  Conny Lotze 
said by e-mail in response to e-mailed questions. Lotze said she
didn’t have a date for the mission.  Lotze later said she was referring to when the mission goes
to  Athens , rather than when it returns to IMF headquarters in
Washington from Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
