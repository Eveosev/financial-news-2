U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he is encouraged by his discussions with European
leaders on how to combat the continent’s debt crisis.  “A solution to this crisis in Europe has to be made in
Europe,” Geithner told reporters at the Group of 20 nations
summit today in Los Cabos,  Mexico . Leaders at the summit
discussed issues including trade, financial industry regulations
and energy, “but the focus of the meetings was very much on the
crisis in Europe and the broader challenges to economic
growth,” he said.  With European Union leaders preparing to discuss the path
to closer political and economic union at a summit in Brussels
on June 28-29, G-20 leaders held their second straight summit
dominated by the contagion from Europe. Geithner said the
European meeting next week will be “critical.”  G-20 leaders prodded  Spain  to spell out details of its bank
bailout as the deepening debt crisis in Europe exposed tensions
among the world’s biggest economies. The officials “talked
about how we need clarity on Spain’s application as soon as
possible,” German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “We were encouraged by what we heard from European leaders
today and by the broad focus of what we are seeing,” Geithner
said.  European officials are trying to “design a framework” to
form a “banking union” and ensure that countries including
Spain and Italy can borrow money at “sustainable  interest
rates ,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
