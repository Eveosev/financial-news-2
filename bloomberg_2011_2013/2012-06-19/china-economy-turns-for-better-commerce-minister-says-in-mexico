China’s economy , the world’s second
biggest, may be improving this month after government measures
to support growth, Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said in Mexico.  “The downward economic trend in April and May this year is
pretty obvious,” Chen told reporters at a briefing in Los Cabos
today. “I personally think that the June situation is turning
for the better” after the central government moved to boost
consumption, he said.  China’s first interest-rate reduction since 2008 this month
highlighted the threat to the economy from budget cuts in Europe
that are constraining demand for exports. Chen said that his
nation’s goal of 10 percent growth in trade this year is “still
possible” if the European debt crisis can be contained in the
second half.  Economists are paring forecasts for China’s growth, with
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  seeing a 7.7 percent expansion this year,
the weakest pace since 1999. A slowdown in investment and curbs
on home purchases have added to weakness in exports in cooling
the economy.  Chen urged nations to avoid trade protectionism, as
disputes simmer between the U.S. and China. The Asian country
doesn’t provide adequate data about subsidies and other
government assistance it gives to its domestic industries, the
 World Trade Organization  said in a June 12 report.  Leaders of the G-20 nations are meeting in Mexico for a
two-day summit dominated by the financial crisis in Europe.  --Regina Tan, Nerys Avery. Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Scott Lanman  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
