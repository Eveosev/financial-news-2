Iran  plans to design and build 10 new
navy ships, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported, citing Rear
Admiral Abbas Zamini, the deputy commander of the navy.  The vessels will include different classes of destroyers
and missile-launching frigates, Fars said.  Iranâ€™s first domestically produced guided-missile
destroyer, the Jamaran, was launched in 2010. The 1,400-ton
vessel is equipped with modern radars and electronic warfare
capabilities and is armed with a variety of anti-ship, surface-
to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, Fars said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
