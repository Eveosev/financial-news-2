Uruguay increased the amount of
wind-powered electricity it plans to bring online in coming
years, saying it wants to capitalize on cheap turbine prices.  Uruguay plans to cram 1,000 megawatts of wind generation
onto its grid by the end of 2015, compared with a September
estimate of 800 megawatts, Ramon Mendez, director of energy at
the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining, said yesterday in a
telephone interview. It has about 40 megawatts online now.  “During some windy nights in summer, we will have 80 to 90
percent of our energy coming from wind,” Mendez said. “It’s
incredible.”  The 1,000-megawatt addition is almost the maximum the
country’s electricity grid can handle, Mendez said. More than
half of that may be under construction by year-end, he said.  National power company Administracion Nacional de Usinas y
Transmisiones Electricas will sign contracts by September to buy
energy from 650 megawatts of projects planned by companies
including  Spain ’s  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and  Germany ’s Enercon GmbH, Mendez
said.  The average global price of  wind turbines  has fallen 25
percent to 850,000 euros ($1.1 million) a megawatt since its
2008 peak due to decreased demand as governments including Spain
and  Italy  have cut renewable-energy subsidies following the
economic downturn, Eduardo Tabbush, an analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance’s London office, said today in a telephone
interview.  ‘Incredible Price’  Uruguay committed to wind energy after an auction in August
for 150 megawatts of new projects saw 17 companies offer to sell
energy at rates as low as $62.35 a megawatt hour, Mendez said.  “We got an incredible price,” Mendez said. “Any
economist will tell you you should develop as much of this as
possible.”  In December, the government issued a  decree  allowing UTE to
buy power from the remaining participants at the average rate
awarded to the three winners. Developers for 13 of the 20
projects that were denied contracts in the bid agreed to the
terms.  In May, a  decree  was issued allowing large power consumers
to erect turbines and sell the excess energy to UTE.  Six projects with 342 megawatts of capacity that were
awarded contracts to sell energy to UTE following two auctions
held 2010 and 2011 will come online through 2014. The remaining
13 projects with 650 megawatts may be producing power as soon as
2015.  Uruguay has 2,350 megawatts of capacity online including
1,500 megawatts of hydroelectric dams that may be turned on when
the wind isn’t blowing, he said.  The nation ascertained through a four-month study that it
was able to attach 1,200 megawatts of wind farms to its grid
“without any problems,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
