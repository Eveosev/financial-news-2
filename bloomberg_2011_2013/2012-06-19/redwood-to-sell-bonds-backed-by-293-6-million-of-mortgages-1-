Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT)  plans to sell
bonds backed by $293.6 million of new U.S. home loans, in the
seventh sale of such securities without government backing since
the market froze in 2008, according to credit-rating firms.  Redwood, a specialist in so-called jumbo mortgages, issued
five of the previous offerings of such securities since the
market restarted in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Kroll Bond Ratings Inc. and Fitch Ratings expect to
assign top grades to $272.2 million of the bonds in the latest
deal, according to “pre-sale” reports sent today by e-mail.  Issuance of so-called non-agency  home-loan bonds  peaked at
$1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006 before collapsing as their
prices tumbled amid soaring foreclosures and plunging home
values. Government-supported mortgage programs and demand from
banks for loans are limiting the market’s revival.  Michael McMahon, a spokesman for Redwood, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message today. The real estate
investment trust is based in  Mill Valley , California.  Barclays Plc is managing the offering, which would be
Redwood’s third this year, Bloomberg data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG and  Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM) , the
New York-based REIT, teamed on the last sale in the non-agency
market with a $730 million deal in March that Fitch said
received grades that were too high from its rivals.  Jumbo home loans are ones larger than allowed in
government-supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for
single-family properties in some areas. Limits range from
$417,000 to $625,500 for  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and Freddie Mac loans with
the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
