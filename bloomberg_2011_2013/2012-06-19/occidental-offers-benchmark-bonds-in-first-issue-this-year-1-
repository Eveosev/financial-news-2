Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S., is
offering debt in its first sale this year.  The company, which also markets natural gas and chemicals,
may issue 5.5- year notes to yield about 85 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and 10.5-year bonds at a spread
of about 115 basis points, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The offering will be of benchmark size,
typically at least $500 million.  Occidental last issued bonds in August 2011, selling $1.25
billion of 1.75 percent, 5.5-year securities at a spread of 95
basis points more than benchmark bonds and $900 million of 3.125
percent, 10.5-year debentures at 105 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which
may include debt repayments, acquisitions and stock repurchases,
the Los Angeles-based company said in a filing today.  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Wells
Fargo & Co. are managing the sale, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because terms aren’t set. The bonds may be
rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
