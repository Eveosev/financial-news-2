Foreign ownership of Japanese
government debt rose to a record in 2011, while Japanese
households’ holdings fell to the lowest since 2005, signaling
increasing dependence on investors abroad to finance the world’s
largest public debt.  Overseas investors owned 8.3 percent of JGBs as of the end
of the fiscal year in March, the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said in a report
released in  Tokyo  today. This was the highest since 1979, the
first year for which comparable data is available. Japanese
households owned 3 percent of issued bonds.  The crisis in  Europe  has increased demand for the yen and
Japanese bonds as a haven, even as  ratings agencies  have
downgraded the nation’s debt. Yields on benchmark 10-year debt
reached a nine-year low of 0.79 percent on June 4, and were at
0.805 percent at 4:06 p.m. in Tokyo today.  Japan ’s government has tapped the nation’s 1,513 trillion
yen ($19 trillion) in household wealth to finance its public
debt burden. This pool of funds has stagnated over the years as
the nation’s population ages and deflation weighs on growth.  Households had 835 trillion yen in cash and deposits at the
end of March, up 2.3 percent from the same period in the
previous year, for the sixth annual rise, reflecting a
preference for liquid assets over bonds. Liquid deposits rose
4.9 percent to 311 trillion yen over the period, exceeding the
0.6 percent rise in term deposits.  Some 55 percent of total financial assets of Japanese
households were in cash and deposits, compared with 14.5 percent
in the U.S., according to the central bank.  Foreign currency deposits rose 3.4 percent to 5.79 trillion
yen in fiscal 2011, the highest since 2004.  Fitch Ratings  downgraded Japan’s local currency long-term
debt rating to A+ in May, the fifth highest ranking.  To contact the reporters on this story:
