Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a solar-panel
company with manufacturing operations in  China , bought 122
megawatts of power projects under development in the U.S. as it
expands its efforts to build and own generating assets.  Construction on the 11 solar farms, which range in capacity
from 2 megawatts to 29 megawatts, will begin this year and the
last will be completed in 2014, Kitchener, Ontario-based
Canadian Solar said today in a statement. Terms and the
projects’ locations weren’t disclosed.  The company expects to buy “many” more solar farms in the
U.S. as it moves beyond panel manufacturing. Canadian Solar’s
project development business is expected to generate 25 percent
of its revenue this year, up from 10 percent last year,
according to the statement.  Canadian Solar formed its U.S. development unit six months
ago as part of its “continued commitment” to the region, Shawn Qu, the company’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. That gives the company “the ability to now further
grow our business in the U.S. market.”  The company also develops solar projects in  Canada .  Canadian Solar shares rose 3 percent to $3.75 at the close
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
