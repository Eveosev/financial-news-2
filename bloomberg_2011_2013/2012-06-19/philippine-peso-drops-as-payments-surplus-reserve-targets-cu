The Philippine peso fell as the
central bank lowered forecasts for the balance of payments and
international reserves due to the slowing global economy.  The surplus in its external accounts position will probably
come in at $2.6 billion this year, compared with the initial
estimate of $2.8 billion, Governor Amando Tetangco said
yesterday. He predicted reserves of $77.5 billion to $78 billion
in 2012, from the prior forecast of $79 billion.  “The weakness is more due to near-term demand for the
greenback and the outlook that the dollar is relatively cheap
against the peso,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market
strategist at Manila-based BDO Unibank Inc., the nation’s
largest lender. The currency will probably trade between 42.15
and 42.50 per dollar in the “near term,” he said.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 42.292 per dollar at the
close in  Manila , data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month
implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 6.5 percent and is down from
7.75 percent at the end of last month.  The central bank reported today a $138 million surplus in
the balance of payments for May, giving a  five-month excess  of
$1.3 billion. That compares with a surplus of $4.8 billion in
the same period last year.  Bond Auction  The currency posted its biggest advance in more than three
years last week and climbed to a 10-month high yesterday on
mounting speculation the country will win a credit-rating
upgrade and as economic growth gathers pace. The peso is
“giving up some gains” after the rally, said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based senior currency analyst at
Malayan Banking Bhd.  The Bureau of the Treasury sold 6.7 billion pesos ($158
million) of 20-year bonds today, less than the 9 billion pesos
on offer, as it sought to cap borrowing costs. The 5.875 percent
securities due in February 2032 were issued at an average yield
of 6.024 percent, compared with 5.906 percent at a sale of
similar-maturity notes in January.  In secondary market trading, the yield rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.02 percent, according to
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
