Zimbabwe must revise an agreement
with Essar Africa Holdings Ltd. because it doesn’t comply with
the country’s black ownership law, NewsDay reported, citing
Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu .  Essar, a unit of Mumbai-based Essar Group, owns 80 percent
of New Zimbabwe Steel Ltd., formerly the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel
Co., under a deal approved by the Cabinet, the Harare-based
newspaper said.  Essar bought the state-owned steel group for a reported
$750 million in March last year in an accord brokered by
Industry Minister  Welshman Ncube .  To contact the reporter on this story:
