U.S. stock-index futures declined,
indicating that the benchmark Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index will
snap a three-day rally, as Greek leaders planned to form a group
to renegotiate terms of an international bailout.  S&P 500 futures expiring in September dropped 0.3 percent
to 1,337.3 at 9:12 a.m. in  London . Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures slipped 20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,666.  Greek politicians continued talks to form a government
after the June 17 elections.  Evangelos Venizelos , the head of
the Pasok party, said he agreed with the leader of the
Democratic Left party to speed up the process.  Venizelos said there was initial agreement on a policy
framework for the new government, as well as on the need to put
together a negotiating team, which can include people from
outside the government, to renegotiate some of the terms
included in an international rescue.  Venizelos spoke in  Athens  in comments carried live on
state-run NET TV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
