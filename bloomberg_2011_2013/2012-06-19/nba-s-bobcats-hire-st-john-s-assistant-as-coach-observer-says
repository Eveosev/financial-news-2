The  Charlotte Bobcats  hired St.
John’s University assistant coach Mike Dunlap as their new head
coach, the  Charlotte Observer  reported, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the process.  Dunlap, 54, was the acting head coach at St. John’s last
season while Steve Lavin was recovering from prostate cancer
surgery. In Charlotte, he replaces Paul Silas, who was fired
after the team went 7-59 and set a record for the lowest winning
percentage in National Basketball Association history.  Dunlap was one of 10 candidates to interview for the
Bobcats’ vacancy and was offered the job yesterday after meeting
with team owner Michael Jordan and other front office officials,
the Observer said. Dunlap previously worked in the NBA as an
assistant with the  Denver Nuggets  from 2006-08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
