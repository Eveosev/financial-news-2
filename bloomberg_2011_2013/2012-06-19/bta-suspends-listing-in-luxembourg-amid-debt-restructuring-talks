BTA Bank (BTAS) , the Kazakh lender seeking
to restructure its debt for a second time, said it suspended the
listing of its securities on the EuroMTF market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.  The Almaty-based lender said the move is due to “the
current process of the bank’s restructuring and it doesn’t mean
that these securities are removed from the listing completely,”
according to a  statement  published on the Kazakh Stock
Exchange’s website today.  The country’s biggest bank before its default on $12
billion of debt in 2009 is negotiating its second debt
restructuring in as many years after failing to make an interest
payment on its July 2018 dollar bonds in January.  State-run BTA said June 15 talks began on its proposed debt
overhaul. The wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took over the lender in
February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
