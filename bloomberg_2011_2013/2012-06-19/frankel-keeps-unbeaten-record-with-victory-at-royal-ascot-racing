Frankel, the world’s top-ranked
horse, maintained his unbeaten record with an 11th consecutive
victory today, winning the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot.  The four-year-old, ridden by Tom Queally and trained by
Henry Cecil, was long odds-on at 1-10, meaning a successful 10-
pound bet yielded only one-pound profit.  Frankel moved into the lead three furlongs from the finish
and left his rivals trailing to win by 11 lengths. Excelebration
was second at 5-1 and Side Glance third at 33-1.  The winning prize for the straight-mile event, the first
race at the meeting, was 198,000 pounds ($310,000). Frankel,
rated No. 1 in the World Thoroughbred Rankings, had already won
three times at Ascot.  The five-day Royal Ascot meeting, in Berkshire west of
 London , is Britain’s richest race meeting, with prize money of
4.5 million pounds.  Queen Elizabeth II , who celebrates her Diamond Jubilee this
year, is attending as usual and took part in a royal procession
at the start of today’s proceedings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
