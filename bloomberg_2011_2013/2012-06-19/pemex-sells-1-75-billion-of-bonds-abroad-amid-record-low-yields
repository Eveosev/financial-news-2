Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, sold $1.75 billion of 32-year bonds,
taking advantage of record-low overseas financing costs to fund
investments.  Pemex, as the company is known, priced the debt to yield
5.53 percent, or 280 basis points more than similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
managed the sale, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t
authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  State-owned Pemex is boosting investment to reverse seven
years of output declines. The company pumped 2.55 million
barrels a day on average last year, compared with as much as
3.38 million barrels a day at its peak in 2004. Pemex has
quadrupled investments during the past decade to about $23
billion a year.  Yields on Pemex’s $2.96 billion of notes due in 2021
touched a record low 3.72 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data
show. Investors are piling into higher-rated emerging-market
debt amid concern Europe’s sovereign crisis will derail global
growth.  Pemex last issued debt in April, selling A$150 million
($153 million) of five-year notes. The new debt is rated Baa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, three levels above junk, and one
grade lower at BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
