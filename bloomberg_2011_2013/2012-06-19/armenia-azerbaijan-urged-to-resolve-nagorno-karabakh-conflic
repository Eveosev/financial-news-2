The U.S., Russian and French
presidents called for  Armenia  and Azerbaijan to find a peaceful
solution to their conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  In a joint  statement  today from the Group of 20 meeting in
Mexico,  Barack Obama ,  Vladimir Putin  and  Francois Hollande  urged
the two former Soviet republics to fulfill a January commitment
to accelerate reaching a peace agreement. The U.S., Russia and
France chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe’s so-called Minsk Group, which mediates on the dispute.  “The parties to the conflict should not further delay
making the important decisions necessary to reach a lasting and
peaceful settlement,” the leaders said. “As evidence of their
political will, they should refrain from maximalist positions in
the negotiations, respect the 1994 cease-fire agreement, and
abstain from hostile rhetoric that increases tension.”  Energy-rich Azerbaijan fought a war with Armenia over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly ethnic Armenian-populated region that
broke free of Baku’s control after the disintegration of the
 Soviet Union  in 1991. While the hostilities largely ended after
a Russia-brokered cease-fire in 1994, the countries have failed
to reach a peace agreement.  Five Armenian soldiers were killed and two were wounded
during an exchange of fire with Azeri troops this month, while
five Azeri soldiers died during a border clash with Armenian
troops, Defense Ministries of both nations said June 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
