France Telecom SA (FTE)  sued Marvell
Semiconductor, claiming that it infringed a patent for methods
of coding digital data.  France Telecom , a Paris-based telecommunications provider,
said Marvell has used the patent in making processors for
BlackBerry wireless devices, according to a filing today in
federal court in Manhattan.  Claude Berrou received at least three awards for being the
inventor of the patent, according to the complaint. He invented
data elements known as “turbo codes,” which according to the
suit “revolutionized digital communications.”  France Telecom said telecommunications companies including
Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Corp. have obtained licenses to use
the patent and pay royalties.  Daniel Yoo, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based
Marvell, didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment
on the suit.  The case is France Telecom v. Marvell Semiconductor, 12-
4986, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
