(Corrects May sales growth in second paragraph.)  Polish  retail sales  accelerated in
May, rebounding from the lowest growth in 22 months in April,
when an Easter holiday damped demand.  Sales advanced 7.7 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a 5.5 percent increase in April, the  Central Statistical
Office  in Warsaw said today. The median  estimate  of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.5 percent. Retail sales
rose 0.9 percent from the previous month.  “The rebound in May sales was a return to normal levels
after the April figure got depressed by an early Easter,”
 Maciej Reluga , chief economist at  Bank Zachodni WBK (BZW)  said before
the release.  The Narodowy Bank Polski, the only central bank in the
European Union to raise borrowing costs this year, increased the
benchmark seven-day rate to 4.75 percent in May to combat
inflation, which has exceeded the upper end of its target range
for 17 months. Policy makers left the rate unchanged this month,
saying they may consider raising it if inflation stays elevated.  The zloty was little changed after the data, trading at
4.2562 per euro at 10:07 a.m. in Warsaw, 0.2 percent stronger on
the day. The average yield on the 10-year government bond due in
2021 rose 1 basis point to 5.17 percent.  The retail data are the last in the series of statistics
before a July 3-4 rate meeting. Policy makers are seeking more
evidence that economic growth will slow to 2.5 percent this year
from 4.3 percent last year, helping contain inflation.  Since the June 6 meeting,  inflation  unexpectedly
decelerated to 3.6 percent in May, the slowest in 15 months,
while jobs growth at companies with more than nine workers held
steady at 0.3 percent and wages rose 3.8 percent, less than the
4 percent median forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
