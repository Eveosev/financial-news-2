Omnia Holdings Ltd. (OMN) , southern
 Africa ’s biggest fertilizer supplier, advanced to a record in
Johannesburg trading as the company resumed paying dividends a
year earlier than planned.  Shares in the chemical, fertilizer and the explosives group
climbed 5.4 percent to 105 rand by the close, the highest since
at least August 1990, when Bloomberg started compiling records
on the stock.  Omnia paid a total dividend of 2.80 rand ($0.33) a share in
the year through March as earnings for the Johannesburg-based
company jumped 41 percent to 630 million rand, it said in a
statement today. The group, which opted not to pay dividends
because it had raised 971 million rand of equity to fund a new
nitric-acid complex, had expected it would resume paying in
fiscal 2013.  “We completed our new 1.4 billion-rand nitric acid complex
on time and below budget, which will provide a solid base for
Omnia’s next growth stage,” the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
