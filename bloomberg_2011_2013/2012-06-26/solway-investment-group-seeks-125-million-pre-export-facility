Solway Investment Group Ltd., a
private equity investor headquartered in Cyprus, is seeking a
$125 million pre-export finance facility for 3 1/2 years,
according to a statement from lenders.  Banks were asked to respond with commitments in the next
few weeks at a meeting in  London  yesterday, according to one
person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private.  BNP Paribas SA and Natixis are mandated lead arrangers and
bookrunners and the facility will be used for general corporate
purposes, the lenders said.  Solway comprises diversified companies with core activities
in mining, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, cement and real
estate, according to the companyâ€™s  website . Its main businesses
are located in Russia and the  Commonwealth of Independent
States , central and eastern Europe, Central America and south
east  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
