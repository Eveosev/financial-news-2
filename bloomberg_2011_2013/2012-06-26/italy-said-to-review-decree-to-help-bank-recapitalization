Italy may approve a decree to help
banks to boost capital through the sale of bonds to the
government, as  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  prepares to
raise at least 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) using the
securities, two people familiar with the matter said.  Ministers may pass the measure as soon as today at a
Cabinet meeting in  Rome , said the people, who asked not be
identified because the matter isn’t public yet. The legislation
probably will be similar to the decree approved in 2009 that
allowed lenders to issue so-called Tremonti-bonds, which were
named after then Treasury Minister  Giulio Tremonti , one of the
people said.  Monte Paschi, which is among Italian lenders that must
raise capital as part of  Europe ’s plan to end the sovereign-debt
crisis, has a capital shortfall of 3.3 billion euros, according
to the European Banking Authority. The bank must also repay 1.9
billion euros of state aid provided in 2009.  Monte Paschi’s board meets today to approve a plan that
includes capital measures to comply with the European Banking
Authority’s targets. The Siena, Italy-based bank may sell at
least 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of bonds to the government
as part of its plan, said a person yesterday. The bank may also
restructure the old issue, said the person.  The lender has already covered more than 2 billion euros of
the shortfall through the conversion of hybrid bonds and the
implementation of new internal risk models, Chief Executive
Officer Fabrizio Viola said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
