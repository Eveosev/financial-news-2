About 18 percent of U.S. oil
production and 17 percent of natural gas output from the  Gulf of
Mexico  are still shut because of Tropical Storm Debby, a Bureau
of Safety and Environmental Enforcement report today showed.  About 250,187 barrels a day of crude-oil output were
offline today, down from 608,025 barrels yesterday, while about
773 million cubic feet of gas output was shut, compared with
1.57 billion yesterday, the report showed. The number of
platforms evacuated fell to 53 from 189 yesterday and rig
evacuations fell to one from 22.  Debby, which has dropped 15 to 20 inches (38 to 51
centimeters) of rain on Florida, will cross the state and move
into the Atlantic, the Miami-based  National Hurricane Center 
said in an advisory at 2 p.m. East Cost time. The storm had
maximum sustained winds of 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour and
was moving east at 6 mph.  Energy companies shut offshore rigs and platforms over the
weekend when forecasts showed Debby moving toward  Louisiana .
The Gulf of  Mexico  represents 6.5 percent of U.S. natural gas
output and 29 percent of oil production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
