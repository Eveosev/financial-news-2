Vietnam ’s one-year bonds fell for a
fifth day, pushing their yield to the highest level in almost
seven weeks, on speculation banks were selling the securities to
free up funds for loans. The dong strengthened.  Vietnam will accelerate  government spending  and boost bank
lending to bolster the economy, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told the National Assembly June 15, after gross
domestic product expanded 4 percent in the first quarter, the
slowest pace since 2009. The  overnight interbank deposit rate 
jumped 42 basis points today to 6.4 percent, the highest since
April 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Banks have been given the green light to speed up credit
growth,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research
at  Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp. (HCM)  “They want to lend out,
rather than use money for investing in bonds.”  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark one-year bonds rose
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 9.51 percent, the
highest since May 9, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has surged 71 basis points in
the past week.  The dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 20,880 per dollar as
of 5:22 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
