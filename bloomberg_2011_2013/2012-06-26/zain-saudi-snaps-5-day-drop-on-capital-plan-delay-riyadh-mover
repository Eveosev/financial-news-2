Mobile Telecommunications Co. (ZAIN)   Saudi
Arabia (SABIC)  rose, snapping a five-day drop, after the phone company
known as Zain Saudi said a meeting to vote on a capital
reduction plan didn’t take place due to lack of quorum.  The company, whose shares tumbled 17 percent in the five
trading days through yesterday, advanced 1.9 percent to 8.05
riyals at 2:57 p.m. in Riydah. Zain Saudi, which has surged 45
percent this year, was the most traded stock by volume on  Saudi
Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index today. The benchmark gained 0.1
percent.  “The shares were being sold in anticipation of the meeting
on capital reduction” and rebounded today after the
announcement of a delay, said Turki Fadaak, head of research at
Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co. “The company will still
need to make an announcement, particularly before second-quarter
results are released.”  Zain Saudi has posted full-year losses since at least 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company plans to
lower its capital to 4.8 billion riyals ($1.3 billion) from 14
billion riyals, the Saudi Capital Market Authority said in May.
Zain Saudi will then increase its capital through a rights-share
sale with a total value of 6 billion riyals.  Six analysts  recommend investors sell the shares, while
four have a hold rating and one says buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
