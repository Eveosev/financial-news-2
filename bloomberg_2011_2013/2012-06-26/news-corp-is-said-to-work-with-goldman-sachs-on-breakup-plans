News Corp. (NWSA)  hired  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  for financial advice on its plans to break up the company,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  Separating News Corp.’s entertainment assets would help
preserve their value after the New York-based company’s
publishing business came under fire for a phone-hacking scandal
at its U.K. newspapers, said one of the people, who declined to
be identified because the matter is private.  To contact the reporters on this story:
