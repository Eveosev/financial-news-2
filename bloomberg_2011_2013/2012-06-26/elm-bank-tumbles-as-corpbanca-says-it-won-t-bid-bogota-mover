Helm Bank SA dropped to the lowest
in three weeks after the president of  Chile ’s  Corpbanca (CORPBANC)  said his
company won’t bid for a stake in the Colombian bank.  Shares dropped 4 percent to 475 pesos, the lowest close
since June 5. The IGBC index gained 0.5 percent. Helm has
rallied 54 percent this year, the biggest advance on the
benchmark, as investors bet it will be targeted for an
acquisition.  Corpbanca won’t bid for Helm, the company’s president Jorge Andres Saieh said in an interview published by Chile’s  Diario
Financiero  yesterday. Corpbanca would look at the acquisition if
it was priced at $250 million, or about a quarter of Helm’s
current market capitalization, the newspaper quoted Saieh as
saying. Corpbanca confirmed in an e-mail that the company isn’t
participating in a Helm takeover.  “As the bank loses companies interested in an acquisition,
the price should be pushed down,” said David Pelaez, an analyst
at Bolsa y Renta brokerage in Medellin. Corpbanca had been
mentioned in local press reports as a potential suitor. “It’s
not clear how the sale process is going. It’s been going on for
awhile and the context in  Europe  is less favorable now.”  Helm Bank has a market capitalization of 1.9 trillion pesos
($1.1 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company said in an e-mail that it had no official comment on
developments in the sale process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
