Lithuanian lawmakers backed reducing
valued-added tax for press, public transport tickets and car
repairs for the disabled, sparking criticism from Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius.  Lawmakers passed the proposal 99-6, with 19 abstentions,
according to a  vote-count  on the parliamentâ€™s website. The law
cuts VAT for the disabled and on tickets, newspapers and
magazines to 9 percent from a current rate of 21 percent
starting Jan. 1.  The tax reductions may reduce budget revenue by 100 million
litai ($36 million) next year, Kubilius said, adding that he
will ask President Dalia Grybauskaite to veto the law
amendments, the  Baltic News Service  reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
