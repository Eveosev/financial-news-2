Agena Technology d.o.o., which
produces motor parts for international majors, will expand
output in  Serbia  in time for a contract with  Ford Motor Co. (F)   Agena, fully-owned by the U.K.-based Albon Engineering &
Manufacturing Plc., will invest 4 million euros ($4.9 million)
in a new 10,000 square-meter plant in Pecinci, a village 30-
kilometers north of Belgrade, and 5 million euros in equipment
needed to start the production of engine parts ahead of mid-2013
when it begins shipments to Ford in a contract worth $56 million
a year, the company’s general manager Ismet Grebovic said.  “We have focused on the U.S. market, where the crisis is
over and which is going through an expansion,” Grebovic told
Bloomberg News in an interview in Belgrade today, adding that
“a five-year contract with  Ford Motor  involves parts for their
new 2.7 liter engine.”  Agena also makes engine parts for  Navistar International
Corp. (NAV) ,  Camis Group , Caterpillar Inc.,  Fiat SpA (F)  and JCB Inc.,
Grebovic said. The company’s business in Serbia, set up in 2006,
had a turnover of 20 million euros in 2011 and net income of 1.8
million euros, which could double this year, he said. Agena will
invest a total of 20 million euros in the Serbian operations
over the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
