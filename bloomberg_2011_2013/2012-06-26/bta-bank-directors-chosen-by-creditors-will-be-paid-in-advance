BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender that
plans to restructure its debt for the second time in as many
years, will pay directors assigned by creditors in advance.  Remuneration for the first six months will be paid before
the work has been completed, as recommended by BTA’s steering
committee, according to the minutes of an extraordinary meeting
of the state-run lender’s shareholders published today on the
Kazakh stock exchange  website . Shareholders voted unanimously
for the measure June 21 in Almaty, the minutes show.  Sergey Babayan and Jacek Brzezinski were selected as
directors representing the interests of creditors on BTA’s board
after two previous representatives resigned following BTA’s
failure to make a January interest payment on its July 2018
dollar bonds. Sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took BTA over
in February 2009, two months before the nation’s largest lender
at the time defaulted on $12 billion of debt.  BTA’s net loss for the year jumped to 1.308 trillion tenge
($8.8 billion) as of June 1 from 711 billion tenge a month
earlier, the central bank’s financial oversight committee said
today in a monthly report on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
