Brazil  will step up efforts to favor
local suppliers in government purchases in a bid to revive
flagging  economic growth , according to two government officials.  As part of a package of measures worth 5 billion reais
($2.4 billion), the government will announce tomorrow that it
will channel spending by the education, health and defense
ministries to Brazilian manufacturers who are being hurt by a
slowdown in growth, according to the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the plan hasn’t been announced.  Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel told reporters in  Sao
Paulo  today that the government would announce tomorrow measures
to boost investment in select industries. He did not provide
details.  As part of a package of incentives announced in April to
aid industry, the federal government said it would pay up to 25
percent more for some locally-produced goods.  Brazil’s economy will grow 2.18 percent this year, less
than the 2.7 percent expansion in 2011, according to a June 22
central bank survey of about 100 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
