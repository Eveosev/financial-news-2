The state of Vermont lost its
challenge to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s renewal of a
license for a nuclear power plant owned by  Entergy Corp. (ETR)   A unanimous three-judge panel of the  U.S. Court of Appeals 
in Washington today dismissed a lawsuit filed against the
commission by the Vermont Department of Public Service and the
New England Coalition, a nuclear-safety watchdog group, after
finding that they failed to raise objections to an environmental
study directly to the NRC.  “The petitioners here were required under agency
regulations to afford the full commission an opportunity to
pass” on the environmental challenge before filing a lawsuit,
U.S. Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote for the panel.
“And they had repeated opportunity to do so.”  Vermont sued the NRC in May 2011, claiming the issuance of
a 20-year renewal license for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power
Station was unlawful because New Orleans-based Entergy didn’t
furnish a state water-quality certificate as required under the
Clean Water Act.  Elizabeth Miller, commissioner of the Vermont Department of
Public Service, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message
seeking comment on the ruling.  Michael Burns , a spokesman for
Entergy, said the company was pleased with the ruling.  The case is Vermont Department of Public Service v. U.S.,
11-1168, U.S. Court of Appeals,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
