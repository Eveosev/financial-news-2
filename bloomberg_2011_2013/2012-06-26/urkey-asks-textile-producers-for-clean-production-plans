Turkey â€™s Environmental Ministry has
asked large textile producers to submit plans for cleaner
production by year-end.  Producers with a daily processing capacity of 10 tons or
more will be required to present their plans by Dec. 31 to abide
by a series of best practices for clean production, water and
energy conservation and recycling, the ministry said today in an
e-mailed statement from Ankara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
