Boaz Weinstein ’s Saba Capital
Management LP has exited credit-derivatives trades against
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s London chief investment office, according
to a person familiar with the matter.  Weinstein, 39, was among hedge-fund managers who profited
from price dislocations in a credit-default swaps index after
outsized trades by JPMorgan’s Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London
Whale, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the trading is private.  The trades in London, first reported by Bloomberg News on
April 5, saddled the biggest U.S. bank with a $2 billion trading
loss that JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said last
month could grow. A strategy intended to scale back a hedge
against a financial crisis backfired, leaving what Dimon has
said were even bigger and harder-to-manage exposures.  Saba’s main $5 billion fund has returned 2.3 percent this
year through June 22, a person familiar with the fund’s returns
said. That compares with a 1.1 percent gain in Hedge Fund
Research Inc.’s HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index.  Weinstein declined to comment, said Jonathan Gasthalter, a
spokesman for Saba.  To contact the reporters on this story:
