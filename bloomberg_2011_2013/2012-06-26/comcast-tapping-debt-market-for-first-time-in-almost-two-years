Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable company, and  MetLife Inc. (MET) ’s global funding affiliate are
tapping the  debt market  as yields approach a record low.  Comcast is planning to raise 10- and 30-year notes in its
first securities offering in almost two years and Metropolitan
Life Global Funding I, which is issuing debt for the second time
this month, is also selling benchmark bonds, according to people
familiar with the transactions, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Comcast plans to redeem $575 million of its 6.625 percent
senior notes maturing in May 2056, the Philadelphia-based
television-services operator said in a June 22 statement. A
benchmark bond typically is at least $500 million in size.  Yields on investment-grade company debentures in the U.S.
fell to 3.36 percent yesterday, approaching a record low 3.33
percent reached on May 8, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show. The companies are selling dollar-denominated debt
after no new investment-grade debt was sold yesterday.  The MetLife sale will be managed by Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC
Holdings Plc and UBS AG, according to the people. Comcast’s
bonds are being marketed by Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas
SA, Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
