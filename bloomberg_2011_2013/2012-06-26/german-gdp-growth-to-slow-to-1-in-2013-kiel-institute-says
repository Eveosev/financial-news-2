Germany ’s economic growth will slow
to  1 percent  in 2013 from an estimated 2 percent this year as
the euro-area debt crisis pushes the region’s largest economy
toward stagnation, the Kiel Economics institute  said .  The risk that Germany will enter a recession has “risen
markedly,” according to a report today on the website of the
research group, which is one of the institutes compiling twice-
yearly economic forecasts for the German government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
