The  yuan  was steady as the central
bank strengthened the fixing after the currency reached a seven-
month low yesterday amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily  reference rate 
0.03 percent stronger at 6.3211 per dollar, after weakening it
by the most in three months yesterday. HSBC Holdings Plc cut its
2012 economic growth forecast for China to 8.4 percent from 8.6
percent, according to a research note released today, saying it
expects policy makers to step up monetary easing in the coming
months. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded 28 Spanish banks
yesterday.  “The ongoing crisis in Europe has capped any upside for
the yuan in the near term,” said Banny Lam, Hong Kong-based
chief economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., a unit of
 China ’s second-largest bank. “The yuan may trade stronger when
data starts to improve in the fourth quarter. For now, exports
and economic growth will remain weak.”  The yuan traded at 6.3637 per dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in
 Shanghai , compared with 6.3633 yesterday, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency, which is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing,
has weakened 1 percent this quarter, the worst performance since
the dollar peg was ended in July 2005. It has dropped 1.1
percent in 2012.  The yuan’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
1.95 percent.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.04 percent
to 6.3695 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were
little changed at 6.4185, a 0.9 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
