Iraq’s crude output rose to the
highest in 20 years as the Halfaya field increased production.  Output exceeded 3.07 million barrels a day this month,
Abdel Ilah Qassem al-Amir, a spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister
for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said today in a
telephone interview from  Baghdad . That compares with a
government figure of 2.92 million barrels a day for May
published in OPEC’s monthly report on June 12.  Iraq, seeking to more than double oil output by 2015, is
poised to overtake  Iran  as OPEC’s second-largest producer by the
end of the year. Production at Halfaya will rise to 70,000
barrels a day in the first week of July, Ali Muarej, director
general of the Iraqi state Missan Oil Co., which oversees the
field, said on June 18.  The nation’s output will increase to 3.4 million barrels a
day by the end of the year after the development of other  oil
fields , al-Amir said. Production capacity will rise to 4 million
barrels a day in the next two years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
