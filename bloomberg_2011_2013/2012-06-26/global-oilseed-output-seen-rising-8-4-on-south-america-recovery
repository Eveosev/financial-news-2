Global oilseed output may jump 8.4
percent in the next season, as South American soybean production
recovers from the previous year’s drought, Hamburg-based
researcher Oil World said.  World production of 10 oilseeds may climb to 471.9 million
metric tons in the 2012-13 year beginning Sept. 1, up from a
revised estimate of 435.2 million for 2011-12, the researcher
said today in an e-mailed report. Farmers worldwide may harvest
273.9 million tons of soybeans, up 15 percent from a year
earlier, while rapeseed output may increase 2.3 percent to 61
million tons.  Brazil ’s soybean production may total 78.5 million tons,
rebounding from 66.4 million a year earlier when drought hurt
crops, Oil World said.  Argentina ’s harvest may climb to 55
million tons from 40.5 million, while output in the U.S. may
rise to 87.8 million from 83.2 million. The U.S.,  Brazil  and
Argentina are the world’s biggest growers of the oilseed.  “Farmers in  South America  will clearly favor soybean
plantings at the expense of grains,” Oil World said. “With
normal weather there should also be much less acreage
abandonment, and we expect that the soybean area available for
harvest will increase steeply.”  Soybean supplies will remain tight during the first half of
the 2012-13 season because South American harvests won’t begin
until 2013, Oil World said. Global stockpiles may drop to 54.7
million tons on Aug. 31, before rising the following year to
61.7 million, the second-lowest number since 2008-09.  Dry weather in the U.S. may also hurt developing soybean
crops, especially if conditions persist until August, when
plants enter the pod-setting and filling stages, Oil World said.  “It has become unfavorably dry and hot in several parts of
the Midwest and the southeast, reducing soil moisture supplies
and resulting in a deterioration in soybean and corn crop
conditions,” Oil World said. “This is reason for concern,
primarily for corn which had entered its important stage of
pollination. There is still time for improvement for soybeans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
