Taiwan ’s dollar ended a three-day
losing streak on speculation exporters are repatriating income
before the end of the month.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency closed at NT$29.990 against its U.S.
counterpart, little changed from NT$29.995 yesterday, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier weakened to NT$30.010, near a
five-month low of NT$30.070 reached on June 5.  “Exporters are very interested in selling the greenback
when the exchange rate is above NT$30,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
currency trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “In the next
three months, the currency should continue to weaken due to the
worsening economic performance.”  Global funds sold $143 million more Taiwanese shares than
they bought today, building on net sales of $840 million this
month through yesterday, exchange data show. The island’s  export
orders  slumped for a third month in May and the jobless rate
climbed, government reports showed last week.  The currency has dropped 1.5 percent this quarter, paring
its 2012 gain to 1 percent. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of  exchange-rate  swings used to price options, was
little changed today at 4.55 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
little changed at 1.20 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The rate on the  benchmark  10-year bonds reached 1.205
percent on June 22, the highest level in more than three weeks.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.507
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
