Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30) 
climbed 2.9 percent to 4,612.14 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo,
the highest level in more than three weeks. That made it the
best performer among 95 global gauges tracked by Bloomberg after
 Bangladesh ’s measure and narrowed the index’s loss this quarter
to 8.1 percent.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)  , the
country’s biggest publicly traded lender, increased 4.1 percent
to 25.43 Egyptian pounds, the highest level in more than a
month. The central bank’s decision last month to cut the local-
currency reserve requirement ratio to 10 percent of deposits
goes into effect today, helping free-up funds for banks to
deploy rather than park at the regulator with no return.  Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH)   climbed 2.7 percent
to 4.22 pounds, the highest level since May 24. An Egyptian
court will examine the company’s appeal of a six-month
preliminary sentence against Chairman and Managing Director
Tarek Talaat Moustafa on July 30 for the alleged sale of a
property unit to more than one client.  To contact the reporter on this story:
