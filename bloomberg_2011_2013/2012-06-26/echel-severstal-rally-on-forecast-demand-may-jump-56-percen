OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  climbed, ending the worst
two-day decline in seven months, after a trade association
representing the largest steelmakers forecast a surge in
domestic demand.  Mechel,  Russia ’s biggest producer of coking-coal, added 0.3
percent to 190.60 rubles by the close in Moscow after slumping
12 percent in the previous two days. OAO Severstal, the
country’s second-largest steelmaker, advanced 0.6 percent to
377.80 rubles.  Russian Steel, which represents companies including
Severstal and OAO Novolipetsk, estimated the country’s demand
for steel products will rise to 64 million tons by 2020 from 41
million tons in 2011 at a presentation today.  Output in Russia will increase to 80 million tons in 2020
from 69 million tons in 2011, Russian Steel said. The
 construction industry  will remain the largest consumer, while
the most growth in demand will come from automakers, it said.
Russian  sales  accounted for 54 percent of Mechel’s annual
revenue in 2008. Coking coal is used in the production of steel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
