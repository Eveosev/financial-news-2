Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn ’s pay rose to 987 million yen ($12 million)
last fiscal year while bigger rival Toyota Motor Corp. left its
CEO’s pay flat and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  cut compensation.  The 58-year-old CEO’s pay increased from the 982 million
yen he earned a year earlier, Ghosn said at the company’s annual
general meeting today in Yokohama, Japan.  Nissan earned the most profit among Japanese carmakers last
fiscal year for the first time in at least two decades, as Ghosn
guided the automaker to a faster recovery than Toyota and Honda
from an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.  “Ghosn has done an incredible job in the last 10, 12 years
in turning Nissan into a very solid company again,”  Ashvin Chotai , London-based managing director for Intelligence
Automotive Asia, said in a telephone interview. “His salary is
a small price Nissan has to pay for his success.”  Nissan’s shares fell 1 percent to 721 yen as of 11:21 a.m.
in Tokyo trading. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
declined 0.8 percent.  Publicly traded companies in Japan are required to disclose
executive pay higher than 100 million yen a year. Ghosn was the
highest-paid executive in the past two years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rivals’ Pay  Toyota President  Akio Toyoda  was paid 136 million yen for
the year ended March 31, the same as the preceding year,
according to a filing to Japan’s Financial Services Agency
yesterday. Honda Motor Co. President Takanobu Ito earned 123
million yen in the same period, 5 percent less than the year
earlier.  In comparison,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  CEO  Alan Mulally , the top-
paid U.S. automotive industry executive in 2011, earned $29.5
million, more than double Ghosn’s compensation，according to
Equilar Inc., a  Redwood City , California-based executive-pay
researcher.  “The executive pay in Europe and U.S. is, generally
speaking, much higher than in Asia,” said Chotai. “Nissan’s
performance depends more on what it does outside Japan rather
than in Japan.”  For the fiscal year ended March 31, Nissan earned 341.4
billion yen in profit, 20 percent more than Toyota and 61
percent more than Honda -- the first time the Yokohama-based
carmaker topped the Japanese  auto industry , according to
earnings data compiled by Bloomberg stretching back to 1992.  U.S. Sales  Ghosn, who’s also CEO of  Renault SA (RNO) , is targeting Nissan to
eventually account for 10 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales,
up from 8.2 percent last year.  In China, where Nissan is the top Japanese carmaker, the
company sold 425,000 vehicles this year as of June 21, 20
percent more than a year earlier. Nissan forecast sales in its
largest market will increase 8.3 percent to 1.35 million units
this financial year.  China’s growth is still significant, even though it will
slow, Ghosn told shareholders today in Yokohama. He said he’s
still bullish on China.  The carmaker will continue investing in China, Executive
Vice President Hiroto Saikawa said at the annual meeting.  Nissan’s lead may be short-lived as  Toyota (7203)  and Honda expect
net income to jump to 760 billion yen and 470 billion yen
respectively this fiscal year, compared with Nissan’s forecast
for 400 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
