RWE (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, plans to create 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity this
year with rooftop panels on commercial buildings, the  Financial
Times Deutschland  said, citing Hanns-Ferdinand Mueller, head of
the company’s power distribution unit.  RWE is creating a business model to expand decentralized
generation of alternative energy in what Mueller described as a
“culture shift,” the Hamburg-based newspaper said in an e-
mailed version of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
