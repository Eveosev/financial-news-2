Cocoa purchases by Cameroon’s major
grinder of the chocolate ingredient fell 48 percent in May, the
Cocoa and Coffee Board and the Cocoa and Coffee
Interprofessional Board said in a joint report.  Sic-Cacao bought 434 metric tons of beans compared with 842
tons a year earlier, the institutions said in a text message
from the port city of Douala today.  Chococam, another main buyer, bought no beans, according to
the message. The two grinders have bought 28,466 tons since the
season started on Aug. 1. Cameroon is  Africa ’s fourth-largest
