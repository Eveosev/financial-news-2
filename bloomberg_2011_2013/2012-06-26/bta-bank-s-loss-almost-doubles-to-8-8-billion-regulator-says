BTA Bank,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
lender before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009, almost
doubled its loss for the year in May amid plans to restructure
its debt for a second time in as many years.  BTA’s 2012 net loss jumped to 1.308 trillion tenge ($8.8
billion) as of June 1 from 711 billion tenge a month earlier,
the central bank’s financial oversight committee said in a
monthly  report  on its website. Liabilities of 2.63 trillion
tenge exceeded assets by 1.19 trillion tenge, the regulator
said.  BTA said June 15 that it had begun talks on its proposed
debt overhaul with the creditors’ steering committee. The state-
owned lender failed to make an interest payment on its July 2018
dollar bonds in January and later halted all payments on $5.2
billion of its recovery units, which BTA creditors took in 2010
as part of a restructuring accord to receive 50 percent of
anything the lender can get from impaired assets.  BTA Bank (BTAS)  didn’t immediately reply to an e-mailed request
for comments.  The following table shows the one-month performance of
Kazakhstan’s five largest lenders by assets, along with seventh-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of June 1. The data from the oversight committee are
in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
