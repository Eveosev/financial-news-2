Elementis Plc (ELM) , the specialty
chemical maker born out of British tea-trader Harrisons &
Crosfield, agreed to acquire Watercryl Quimica Ltda. of  Brazil 
for $24 million to expand in the Latin American market for
coatings additives.  Watercryl generated sales of $9.3 million and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $2.3
million in the year through May, and the deal is expected to
close in the second half, the London-based company said in a
release today.  Elementis shares  climbed 2.7 percent to 193 pence
as of 8:49 a.m. local time.  Elementis will combine Watercryl with its existing
Specialty Products offering to  accelerate growth  in Latin
America. The company is seeking out other investment
opportunities to pursue expansion in high-growth markets, Chief
Executive Officer David Dutro said in the release.  “This acquisition represents significant progress in
extending our reach into the fast growing and increasingly
sophisticated  Latin America  coatings market,” Dutro said.  The purchase price implies a multiple of 10.4 times Ebitda,
compared with a median ratio of 7.19 for specialty chemical
deals in western  Europe  over the past six years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
