Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.1 percent to 2,222.07. The gauge
declined for a fifth day, the longest losing streak since
December. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.1 percent to 2,454.92.  Heilongjiang Interchina Water Co. (600187)  (600187 CH), which
operates a water supply and sewage business, dropped 5.9 percent
to 8.91  yuan . The company will issue up to 160 million shares
for at least 8.03 yuan each, according to a Shanghai exchange
filing yesterday.  Other water companies declined.  Qianjiang Water Resources
Development Co. (600283)  (600283 CH) slumped 6.9 percent to 9.90 yuan.
 Chongqing Three Gorges Water Conservancy & Electric Power Co. (600116) 
(600116 CH) slid 4.7 percent to 12.66 yuan.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111)  (600111
CH), China’s biggest producer of rare earth, retreated 2.6
percent to 41.58 yuan, the lowest close since May 3. Rare earth
stocks are falling because gains have been excessive this year,
said Zhang Zhipeng, an analyst at AJ Securities Co., in a phone
interview in Shanghai. The stock has surged 121 percent in 2012
and trades at 26.6 times estimated profit, compared with the
Shanghai Composite’s 9.7 multiple.  Navinfo Co. (002405)  (002405 CH), a maker of electronic navigation
products, decreased 5.5 percent to 12.80 yuan, a record low. A
gauge of technology companies in the CSI 300 Index sank 0.8
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Technology stocks’
valuations are too high, said Hu Jiaming, an analyst at Capital
Securities Corp. in Shanghai. The industry index trades at a
multiple of 18.2 times estimated profit, compared with the CSI
300’s 10.4 times. Hu expects consumer electronics stocks to
continue to falter in the second half on weaker European demand.  Ningxia Yinxing Energy Co. (000862)  (000862 CH) gained 3.9 percent
to 7.21 yuan, snapping four days of losses. The company said it
plans to develop wind and solar farms.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  (600104 CH), China’s largest carmaker,
retreated 0.8 percent to 14.10 yuan, the lowest close since
March 28. An official with the nation’s economic planning body
said the government has no imminent plans to introduce more
stimulus policies to revive vehicle demand.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (600188)  (600188 CH), the nation’s fourth
largest producer, plunged 5.4 percent to 19.61 yuan, the lowest
close since Sep. 30, 2010. Benchmark power-station coal prices
at Qinhuangdao declined the most in more than three years.  -- Editor: Darren Boey  To contact the reporter on this story:
