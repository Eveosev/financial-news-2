Jamie Moyer, 49, will try to
continue his Major League Baseball career with the Toronto Blue
Jays after being released by two other organizations this
season.  Moyer, who was released by the Baltimore Orioles on June
23, agreed to a minor-league deal with the Blue Jays, the team
said.  After missing the entire 2011 campaign, Moyer returned from
ligament transplant surgery on his pitching elbow to open the
season with the Colorado Rockies, going 2-5 with a 5.70 earned
run average before being cut in May.  In April he became the oldest pitcher to win a major-league
game. The 25-year veteran has a  269-209 record  and a 4.25 ERA
with eight teams.  Toronto is 38-35 this season, tied with the Boston Red Sox
for last place in the American League East, 6 1/2 games behind
the division-leading New York Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
