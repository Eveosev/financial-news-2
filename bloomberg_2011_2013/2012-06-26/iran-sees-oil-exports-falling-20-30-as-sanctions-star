Iran ’s oil exports may “gradually”
decline by 20 percent to 30 percent after sanctions start next
week amid field maintenance work, according to Deputy Oil
Minister Ahmad Ghalebani.  Iran is planning to carry out field workovers and reservoir
maintenance on  oil fields  just as the European Union sanctions
begin, Ghalebani told reporters today at an energy conference in
Moscow. Imports by China, India, Korea and  South Africa  may drop
in the “short term,” although the countries will need Iranian
energy to feed growing demand, said Ghalebani, who is also head
of National Iranian Oil Co.  An EU embargo aimed at derailing Iran’s nuclear enrichment
program will come into effect July 1 after talks with the
Persian Gulf state failed to reach a breakthrough.  While Ghalebani said field maintenance was the reason for
the drop in exports, he also said, that “maybe, yes,” the work
is timed to coincide with sanctions. He didn’t say what the
country’s rate of exports or production was.  Iran’s May crude production rate was 3.14 million barrels a
day, according to the OPEC secretariat’s secondary sources, and
3.76 million barrels a day according to a direct communication
from Iran’s government, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said in its latest monthly report on June 12.  Earlier today, the Tehran-based newspaper Shargh said Iran
would welcome payments for its oil in Chinese  yuan , citing an
interview with Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi. The country
typically is paid for oil shipments in U.S. dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
