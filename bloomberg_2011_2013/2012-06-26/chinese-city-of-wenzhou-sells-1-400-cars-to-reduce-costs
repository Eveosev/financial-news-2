A Chinese city that is bearing the
brunt of the country’s economic slowdown plans to sell about
1,400 government cars to cut costs and increase transparency.  The Wenzhou city government sold 215 cars by auction on
June 24, state-owned  China  National Radio reported, citing
information from the local government. Officials who no longer
have a car will be given transportation subsidies ranging from
300  yuan  ($47) to 3,100 yuan a month based on rank, the
 government  said on its website.  Chinese  leaders  have asked government agencies to disclose
vehicle purchases and ownership as part of efforts to make
expenditures more transparent. China’s growth has slowed for
five quarters, and Wenzhou, stung by government plans to rein in
a property bubble, has seen growth moderate to a 5 percent pace
last quarter, the weakest in at least four years.  Wenzhou spends 144 million yuan a year to operate and
maintain its vehicle fleet, China National Radio said. Ipsos, an
auto research body, estimates that the national government
spends about $16 billion a year as China’s biggest buyer of
cars.  Vehicles produced by  Audi AG (NSU)  make up about a third of
government and state-linked enterprise fleet, according to Zhang Xin, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
