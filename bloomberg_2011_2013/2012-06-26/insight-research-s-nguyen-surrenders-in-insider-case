Tai Nguyen, president of Insight
Research LLC, admitted to participating in an insider-trading
scheme that involved hedge fund Galleon Group LLC.  Nguyen, 49, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge
Naomi Reice Buchwald in federal court in  Manhattan  to one count
of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.  He was charged earlier today as part of a sweeping probe of
illegal trading by Galleon. Nguyen’s name emerged last year in
telephone records submitted by prosecutors in a criminal case
against Donald Longueuil, a former portfolio manager at SAC
Capital Advisors LP, who pleaded guilty to insider-trading
charges.  Nguyen admitted to participating in a scheme that ran
between 2006 to 2009. The charge carries a term of as long as
five years in prison. Buchwald said that U.S. sentencing
guidelines indicate he faces a range of 46 to 57 months.  Longueuil was sentenced in July to 2 1/2 years in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
