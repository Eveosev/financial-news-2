Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K.’s largest
online grocer, reported modest growth in first-half profit as it
joined a coupon battle with store-based competitors and said the
outlook remains tough for food retailers and the economy.  Pretax profit was 181,000 pounds ($282,180) in the 24 weeks
ended May 13, the Hatfield, England-based retailer said today in
a  statement , compared with 174,000 pounds in the same period a
year earlier. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 4.5 percent to 14.9 million pounds, missing
the 15.1 million-pound  average estimate  of three analysts.  Ocado fell as much as 12 percent in London trading, the
most since Dec. 19. The retailer increased spending on marketing
coupons to defend against similar activity by the biggest
supermarkets including  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  and J Sainsbury Plc. Revenue at
the online grocer rose by 11 percent to 308 million pounds, and
Ocado said it expects growth to accelerate in the second half as
it increases capacity at its Hatfield distribution center.  “The grocery market and the general economic picture
remain challenging and uncertain,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner said in the statement. “The third quarter is
particularly hard to forecast as we have already seen some
disruption from the Jubilee events, and there is uncertainty as
to the effect of the forthcoming  Olympic Games .”  Ocado dropped 7.7 percent to 99.8 pence as of 8:21 a.m. The
shares have still risen 83 percent this year, the fifth-best
performer in the U.K. FTSE 350 Index.  Duncan Tatton-Brown, the former chief financial officer of
Fitness First Group Plc, will join the board as new CFO from
Sept. 1 replacing Andrew Bracey who left in March. Tatton-Brown
was formerly finance director of Kingfisher Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
