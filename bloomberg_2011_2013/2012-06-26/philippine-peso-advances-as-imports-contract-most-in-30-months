The Philippine peso rose for the
first time in four days as government data showed imports fell
the most in 30 months amid a global slowdown, curbing demand for
dollars.  Overseas purchases shrank 13.7 percent in April from a year
earlier, the biggest drop since October 2009, and the trade
deficit narrowed to $135 million from $1.05 billion, the
 National Statistics Office  in  Manila  said today. Global trade
has slumped amid  Europe ’s debt crisis, which will be discussed
by the region’s leaders at a two-day summit this week.  “Manufacturers are still wary of stepping up purchases,”
said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .
“Ahead of the European summit, gains in Asian currencies are
going to be tentative.”  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 42.470 per dollar in Manila,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 42.675
yesterday, the weakest level since June 13. Its one-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, increased 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage
point, to 6.30 percent.  The peso has appreciated 0.9 percent this quarter, the best
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the
yen. For the year, it’s strengthened 3.1 percent.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 was unchanged at 5.94 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  The government reported today that the budget balance swung
to a deficit of 19.9 billion pesos ($468 million) in May from a
surplus of 31 billion pesos in April as spending rose 16.7
percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
