Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s second-
biggest lender, climbed the most in three weeks, snapping its
longest losing streak in more than five months that left it
trading at a discount to domestic banks.  The shares rose 3.3 percent to 146.2 zloty at 4:36 p.m. in
Warsaw, the biggest increase since June 6. Pekao, 59 percent
owned by UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s largest bank, trades 12.9 times
trailing 12-month earnings, below the  average  of 14.1 for its
local peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Pekao’s valuation has slipped relative to other domestic
banks in recent weeks,” Tomasz Bursa, an analyst at Ipopema
Securities SA in Warsaw, said by phone today. “That makes it
attractive, especially to foreign buyers.” Ipopema rates Pekao
a buy with a 12-month target price of 148 zloty.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , the biggest Polish bank, gained the
most in a week as its shares advanced 2.2 percent to 33.78
zloty. The price-earnings ratio for state-controlled PKO is
10.7, lower than Pekao’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
