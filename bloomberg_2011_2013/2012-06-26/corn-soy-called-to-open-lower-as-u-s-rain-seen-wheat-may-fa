What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as new forecasts showed a
little more rain and cooler temperatures than earlier in the
day, which may ease stress on some Midwest crops, Jerrod Kitt,
the research director for the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on the U.S. weather forecast and on reduced demand after
prices rallied 5.5 percent this month, Kitt said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT on speculation that a 16 percent surge in prices this
month, the biggest gain among 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poorâ€™s GSCI Spot Index, will slow global demand for
supplies from the U.S., Kitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
