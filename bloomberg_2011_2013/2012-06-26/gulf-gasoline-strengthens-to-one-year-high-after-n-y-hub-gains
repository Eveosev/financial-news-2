U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened to the highest level in a year after New York
prices rose as refineries shut equipment.  Fuel made to East Coast specifications gained in the Gulf
for a second day. Prices in New York Harbor have climbed for
five of the past six days after Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia
refinery closed a vacuum tower for work June 20, according to a
regulatory notice.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast rose 2.5 cents to 11 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:24 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the highest
level since May 12, 2011. Prompt delivery fell 10.61 cents to
$2.6247 a gallon.  LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)  NV’s Houston Refining reported a
leak at a plant in Houston from a tower at the 940 unit,
according to a filing with state regulators. The line was
blocked and the leak was stopped, the filing shows.  Refineries including Hovensa LLC’s St. Croix refinery in
the  U.S. Virgin Islands  and the Trainer plant in Pennsylvania,
now owned by a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines Inc., both shut
before the start of the peak summer U.S. demand season.  The premium for RBOB in New York Harbor advanced 0.25 cent
to 20.25 cents a gallon. The fuel reached its highest level
since September on June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
