An options paper for reshaping the
euro zone leans toward mutualizing debt and doesn’t say enough
about imposing stricter controls on national budgets, said
German Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Link.  “Parts of it read like a wish list,” Link told reporters
before a meeting of European affairs ministers in Luxembourg
today. “The report is important but it isn’t a decision.”  The report -- co-authored by European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy , European Commission President Jose Barroso,
European Central Bank PresidentMario Draghi and Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  -- was sent to national
capitals early today.  The proposals lean “toward various models for mutualizing
debt. What comes up short is improved controls,” Link said.
“We’re not convinced that mutualization of debt is a way out of
the crisis.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
