Charles Kim, a New York-based
director at Mirae Asset Securities Co., comments on key factors
that will drive  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  shares and the outlook
for its smartphone business.  Kim spoke during an interview with Rishaad Salamat on
Bloomberg Television’s “First Up.”  On why he favors Samsung amid legal disputes with Apple Inc.:  “Going forward, the bigger issue would be their new
handset line up and their ever-expanding market share in the
smartphone space. I think that is going to be the real driver
for Samsung share price going forward.”  “Smartphone is one of the most important businesses for
Samsung Electronics right now.”  On how the new Galaxy S III smartphone will help Samsung:  “With the successful launch of the Galaxy S III, Samsung
can really overtake Apple and other competitors as the No. 1
smartphone maker globally.”  “They did have an issue with some of their component
manufacturers. I believe they’ll resolve these issues in the
third quarter.”  “Going into the second half of this year, especially the
third quarter, I’m looking for strong shipments, over 10 million
units of Samsung S III.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
