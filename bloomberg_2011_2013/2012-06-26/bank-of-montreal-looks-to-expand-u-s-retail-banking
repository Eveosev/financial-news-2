Bank of Montreal  identified five
U.S. Midwest markets in which to expand its U.S. consumer lender
and build on its C$4.1 billion ($3.99 billion) takeover of
Milwaukee-based lender Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  Canada’s fourth-largest lender said it’s looking to expand
its Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank by building branches or
pursuing small takeovers in downtown Chicago, Indianapolis,
Minneapolis,  St. Louis  and  Kansas City , Missouri, according to a
 presentation  on its website.  Bank of Montreal plans build on its July takeover of M&I,
the largest acquisition in the company’s 195-year history. The
Toronto-based bank is integrating M&I into its BMO Harris Bank
consumer lending unit.  The bank will maintain branches in Phoenix and Florida, and
may close or consolidate branches in  Milwaukee , Madison,
Wisconsin, and suburban Chicago, BMO Harris Bank Chief Executive
Officer Mark Furlong said today in an investor presentation in
Chicago. The bank said yesterday it’ll close 24 U.S. branches to
eliminate overlap.  Bank of Montreal said it expects “at least” $400 million
in cost savings from integrating the lender, up from an earlier
target of $300 million. Expenses are down $180 million on an
annualized basis, the bank said.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)   rose  8 cents to C$54.80 at 12:19 p.m.
