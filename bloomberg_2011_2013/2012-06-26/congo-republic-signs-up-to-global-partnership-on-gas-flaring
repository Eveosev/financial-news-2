Congo Republic, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s
fourth-biggest oil producer, agreed to become a member of the
Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership that seeks to curb
burning of the fuel, the government said.  An agreement was signed with the World Bank-backed project
today in the capital, Brazzaville, Petroleum Minister Andre
Raphael Loemba said.  Congo flares about 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas
annually, according to a satellite survey conducted by the  World
Bank  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in
2010. Global flaring adds 400 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere each year, according to the World
Bank’s website.  Congo produced 295,000 barrels a day of oil last year,
according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
