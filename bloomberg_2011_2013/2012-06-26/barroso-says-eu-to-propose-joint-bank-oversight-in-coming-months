The European Union plans to propose
joint bank supervision and deposit insurance this year, European
Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  said today.  “We intend to present further proposals in the coming
months on a common European supervisor and a common deposit
insurance and resolution scheme, including common funds paid for
primarily by those banks that are overseen by the common
European supervisor,” Barroso, who heads the EU’s regulatory
arm, said in a speech today.  Barroso said the proposals would aim to include all 27
nations while recognizing that some countries may need to opt
out of some aspects of the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
