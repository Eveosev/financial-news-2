Turkey will offer incentives for
technology companies, educational institutions, filmmakers and
games producers to venture abroad, in an effort to reduce the
country’s current account deficit,  Sabah  reported, citing
Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan.  Companies opening offices in technology centers will get as
much as $600,000 to help with the costs of rent, salaries and
cooperation with other agencies, the newspaper said.  Games makers can have half of the cost of entering  foreign
markets covered as the government seeks to increase the
industry’s revenue to $1 billion, Sabah said.  Educational institutions will receive as much as $200,000
to cover 60 percent of the cost of renting offices, and
filmmakers can have half the costs of advertising covered up to
$100,000 per film, Sabah said, citing Caglayan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
