Global trade confidence is so far
weathering Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, according to a survey
of businesses by  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Some 71 percent of exporters, importers and traders expect
shipment volumes to be unchanged or increase in the next six
months, HSBC said in a statement today. The bank cited a survey
of 5,800 enterprises in 20 countries from April 10 to June 1.  Cyprus said yesterday that it will seek a financial
lifeline as the euro region’s leaders struggle to contain a
crisis that has also undermined Spain’s banks. Asian stocks fell
for a fourth day today after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
hardened her resistance to euro-area debt sharing before
European leaders meet this week.  “Despite the uncertain economic conditions, traders remain
cautiously optimistic,” HSBC said.  The bank’s Trade Confidence Index was at 113 points,
compared with 112 in the second half of 2011. In a change to the
shape of global trade, China’s imports will start to grow more
quickly than the nation’s exports within the next five years,
HSBC said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.4 percent as of 10:52
a.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its longest losing streak in three
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
