Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) ,
a Hong Kong-based chain with more revenue than  Tiffany & Co. (TIF) ,
said profit jumped 79 percent last fiscal year as it expanded
and benefited from higher luxury spending in China.  Net income rose to HK$6.34 billion ($817 million) for the
12 months ended March 31, according to a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday, matching the  average  of 12 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue jumped 61 percent to
HK$56.6 billion.  The world’s biggest listed jewelry retailer raised about
HK$15.8 billion in a public offering last December and joins
companies including  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  and  Prada SpA (1913)  in betting
on China’s demand for  luxury goods . Chow Tai Fook plans to
double sales in three years by opening new outlets, Chairman
Henry Cheng said at a press conference in  Hong Kong  yesterday.  China’s growing middle class is helping to bolster revenue
despite weaker economic expansion in the world’s second biggest
economy, Cheng said. Same-store sales at outlets open more than
a year grew 40 percent.  “Retail sentiment has weakened in recent months as
consumers became more prudent because of economic uncertainty,”
Cheng said. “That’s reflected in lower spending per customer
per transaction, but as the size of China’s middle class is
growing, this helps to boost total sales.”  Chow Tai Fook shares rose as much 3.4 percent to HK$9.53 as
of 9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong trading today. The city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  fell 0.04 percent. The stock has dropped 36
percent from its HK$15 initial public offering price.  The world’s second-largest economy expanded 8.1 percent in
the first three months of this year, the fifth quarterly
deceleration. Average annual urban disposable income rose 14
percent in China to about 21,810  yuan  ($3,427) last year.  Adding New Stores  Sales of discretionary goods in China will grow by a
compounded annual rate of 13.4 percent between 2010 and 2020, as
shoppers in the world’s largest economy after the U.S. become
richer, McKinsey & Co. said in a report in March.  Chow Tai Fook had 1,627 outlets as of the end of March, it
said yesterday, compared with 1,358 a year earlier. The company
expects to have 2,000 stores by 2014, Managing Director Kent Wong said.  The company expects capital expenditure of HK$800 million
to HK$1 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2013, with as
much as HK$400 million to be spent on adding at least 200 new
stores in the period.  Founded in 1929 in the southern Chinese city of  Guangzhou ,
the jeweler was named after founder Chow Chi Yuen. “Tai Fook”
means “big blessing” in Chinese. Before the public offering,
the company had  predicted  earnings of “not less than” HK$6.3
billion for the fiscal year ended March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
