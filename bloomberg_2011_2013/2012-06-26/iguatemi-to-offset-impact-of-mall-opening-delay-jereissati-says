Iguatemi Empresa de Shopping Centers
SA  will make up for the impact of a two-month delay in the
opening of its luxury JK Iguatemi shopping mall by cutting costs
and boosting revenue, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Jereissati
said.  “It has an impact, but the company has mechanisms to
generate other revenues here, and save there, so that this
impact isn’t felt,” Jereissati said in an interview during the
opening of the mall on June 22 in Sao Paulo. “Iguatemi earnings
will be fine.” He didn’t elaborate on how the company will
compensate for the delay.  Sao Paulo-based Iguatemi spent 322.3 million reais ($156.1
million) to build the  JK Iguatemi  mall, which was initially
scheduled to open April 19. The start of operations was
postponed while developers waited for permits to build access
roads capable of handling the traffic generated by expected
20,000 daily visitors.  The mall features about 30 international retailers starting
operations in  Brazil , including Jeanne Lanvin SA, Carolina
Herrera Ltd. and Sephora SA.  Iguatemi expects net revenue to grow 25 percent to 30
percent in 2012, while the margin on earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of
profitability -- will reach about 70 percent by the end of the
year, according to its  first-quarter  earnings report, published
on May 3. Iguatemi is scheduled to release second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 2.  “We are very comfortable with our guidance,” Jereissati
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
