Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. ,
a retail chain that sells West Coast-inspired apparel, jumped
the most in three weeks after a director bought 30,000 shares in
the company.  The Anaheim, California-based company rose 10 percent to
$1.60 at the close in New York, for its biggest gain since June
5.  Board member Brett Brewer purchased shares in the company
from June 22 to June 25 at prices ranging from $1.45 to $1.56 a
share, the company said today in a  filing  with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Pacific Sunwear, whose competitors include  Zumiez Inc. (ZUMZ)  and
Tilly’s Inc., posted a $15.6 million loss in the first quarter
ended April 28, compared with a $31.5 million loss a year
earlier. The company is closing stores as it seeks to raise the
performance of individual outlets and will have about 620 to 630
shops at the end of this fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer
Gary Schoenfeld told a Piper Jaffray  conference  on June 6.  The company operated 930 stores when Schoenfeld joined the
company three years ago, he said.  Schoenfeld purchased 150,001 of the company’s shares from
May 29 to May 30, at prices ranging from $1.45 to $1.47 a share,
according to a filing the company made with the SEC on May 31.
George Mrkonic Jr., a director, purchased 100,000 shares at
$1.48 each on May 29, the company said in filing dated May 30.  Today’s rise in the shares pare their decline this year to
6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
