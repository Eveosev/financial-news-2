The naira retreated against the
dollar on speculation that declines in oil,  Nigeria ’s key
export, may hamper the central bank’s ability to defend the
currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.3 percent to 162.65 per dollar as of 3:08 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has slid 0.2 percent this year
after being Africa’s best-performing currency in the first five
months.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude snapped two days of
gains, sliding 0.1 percent to $92.18 a barrel, a 28 percent
retreat from its March peak this year. Spanish and Italian bonds
fell as borrowing costs increased at debt sales today ahead of a
gathering of European leaders on June 28-29 in their latest
summit meeting to try to stop contagion from the debt crisis.  “Recent naira weakness reflects the fall in global  oil
prices  caused by the impact of the euro zone crisis on the
global economy,” Ecobank Transnational Inc. strategists, led by
Paris-based Paul-Harry Aithnard, wrote in a note to clients
today.  The West African nation’s foreign reserves have fallen $612
million this month to $37.1 billion as of June 22 as the central
bank has increased dollar sales at twice-weekly currency
auctions and directly to the market to defend the naira.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose to a record high, gaining seven basis points to 15.71
percent, according to the June 25 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website.  The Debt Management Office will offer as much as 30 billion
naira ($184 million) of the five-year notes at an auction
tomorrow.  Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
fell four basis points to 5.59 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.6 percent to 1.934 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
