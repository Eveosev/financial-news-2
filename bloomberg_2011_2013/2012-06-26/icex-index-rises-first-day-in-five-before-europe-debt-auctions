Russian stocks gained for the first
time in five days before bond sales in  Europe  and as the
region’s leaders prepare to discuss steps to contain the debt
crisis.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent to 1,338.04 by 10:09 a.m.
in Moscow. OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia’s largest
telecommunications operator, led the advance, rising 1.8
percent. OAO Aeroflot, the country’s biggest airline carrier,
jumped 1.2 percent after Alexey Navalny, an anticorruption
blogger and opposition leader, was elected to the board
yesterday.  The  MSCI Emerging-Market Index (MXEF)  added 0.2 percent to 906.11.
Italy and Spain auction securities today and European Union
leaders hold a two-day summit starting June 28. Oil, Russia’s
biggest export earner, was little changed at $79.13 in New York
after paring earlier losses.  “Investors are waiting for the results of the EU summit,”
UralSib Capital analysts led by Leonid Slipchenko said in an e-
mailed note. “There is quite a lot of uncertainty, which
continues to destabilize markets.”  Oil and gas contribute about 50 percent of  Russia ’s state
revenue. Crude fell to the lowest level since October on June
21, tumbling to $78.20.  The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  slid 1.9 percent to 1,430.02
yesterday, the biggest drop since June 8. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index added 0.9 percent today to 1,273.33, rising for the
first day in five.  Russian stocks trade at 4.8 times  estimated earnings ,
having retreated 4.7 percent this year. That compares with a 1.2
percent drop for MSCI’s emerging-market gauge which trades at
9.3 times projected earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
