Rival airlines to  Ryanair Holdings
Plc (RYA)  have drawn up a report alleging that the Irish discount
carrier would have made a loss of 304.9 million euros ($381.6
million) in the 2011-12 financial year if it wasn’t for state
support,  L’Echo reported , citing a copy of the document.  The report, which hasn’t been made public, was drawn up by
the Association of European Airlines, a trade group, L’Echo
said.  In an interview with the Belgian newspaper, Ryanair Chief
Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  denied that the airline
received state aid. Tax reductions that the company has
negotiated with airports do not count as public support, he
said.  O’Leary said Ryanair would seek to begin flights from
another four European airports by the end of this year,
according to L’Echo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
