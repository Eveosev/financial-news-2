Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will begin
drilling off Alaska’s north coast in the third quarter, Interior
Secretary  Ken Salazar  said as he outlined U.S. plans to advance
Arctic energy production.  “We anticipate that there will be exploration with the
initial wells going in by Shell this summer,” Salazar said
today in an interview at a meeting of energy ministers in
Trondheim, Norway. “We have now pending exploration plans that
have been submitted by other companies as well.”  Shell is awaiting U.S. approval of the final permit to
develop leases bought in 2005 and 2008.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and
 Statoil ASA (STL)  also won rights in the region and plan to join The
Hague-based Shell in the area last explored in early 1990s.  Arctic drilling has been challenged in court by
environmental groups and some native Alaskans who say it may
lead to a disaster similar to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s well blowout in the  Gulf
of Mexico  in 2010, triggering the biggest U.S. offshore spill.  Shell plans to drill in about 120 feet (37 meters) of
water, while BP’s well was about 5,000 feet deep.  The U.S. plans to sell more oil and gas exploration
licenses in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in 2016 and 2017 as
the nation seeks to bolster domestic energy reserves,Salazar
told reporters today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
