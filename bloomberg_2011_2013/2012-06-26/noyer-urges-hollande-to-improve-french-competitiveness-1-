Bank of  France  Governor  Christian
Noyer  urged President  Francois Hollande  to bolster French
competitiveness, saying a persistent trade deficit in goods and
services needs to be eliminated.  “The persistent current account deficit induces imbalances
that are getting worse,” Noyer told journalists today in Paris.
“Inverting the trend strikes me as very necessary.”  France’s  current account  shortfall reached 1.9 percent of
gross domestic product last year as imports climbed to 497.5
billion euros ($621.5 billion) last year and exports stalled at
424 billion euros. The cumulative deficit since 2005 amounts to
165 billion euros, compared with a surplus of 130 billion euros
from 1999 to 2004.  “We have a problem of lack of competitiveness,” Noyer
said. “This evolution is worrying. It’s probably related to a
question of prices, of labor costs, though also quality.”  The government needs to tackle the issue in a durable
manner and not simply address the deficit by reducing demand,
Noyer added.  Cutting the deficit through “a reduction in demand linked
to deteriorating growth would mean that when growth recovers,
the deficit would simply return more strongly and the loss of
competitiveness would be aggravated,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
