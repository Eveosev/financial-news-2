South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell to the lowest level in four months as exports
contracted in all but one month this year amid Europe’s
worsening debt crisis.  The  index  measuring expectations for July dropped to 84
from 86 in June, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in Seoul
today. A measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies 
declined to 77 from 83.  The Bank of  Korea  indicated on June 21 it may cut its 2012
growth forecast in July for the second time this year. The
nation’s  consumer confidence  dropped to 101 in June, the weakest
in three months, according to a BOK report yesterday.  The business survey, conducted from June 13 to June 20, was
based on responses from 1,617 manufacturers and 881 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
