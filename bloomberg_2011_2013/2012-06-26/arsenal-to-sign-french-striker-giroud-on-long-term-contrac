Arsenal agreed to sign French
striker Olivier Giroud, the Premier League soccer club said on
its website.  Arsenal didn’t disclose terms of the agreement, only
calling it  “long-term.”  The Sun yesterday reported Giroud
would receive a five-year deal.  Giroud, 25, tied for the lead last season in Ligue 1 with
21 goals in helping Montpellier win its first league title. He
also played for  France  at the European Championship.  “He has proved that he is capable of performing at the top
level with club and country, and we saw what a big influence he
was in Montpellier’s championship-winning side last season,”
Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  said.  Giroud is the second forward signed by Arsenal for the new
season after Germany’s Lukas Podolski agreed in April to join
from Cologne. The Gunners are also trying to sign leading scorer
Robin van Persie to a new contract with his current deal
expiring after next season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
