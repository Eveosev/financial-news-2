EQT Partners AB set the  interest
rate  that will be paid on 865 million euros ($1 billion) of
senior leveraged loans backing its buyout of BSN Medical,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  A 225 million-euro term loan B denominated in dollars, a 50
million-euro revolving credit, and a 75 million-euro acquisition
facility will pay interest of 475 basis points more than
benchmark lending rates, while the remaining 515 million-euro
term loan will have an interest margin of 500 basis points, said
the person, who asked not to be named because the terms are
private.  The benchmark lending rates will have a 1.25 percent floor,
the person said.  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and Morgan Stanley are arranging the senior financing,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The banks plan to host meetings for potential lenders
tomorrow in  London  and June 28 in  New York , the person said.  EQT said on June 11 that it agreed to buy BSN from Montagu
Private Equity LLP for 1.8 billion euros.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
