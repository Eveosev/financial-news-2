RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , the U.K.’s
largest non-life insurer by market value, is seeking a loan for
as much as 500 million pounds ($778 million) to refinance an
existing credit line, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  RSA is self-arranging the five-year facility and is looking
for 10 banks to participate, each providing about 50 million
pounds, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the negotiations are private. The loan will replace a 455
million-pound facility signed in 2006 that’s due to mature in
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company is offering to pay initial interest of 50 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate for the
revolving credit, which is intended to remain undrawn, one of
the people said. The margin is linked to a credit-ratings grid
and will rise if RSA’s rating decreases. The London-based
insurer currently holds  investment-grade ratings  of Baa1 from
Moody’s Investors Service and BBB+ from  Fitch Ratings , Bloomberg
data show.  The revolving credit will pay additional utilization fees
of 15 basis points to borrow as much as a third of the facility,
30 basis points for more than a third, and 50 basis points for
two-thirds or greater, the person said.  Lenders will also receive a commitment fee of 17.5 basis
points, the person said. RSA paid an initial interest margin of
30 basis points more than Libor for the revolving credit it
signed in 2006, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage points.  “Our facility is due to be renewed next Spring,” Louise Shield, a spokeswoman for RSA said in an e-mailed statement.
“This renewal is just part of our ordinary course of
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
