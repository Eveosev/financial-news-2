The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.314
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in June 2014, yielded 0.313
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past 20
sales of the two-year maturity after peaking at $44 billion from
October 2009 through April 2010.  Last month’s two-year note sale drew a yield of 0.300
percent. The record auction low was 0.222 percent in August.  The May 22 offering’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.95. It was the highest since the Nov. 21 auction’s ratio of
4.07, the most for a fixed-coupon U.S. note or bond since the
Treasury Department began releasing the data in 1993. The
average for the past 10 auctions is 3.71.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 33.5 percent of the notes at the
May sale after purchasing 32.1 percent at the April offering.
The average for the past 10 auctions is 34 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 11.8
percent at the past 10.  Two-Year Returns  Two-year notes have returned 0.03 percent this year,
compared with a 1.92 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 1.46 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.79 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on June 28.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the June 21
auction of $7 billion in 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $49.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $56.1 billion.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
