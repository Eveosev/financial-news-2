Thailand’s baht rebounded from the
weakest level in three weeks after exports from Southeast Asia’s
second-biggest economy climbed more than forecast.  Government
bonds  were steady.  Overseas  shipments  rose 7.68 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with the median 0.5 percent increase
economists predicted in a Bloomberg survey, government data
showed yesterday. The currency lost 3 percent this quarter and
0.8 percent this year as concern Europe’s debt crisis will crimp
global economic growth reduced demand for emerging-market
assets.  “We can expect month-end baht demand from exporters,
especially as data confirms a gradual recovery in shipments from
last year’s floods,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the
Japan Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “However, that
won’t change the basic trend, which is a decline in stocks and
regional emerging-market currencies amid concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will spread. Sentiment will remain weak.”  The baht gained 0.3 percent to 31.80 per dollar as of 8:32
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 31.96 yesterday, the weakest level since May
31. Its one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
unchanged at 3.34 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
