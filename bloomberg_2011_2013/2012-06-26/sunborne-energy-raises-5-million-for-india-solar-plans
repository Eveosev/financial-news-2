SunBorne Energy Holdings LLC, the
Indian solar power company backed by billionaire  Vinod Khosla ,
raised $5 million for project development.  “This is a part of our ongoing fundraising,” Chief
Operating Officer Gagan Vermani said in an e-mail yesterday,
without identifying the investor.  SunBorne won a contract to build a 10-megawatt solar-
thermal project in India’s Karnataka state in April. It
completed a 15-megawatt plant in Gujarat state in December.  The Gurgaon-based company may seek to raise as much as $20
million, according to a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
