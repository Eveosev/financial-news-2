(Corrects to remove reference to units in other countries
in fourth paragraph in story published yesterday.)  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
 Turkey ’s largest mobile-phone company, said it has made no
decision on bidding for Globul, the Bulgarian mobile-phone unit
of Athens-based  Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA. (HTO)   Turkcell continues work on evaluating acquisition
opportunities in countries near its home market, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , Turkcell and Orange SA, controlled by
 France Telecom SA (FTE) , may be among the potential buyers of Globul,
 Capital  newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Hellenic Telecommunications hired  Citigroup Inc. (C)  as
adviser.  Globul has 4.3 million subscribers and had 413 million
euros ($516 million) of revenue in 2011, Tera Stock Brokers,
based in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note.  An auction to sell 94 percent of Bulgaria’s largest fixed-
line company  Vivacom, (5BT)  in which Turkcell also bid, failed in
early May as sellers canceled the process.  Turkcell shares rose 2.3 percent to 8.88 liras at 2:46 p.m.
in Istanbul trading, gaining for a fourth day in the longest
winning streak since Feb. 20. The company’s shareholders include
 TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , Altimo of  Russia  and Cukurova Holding AS of
Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
