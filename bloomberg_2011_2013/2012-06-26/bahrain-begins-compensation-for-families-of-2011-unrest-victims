Bahrain has started disbursing
compensation totaling $2.6 million to the families of 17 people
killed during last year’s unrest, the Information Affairs
Authority said.  The Justice Ministry set up the civil settlement initiative
in line with recommendations from an independent international
commission that investigated possible human-rights abuses during
mass protests in February and March 2011. At least 35 people
were killed during the rallies and an ensuing crackdown through
April last year, the commission has said.  Today’s e-mailed IAA statement quoted Judge Khalid Hassan
Ajaji, an assistant undersecretary at the ministry, as saying
that compensation for the 17 cases “was assessed on the basis
of civil court precedents.”  Protesters led by Bahrain’s Shiite majority last year
demanded equal rights and representation from the Sunni
monarchy, leading to a crackdown by security forces in which
troops from neighboring  Saudi Arabia , also ruled by Sunnis, were
called in to help. Tensions in the island nation have simmered
in Shiite areas since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
