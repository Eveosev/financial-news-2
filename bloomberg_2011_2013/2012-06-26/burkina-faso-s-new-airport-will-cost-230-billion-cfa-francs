Burkina Faso’s new international
airport will cost 230 billion  CFA francs  ($435 million), with
about 77 percent of the funding already committed from
international lenders.  The current facility is too close to Ouagadougou, the
capital city of 1.5 million people, and will be located in the
village of Donsin, 30 kilometers (19 miles) away, Do Pascal
Sessouma, communication director of the project, said in an e-
mail on June 22.  The funders who have already pledged loans of 177 billion
francs include the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the
 African Development Bank  and the West African Development Bank,
Sessouma said. Private investors will provide the remainder, he
said, without giving details.  Construction will begin next year and the first commercial
flight is expected in 2017, with 1 million passengers annually
reached by 2025, he said. The airport will have a runway of
3,500 meters and another of 4,000 meters, Sessouma said.  Air France-KLM (AF) , Royal Air Maroc, Brussels Airlines NV,
 Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  and Air Burkina, which flies around West
Africa, are the main carriers currently using the Ouagadougou
airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
