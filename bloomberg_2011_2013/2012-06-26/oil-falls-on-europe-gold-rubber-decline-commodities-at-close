The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.1 percent to 568.28 at 5:05 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.1
percent to 1425.258.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day in New York amid speculation a
meeting of European leaders this week will fail to halt a debt
crisis that threatens to slow the economy and curb fuel demand.  Oil for August delivery fell as much as 36 cents to $78.85
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $78.97 at 3 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday slipped 55 cents to $79.21, the lowest close
since June 21. Prices have fallen 23 percent this quarter, the
biggest drop since the final three months of 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas declined from a one-month high in New York as
Tropical Storm Debby was forecast to move away from production
platforms in the  Gulf of Mexico .  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July dropped 5 cents to $106.50
a barrel, at 10:22 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The premium of gasoil to
Dubai crude, known as the crack spread, declined for a third day
by 37 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $16.81 a barrel today.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of $1 a barrel to gasoil. This
spread, also known as the regrade, stayed unchanged from
yesterday.  Naphtha swaps for July rose $15.25, or 2.2 percent, to
$725.25 a metric ton, PVM data showed. Japan naphtha’s premium
to London-traded Brent crude futures climbed for a second day by
gaining $12.84 to $37.17 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This shows increasing refining profit from the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock.  Singapore fuel oil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining profits for the fuel, increased 47 cents to 94 cents a
barrel, PVM data showed.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may drop for the first time in three days as some
investors sold the metal after it advanced the most in two
weeks, before European leaders meet to address the region’s debt
crisis. Silver, platinum and palladium fell.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.2 percent to $1,581.63 an
ounce, and was at $1,583.32 at 3:04 p.m. in Singapore, after
gaining 0.2 percent earlier. The metal rose 0.8 percent
yesterday and 0.4 percent on June 22. August-delivery bullion
lost as much as 0.4 percent to $1,582 an ounce on the Comex in
 New York , and was last at $1,583.80.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for a second day, paring a quarterly drop,
after data showed that demand for new U.S. homes rose by more
than forecast last month.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.9 percent to $7,402 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$7,347.50 at 3:48 p.m. in  Shanghai . The metal, set for the first
quarterly fall in three, has lost 3.3 percent this year. Comex
September-futures were little changed at $3.3225 per pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  dropped on speculation that output in  Malaysia ,
the second-largest grower after  Indonesia , may surge this month
as the high-production season approaches, boosting global
cooking-oil supplies.  The September-delivery contract declined as much as 0.7
percent to 3,010 ringgit ($942) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and traded at 3,023 ringgit at 4:05 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Prices have lost 12 percent this quarter.  Corn advanced to the highest level in more than seven
months as dry weather wilted plants in the U.S., producer of 40
percent of the global crop, curbing supply.  December-delivery corn gained as much as 2.8 percent to
$6.1075 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the highest
level for the contract since Nov. 9. Futures surged yesterday by
7.2 percent or 40 cents, the most allowed by the exchange. They
traded at $6.095 at 2:27 p.m. Singapore time.  Wheat futures extended gains to the highest level since
September on the dry weather before reversing direction. The
contract for September delivery advanced as much as 1.9 percent
to $7.5525 a bushel, extending yesterday’s 7.8 percent surge,
before declining 0.3 percent to $7.385.  Soybeans for November delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$14.2325 a bushel in Chicago. December-delivery  soybean oil  lost
0.4 percent to 51.95 cents a pound.  Rubber fell, after climbing by the most in a week
yesterday, on concern that a meeting of European leaders this
week will fail to halt the region’s debt crisis that threatens
to hurt global growth and demand for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
