The Obama administration pushed back
by two years a sale of oil leases in Alaska’s Beaufort Sea to
collect additional scientific information about the region, the
Interior Department said.  The agency plans to auction rights in the Arctic spanning
the U.S.-Canada border in 2017, Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar 
said today on a conference call with reporters. A  draft leasing
plan  for 2012-2017 released in November set the sale in 2015.  “We want to ensure that we get it right, and so we are not
going to rush the process,” Deputy Secretary  David Hayes  said
on the call. A sale of leases in the adjacent  Chukchi Sea 
remains on schedule for 2016, he said.  The U.S. probably will let  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  start
exploring in the Arctic this year to lower dependence on foreign
fuel and compete with nations such as Norway and Russia, which
are more advanced in drilling north of the Arctic Circle. The
Beaufort Sea is estimated to have 8.22 billion barrels of oil,
according to a 2011 Interior Department assessment.  The agency will collect information from the  energy
industry , environmental groups and native Alaskans to ensure
that environmentally sensitive areas or those that Eskimos rely
on for their sustenance are excluded, Hayes said.  Shell, which bought the  Beaufort Sea  leases in 2005, is
waiting for the final U.S. permit to begin drilling wells in the
area. The company plans to drill two wells in 2012 and two in
2013.  “Allowing additional time to gather science and develop
targeted lease sales is a step in the right direction,” Mike
LeVine, a senior counsel for the environmental group Oceana,
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
