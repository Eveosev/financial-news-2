Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which
operates  Colombia ’s largest oil field, expects to receive an
environmental license to expand the development’s output as
early as this week.  The license to increase water injection into wells at the
onshore Rubiales field in eastern Colombia will enable output to
reach 200,000 barrels a day, Chief Executive Officer Ronald
Pantin told reporters in Santiago today. Production at the field
was 172,455 barrels a day in the first quarter, the company said
last month.  Colombia, South America’s third-largest crude supplier
after Brazil and Venezuela, is speeding up the release of
permits for oil producers, Orlando Cabrales, the nation’s oil
regulator, said last week.  The company owns 40 percent of the Rubiales field and
state-run  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  owns the rest.  Pacific Rubiales slid 0.4 percent to 36,860 pesos in Bogota
at 9:50 a.m., paring a loss of as much as 1.2 percent earlier
today.  Permits for the company’s CP-6 field in Colombia are due in
July, Pantin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
