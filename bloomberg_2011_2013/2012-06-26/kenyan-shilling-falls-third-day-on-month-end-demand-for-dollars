Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
third day, heading for the biggest drop in two weeks, as
businesses sought dollars to pay month-end bills.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 84.40 per dollar, the biggest one-day
drop since June 12, and was trading 0.2 percent weaker at 84.25
by 1:03 p.m., in Nairobi, the capital.  “The shilling is being dragged down by end-month demand
for the greenback from the energy and telecom sectors and will
continue weakening as the market continues to experience the
increased dollar demand from importers covering their end-month
requirements,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in an note to
clients. “We expect the market to trade within the 84.00 to
84.50 levels today.”  The shilling,  Africa ’s best-performing currency this year,
may weaken after the central bank cuts interest rates as soon as
next month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Giulia Pellegrini said.  “The currency may trade at 88 to 90 a dollar by the end of
this year,” Pellegrini said by phone from Johannesburg. “We
expect more currency weakness to come through in the second
half,” she said in a research note dated June 7 and e-mailed
today.  The shilling appreciated 2.2 percent in the seven days
through June 21, closing at 83.55 per dollar, the highest since
May 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kenya’s central
bank did not offer repurchase agreements and term-auction
deposits for a fifth day today, said a bank official who asked
not to be identified in line with policy.  Uganda ’s shilling gained less than 0.1 percent to 2,468 per
dollar, while Tanzania’s currency appreciated to the highest in
more than a year, gaining 0.3 percent to 1,548 per dollar. A
close at this level will be the highest since July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
