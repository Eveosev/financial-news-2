  ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) , an Internet-
advertising company, fell to the lowest level in 10 months after
an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos said increased competition from
online exchanges may crimp sales.  ValueClick tumbled 7.2 percent to $14.47 in New York, for
the lowest closing price since August 25. The shares have
declined 11 percent this year.  There has been “continued acceleration of impression
buying via online exchanges,” Mark Zgutowicz, a Piper Jaffray
analyst based in  Minneapolis , said in a research report today,
downgrading the shares to neutral from overweight. ValueClick,
based in  Westlake Village , California, provides online ad
campaigns and programs to customers including direct marketers,
brand advertisers and agencies.  “As agencies continue to buy away from ad networks -- and
ValueClick specifically -- in favor of online exchanges,
ValueClick’s media business fundamentals likely deteriorate,”
Zgutowicz said in an e-mail today.  Media revenue was $224.6 million last year, or 40 percent
of sales, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Gary Fuges, a ValueClick spokesman, didn’t respond to a
voicemail and e-mail requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
