Heating oil futures rose the most in
almost three weeks as reports today and yesterday indicated the
U.S. housing market may be firming and fuel demand may improve.  Futures gained as much as 1.2 percent as the S&P/Case-
Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities showed residential
real estate prices fell in April at the slowest pace in more
than a year. A Commerce Department report yesterday showed
demand for  new U.S. homes  rose in May as  mortgage rates  dropped.  “The U.S. housing market is showing some sign of life and
with the market being oversold, that is giving us a bounce,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  Heating oil for July delivery rose 2.52 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.5637 a gallon at 9:41 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, after touching $2.5677. Prices have fallen
5.3 percent this month and have lost 13 percent this year.  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  dropped 1.9 percent in April
from the same month in 2011, the smallest decline since November
2010.  May  new home  purchases climbed to a 369,000 annual rate,
the most since April 2010 and up 7.6 percent from the prior
month.  July-delivery gasoline gained 0.55 cent to $2.6513 a
gallon. The premium to the August contract narrowed 1.47 cents
to 13.29 cents a gallon. The front-month contract has dropped
6.1 percent in June and is down 1.3 percent this year.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.4
cents to $3.397 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
