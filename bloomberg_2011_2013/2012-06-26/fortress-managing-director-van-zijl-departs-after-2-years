Rick Van Zijl, a managing director
in  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ’s credit-lending business, has
left the New York-based investment firm.  “After two terrific years at Fortress I am departing the
firm,” Van Zijl said in an e-mail to colleagues last week, a
copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Van Zijl, reached
by telephone, confirmed the e-mail and said he left earlier this
month.  Van Zijl was based in the firm’s  New York  office, said
Gordon Runte, a spokesman for Fortress. Runte declined to
comment further on the departure.  Fortress’s credit business manages about $12.3 billion
across private equity and hedge funds, investing in areas such
as distressed assets, real estate, natural resources and other
opportunistic lending situations.  Van Zijl previously worked at Barclays Plc in New York,
where he ran U.S. leveraged loans and mezzanine financing, and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , where he was a managing director in
leveraged finance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
