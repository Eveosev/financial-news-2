Corn for delivery after the harvest
jumped to a nine-month high on speculation that hot, dry weather
in the next two weeks will reduce yields in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower. Soybeans fell.  Temperatures as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
and dryness over the next three days will increase stress on
Midwest crops that got less than 25 percent of normal rain since
May 1, John Dee, the president of Global Weather Monitoring in
Mohawk,  Michigan , said in a telephone interview. The weather
will be mostly dry in the first week of July, damaging corn
plants that will be pollinating, he said.  “This is a drought that has caught people by surprise, and
that’s why prices are running to the upside,” Chad Henderson, a
market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “The
crops are declining, and there’s not enough rain in the forecast
to prevent irreversible corn damage. Soybeans still have time to
recover.”  Corn futures for December delivery gained 5.1 percent to
close at $6.24 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $6.2475, the highest for the contract
since Sept. 21. Yesterday, the commodity surged by the exchange
limit of 40 cents, or 7.2 percent, the most since June 30, 2010.  Soybeans futures for November delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$14.1325 a bushel on the CBOT. The most-active contract jumped
3.6 percent yesterday.  About 70 percent of  Illinois , the biggest U.S. corn and
soybean grower behind  Iowa , is in moderate to extreme drought,
National Weather Service data show.  Fifty-six percent of the U.S.  corn  crop was in good or
excellent condition as of June 24, down from 63 percent a week
earlier, the biggest decline since June 2007, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data showed yesterday.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
