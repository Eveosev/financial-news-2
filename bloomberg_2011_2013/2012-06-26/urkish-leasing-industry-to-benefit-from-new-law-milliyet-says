The Turkish leasing industry will
benefit from a new draft law being discussed by the parliament,
 Milliyet newspaper  reported, citing Unal Gokmen, chief executive
officer of Garanti Leasing.  The ‘sell and lease back’ clause of the new law will enable
small- and medium-sized enterprises to access cash by selling
their assets and leasing them back afterwards, Gokmen said,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Garanti Leasing is a unit of  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,
 Turkey ’s biggest listed bank by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
