The ruble snapped four days of
declines and yields on  Russia ’s international debt fell as oil,
the country’s main export, advanced and tax payments boosted the
currency.  The Russian currency appreciated 1.2 percent to 32.92 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, the biggest gain since June 6,
paring its quarterly depreciation to 12%. The country’s $3.5
billion of Eurobonds due 2020 rose, lowering the yield by 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 3.778 percent.  Brent crude  advanced for a third day, up 0.3 percent to
$91.36 per barrel, set for the highest closing price since June
20. Oil and gas make up about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue, according to the government’s estimates. The ruble is
being temporarily supported as exporters convert revenue from
abroad to pay monthly taxes, according to Igor Akinshin, a
currency trader at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow.  “Backed by rising oil, the ruble is appreciating
modestly,” Peter Neimyshev, head of foreign exchange at
Otkritie Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. The currency may
appreciate a further 1.1 percent before correcting, he said and
added the European “situation is far from stable.”  The ruble gained 1.3 percent to 41.055 per euro and 1.2
percent to 36.5808 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.4896 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.8195 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
