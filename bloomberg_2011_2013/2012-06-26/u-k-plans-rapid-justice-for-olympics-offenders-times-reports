U.K. authorities plan “fast-track
justice” for people who commit crimes in connection with this
summer’s  Olympic Games , the London-based Times reported, citing
Alison Saunders,  London ’s Chief Crown Prosecutor.  “Olympics offenses,” defined as those committed during
the Games and at Games locations, and involving spectators,
competitors or officials, will result in court appearances
within 24 hours; courts across London will sit in the evenings
and early mornings, the newspaper said.  Virtual “live-link” courts will be used extensivly, to
avoid unnecessary movement of prisoners across the capital at a
time of traffic congestion, the Times said.  The plans have been drawn up by the  Crown Prosecution
Service , the police, the Courts Service and other criminal
justice agencies, the newspaper said.  Crimes to be dealt with under the fast-track system include
ticket touting, street disorder, pick-pocketing and mugging,
according to the Times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
