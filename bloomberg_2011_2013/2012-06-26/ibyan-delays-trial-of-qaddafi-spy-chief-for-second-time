A Libyan appeals court delayed for a
second time the trial of Muammar Qaddafi’s spy chief, Abuzeid
Dorda, who is accused of ordering attacks on civilians and
helping incite sedition and civil war.  The adjournment until July 10 was to give Dorda’s attorney
more time to study the case file, Al-Ajaili Al-Maaloul, the
court’s chairman, said in the hearing aired on state television.  Dorda, the first of Qaddafi’s inner circle to be tried, is
also accused of using force to prevent peaceful demonstrations,
the unlawful detention of civilians and abuse of office, the
Libya News Agency said on June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
