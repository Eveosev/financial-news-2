H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that exceeded
the company’s reduced forecast as processed returns climbed.  Net income from continuing operations for the three months
ended April 30 fell 7.9 percent to $591.7 million, or $2.01 a
share, from $642.8 million, or $2.09, a year earlier, the Kansas
City, Missouri-based company said today in a statement. Full-
year earnings per share were $1.16, beating the company’s
earlier forecast of $1.09 to $1.15.  Chief Executive Officer Bill Cobb, a former marketing
executive at EBay Inc. and PepsiCo Inc., is cutting jobs and
closing offices as H&R Block vies to recapture market share from
TurboTax maker  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  The moves may save an annualized $85
million to $100 million by the end of the current fiscal year,
the firm said in April.  “We achieved our top goal this fiscal year by growing
clients and share in both the assisted and digital categories
for the second consecutive year,” Cobb, 55, said in the
statement. “We also rationalized our cost structure and shed
non-core assets to drive higher margins and to refocus the
business on what we do best -- tax preparation.”  H&R Block fell 12 cents to $15.09 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The shares have dropped 7.6 percent this year, compared with a 5
percent gain for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Total tax returns prepared worldwide climbed 4.3 percent to
a record 25.6 million for the 2012 tax season. The company
estimated that it gained 30 basis points of total U.S. market
share, including 75 basis points in the do-it-yourself category,
according to the statement.  Market Share  Intuit controls about 80 percent of the U.S. market at the
retail level and 60 percent for returns prepared online, company
Treasurer Marjorie Thomas said during a May 30 investor
presentation by the  Mountain View , California-based company.  “We were hoping to see that grow and we really held as far
as our market share was concerned this year,” Thomas said. Even
as TurboTax revenue climbed 11 percent in the three months ended
April 30, “we were a little dissatisfied with our own
performance,” she said.  Tax-filing firms typically post losses in the first half of
the fiscal year, before collecting revenue from tax returns. The
U.S. tax season ends in mid-April, pushing the bulk of their
profit to the final quarter.  H&R Block said in April that it will eliminate 350 full-
time jobs and shutter 200 retail tax offices. Earlier this
month, Gregory J. Macfarlane joined the company as chief
financial officer, its fourth since 2007.  Share Repurchases  Cobb, whose appointment last year marked the firm’s fifth
CEO change in less than five years, has boosted spending on
marketing and offered free services in a bid to recapture share.
The firm also has grappled with the loss of revenue from refund-
anticipation loans for a second year after U.S. regulators
prompted HSBC Holdings Plc to stop offering them.  Fourth-quarter revenue fell 2.2 percent to $2 billion from
a year earlier, the company said. The company repurchased 14.6
million shares for a total of $200 million, or $13.74 a share,
during fiscal 2012 and repurchased an additional 21.3 million
shares for a total of $315 million, or $14.82 a share, in the
current quarter, according to the statement.  H&R Block agreed in April to pay more than $28 million to
resolve Securities and Exchange Commission claims that its
Option One Mortgage Corp. unit, now known as Sand Canyon Corp.,
didn’t tell investors it may be unable to make good on
obligations to repurchase faulty mortgages without assistance.
From Jan. 31 through April 24, Sand Canyon received new claims
tied to home loans with principal of $543 million, H&R Block
said in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
