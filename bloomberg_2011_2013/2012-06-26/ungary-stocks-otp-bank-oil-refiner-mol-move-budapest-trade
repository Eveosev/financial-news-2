gains.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, gained for a

assets. The shares jumped 1.5 percent to 16,040 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, advanced
0.4 percent to 3,415 forint before a scheduled meeting of
