The first seafood caught off the
coast of Fukushima, Japan, since last year’s tsunami and
subsequent nuclear disaster went on sale, the Daily Telegraph
reported, citing the Fukushima Prefecture Fishing Cooperative.  Octopus and whelk caught on Friday went on sale at
supermarkets after regular testing for radioactive caesium
showed no detectable amounts; flounder, sea bass and other fish
can’t be sold yet because they are still showing above the safe
limit for radiation, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
