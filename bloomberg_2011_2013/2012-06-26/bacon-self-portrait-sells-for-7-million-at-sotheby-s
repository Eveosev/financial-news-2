Collectors at a $108.4 million sale
last night pushed a Glenn Brown painting to three times the
artist’s record, while remaining choosy about secondary works by
auction stars such as  Gerhard Richter  and  Francis Bacon .  The battle for the less-well-known Brown’s picture of the
end of the world came as fears about the euro and fragile
economies reduced demand at Sotheby’s in  London . The event
started a week of auctions that test contemporary-art sales.  “There is fatigue, and look at the financial situation,”
the Spanish-based dealer Fernando Mignoni said in an interview.
“The results were OK for what they had. Tonight will be more of
an indication,” Mignoni said, referring to Christie’s
International’s evening sale, estimated to raise more than 100
million pounds ($156 million).  The auctions of more than 1,000 works by established and
emerging artists, which also include two sales at Phillips de
Pury & Co., are estimated to raise as much as 290 million
pounds. They follow the Art Basel fair in  Switzerland  this month
and Sotheby’s 41.4 million-pound auction of the Gunter Sachs
collection in London on May 22-23.  “Billionaires want fabulous works by acknowledged masters,”
the New York-based art adviser David Nisinson said in an
interview. “Not every work is going to sell. There’s a lot on
the market. People know it isn’t the last work by this artist
they’re going to see.”  Basquiat’s Warrior  The top price was 5.6 million pounds for Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1982 painting “Warrior,” showing a lone black figure
brandishing a sword. One of six lots in the auction guaranteed
to sell, thanks to a third-party “irrevocable bid,” the work
had been acquired by its seller at  Sotheby’s (BID) , London, in 2007,
for 2.8 million pounds.  Five years on, it was revalued at 5 million pounds to 7
million pounds. Competition was muted, the winning telephone
bid, taken by Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby’s European head of
contemporary art, adding just 50,000 pounds to the pre-agreed
hammer price.  Glenn Brown’s giant landscape “The Tragic Conversion of
 Salvador Dali  (After John Martin)” fetched a record 5.2 million
pounds to a telephone bid taken by Oliver Barker, Sotheby’s
senior international specialist. He beat five other telephone
bidders represented by Sotheby’s staff, at least two of whom
regularly bid for Russian clients, dealers said.  Also guaranteed for sale, this 1998 work by the keenly-
collected U.K. artist, combining science fiction elements with
apocalyptic Victorian landscape, had been estimated at 2.2
million pounds to 2.8 million pounds.  Braka’s Smile  It had been included in the recent exhibition of works by
the 19th-century painter  John Martin  at  Tate Britain , which
identified the owner as Ivor Braka, a London-based private
dealer. Braka, who was in the room, smiled at the result.  The previous highest price for Brown was the $2.5 million
paid for the 2004 panel painting “Filth” at Phillips in New
York in May 2011.  Bacon’s 1980 canvas “Study for Self-Portrait” was also
guaranteed and made 4.5 million pounds ($7 million) with fees,
attracting just one irrevocable bid from Westphal. It had been
estimated at 5 million pounds to 7 million pounds at hammer
price.  The Bacon had been purchased by its seller for $1.8 million
at Sotheby’s sale of the collection of Stanley J. Seeger in  New
York  in May 2001. An earlier single-panel portrait, dating from
1969, sold for $33.1 million at Sotheby’s, New York, at the
height of the last art-market boom in November 2007.  Bacon’s Head  This June sale also included a ghostly “Head” by Bacon,
dating from about 1949, which sold to a single telephone bid of
993,250 pounds. The painting had been offered on consignment by
the London-based dealer  Dickinson  for $4 million at the Pavilion
of Art and Design London fair in 2010.  The recent bull run of exceptional auction prices for
Richter came to an end at the sale. The 1967 photo-inspired
painting “Philodendron” failed against a low estimate of 800,000
pounds; the 1995 landscape “ Jerusalem ,” and an untitled 1989
predominantly black-and-white abstract both sold within estimate
for 4.2 million pounds and 2.8 million pounds respectively.  The current Damien Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern
tempted collectors to test the market with rare early works by
the artist. The medicine cabinet “My Way,” dating from 1990-
1991, failed against a low estimate of 1.2 million pounds, while
the brightly colored 1992-1995 canvas “Jolly” from the “Visual
Candy” series -- precursors of the ubiquitous spot paintings --
sold to an unidentified buyer in the room for 601,250 pounds,
more than double the upper estimate.  The sale raised 69.3 million pounds with fees, almost 40
million pounds lower than Sotheby’s equivalent mixed-owner
contemporary-art auction last year, with 13 percent of the 79
lots unsuccessful. The presale estimate was 57.5 million pounds
to 82.5 million pounds based on hammer prices.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
