Gold declined for the first time in
three sessions amid signs that  Europe ’s crisis is intensifying.  Spanish and Italian borrowing costs rose at debt sales amid
concern that a European Union summit this week will fail to
solve the sovereign debt crisis. The precious metal has tumbled
5.8 percent this quarter, heading for the biggest such loss
since 2004, as investors favored the dollar as a haven
investment. The  greenback  was up 6.7 percent against the euro
this quarter through yesterday.  “People are waiting on the sidelines to see what the next
step will be in Europe,” Fain Shaffer, the president of
Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for August delivery fell 0.8 percent to settle
at $1,574.90 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  The metal is still up 0.5 percent this year after 11
consecutive annual increases. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-
traded products increased 38.7 metric tons this month, the most
since November, and are within 0.1 percent of the all-time high
set in March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia’s bullion reserves climbed 15.5 tons to 911.3 tons
last month, the highest since at least 1993, data on the
International Monetary Fund’s website showed. Turkey, Ukraine
and  Kazakhstan  also boosted holdings, the data show.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$27.103 an ounce on the Comex, extending this quarter’s drop to
17 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 0.9 percent to $1,430.30 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slumped 2.2 percent to
$593.70 an ounce, falling the most since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
