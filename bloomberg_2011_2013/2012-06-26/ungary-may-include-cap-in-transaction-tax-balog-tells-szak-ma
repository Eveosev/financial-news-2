Hungary’s planned tax on financial
transactions may include a “protective” ceiling or exemptions
on certain transactions where the levy would be too high, news
website  szak-ma.hu  reported, citing Adam Balog, deputy state
secretary at the  Economy Ministry .  The government intends to maintain the so-called Robin Hood
tax on energy and utility companies in the long-term, Balog
said, adding that the tax rate will increase to 11 percent from
8 percent, according to the portal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
