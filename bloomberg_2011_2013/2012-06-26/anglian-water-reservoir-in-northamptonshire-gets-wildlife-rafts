Anglian Water, which supplies
wastewater and water services to 6 million customers in eastern
 England , said nesting birds will benefit from 60 floating plant-
filled rafts it commissioned at its Pitsford reservoir.  The reservoir in Northamptonshire provides protection for
wildlife and breeding birds including coots and little and great
crested grebes, Anglian Water’s biodiversity action plan
scientist, Mike Drew, said on the company’s website.  The U.K.’s recent drought saw reservoir water levels drop
to 60 percent of normal, affecting wildlife habitats, Anglian
Water said. The reservoir supplies water to Northampton and
parts of Daventry and Brixworth. Pitsford’s nature reserve is
jointly run by Anglian Water and the Wildlife Trust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
