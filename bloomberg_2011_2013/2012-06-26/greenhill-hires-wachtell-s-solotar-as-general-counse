Greenhill & Co., the advisory firm
founded by Robert Greenhill, hired Gavin Solotar from Wachtell
Lipton Rosen & Katz as general counsel.  Solotar, 48, who will be a managing director in New York,
previously was a partner focused on mergers and acquisitions,
corporate governance and  securities law  at Wachtell Lipton, New
York-based Greenhill said today in a statement. Solotar, who was
at Wachtell Lipton for 20 years, also will help develop client
relationships and advise on deals, according to the statement.  The investment bank is adding managing directors amid what
Chief Executive Scott Bok, 53, has called a surge in recruiting
opportunities. The firm said yesterday it hired Eric Mendelsohn
from Bermuda-based  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  for Greenhill’s restructuring
unit. Last month, Greenhill added Luca Ferrari from  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Anthony Parsons from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Mats Bremberg from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to expand in Europe.  Solotar, who will begin work after Labor Day, “has a broad
range of relationships, both in the corporate world and the
legal community, as well as deep experience in structuring and
negotiating complex transactions,” Bok said in the statement.  Solotar advised America Movil SAB, the wireless carrier
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , on an agreement to boost
its stake in  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , as well as Lazard’s
reorganization and 2005 initial public offering,  Jeffrey Taufield , a Greenhill spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
