The French economy will expand 0.4
percent this year after failing to grow in the first half as
 Europe ’s debt crisis undermines business confidence, national
statistics office Insee said today.  Gross domestic product  will probably be unchanged in the
second quarter instead of expanding 0.2 percent as forecast in
March, Insee said today in a presentation handed to journalists.
Growth will be 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.2 percent
in the fourth quarter, Insee estimates.  With Europe’s debt crisis in its third year and governments
across the region restraining spending, businesses are reporting
shrinking order books and cutting investment. Sentiment among
factory executives has declined for three straight months, Insee
surveys show.  “In the manufacturing industry, business leaders’ opinions
of their overall order books and the general outlook for their
sector took a marked turn-down in May,” Insee said in the
report.  Growth will probably “remain slow in  France  through
the end of 2012.”  The prediction increases pressure on President  Francois
Hollande ’s government to re-consider its own 0.5 percent growth
forecast and the tax and spending plans that go with it. Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said this month that his department is
considering adjusting that forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
