Deutsche Boerse  AG’s Xetra trading
system will be switched to the Frankfurt stock exchange
operator’s global electronic system by 2015,  Boersen-Zeitung 
said, citing an interview with Deutsche Boerse management board
member Frank Gerstenschlaeger.  Revised regulations that expand transparency to asset
classes such as bonds, investment funds and exchange-traded
funds are major business opportunities for Deutsche Boerse, the
German newspaper quoted Gerstenschlaeger as saying in comments
to be published in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
