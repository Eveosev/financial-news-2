Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
is leaving the U.S. and Spanish commercial real-estate markets
to focus on  Germany  and selected European countries, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Thomas Buerkle, the
new head of NordLB’s Deutsche Hypo division.  The unit, with assets of 35 billion euros ($44 billion),
will let its 3 billion euros of property loans in the U.S.
mature, the FTD said. In Spain, where it will also stop new
lending, NordLB has made loans in the “lower three-digit
million-euro” region, Buerkle said. The bank will instead focus
on the property markets in Germany, Belgium, France, Holland,
 Poland  and the U.K., he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
