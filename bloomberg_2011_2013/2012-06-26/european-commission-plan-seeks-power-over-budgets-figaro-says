The European Commission is working
on a plan that would give it greater powers to oversee budgets
of countries using the euro,  Le Figaro  reported, citing unnamed
European Union officials.  Under the proposal, governments would have to inform the
commission of all decisions being planned on state taxes and
spending before presenting their budgets and the commission
would give its opinion on all amendments presented in national
parliaments, Le Figaro said. The commission would decide whether
to impose sanctions if it concluded that a national budget broke
EU treaties, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
