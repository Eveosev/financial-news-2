Gunvor Group Ltd., the closely held
energy trader, said it plans to start the process of refinancing
a $937 million credit line in September after extending its
maturity.  Gunvor extended the maturity of the revolving credit by six
months to December 2012, according to a  statement  today on its
website.  The Cyprus-based company will use proceeds of the credit
line to refinance existing debt and fund its business, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
