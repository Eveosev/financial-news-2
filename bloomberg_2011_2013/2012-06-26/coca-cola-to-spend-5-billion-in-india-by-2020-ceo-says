Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  said the company and
its local partners plan to spend $5 billion in  India  by 2020 on
expanding its distribution and adding capacity to meet rising
demand in the world’s second-most populous nation.  The  company  and its bottling partners will invest $30
billion globally in five years on new plants and sales networks,
Chief Executive Officer  Muhtar Kent  said at a press conference
in New Delhi today.  Kent aims to boost sales in a country where 12 of his
products are consumed per person annually, compared with 38 in
China, 40 in  Kenya  and 92 as global average. The Atlanta-based
 company  expects India’s large population of teenagers,
increasing urbanization, changing lifestyles and expanding
economy to drive demand for its products.  “All of which explains why we believe this business has
near limitless growth potential,” said Kent. “India is a
wonderfully diverse country. Dynamic, young and emergent.”  Coca-Cola targets India to be among its top five countries
by volume from seventh now, according to Kent.  India’s non-alcoholic beverages market is estimated by
Euromonitor International to double to 12.9 billion liters in
2015 from 6.2 billion liters in 2010.  Market Share  Coca-Cola’s subsidiary held a 25 percent share of the non-
alcoholic beverages market in India in 2010, ahead of rival
 PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) ’s 20 percent, according to data from Euromonitor.
Parle Bisleri Ltd., based in Mumbai, also had a 25 percent
market share.  The India investment includes the $2 billion the world’s
largest soft-drink maker and its partners announced in November.  Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL) , which sells Tetley Tea and
Eight O’Clock coffee, said in February it plans to market a
nutrient beverage in India with PepsiCo’s local unit.  Coca-Cola’s India unit sells beverages including Coca-Cola,
 Diet Coke , Fanta and Sprite, fruit drinks Minute Maid and Maaza,
and Kinley bottled water through more than 1.5 million outlets.  The company first began selling its products in the country
in 1952, but exited the market in 1977 when government
regulations changed and required the company to have a local
partner. It returned to India in 1993, after the change in rules
allowed a wholly owned subsidiary.  The beverage maker seeks to increase sales in India as part
of its so-called 2020 Vision announced in November 2009,
according to Kent. The plan entails boosting the company’s
annual revenue, including that of its system of global
distributors, to $200 billion by the end of the decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
