The German parliament will probably
hold a special meeting on July 6, its first extraordinary
session on the debt crisis, to vote on  Spain ’s request for a
bailout, the Bild Zeitung newspaper reported, citing
unidentified coalition lawmakers.  Germany  has to approve a so-called memorandum of
understanding on Spain’s bailout petition, the newspaper said in
a pre-release of an article to be published today. The
parliament may meet again a week later to decide on Cyprus’s
request for aid, the newspaper said.  Spain formally requested a bailout for its banks this week,
and Cyprus also sought a financial lifeline from the euro area’s
firewall funds, becoming the fourth and fifth of the currency
union’s 17 member states to require external aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
