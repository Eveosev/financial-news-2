Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K. oil and gas
engineer focusing on the  Middle East , said its order backlog
declined in the first half as the flow of new projects slowed.  The company expects a backlog of $9.1 billion at the end of
the month, compared with $10.8 billion at the end of 2011, it
said today in a statement. Petrofac may report a drop in cash
balances to about $700 million from $1.5 billion after starting
projects that had received advances.  “We’ve seen a little bit of slippage in some geographies,
for example in Iraq,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Weller said
on a conference call. “We’re targeting about $6 billion in new
orders for the year, and in the first half we’ve had about a
third of that. We’ll probably see things pick up over the next
few weeks.”  Petrofac, expanding in West Africa,  Southeast Asia  and
 Latin America  to counter weaker growth elsewhere, won a so-
called production enhancement contract at the Panuco field in
 Mexico  this month. The company is on course to deliver net
income growth of at least 15 percent this year and aims to
double earnings by 2015, it said in the statement.  Petrofac fell 0.8 percent to 1,346 pence in London trading.
The stock has lost 23 percent since the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
