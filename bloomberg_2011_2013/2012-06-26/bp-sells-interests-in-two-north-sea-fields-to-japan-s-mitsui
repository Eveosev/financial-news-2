BP Plc (BP/) , the oil producer that’s
selling assets to help pay for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill,
sold stakes in two North Sea fields to  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  for $280
million in cash.  BP is divesting its non-operating 13.3 percent stake in the
Alba field and the 9 percent stake in the Britannia, which
together account for about 7,000 barrels of production a day, it
said today in a statement in London. The deal should complete by
the end of the third quarter, it said.  The agreement follows yesterday’s decision by BP to sell
its U.S. natural gas fields in  Wyoming  for about $1 billion. The
company has disposed of about $24 billion of assets since the
beginning of 2010 and is targeting $38 billion by the end of
next year.  “The divestments are part of our strategy to develop a
more focused business in the U.K. and Norway,” Trevor Garlick,
head of BP’s North Sea operations, said in a statement. “BP has
a multi-billion pound investment program currently underway in
the region, with four major field development projects in the
U.K. and a further two in Norway.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
