Banks are facing pressure from
global regulators to be more transparent about their capital
reserves in an effort to ward off future financial crises and
bolster confidence in lenders’ resilience.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which brings
together supervisors from 27 nations including the U.S., U.K.
and  China , said the measures would force banks “all the
components” of their capital and make it clear where they are
located on balance sheets. The rules will apply starting June
30, 2013.  “Clear and comparable disclosure is the key to improving
both market confidence and financial stability,”  Stefan Ingves ,
the Basel committee’s chairman, said in a statement on the
group’s website.  Global regulators are seeking to force banks to hold more
capital and to make it harder for them to hide excessive risk in
an attempt to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that
followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Efforts by regulators and investors to predict how banks
might withstand the crisis were hampered by “insufficiently
detailed disclosure” and a “lack of consistency in reporting
across banks and jurisdictions,” the group said. “This lack of
clarity may have contributed to uncertainty.”  The Basel group agreed in 2010 on a package of rules,
known as Basel III, that more than triples the core reserves
that lenders must hold to absorb losses.  The disclosure rules published today “will let banks
demonstrate improvements to the quality of their capital bases
as they proceed towards Basel III implementation,” Ingves said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
