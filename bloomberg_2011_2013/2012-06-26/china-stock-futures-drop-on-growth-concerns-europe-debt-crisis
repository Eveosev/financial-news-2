Most  Chinese stocks  rose, led by
property companies and banks, as speculation new lending will
rebound eased concerns over an economic slowdown and
overshadowed a lower growth forecast from HSBC Holdings Plc.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  and Huaxia Bank Co. gained at
least 1.3 percent after the Shanghai Securities News said June
new loans may reach 1 trillion yuan ($157 billion).  Shenzhen
Chiwan Wharf Holdings Ltd. (200022)  rallied 4 percent after the commerce
ministry said trade growth is improving.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) 
dropped to a three-month low after an official with the nation’s
economic planning body said the government has no imminent plans
to introduce more policies to revive vehicle demand.  “The market is speculating that figures in June will
improve a bit, lessening the risk of a hard landing for the
economy,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities
Co. in Shanghai. “That’s helping stocks rebound.”  Five stocks rose for every four that fell on the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which dropped 0.1 percent to 2,222.07 at the
close. The gauge slid for a fifth day today, the longest streak
since the six days ended Dec. 15. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost less
than 0.1 percent to 2,454.92. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) ,
the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
retreated 2.7 percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 6.3 percent in June,
poised for the worst monthly performance since March, on concern
the first interest-rate cut since 2008 won’t be enough to
prevent economic growth from missing the government’s target of
7.5 percent this year. Stocks in the measure are valued at 9.69
times estimated earnings, compared with the average of 17.8
since Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006.  Quarterly Drop  The Shanghai  gauge  has lost 1.8 percent since the start of
April, paring its gain this year to 1 percent. The index is
headed for its fourth quarterly decline in five.  HSBC cut its 2012 growth estimate for  China  to 8.4 percent
from 8.6 percent, economists Qu Hongbin and  Frederic Neumann 
wrote in a note. China will step up policy easing measures in
the coming months to avert a hard landing, they wrote. The move
comes a day after Citigroup Inc. lowered its growth estimate for
this year to reflect “anemic” domestic activity in the second
quarter and further weakening of European demand.  Europe is China’s biggest export market, making up about 18
percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according to Shenyin
& Wanguo Securities Co.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  hardened her resistance to
euro-area debt sharing, setting  Germany  on a collision course
with its allies at a summit starting on June 28. In signs the
debt crisis is worsening, Cyprus said it will seek a financial
lifeline from the euro area’s firewall funds, and Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras consented to the resignation of his
finance minister, Vassilios Rapanos.  Biggest Gains  A measure of banks, developers and insurers in the CSI 300
advanced 0.2 percent today, the most among the 10 industry
groups. Poly Real Estate, China’s second-largest developer by
market value, rose 2.7 percent to 11.24  yuan .  China Merchants
Property Development Co. (000024) , the third biggest, jumped 4.5 percent
to 24.47 yuan. Huaxia Bank, partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG,
gained 1.3 percent to 9.40 yuan. Bank of Beijing Co. added 1.1
percent to 9.57 yuan.  China’s June new loans may be about 900 billion yuan to 1
trillion yuan, the Shanghai Securities News reported today. That
would be a rebound from 793.2 billion yuan in May and 681.8
billion yuan in April.  The loans added to speculation the nation’s economic
slowdown is easing. An index of leading Chinese economic
indicators increased 1.1 percent in May from the previous month,
the New York-based Conference Board said in an e-mailed
statement today, citing a preliminary reading. That compares
with a 0.9 percent gain in April.  Trade Growth  China can achieve a 10 percent gain in exports and imports
this year if the world economy doesn’t worsen further, Shen Danyang, a commerce ministry spokesman, said at a briefing in
Beijing today. Trade growth improved in June and had “sound
momentum,” Shen said.  Shenzhen Chiwan Wharf, a port operator, climbed 4 percent
to 10.92 yuan, the highest close since March 13.  Shenzhen
Yantian Port Holdings Co. (000088)  gained 3.2 percent to 4.20 yuan.  The Shanghai Composite’s 14-day relative strength index,
which measures how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped in
that time period, dropped to 30.7 today. Readings below 30
indicate it may be poised to rise. About 6 billion shares
changed hands in the Shanghai index yesterday, 31 percent lower
than the daily average this year. Thirty-day volatility in the
gauge was at 16 today, the highest level since May 14.  Shallow Slowdown  China’s economic growth hasn’t bottomed though the slowdown
should be shallow,  Jason Todd , Hong Kong-based global head of
equity strategy at Religare Capital, wrote in an e-mail today.
While China’s policy response is late, it’s not light relative
to the deterioration in data, he wrote.  SAIC Motor fell 0.8 percent to 14.10 yuan, the lowest close
since March 28.  FAW Car Co. (000800) , which makes passenger cars in China
with Volkswagen AG, dropped 0.4 percent to 10.90 yuan.  The National Development and Reform Commission is still
studying the feasibility of measures to subsidize vehicle
purchases in rural areas, said Chen Jianguo, deputy director of
the agency’s industry coordination department.  “We’re still looking into the issue of whether such policy
is even needed,” Chen said yesterday in an interview in Dalian,
China. “It is common sense” that there’s no need for the same
kind of stimulus policies introduced in 2009.  Internet companies led declines in Chinese stocks traded in
the U.S. yesterday. The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the
biggest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 2.2
percent to $31.83, the lowest level since October.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
