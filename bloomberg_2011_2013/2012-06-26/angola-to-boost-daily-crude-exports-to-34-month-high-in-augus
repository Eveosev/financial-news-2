Angola ,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil
producer, will boost its daily crude exports for August to the
highest level in 34 months, according to a revised loading
program obtained by Bloomberg.  The nation plans to ship 61 cargoes, totaling 58.01 million
barrels, or 1.87 million barrels a day, the most since October
2009, the plan showed. This compares with 51 cargoes amounting
to 1.58 million barrels a day in July.  One cargo each of Cabinda and Nemba grades were added to
the preliminary schedule released on June 18, according to the
revised plan. Shipments of Hungo, Kissanje, Mondo and Saxi
blends are subject to change.  Oil shipments from the West African nation rose as output
from the Pazflor field was increased amid limited startup flows
from the Kizomba D Satellite fields, the  International Energy
Agency  said in its monthly report on June 13.  Angola will ship one Gimboa and two Palanca cargoes in
August, while no exports of the two grades were planned next
month, the program shows.  The country will also boost exports of Girassol to six
consignments in August, two more than July, according to the
schedule. Planned maintenance at the 250,000 barrel-a-day field
was forecast to curb output this month, the IEA said.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are
listed in multiples of 1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
