Deere & Co. (DE) , the largest maker of
agricultural equipment, sold $1.6 billion of bonds in a three-
part offering through its financing arm as it looks to refinance
maturing debt.  Deere was joined by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , American International
Group Inc. and  MetLife Inc. (MET) ’s global funding affiliate, which
are among other companies leading bond sales in the U.S. to
about $8 billion today, after a shutdown of supply in the
investment-grade market yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The tractor maker had about $13 billion of debt maturing by
2014 as of Dec. 31, Bloomberg data show. The Moline, Illinois-
based company has pushed out the  weighted average maturity  date
on its debt to June 2018 from October 2015 with nearly $5
billion of bond sales this year. That’s more than twice the
amount sold for the same period in 2011.  “They had a lot of debt maturing in the next couple of
years and should the market freeze like it did a few years ago,
then it would be a problem,” Jody Lurie, a corporate credit
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, said in a telephone
interview. “What better time to issue than when the market is
offering such low rates.”  Deere spokesman Kenneth Golden did not immediately return
calls to discuss the company’s bond sales.  Yields Fall  John Deere Capital Corp. sold $500 million of 22-month
floating-rate securities priced to yield 15 basis points more
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, $600 million
of 0.95 percent three-year debentures at 55 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of 2.8 percent
10.5-year bonds at a 120 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show.  Deere’s $2 billion of 2.875 percent government-backed debt
matured this month. The company had issued bonds through the
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program put in place to stem the
2008 financial crisis.  Yields on investment-grade company bonds in the U.S. fell
to 3.36 percent yesterday, approaching a record low 3.33 percent
reached on May 8, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, sold $1 billion of
3.125 percent, 10-year notes at 150 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $1.25 billion of 4.65 percent,
30-year debt at 195 basis points more than benchmark securities.
Comcast plans to redeem $575 million of its 6.625 percent senior
notes maturing in May 2056, the Philadelphia-based television-
services operator said in a June 22 statement.  Metropolitan Life  Metropolitan Life Global Funding I sold $1 billion of 1.7
percent, three-year notes priced to yield 132 basis points more
than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. AIG sold an additional
$750 million of its 4.875 percent notes maturing in June 2022.  “There was a pretty significant down draft in the market
on Monday because of negative news coming from  Europe ” Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond strategy at Susquehanna
International Group LLP said in a telephone interview. “Most
companies have a fair amount of flexibility when they access the
market and they could have decided to hold off or postpone the
bond sale.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
