Slovakia  will ask the European Union
for more aid to help cover the costs of decommissioning two
nuclear reactors, Prime Minister  Robert Fico  said.  The Slovak administration will demand that the EU
contributes at least 300 million euros ($375 million) to help
cover the costs of the closures, Fico said. The EU in the
2014-2020 budgetary cycle allotted 115 million euros for its
east European member to help finance the 2006-2008 shutdown of
two Soviet-style reactors at Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant.  “At this time, we can’t afford to spend money on
decommissioning of reactors we didn’t want to shut down,” Fico
told lawmakers in the Slovak capital, Bratislava. A failure to
win more aid would halt the process, whose costs the government
estimates at 425 million euros, he added.  The economic slowdown combined with a need for  austerity  to
combat the  European debt crisis , makes it harder for eastern
European nations to cover the costs of closing nuclear
facilities demanded by the EU on safety grounds as part of
accession agreements beginning in 2004. The bloc in the next
cycle assigned a combined 500 million euros in aid to Slovakia
and Lithuania and  Bulgaria , two other countries also affected by
the EU-demanded shutdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
