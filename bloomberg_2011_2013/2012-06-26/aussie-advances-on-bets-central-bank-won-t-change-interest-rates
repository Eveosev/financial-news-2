The Australian dollar rose on bets
the country will keep  interest rates  steady amid speculation the
economy will be strong enough to weather Europe’s debt crisis.  The Aussie gained against most major peers before  Reserve
Bank  of Australia policy makers are forecast to keep the key
rate unchanged when they meet next week, according to a
Bloomberg  survey  of economists. The New Zealand currency,
nicknamed the kiwi, also climbed amid low expectations for
results from European leaders’ two-day summit that opens
tomorrow.  The Aussie advanced 0.5 percent to $1.0064 yesterday in New
York after the previous day touching 99.69 U.S. cents, its
weakest level since June 14. It rose 0.4 percent to 80.08 yen.  The kiwi climbed 0.5 percent to 79.11 U.S. cents and gained
0.3 percent to 62.90 yen.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a better than 53 percent chance RBA policy makers won’t
change the benchmark rate when they meet July 3, up from a 30
percent probability seen on June 19.  The Aussie and kiwi extended gains after German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  told German lawmakers she doesn’t expect any
shared debt liability in her lifetime even as Spain and Cyprus
on June 25 became the fourth and fifth of the currency union’s
17 member states to require external aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
