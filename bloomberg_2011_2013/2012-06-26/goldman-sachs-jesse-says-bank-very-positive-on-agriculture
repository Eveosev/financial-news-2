Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is “very
positive globally” on the  agriculture sector , in part as dry
weather in the U.S. supports grains, said Steve Jesse, an
executive director of fixed income, commodities and
currencies at the bank.  “In the main grain markets in the agriculture sector,
they’ve all become a lot more closely connected,” Jesse said
today on a panel at an agriculture conference in London.
“What’s happening right now in the U.S. with the drought
is the main driver of the U.K. wheat market in the last few
days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
