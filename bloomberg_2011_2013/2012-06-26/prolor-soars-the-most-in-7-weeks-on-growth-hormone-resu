Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  surged the most
in five weeks in  New York  after the Israeli drugmaker said
research showed its weekly growth hormone injection has the
potential to replace a treatment given in seven daily dosages.  Prolor, based in Nes Ziona,  Israel , jumped 3.8 percent to
$4.90 by the close in New York, the sharpest increase since May
21. The shares are headed for a 15 percent gain in the first
half of 2012, compared with an advance of 4 percent for the
 Standard and Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals Index . Prolor’s stock
rose 6.7 percent to 19.43 shekels, or the equivalent of $4.93,
in  Tel Aviv , the largest rise since Jan. 16.  Prolor’s Phase II trial of its hGH-CTP human growth
hormone, used to treat growth hormone deficiency in adults,
showed that a single weekly injection of the drug has the
potential to replace seven daily injections currently being
marketed, according to a statement distributed by PRNewswire.
The data presented today was an extension of a result that last
month showed the weekly injection had comparable outcomes to the
similar drug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
