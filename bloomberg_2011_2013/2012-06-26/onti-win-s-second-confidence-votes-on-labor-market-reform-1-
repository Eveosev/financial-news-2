Prime Minister  Mario Monti  won a
second confidence vote on parts of his labor-market reform that
will allow for final passage of the measure tomorrow before the
start of the European summit on June 28.  Monti won both votes in the lower house of parliament in
 Rome  by a margin of more than 300 as the coalition of competing
parties that back his unelected government held together. There
will be a further two confidence votes tomorrow morning with a
final ballot on the entire law due in the afternoon.  The labor package includes incentives to support the
hiring of young people and women and gives companies more
flexibility in firing workers. The legislation also introduces a
new system of  unemployment benefits  that will cover a broader
pool of workers than under current rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
