Greece ’s port workers’ union filed
with the country’s highest court to cancel the government’s
transfer of shares of  Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA)  and Thessaloniki
Port Authority SA to the state asset-sales agency.  The federation of Greek port workers unions asked the
Council of State to overturn the transfer of the stakes to the
 Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund , on the ground that it
was unconstitutional, according to an e-mailed statement from
the union today.  The government transferred stakes in the ports to the
agency this year with a view to selling them to investors as
part of a program to raise 50 billion euros ($63 billion) from
asset sales by 2020. The sales are a condition set by the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for 240
billion euros of bailout loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
