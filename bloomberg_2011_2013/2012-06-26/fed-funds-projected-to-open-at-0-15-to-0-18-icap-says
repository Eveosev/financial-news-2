Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open in a range of 0.15
percent to 0.18 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.15 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.15 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion
of Treasuries maturing from August 2020 to May 2022. The
purchases are the first in the Fed’s new program to replace $400
billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
