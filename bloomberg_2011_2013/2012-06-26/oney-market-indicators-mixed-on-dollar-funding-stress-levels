Money-market forward indicators
signaled on short-term dollar funding conditions were mixed.  The three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor,
which represents the rate at which banks say it would cost to
borrow from another,  was  0.46060 percent, little changed,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. The Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, narrowed to 28.2
basis points from 28.5 basis points yesterday.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the  Federal Reserve ’s effective funds rate will average
for the term of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, widened to 31.8 basis points from 30.3 basis
point, according to the second rolling three month contracts.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, widened 0.5 basis points to 24 basis points. The gap,
which is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking-
sector credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations
for dollar Libor, touched yesterday the narrowest since August.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market decreased. The three-month cross-currency
basis swap was 55.6 basis points below Euribor, compared with 58
basis points below yesterday.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, held steady.
The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed at 43 basis points.  The price on one-year cross-currency basis swaps between
yen and U.S. dollars was minus 35.4 basis points, from minus
34.7 basis points yesterday. A negative swap price indicates
investors are willing to receive reduced interest payments on
the yen they lend in order to obtain the needed financing in
dollars.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
fell $8.9 billion to $998.2 billion in the week ended June 20,
the third consecutive slide, according to Federal Reserve data.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
