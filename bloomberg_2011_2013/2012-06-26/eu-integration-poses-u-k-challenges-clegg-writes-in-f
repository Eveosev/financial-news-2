A European banking union, which will
be on the agenda of tomorrow’s European Union meeting, poses a
risk of discrimination against non-euro members of the EU, U.K.
Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  wrote in the Financial Times.  “Technical decisions -- such as rules requiring companies
trading in euro-denominated products to have operations in the
eurozone -- can and do seriously disadvantage non-euro
countries,” Clegg wrote.  Proecting the single currency must not become
“protectionism within the single market,” Clegg wrote.  Clegg said dealing with the effects of a deeper euro-area
integration poses a challenge. “Economic marginalization of the
U.K. would bolster calls for a complete exit from the EU,” he
wrote.  “I want to see the U.K. standing tall in  Europe , not
forced to the sidelines, or, worse, out the door,” the deputy
prime minister wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
