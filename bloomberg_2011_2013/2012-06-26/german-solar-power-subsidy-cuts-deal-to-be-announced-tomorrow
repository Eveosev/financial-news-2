Germany ’s federal government and its
16 states reached a compromise agreement on cuts to solar
subsidies in the world’s biggest market.  “There will be an agreement in the arbitration panel
meeting tomorrow”, Georg Nuesslein, a spokesman for energy
affairs for the CSU, one of Germany’s governing parties, said
today by phone from Berlin, declining to give any details of the
agreement. The changes will be backdated to April 1.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government has pushed to reduce
the pace of solar installations by about 50 percent after new
projects peaked at 7.5 gigawatts last year, making Germany the
world’s top solar market by total capacity installed.  A plan to lower subsidies by as much as 29 percent was
blocked by state governors in the upper house of Germany’s
parliament last month. They have concerns that subsidy cuts will
hurt domestic manufacturers such as  Solarworld AG (SWV)  already
suffering from Chinese competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
