Macau casino stocks declined in Hong
Kong trading amid speculation visa restrictions and limits on
some China credit cards are slowing revenue growth in the
world’s largest gambling hub.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  dropped 5.7 percent to
close at HK$18.12,  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  declined 5.8 percent, Wynn
Macau Ltd. lost 2.8 percent.  Growth in mainland Chinese visitors to Macau may have
softened in May as the Guangdong local government might be
tightening visa issuance and as China UnionPay reduces the
amount that can be spent overseas on credit cards, Chinese-
language Macau Daily reported on June 23. Macau casino gambling
revenue rose 7.3 percent in May, the slowest pace since July
2009.  “Recent weakness in Macau gaming revenue and visitation
growth could be partially explained by the visa restrictions and
reduction in China UnionPay limits highlighted by the Macau
Daily,” Cameron McKnight, an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said
in a June 25 research note. “While expectations have recently
moderated, we believe outperformance in the Macau stocks is
likely to be limited here.”  Visitors from the mainland drove casino revenue up 42
percent last year in the only city in China where casino
gambling is legal, pushing up earnings at Macau operators. About
16 million mainland Chinese tourists visited the city in 2011.  Gambling revenue for the six casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony rose last month to 26.1 billion patacas ($3.3
billion) from 24.3 billion patacas a year earlier, according to
the Chinese city’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.  “The report on visa tightening is a bit speculative,”
said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst at Union Gaming
Group. “We haven’t seen anything so far to convince us this is
happening.”  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282)  slumped 4.8 percent,  SJM Holdings
Ltd. (880) , founded by billionaire  Stanley Ho , dropped 1.98 percent,
 Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  dropped 2.5 percent in Hong Kong
trading. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.45
percent.  Gigi Chiu, spokeswoman of the Macau Government Tourist
Office declined to comment on the newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
