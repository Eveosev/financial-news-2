Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
urged House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a Virginia Republican,
to schedule floor time for the new farm bill, saying U.S.
producers need to know the shape of programs that support them.  “I would ask him to take his finger off the pause button
so the rest of us don’t have to hit the panic button,” Vilsack
said today at a Washington meeting of land-grant universities.
Farmers “need that certainty,” he said.  The Senate passed a bill last week covering farm and food
aid that would cut spending by $23.6 billion over 10 years,
mostly by replacing a direct-payment program for major crops
with a revenue guarantee. The House has yet to draft its
version.  House Republican leaders last week delayed plans for the
agriculture committee to work on the farm-bill draft until after
July 4. The current law expires Sept. 30.  Efforts to obtain a response from Cantor to Vilack’s appeal
were unsuccessful.  Record U.S. farm profits and food-stamp spending are making
the five-year reauthorization of USDA programs a target for
budget cutters. Net  farm income  reached an all-time high of
$98.1 billion in 2011 and this year will be $91.7 billion, the
second-highest, the USDA said in February. Funding for  food
stamps  reached a record $75.7 billion last year, double the
level of four years earlier.  Vilsack spoke at a meeting of the Association of Public and
Land-Grant Universities, which is marking the sesquicentennial
of the Morrill Act, the 1862 law signed by President  Abraham Lincoln  that established the U.S. land-grant university system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
