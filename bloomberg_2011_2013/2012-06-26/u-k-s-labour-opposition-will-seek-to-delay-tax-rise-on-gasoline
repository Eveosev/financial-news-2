The U.K.’s opposition Labour Party
will seek to amend Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s
budget to delay a planned 3 percent tax increase on gasoline
until next year to help motorists suffering from rising prices.  Labour Treasury spokesman  Ed Balls  called on the
Conservative-led coalition to use savings from the London 2012
Olympics budget to fund the delay. He said the increase should
come into effect next year, instead of August as now planned.  “If you postpone this until next year, that would cost
half a billion pounds ($780 million),” the same amount as the
Olympics will come in under budget, Balls told ITV’s
“Daybreak” program today. “The economy is in recession,
families are under real pressure. But also we’ve seen a 20
percent fall in the oil price since Christmas -- that is not
reflected in the pump prices we’re all paying.”  Conservative Transport Secretary Justine Greening is
considering legislation to force retailers of gasoline to pass
on lower fuel costs to motorists, the  BBC  reported on May 30. In
an interview with the  Daily Telegraph  on June 25, she said she
would not press for a delay in the tax rise.  -- Editors: James Hertling, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
