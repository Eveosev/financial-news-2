Belgium Energy Minister Melchior Wathelet has proposed to extend by 10 years half of the nuclear
capacity that’s supposed to close in 2015, French daily La
Tribune reported, without citing anyone. The government has
promised to take a decision in coming months, the French
newspaper reported.  The Belgian coalition government is split over what to do
and officials at  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) ’s Belgian Electrabel unit weren’t
commenting, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
