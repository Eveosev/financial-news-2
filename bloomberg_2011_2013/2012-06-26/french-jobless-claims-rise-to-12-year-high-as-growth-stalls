French jobless claims rose to the
highest in more than 12 years in May as stalling growth prompted
companies to trim payrolls.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
33,300, or 1.2 percent, to 2,922,100, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Four economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected claims of between 2.29
million and 2.91 million.  Faced with a sovereign debt crisis in its third year,
governments across  Europe  are trying to reduce budget deficits,
lowering demand for French goods and services at home and
abroad. That’s prompted companies ranging from cement maker
Lafarge SA to airline Air France-KLM Group and retailer
 Carrefour SA (CA)  to reduce staff.  France ’s economy didn’t expand in the first quarter and the
Bank of France estimates that it may shrink in the second
quarter for the first time since 2009. The nation’s unemployment
rate stood at 9.8 percent at the end of last year.  Jobless claims were last above 2.9 million in September
1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
