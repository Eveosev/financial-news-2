PNC Bank, a unit of  PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. (PNC) , will pay $90 million to settle a lawsuit
accusing it of improperly manipulating customers’ debit card
transactions to generate excess overdraft fees, lawyers said.  The lawsuit, part of litigation involving more than 30
banks, is pending before U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King
in Miami, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The customers claimed PNC Bank’s computer system
resequenced the actual order of debit card and ATM transactions
by posting them in highest-to-lowest dollar amount instead of
the actual order in which they were initiated, according to the
statement. That led to excess overdraft fees, the plaintiffs
say.  Other banks have reached settlements.  Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD) , Canada’s second-largest bank, entered in May a preliminary
agreement to pay $62 million to settle overdraft claims. In
April Citizens Bank agreed to pay $137.5 million. In February
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reached
an agreement for $110 million.  Robert Gilbert, a lawyer for customers, said in the
statement that the settlement will be presented to King for
preliminary approval later this summer.  Fred Solomon , a spokesman for Pittsburgh-based PNC,
declined to comment on the case.  The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
