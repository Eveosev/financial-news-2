Iran  plans to increase steel output,
becoming an exporter of the metal, after U.S.-led sanctions over
the country’s nuclear program reduced imports by 30 percent, an
executive from the Islamic republic’s  Esfahan Steel Co.  said.  “Imports became difficult,” Mansour Yazdizadeh, deputy
managing director at Esfahan, told a Metal Bulletin conference
in Moscow, as sanctions on international payments were enforced.  Iran plans to raise steel output to 55 million metric tons
by 2025, from 13.4 million tons last year, when it imported 5.4
million tons, Yazdizadeh said. The country’s steel consumption
is set to more than double to 44 million tons by 2025, he said.  Russian companies including OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel
and  Metalloinvest (METIN)  have been supplying steel to Iran. MMK failed
to complete a deal to buy a stake in Esfahan Steel in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
