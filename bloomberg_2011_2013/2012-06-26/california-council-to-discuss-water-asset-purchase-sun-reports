Claremont council members are
discussing price and terms to potentially acquire Golden State
Water Co. assets in the Southern California town, the San
Bernardino County Sun reported, citing city officials.  Golden State Water and its parent,  American States Water
Co. (AWR) , said in February that its share of Golden State assets that
serve Claremont aren’t for sale, the newspaper said.  Claremont’s hope to purchase water assets in the city east
of  Los Angeles  follow a Golden State filing with the state
Public Utilities Commission for double-digit rate increases next
year and in 2014 and 2015 for 11,000 Claremont customers, the
paper said. The council voted Jan. 5 to attempt to buy the water
assets. Councilman Sam Pedroza has said purchasing the company
could cost $100 million, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
