Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA 
dropped a fifth day in Lisbon trading to the lowest price in
three years after Camargo Correa SA gained control of  Portugal ’s
biggest cement maker.  Cimpor (CPR)   declined  as much as 14 percent to 3.26 euros, the
 lowest  since March 2009, and traded at 3.55 euros at 12:33 p.m.
in the Portuguese capital. The stock fell 26 percent yesterday.
The shares were excluded from Portugal’s PSI-20 benchmark index
last week.  Camargo raised its stake last week to about 95 percent
after bidding 5.50 euros a share on March 30 to buy the Cimpor
stock it didn’t already own. Camargo hasn’t decided whether to
remove Cimpor from trading in Lisbon, Jose Edison, president of
Camargo’s Intercement unit, said on June 20.  Standard & Poor’s lowered Cimpor’s long-term corporate
 credit rating  today to the non-investment grade of BB from BBB-.  “We assess Camargo Correa as having weaker  credit quality 
than Cimpor and believe that Cimpor will be fully incorporated
into Camargo’s cement operations,” S&P said. “This gives
Camargo direct access to Cimpor’s assets, along with control of
cash and dividend payouts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
