The pound climbed to the strongest
this month against the euro amid speculation European Union
leaders meeting this week will fail to agree on measures to stop
the region’s debt crisis from spreading.  Sterling advanced for a second day versus the single
currency as Italian and Spanish borrowing costs surged at debt
auctions, boosting demand for the pound as a haven. Gilts fell
after a government report showed Britain had a larger  budget
deficit  in May than economists forecast. The U.K. sold 1.25
billion pounds ($1.96 billion) of inflation-linked debt.  “We have the EU summit, which I think is most likely to be
taken by the market in a disappointing fashion,” said  Steven Barrow , head of Group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc in
London. “Euro-sterling is going to go down,” he said, meaning
the pound will strengthen versus the 17-nation single currency.  Sterling appreciated 0.5 percent to 79.92 pence per euro at
4:15 p.m. London time after reaching 79.85 pence, the strongest
since May 30. The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5594. It fell
to $1.5539 yesterday, the weakest since June 15.  EU leaders gather in Brussels for two days of talks
starting June 28, the 19th meeting since the debt crisis broke
out in early 2010.  Spain  sold three-month bills at a yield of
2.36 percent today, up from 0.85 percent at the previous
auction. Italy sold zero-coupon debt due in 2014 at a yield of
4.71 percent, compared with 4.04 percent on May 28.  Second Best  The pound has appreciated 1.9 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as investors sought
safety from  Europe ’s debt turmoil. Only  New Zealand ’s dollar
rose more among the 10 developed-market currencies. The euro
dropped 2.7 percent.  Sterling’s advance against the dollar may be capped by
resistance at the 200-day moving average, currently at $1.5749,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Resistance refers to an
area where sell orders may be clustered.  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose the most in a week after
the  Office for National Statistics  said the budget shortfall
excluding government support for banks was 17.9 billion pounds
in May. Economists forecast a deficit of 14.8 billion pounds,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  The 10-year gilt yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.68 percent, after climbing as much as six
basis points, the most since June 19. The 4 percent bond due in
March 2022 fell 0.11, or 1.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 120.65.  More Stimulus  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  told lawmakers in
London today that his vote for more stimulus, or quantitative
easing, this month reflected his concern the global economic
outlook is deteriorating.  “What’s concerned me in the last several months, and why I
voted for easing in policy, is the worsening in the position in
 Asia  and other  emerging markets ,” King said. Another reason is
that “my colleagues in the U.S. are more concerned than they
were at the beginning of the year about what’s happening in the
American economy,” he said.  The Bank of England will increase its asset-purchase plan
by 75 billion pounds at its July 5 meeting to 400 billion
pounds, Philip Rush, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
London, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. Nomura had
previously predicted the central bank would increase stimulus by
50 billion pounds in August.  “Sterling saw no material impact from the BOE testimonies
on the Treasury Select Committee,” strategists led by  Marc Chandler  at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New York , wrote in
a note to clients. “Still, the testimony reaffirmed the BOE’s
dovish stance. The comments underline expectations that the BOE
is more likely to resume QE.”  The Debt Management Office sold the inflation-linked bonds
due in March 2029 at a yield of minus 0.11 percent. That
compares with minus 0.05 percent at a prior auction on April 19.  U.K. government debt has returned 3 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2.9 percent, and U.S. Treasuries rose 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
