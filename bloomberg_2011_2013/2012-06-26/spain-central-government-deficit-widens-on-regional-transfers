Spain ’s central-government budget
deficit widened in the first five months of the year,
approaching its full-year target, as the state brought forward
payments to cash-strapped regional administrations.  The central government, which is aiming for a deficit of
3.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, had a shortfall
of 3.41 percent through May, compared with 2.59 percent a year
earlier. Excluding the impact of regional transfers, the deficit
narrowed to 2.38 percent from 2.56 percent, the Budget Ministry
said in a statement today in Madrid.  Spain missed its deficit goal last year by almost 50
percent mainly because regional governments failed to cut
spending enough and  tax revenue  slumped. In the first quarter of
this year, regions balanced their budgets even as the economy
contracted, helped by transfers from the government, Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro said on June 1.  “The deficit has started on a downward path and we expect
that to intensify,” Deputy Budget Minister Marta Fernandez Curras told reporters in Madrid. “We are determined to meet the
budget target.”  The central government shortfall is set to be the largest
component of the overall public-sector deficit, which is
targeted at 5.3 percent of GDP this year. It was 8.9 percent in
2011, the third-largest in the euro area, according to the last
estimate, which the government made after discovering bills left
unpaid by regional administrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
