Italy  sold 3.91 billion euros ($4.9
billion) of bonds, near the maximum set for the auction, and
borrowing costs rose after two more euro-area nations officially
requested bailouts, hurting demand for its debt.  The Treasury sold 2.99 billion euros of zero-coupon 2014
debt to yield 4.712 percent, up from 4.037 percent at the
previous auction on May 28. Investors bid for 1.65 times the
amount offered, similar to the 1.66 times last month. The Rome-
based Treasury also sold 916 million euros of inflation-linked
bonds due in 2016 and 2026 to yield 5.2 percent and 5.29
percent, respectively.  Italy’s 10-year bond was weaker after the auction, with the
yield rising 7 basis points to 6.08 percent at 11:25 a.m. Rome
time, pushing the difference or spread with similar-maturing
German debt to 457 basis points.  European leaders gather on June 28-29 in their latest
summit meeting to try to stop contagion from the debt crisis.
The meeting comes days after  Spain  and Cyprus officially
requested emergency aid, which will bring to five the number of
euro-nations with financial lifelines. Leaders remain divided
over how to achieve a common fiscal policy and whether to
collectively issue debt to try to stem the crisis.  French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  will meet his
German counterpart  Wolfgang Schaeuble , Italy’s deputy Finance
Minister  Vittorio Grilli  and Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos tonight in Paris to prepare for the summit.  Spanish bonds extended their declines today after the
Treasury was forced to pay 2.362 percent to sell three month
bills, more than twice the level of the last sale on May 22. The
yield on the country’s 10-year yields bonds climbed eight basis
points to 6.72 percent after the auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
