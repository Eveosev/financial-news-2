Alterco SA (ALT) , a Polish real-estate
company, is in talks with a group of investors to jointly buy
Croatian hotel chain  Jadran Crikvenica Hoteli .  Alterco will meet with the Croatian  Finance Ministry  next
month to discuss a takeover of Jadran d.d., the chain’s owner,
based in Crikvenica, near the Adriatic port of Rijeka, Mateusz
Olszak, a spokesman for Alterco said by phone today. Croatia is
a “significant” shareholder of the nine-hotel chain, he said.  “Croatia is a popular tourist destination and we want to
take advantage of this,” Olszak said. “We are mainly talking
to financial investors to create a group that could buy the
owner of the chain and we also could acquire a stake in it.”  The Balkan country, which is set to become the European
Union’s 28th member in July 2013, is seeking foreign investment
after two years of recession and a period of stagnation in 2011.
Tourism accounts for one fifth of  Croatia ’s economy.  Olszak declined to comment on how much the group might pay
for the company or discuss its investment plans. Alterco plans
to invest 80 million euros ($100 million) in the unprofitable
hotel chain, the Zagreb-based  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported today.  Alterco shares slumped 5.5 percent to 5 zloty at 2 p.m. in
Warsaw, falling for a seventh day and valuing the Polish company
at 29 million zloty ($8.5 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
