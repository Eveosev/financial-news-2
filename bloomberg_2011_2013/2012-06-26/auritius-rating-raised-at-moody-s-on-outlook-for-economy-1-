Mauritius’s sovereign credit rating
was increased by Moody’s Investors Service to Baa1, the third-
lowest investment-grade, with a stable outlook.  The credit upgrade of the Indian Ocean island nation marked
a one-step increase from Baa2, Moody’s said in a statement
today. The credit rating company cited stronger government
institutions, increased diversification of the economy and a
lower debt burden in its statement.  “Mauritius has undertaken various steps, including
broadening its economic cooperation with China and  India , and is
actively transitioning the economy from a comparatively low-
skilled exporter to that of a highly-skilled service-based
economy,” Aurelien Mali, a London-based sovereign credit
analyst at Moody’s, wrote in the statement. “Progress in this
area will mitigate the economy’s external vulnerabilities.”  Mauritius’s rupee declined 0.7 percent to 30.9 per  U.S.
dollar  today, extending its loss this quarter to 6.3 percent.
