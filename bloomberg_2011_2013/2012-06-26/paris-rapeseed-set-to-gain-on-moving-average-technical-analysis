Rapeseed futures for November may
gain to a record 490 euros ($612) a metric ton in the next two
weeks after closing above the five- and 10-day moving averages,
according to technical analysis by Starsupply Commodity Brokers.  The contract may extend the 2.9 percent increase this month
on NYSE Liffe in Paris after crossing the moving averages
last week, said Arnaud Saulais, a broker at Starsupply in Nyon,
 Switzerland . The oilseed for November delivery settled at 478
euros yesterday. The five- and 10-day measures are currently at
471 euros and 466.63 euros, respectively.  “The market has crossed different levels, the 10-day and
the five-day” moving averages, Saulais said by phone yesterday.
“It’s very positive for the market. U.S. soybeans were going up
too,” which also supported rapeseed, he said.  Rapeseed competes with soybeans for use in cooking oil,
biofuels and  animal feed . The November rapeseed contract has
climbed 19 percent this year, almost matching the advance in
November-delivery soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade. Those
beans rallied as dry weather hurt crops in  South America  and the
U.S. and as Chinese demand increased.  Rapeseed output in the European Union, the largest
producer, may be 17.9 million tons in the 2012-13 season, down
6.4 percent from a year earlier, after a cold snap this year,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
