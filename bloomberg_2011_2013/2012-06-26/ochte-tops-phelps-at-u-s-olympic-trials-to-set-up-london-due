Ryan Lochte  beat  Michael Phelps  in
the final of the 400-meter individual medley at the U.S. Olympic
swimming trials, setting up another showdown between the
Americans at the London Games next month.  Lochte finished in  4 minutes, 7.06 seconds  in the opening
final of the eight-day trials in Omaha,  Nebraska . Phelps was
second in 4:07.89 to earn the other Olympics berth.  “The biggest thing and hardest thing for us is coming to
trials and making the team,” Phelps said in a televised
interview. “This is just a baby step. Ryan knows this just like
I do, the race that counts happens in a couple weeks.”  While Phelps, 26, captured a record eight gold medals at
the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the 27-year-old Lochte has
received the American Swimmer of the Year award the past two
years and won five golds at the 2011 world championships,
including both of his events against Phelps.  “Ryan and I have had a lot of tough races with one
another,” Phelps said. “We have a couple weeks to get ready
for  London  and hopefully we can have another good one.”  Phelps, who won the 400m individual medley at the past two
Olympics, said after the 2008 Games in Beijing that he may not
swim the race again. Yesterday, he said he’ll definitely go for
a third straight gold medal at the event in London.  Lochte took the bronze medal in the 400m individual medley
in Beijing, where Phelps set a world record.  Clary Leads  In yesterday’s race, Lochte and Phelps trailed Tyler Clary
at the midway point following the butterfly and backstroke legs.
Lochte moved in front on the breaststroke element and maintained
his lead on the finishing freestyle segment as Phelps pulled
away from Clary, who was second to Lochte in the discipline at
the past two world championships.  “The big picture is the U.S. trying to take over the world
in a couple weeks,” Lochte said. “We have the two best
swimmers right now and we’re going to go out there and show the
world something.”  Phelps and Lochte will participate in other individual
events at the trials in Omaha and may go head-to-head again in
the 200m medley and 200m freestyle. Phelps will probably also
race in the 100m and 200m butterfly and would be a member of
three U.S. relay squads, which could give him the chance at
winning another eight gold medals.  Peter Vanderkaay earned his third trip to the Olympics by
winning the men’s 400m freestyle final in a time of 3:47.67.
Conor Dwyer gained the second spot in London in 3:47.83.  Elizabeth Beisel, who was the youngest member of the U.S.
Olympic swim team in 2008 at age 15, won the women’s 400m
individual medley in 4:31.74. Caitlin Leverenz was second in
4:34.48.  There are  three finals  scheduled for today: the women’s
100m butterfly, men’s 100m breaststroke and women’s 400m
freestyle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
