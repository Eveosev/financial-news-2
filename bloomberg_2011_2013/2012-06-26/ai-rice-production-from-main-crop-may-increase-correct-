Thai rice production from the main
crop may climb to 25.88 million metric tons this year, more than
a previous forecast, according to the Office of Agricultural
Economics.  Output from the main harvest, representing about 70 percent
of annual production, will probably increase from the 24.7
million tons forecast in May, according to the agency.
Production from the main harvest in the previous crop year
raised to 23 million tons from 20.4 million tons, it said.  The government has bought about 16 million tons of unmilled
rice since October under a purchase program to boost farmer
incomes, according to the Ministry of Commerce.  Production of natural rubber may increase 8.3 percent to
3.63 million tons and oil-palm output may gain 7.8 percent to
11.6 million tons, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
