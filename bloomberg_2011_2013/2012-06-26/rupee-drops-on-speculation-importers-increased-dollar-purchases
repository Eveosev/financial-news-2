India ’s rupee fell toward a record
low on speculation oil importers stepped up purchases of dollars
to pay month-end bills.  The rupee’s 11 percent decline this quarter has pushed up
costs for refiners as  Asia ’s third-largest economy meets almost
80 percent of its oil needs from imports. India’s raising of the
amount of government bonds foreigners can hold by $5 billion
yesterday failed to arrest the currency’s slide. Global funds
sold $99 million more local stocks than they bought last week,
the most since May, exchange data show.  “Month-end dollar demand is strengthening and the rupee is
under some pressure,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a currency
trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Weakness in
the rupee may persist for a few days.”  The rupee declined to 57.035 per dollar at the 5 p.m. close
in Mumbai, from 57.015 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has dropped 7 percent in 2012, the worst
performance among the 10 most-traded Asian currencies. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at  12.35 percent.  Three-month  offshore  non-deliverable forwards traded at
58.21 per dollar, compared with 58.20 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
