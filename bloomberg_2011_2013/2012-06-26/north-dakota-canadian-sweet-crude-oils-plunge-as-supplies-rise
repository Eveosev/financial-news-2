North Dakota  and Canadian sweet oil
discounts to West Texas Intermediate plunged as supplies rise
and pipeline restrictions limit the movement of some grades next
month.  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for the U.S. benchmark oil, the grade traded in  New York , rose
360,000 barrels to a record 47.8 million on June 15, Energy
Department data showed.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  will temporarily
restrict some light sweet crudes on its Keystone pipeline
starting in July, a person with knowledge of the situation said
May 31.  Bakken oil’s discount widened $7 to $13 below WTI at 4:10
p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Syncrude’s discount increased 75 cents to $3.50 below the U.S.
benchmark. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike
bitumen in  Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $3 to $26.50 a
barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI lost $1.15 a barrel to $12.35 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet strengthened $1.35 to $13.60 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium to WTI lost 25 cents to $8 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon’s premium added $1.40 a barrel to $8.50.
Mars Blend’s premium lost 25 cents to $9 a barrel.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, lost $1.45 to $11 a
barrel over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
