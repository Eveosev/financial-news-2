Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  rose 0.6 percent to 3,881.40,
the first gain in four days. The gauge has fallen 5.8 percent
since the start of April, poised for the steepest quarterly drop
since the three months ended Sept. 30. The index has gained 1.6
percent this year.  Mining companies:  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI)  ,  Indonesia ’s
biggest coal producer, advanced 1.8 percent to 1,120 rupiah,
rebounding from a 9.1 percent plunge yesterday.  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO) 
, the second largest, rose 4.5 percent to 1,390 rupiah
after dropping 6.3 percent over the past two days.  Investors deemed the shares’ recent declines excessive,
according to Leonardo Henry Gavaza, an analyst at PT Bahana
Securities in Jakarta. The shares fell over the past few days
amid concern the debt crisis in  Europe  will slow demand for
commodities such as coal, Gavaza said.  PT Central Omega Resources (DKFT)  , a nickel producer,
rose 2.3 percent to 1,750 rupiah, the highest close since May
10. The company’s units obtained permits to export 1.175 million
metric tons of nickel ore over three months, it said in a stock-
exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
