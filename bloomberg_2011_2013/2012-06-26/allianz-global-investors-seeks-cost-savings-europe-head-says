Allianz Global Investors, a unit of
 Allianz SE (ALV) , plans to integrate its international business units
and create three European hubs in London, Paris and  Frankfurt  to
reduce costs.  “We want to reduce our cost-income ratio of currently
around 75 percent,” James Dilworth, chief executive officer of
Allianz Global Investors Europe, said at a press conference in
Frankfurt today. “To achieve that, we not only want to cut
costs but also increase income.”  Allianz Global Investors is part of the Munich-based
insurer’s Allianz Asset Management, led by management board
member Jay Ralph. The larger entity also includes Pacific
Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s largest bond
mutual fund. Allianz gave  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco
greater independence last year by separating it from its other
asset managers.  Allianz Global Investors  Europe  recorded a net money inflow
of 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in the first quarter of the
year, Dilworth said during the press conference. The asset
manager plans on further reducing its product range in Europe,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
