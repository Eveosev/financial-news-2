Spain ’s borrowing costs jumped and
demand fell at a bill sale a day after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded 28 Spanish banks.  The Treasury sold 3.08 billion euros ($3.85 billion) of
bills, beating a maximum target of 3 billion euros. Three-month
bills fetched an average yield of 2.362 percent, compared with
0.846 percent at the last auction on May 22, and six-month bills
an average rate of 3.237 percent, compared with 1.737 percent.  Spain’s  10-year borrowing costs  rose for a second day,
edging toward 7 percent, after Moody’s yesterday cut at least 12
banks’ ratings to junk, saying the government’s weakening credit
profile undermined its ability to backstop lenders. The
downgrades came as Spain negotiates the terms of a 100 billion-
euro loan requested for its banks on June 9.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told lawmakers in  Madrid 
that lenders receiving public funds may have to remove risky
assets from their balance sheets. Some conditions will apply
solely to bailed-out lenders while others will be “horizontal”
for the whole industry, de Guindos said.  “These sales further underline the difficulty Spain faces
in financing itself at a sustainable level,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in  London .  ‘Additional Bailouts’  “A failure to see much in the way of traction at this
week’s EU summit, as seems decidedly possible, will likely put
further strong additional pressure on Spanish yields, thereby
rapidly raising the prospect of additional bailouts,” he said.  Demand for the bills was lower, at 2.6 times the amount
sold for the three-month securities, compared with 3.95 times in
May, and a bid-to-cover ratio for the six-month bills of 2.82
compared with 4.3.  The Treasury said it has completed 61.7 percent of its
planned sales of medium- and long-term debt for this year.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond rose as much as 5 basis
points to 6.719 at 11:05 a.m. in Madrid after the auction. That
widened the gap with similar German maturities to as much as
5.18 percentage points, compared with a record 5.89 percentage
points on June 18.  Spain is the fourth euro member to have requested a bailout
and Cyprus followed yesterday, hurting demand for Italian debt.
 Italy  today sold 3.91 billion euros of bonds, near the maximum
set for the auction. The average yield for the 2.99 billion
euros of zero-coupon 2014 debt rose to 4.712 percent from 4.037
percent at the previous auction on May 28.  “The auctions in Spain and Italy were a little soft,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The amounts
sold look reasonable, but it’s the underlying weakness that the
market is paying attention to.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
