Indian equities climbed the most in
about a week after the  Reserve Bank of India  took measures to
contain the rupee’s slump.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the top software exporter,
rose the most in three weeks. Reliance Industries Ltd., owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, increased the most in a
week. The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, added 0.4
percent to 16,943.48, the steepest gain since Jun 21, according
to preliminary closing prices in Mumbai. The gauge changed
directions at least 20 times.  India’s central bank yesterday raised the amount of
government debt foreign funds can hold by $5 billion. The rupee
is  Asia ’s worst performer in the past year, and its weakness has
added to inflation that the central bank deemed on June 18 too
high to allow an interest-rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
