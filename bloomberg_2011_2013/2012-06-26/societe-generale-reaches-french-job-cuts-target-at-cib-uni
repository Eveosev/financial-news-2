Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s
second-largest bank by market value, has reached its goal of 880
voluntary staff departures at its corporate- and investment-
banking unit at home, a union official said.  “The management attained its quotas” for CIB job cuts in
France, said Michel Marchet, a CGT union representative at the
Paris-based bank.  About 680 people are leaving the group while about 200 are
moving to other positions within the bank, he said. Helene Mazier, a Societe Generale spokeswoman, declined to comment when
reached by phone today.  Societe Generale, along with rivals  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , is cutting assets and shrinking costs at its
CIB unit to cope with stricter Basel III capital rules and as
 Europe ’s debt crisis trimmed funding options last year,
especially in dollars.  The top three French banks’ CIB units are cutting 1,800
jobs at home.  Societe Generale is cutting about 1,580 CIB jobs worldwide.
In France, the unit is reducing 463 back-office positions and
416 front-office jobs, mostly sales staff, as part of the
voluntary departure plan, Marchet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
