Temperatures may reach 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) later this week from the Mississippi
River to the mid-Atlantic, including  Chicago  and  Washington ,
boosting energy demand.  Chicago is expected to reach 100 in two days and Washington
may see 99 by the end of the week, according to the  National
Weather Service . Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  said he thinks Washington will break 100.  “By Thursday and Friday, Chicago and Washington, D.C.,
should see their first 100-degree high temperatures of the year
based on this fast moving heat surge,” Rogers said from his
office in Bethesda, Maryland. “This event does not hit the
Northeast as hard.”  Temperatures in the 90s and above in large population areas
send more people to air conditioners to get cool, which in turn
raises power-plant fuel prices and demand for electricity. A
heat wave throughout the Northeast and into eastern Canada last
week pushed up day-ahead electricity prices to a three-year high
in New York on June 21.  New York is expected to reach a high of 93 by June 29 and
 Boston ’s temperature may be 90 the next day, according to the
Weather Service. A high of 94 is forecast for Philadelphia by
the weekend. Highs may reach 102 in Richmond, Virginia; 97 in
Baltimore; and 94 in Trenton,  New Jersey , the  Weather Service 
said.  Toronto may see 91 this weekend, according to  Environment
Canada .  Central Heat  The central U.S. from North Dakota to  Texas  is already in
the grip of a heat wave, according to the Weather Service.
Wichita, Kansas, has had two days of temperatures above 100 and
is forecast to have four more before the high drops to 99 this
weekend, the agency said. Tulsa, Oklahoma, may end the week with
seven days above 100.  Houston’s high today may reach 102 and temperatures may
then linger in the 90s for the rest of the week, according to
the Weather Service.  The heat may moderate in the Northeast, where temperatures
are expected to be seasonal from July 1 to July 5, according to
 MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The central U.S.
is forecast to stay 5 to 7 degrees above normal through July 10.  Rogers said the western U.S. will probably remain seasonal
during the next two weeks.  For July 1, the normal average temperature in  New York City 
is 76, according to MDA. It’s 72 in Boston; 79 in Washington; 80
in Atlanta; 74 in Chicago; 84 in Houston; 64 in Seattle and 73
in Burbank, California.  -- Editors:  Charlotte  Porter, Bill Banker  To contact the reporter on this story:
