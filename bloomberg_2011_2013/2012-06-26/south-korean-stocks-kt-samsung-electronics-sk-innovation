Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Seoul. The Kospi
index retreated 0.4 percent to 1,817.81, falling for a fourth
day to the lowest level since June 5. The measure has slumped
9.7 percent this quarter, poised for the steepest drop since the
quarter ended September.  KT Corp. (030200)  (030200 KS), South Korea’s largest phone and
Internet company, rallied 3 percent to 28,950 won, its steepest
gain since May 7. The stock gained after MoneyToday reported the
company is reviewing various ways to set up a holding company,
including a spinoff of its network business. KT hasn’t
considered a plan to set up a holding company, Kim Yoon Jeong, a
company spokeswoman, said by phone today.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  (005930 KS), Asia’s biggest maker
of chips and flat screens, added 0.6 percent to 1.139 million
won, after slumping 4.2 percent yesterday. Much of the recent
pessimism over the company’s second-quarter earnings looks
“overdone,” Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report.  SK Innovation Co. (096770)  (096770 KS), South Korea’s biggest
refiner, dropped 3.6 percent to 134,000 won, the most since June
4. South Korea, which imports all of its crude, may halt
purchases from Iran after it failed to win an exemption from
European Union sanctions that mean tankers shipping the oil
can’t get insurance. SK Innovation said it is committed to
finding alternative suppliers, a company spokesman said by phone
today, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
