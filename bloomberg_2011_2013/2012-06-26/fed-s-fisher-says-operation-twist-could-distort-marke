President  Richard Fisher  said the Fed’s expansion last week of
its maturity extension program known as Operation Twist could
interfere in the allocation of U.S. Treasury securities.  “There’s a limit to what we can do without distorting the
marketplace,” Fisher said in a Fox Business Network interview
today. “And that’s a subject of much debate” on the  Federal
Open Market Committee , said Fisher, who doesn’t vote on policy
this year. “The real question is: Where does it start to
interfere with the way that markets allocate securities?”  Richmond Fed President  Jeffrey Lacker  dissented last week
from the Fed’s $267 billion extension of Operation Twist,
asserting it will spur inflation and not significantly help the
economy. Central bank officials on June 20 downgraded their
forecasts for growth and employment while noting “significant
downside risks” to the economy.  “My suspicion is Operation Twist is having a very minor
effect” on the economy and “ the costs exceed the benefits,”
Fisher said. “That’s why I personally didn’t support the
program.”  Fisher, 63, has been president of the Dallas Fed since
2005. His district includes Texas, northern Louisiana and
southern  New Mexico .  To contact the reporters on this story:
