Peugeot SA (UG)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
Opel unit may start building cars in each other’s plants in
France and Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported,
citing German labor-union officials.  Plans call for building the Peugeot 508 and Citroen C5
limousines at Opel’s main Ruesselsheim plant outside Frankfurt,
while Peugeot would produce Opel’s Zafira minivan, the newspaper
reported today.  The newspaper report is “pure speculation,” Ulrich Weber,
a spokesman for Adam Opel AG in Ruesselsheim, said in an e-
mailed statement. Peugeot and GM are discussing working together
on logistics, purchasing and engineering, while production isn’t
covered by the cooperation agreement, Weber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
