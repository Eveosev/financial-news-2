Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  rose 0.5
percent to 67.27 in Nairobi, extending its gain this quarter to
12 percent.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index fell for the
second straight day, down less than 0.1 percent to 21,347.17 in
Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the bourse.
Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  slid 0.3 percent to 1,784.19 in Port

consecutive day, retreating 0.2 percent to 896.74 in Windhoek.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL)  , the country’s
sixth-biggest lender, gained 4 percent to 104 shillings, the
highest since Aug. 8, before a planned sale of the shares at a
discount to the current price.  “It’s an attractive discount compared to the prevailing
market prices,” Gregory Waweru, head of corporate advisory for
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi,
the capital. “Investors are in the market trying to be on the
shareholder list by the book closure date.”  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , Kenya’s biggest oil marketer by
market value, rose for a third day, advancing 2.6 percent to
15.95 shillings, the highest close on record since at least May
1997, after Trafigura Baheer’s Puma Energy Ltd. made a takeover
proposal and the company was awarded two tenders to deliver fuel
in July and August. The award comes a day after the company won
a bid to deliver two cargoes of Murban crude in August.  Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC)  , the East
African nation’s biggest power producer, gained for a third day,
increasing 1.1 percent to 8.85 shillings, as the company boosted
its hydropower installed capacity, reducing reliance on
expensive sources in energy production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
