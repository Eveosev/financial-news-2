College football’s top division may
officially get a playoff system as a four-team, three-game
proposal goes to a vote of the Bowl Championship Series
president oversight committee today.  The playoff was agreed upon last week by the commissioners
of the 11 conferences at the sport’s top level -- the Football
Bowl Subdivision -- and University of Notre Dame Athletic
Director Jack Swarbrick. If the proposal gains approval at the
BCS presidential committee’s meeting in  Washington , it would be
implemented for the 2014-15 season.  College football’s national champion since 1998 has been
crowned by the BCS, which uses a formula that incorporates
rankings and computer polls to decide the two schools that play
for the title.  Under the proposed playoff format, the two national
semifinal games would rotate among the major bowls such as the
Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls. The national championship
game would be played approximately 10 days after the semifinals
and the neutral site would be up for bid the same way the
 National Football League  rotates its  Super Bowl  between bidding
cities, the Washington Post reported.  A selection committee would probably be formed to determine
the four participants in the playoff, the paper said.  Last season’s BCS title game, a rematch between
 Southeastern Conference  rivals Louisiana State and the
University of Alabama, drew the lowest television ratings of the
BCS era. Alabama’s 21-0 victory marked the sixth straight year
that a school from the SEC won the BCS championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
