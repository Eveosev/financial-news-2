SBA (SBAC)  Communications Corp. agreed to
buy 3,252 towers from TowerCo for $1.45 billion, its second
acquisition of wireless network antennas this year as mobile
device carriers try to woo subscribers with faster connections.  SBA will pay $1.2 billion in cash and 4.6 million shares
for towers in 47 U.S. states and  Puerto Rico , the companies said
today in a statement. The transaction is expected to close in
the fourth quarter and the assets will produce as much as $95
million in tower cash flow in 2013 for SBA.  The deal is Boca Raton, Florida-based SBAâ€™s largest in at
least 13 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company in February agreed to pay about $1.1 billion for 2,300
towers in the U.S. and Central America from Mobilitie LLC, as
well as outdoor distributed antenna system assets in Chicago,
Las Vegas,  New York City  and Auburn, Alabama. That cash and
stock deal completed in April, and was projected to add about
$75 million in tower cash flow in 2012.  SBA rose 1.6 percent to $55.64 yesterday. The shares had
gained 30 percent this year. Cary, North Carolina-based TowerCo,
the fifth-largest independent tower operating company in the
U.S., counts among its investors Soros Strategic Partners LP and
Vulcan Capital.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. provided $900 million in financing and
acted as financial adviser for SBA, while Greenberg Traurig LLP
provided legal council.  Wells Fargo & Co . acted as financial
adviser to TowerCo, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
LLP was its legal adviser.  To contact the reporters on this story:
