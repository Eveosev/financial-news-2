Bank of Nova Scotia  wants to break
through what Chief Executive Officer  Richard Waugh  calls a
“concrete” ceiling that has prevented women in Mexico from
advancing in business.  “The barriers faced by women in business internationally
are enormous,” Waugh, said in an e-mailed statement. “In
Mexico, the ceilings were not glass but concrete.”  Canada ’s third-largest bank plans to donate C$500,000
($486,000) to help nonprofit research group Catalyst establish a
presence in the Latin American country. New York-based Catalyst,
which investigates ways to expand opportunities for women in
business, will use the funds over a five-year period. Waugh is
chairman of Catalyst Canada’s advisory board.  Greater gender diversity can lead to a more productive
Mexican economy in a culture that has traditionally relied on
men in the top positions, said Nicole Reich de Polignac, chief
executive officer of  Scotiabank Mexico , whose staff is 53
percent women.  “ Mexico  still has a long way to go in terms of advancing
women,” de Polignac said in an interview in Toronto.  Scotiabank, which runs Mexico’s seventh-largest bank,
promoted de Polignac to head of the unit in 2007, making her the
first female bank CEO in the Latin American country. None of
Canada’s eight publicly-traded banks have had a female CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
