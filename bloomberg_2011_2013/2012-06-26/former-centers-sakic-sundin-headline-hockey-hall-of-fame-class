Joe Sakic and Mats Sundin, former
National Hockey League All-Stars and Olympic gold medalists,
have been voted into the  Hockey Hall of Fame .  They will be joined by Russian forward Pavel Bure, and Adam Oates, who today was named coach of the  Washington Capitals . The
selection committee voted today on the Class of 2012, which will
be formally inducted into the Hall in Toronto on Nov. 12,
according to an NHL statement.  Sakic, 42, had 1,641 career points, ninth on the NHL’s all-
time list; two Stanley Cup titles; and an Olympic gold medal. He
was named the playoff’s Most Valuable Player in 1996 when he
captained the  Colorado Avalanche  to a Stanley Cup championship,
and was named league MVP in 2001, when the team won its second
title in  Colorado .  “I’m extremely proud of the career I had,” Sakic said in
an interview on NHL Network. “I had a lot of help from a lot of
different people, but after 20 years of playing in the league
and to be honored like this and placed among the best who have
ever played the game, it’s a very humbling day.”  A 13-time All-Star, Sakic spent his entire 20-year career
with the Avalanche franchise, playing seven seasons with the
Quebec Nordiques before they relocated to Denver. He won a gold
medal with  Canada  at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  “You’re hoping to get the call and when you do, I was
speechless for a bit,” Sakic said.  Sundin, a former captain of the  Toronto Maple Leafs , scored
1,349 points in 1,346 games over 18 NHL seasons. He is the Maple
Leafs’ career leader in points, goals, power-play goals,
shorthanded goals, game-winning goals and overtime goals, and
captained  Sweden  to the gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics
in Turin, Italy.  ‘Hockey Matters’  “Three years have passed since I retired and it makes me
realize how privileged I was to play my entire career in Canada,
where hockey really matters,” Sundin said in the statement.
“Having my hobby and love for a sport become my livelihood
really allowed me to live out my dream.”  Bure, 41, played 12 seasons before retiring due to a knee
injury. The right wing averaged 37 goals per season as a member
of the  Vancouver Canucks ,  Florida Panthers  and  New York  Rangers,
and led the league in goals during the 1993-94, 1999-00 and
2000-01 seasons.  The 49-year-old Oates, eligible for induction since 2007,
is sixth on the NHL’s all-time assists list with 1,079 in 1,337
games. A center who spent a majority of his career with  Boston
Bruins  and Capitals, Oates led the NHL in assists three separate
times, including the 2001-02 season, when he was 39.  Former players who were eligible but not inducted include
Brendan Shanahan, Jeremy Roenick and Curtis Joseph.  Shanahan’s performance as the NHL’s head of discipline has
drawn criticism from players and coaches for his strict
interpretation of the rules and punishments that he has handed
down. He won Stanley Cup titles with the  Detroit Red Wings  in
1997, 1998 and 2002, and is the only player in league history
with more than 600 goals and 2,000 penalty minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
