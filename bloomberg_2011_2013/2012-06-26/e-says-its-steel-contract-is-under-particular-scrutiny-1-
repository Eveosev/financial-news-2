The London Metal Exchange’s steel
contract may need some “fine-tuning” after the possible sale
of the exchange is completed, said  Martin Abbott , chief
executive officer.  “The billet contract as a relatively new contract is under
particular scrutiny,” Abbott said in an interview in London
today. “My guess is that at some point we’ll have to do some
fine-tuning at least and we’ll be ready to do that, but probably
not while we’re otherwise engaged with the potential
transaction. I don’t think we need to focus on the billet
contract right now.”  Steel billet trading on the LME fell 30 percent to 11,307
contracts in May from the year earlier. One contract is 65
metric tons. The contract, introduced in 2008, traded at $400 a
ton for a three-month delivery yesterday.  Shareholders of the 135-year-old  London  exchange are
expected to vote on a 1.39 billion pound ($2.2 billion) takeover
proposal by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. at the end of
next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
