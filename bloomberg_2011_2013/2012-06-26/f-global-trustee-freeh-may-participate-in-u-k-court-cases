MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)  Chapter 11
trustee,  Louis Freeh , was given the right by a London judge to
participate in all U.K. court proceedings involving the failed
brokerage.  Judge David Richards signed off on the application at a
hearing today. Freeh has filed a London lawsuit against the
administrators of the company’s U.K. unit seeking about $400
million from internal repurchase agreements used to move money
around the company.  Legal disputes between multiple trustees winding up MF
Global’s British and American entities have tied up about $1.1
billion of clients’ and creditors’ money, which can’t be
returned until courts decide who controls the assets. MF Global
filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31 after
getting margin calls for its bets on European debt.  A separate $700 million case between U.K. administrators
KPMG LLP and the trustee of the MF Global U.S. brokerage unit
over disputed assets is set to go ahead in  London  in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
