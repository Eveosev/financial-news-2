Corn, soybean and rice crops in
 China â€™s main producing regions may get rain this week, boosting
crops threatened by drought conditions earlier,  the National
Meteorological Center  said.  Most parts of northern China, areas along the Yellow River
and Huai River will receive showers ranging from 10 millimeters
to 150 millimeters before the end of this month, the center said
in a report dated June 24. Summer crops such as corn, and
soybeans are in development stage, while certain rice seedlings,
being transferred to open fields, are in need of water, it said.  The rains will help replenish moisture in the soil after
drought conditions since the end of May affected the crops, the
center said. Still, farmers will need to watch out for excessive
rain that might turn into floods, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
