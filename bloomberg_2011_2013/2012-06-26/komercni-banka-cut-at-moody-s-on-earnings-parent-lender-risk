Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  had its bank
financial-strength rating cut at Moody’s Investors Service,
which cited a Czech economic slowdown and risks of capital
transfers to the lender’s owner, Societe Generale SA.  Moody’s downgraded the Prague-based company’s standalone
bank financial strength rating to C-/baa1 from C/a3 in a report
late yesterday.  The economic slowdown will outweigh the bank’s “strong
capital position” with a 13.6 percent Tier 1 ratio at the end
of March 2012, according to the report. The downgrade follows a
cut in the parent company’s ratings on June 21, Moody’s said.  “The weakening operating environment will constrain
earnings and exert pressure on the bank’s problem loans,” the
ratings company said. SocGen’s deteriorating credit profile
poses a “risk of capital being up-streamed to the parent, which
would directly affect Komercni Banka’s capital cushion,”
Moody’s said.  The lender rose 0.7 percent today to 3,405 koruna by 11:52
a.m. in  Prague , snapping a 3.4 percent drop in the previous two
sessions.  The ratings provider confirmed Komercni Banka’s long-term
local and foreign-currency deposit ratings of A2 and its Prime-1
short-term local and foreign-currency deposit grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
