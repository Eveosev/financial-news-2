European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn will join a meeting of finance
chiefs in Paris tonight as they prepare for an EU summit in two
days.  The working dinner hosted by French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  will include Germany’s  Wolfgang Schaeuble , Italy’s
Vittorio Grilli and Spain’s Luis de Guindos Jurado, according to
a statement from Moscovici’s office.  “It’s not a last-chance summit but it’s a crucial one,”
Moscovici said today on France Info radio. European leaders need
to adopt a plan for growth, banking union and political
integration, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
