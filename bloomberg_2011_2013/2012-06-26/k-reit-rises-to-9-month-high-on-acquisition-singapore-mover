K-REIT Asia (KREIT) , the Singapore office
landlord partly owned by Keppel Corp., climbed to the highest in
more than nine months after saying it bought an additional stake
in Ocean Properties LLP.  The stock rose 2.9 percent to S$1.055 at the close in
Singapore trading, the highest since Sept. 9. The real estate
investment trust paid S$261.6 million ($204 million) for an
additional 12.39 percent of the downtown  Ocean Financial Centre ,
raising its holding to 99.9 percent, it said in a Singapore
stock exchange statement yesterday. The property has 887,423
square feet of rentable space.  The acquisition will add to K-REIT’s assets where  office
rents  in the city-state advanced to the highest in three years
at the end of 2011, based on government data. The purchase will
be funded by bank borrowings and proceeds from a placement of 60
million new units at an offer price of S$1.17 per share that
will help raise S$70.2 million.  “The acquisition price represents a 10 percent discount
against Savills valuation of S$291 million as of 15 June 2012,”
Min Chow Sai and Paul Lin Zikai, Singapore-based analysts at
Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note to clients yesterday. Ocean
Financial Centre’s committed occupancy is estimated at more than
90 percent as of the first quarter, compared with 80 percent in
the previous three months, according to the note. The stock is
rated neutral by the brokerage.  The Ocean Financial Centre, a 43-story  office tower , is
located on a site with a 999-year leasehold title that commenced
from 1862. The acquisition will allow K-REIT to increase its
interest in a premium office building and is expected to be
yield-accretive and increase the distribution to unit holders,
it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
