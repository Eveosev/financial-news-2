Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the third-
largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, is in negotiations to bring  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  into its
deep-water Phobos project in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Exxon may cover Anadarko’s costs for the project’s first
exploration well, John Colglazier, vice president of investor
relations and communications at Anadarko, said during a Global
Hunter Securities LLC conference webcast today. The Woodlands,
Texas-based Anadarko would reduce its stake to 30 percent and
remain operator under the potential arrangement, he said.  Anadarko has a 50 percent working interest in Phobos along
with Plains Exploration & Production Co.,  John Christiansen , an
Anadarko spokesman, said in a telephone interview today. Plains
expects a resource potential of 306 million barrels of oil
equivalent from Phobos, it said in slides at the Global Hunter
conference.  Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment,
saying in an e-mail that the company doesn’t discuss potential
business plans.  ConocoPhillips and Apache Corp. are the largest U.S.
independent oil and gas producers by market value. Independent
oil producers don’t own refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
