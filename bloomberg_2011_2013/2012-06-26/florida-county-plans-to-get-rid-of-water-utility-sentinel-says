Lake County is planning to get rid
of an antiquated water utility this summer after receiving a
$1.2 million U.S. federal grant for new lines to link South
Umatilla Water customers to the city’s water system, the Orlando
Sentinel reported, citing county officials.  The newspaper said the Florida county was burdened with the
failing utility five years ago, spending $40,000 a year on it
after privately owned South Umatilla Water Inc. dissolved.
“Lake County is not in the utility business,” public works
engineer Alan Kirkland told the paper. “That’s why it’ll be
turned over to the city of Umatilla.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
