Digital Realty Trust Inc., (DLR)  the
largest provider of data-center real estate, agreed to buy three
properties near London for 715.6 million pounds ($1.1 billion).  The Sentrum Portfolio will be purchased with cash, debt and
a bridge loan, the San Francisco-based company said in a
statement today. Digital Realty also plans to sell 8.35 million
shares in a public offering to help fund the acquisition,
according to a separate statement today. It didn’t disclose the
name of the seller.  The European data center market is less mature than in
 North America  and should “sustain solid growth,” equity
researcher Benchmark Co. LLC said in a December report. Four-
fifths of the space in the Sentrum Portfolio is currently
rented, with an average of eight years remaining on the leases,
according to the statement.  “There is a significant value-add opportunity to lease the
balance of the portfolio’s available space,”  Scott Peterson ,
chief acquisitions officer for Digital Realty, said in the
statement.  The portfolio includes 761,000 square feet (71,000 square
meters) across three data centers located in Woking, Watford and
Croydon.  Digital Realty, which has data centers in 31 countries, has
seen its share price rise 9.9 percent this year. The company
acquired a 269,000-square-foot data center in Dallas, Texas, it
said on June 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
