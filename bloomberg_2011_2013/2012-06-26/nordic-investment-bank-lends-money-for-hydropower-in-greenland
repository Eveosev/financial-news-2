The Nordic Investment Bank, owned by
the five Nordic and three Baltic governments, is lending 47
million euros ($59 million) to the Greenland’s self-rule
government for a hydropower project on the island’s west coast.  The 15-year loan, which will cover almost half of the
project’s cost, will help the Greenland Energy Authority develop
a 22.5-megawatt facility, Dimitrijs Alehins, a spokesman for the
NIB, said today by e-mail. The government will finance the
remainder.  Three turbines of 7.5 megawatts each will be installed at a
site outside of the town of Ilulissat. The first turbine is
expected to start working in November and the whole plant from
September 2013, according to a  website statement .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
