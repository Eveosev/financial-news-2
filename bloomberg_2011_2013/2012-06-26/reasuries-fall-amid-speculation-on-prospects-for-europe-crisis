Treasuries fell amid speculation
whether European leaders are making progress toward resolving
the euro bloc’s financial crisis.  The U.S. sold $35 billion in two-year notes at an auction
that drew a  yield  of 0.313 percent, approaching the record low
of 0.222 percent reached in August. Treasuries advanced from
their lowest of the day after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
rejected shared liability for debt. European Union leaders open
a two-day summit on June 28.  “They are waiting for the next shoe to drop out of Europe
to determine what their next position is going to be,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York . “Everything is based
on what’s going to happen out of Europe.”  Ten-year note  yields increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 5:13 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They added as much as
five basis points to 1.65 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 declined 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 1/8.  The yield on the current  two-year note  rose one basis point
to 0.31 percent and touched 0.3111 percent, the highest level
since April 10.  Volume, Volatility  Trading volume jumped. About $225 billion of Treasuries
changed hands as of 5:01 p.m. through ICAP Plc, the world’s
largest interdealer broker, up 37 percent from yesterday’s $164
billion. Volume touched $396 billion on May 31, the highest
level since March. The daily average over the past year is $253
billion.  Volatility declined for a sixth straight day yesterday, the
longest stretch since March, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index. It fell to 72.8 basis points, the
lowest level since May 29. The index measures price swings based
on options. It dropped 20 basis points last week, the most since
June 2009.  Treasuries trimmed their decline earlier as Spanish and
Italian borrowing costs rose amid concern the EU summit will
fail to solve the euro bloc’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “We are still near low yields levels as  Europe  is still
forefront on everyone’s mind, and nothing is going to change
that any time soon unless something in Europe changes,” said
Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP, which as one of the 21 primary dealers is
obliged to bid in Treasury sales.  Merkel Comments  Germany ’s Merkel told lawmakers of her ruling coalition she
“doesn’t see” shared debt happening in the euro area,
according to Steffen Seibert, her chief spokesman.  An EU options paper for reshaping the euro bloc leans
toward mutualizing debt and doesn’t say enough about imposing
stricter controls on national budgets, German Deputy Foreign
Minister Michael Link told reporters today.  “Merkel’s strong resistance to Eurobonds continues the
bleak outlook coming from Europe,” said Tom Tucci, managing
director and head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World
Markets Corp. “The constant debate in Europe is keeping us near
these low yield levels as we are still in the middle of a
banking and sovereign debt crisis.”  Spain  sold 3.08 billion euros ($3.85 billion) of bills,
with the three-month note yielding 2.362 percent, compared with
0.846 percent at the previous auction. Italy sold 2.99 billion
euros of zero-coupon 2014 notes at a yield of 4.71 percent, up
from 4.04 percent at the previous auction.  Auction Yield  The yield at today’s Treasury auction compared with the
average forecast of 0.314 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine primary dealers. Two-year note auction yields averaged 0.99
percent from the start of 2009 until the announcement of
 Greece ’s first bailout in May 2010.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.62,
versus an average of 3.71 for the past 10 offerings.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 31.7 percent of the note, compared with
an average of 34 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders ,
non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with
the Treasury, bought 7.9 percent, versus an average of 11.8
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Primary Dealers  Primary dealers, which are obliged to bid in Treasury
sales, purchased 60.4 percent of the securities, the most since
December. The average for the past 10 auctions is 54.2 percent.  The Treasury is selling $99 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It will auction $35 billion in five-year debt tomorrow and
$29 billion in seven-year securities on June 28.  This week’s note sales, combined with the June 21 auction
of $7 billion in 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $49.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $56.1 billion.  Two-year notes have returned 0.03 percent this year,
compared with a 1.92 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 1.46 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.79 percent.  Treasuries investors increased their neutral position in
the securities and became “net short” for the third time in
four weeks, according to a survey by the primary dealer JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Neutrals rose to 74 percent, from 66 percent, marking the
highest level of outright neutrals since October. The proportion
of net shorts, or bets the securities would fall compared with
those on an advance, rose to 4 percentage points from zero in
the week ending yesterday, even as the percent of outright
shorts dropped to 15 percent from 17 percent. The percent of
outright longs also dropped to 11 percent from 17 percent in the
same period.  The  Federal Reserve  bought $4.65 billion of Treasuries
today due from August 2020 to May 2022 as part of its Operation
Twist program to replace short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term securities to hold down borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
