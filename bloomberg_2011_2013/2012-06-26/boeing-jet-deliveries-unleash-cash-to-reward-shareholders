Boeing Co. (BA) , after investing heavily
in new jet designs, may see free cash flow as much as double
during the next three years to $18 billion, raising the prospect
of bigger dividends or stock buybacks.  A record backlog of commercial-jet orders is setting up
Boeing for a surge in  cash  as the Chicago-based planemaker
cranks up production and trims spending for aircraft development
programs such as the 787 Dreamliner.  That gives Boeing the ability to increase its dividend or
begin its first new buyback plan in five years. The company may
announce the purchase of $3 billion of its own stock, equal to
about 5 percent of the total outstanding, as soon as the fourth
quarter, said  Peter Arment , a Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. analyst.  “If Boeing is able to execute successfully on this
significant production ramp in front of them, they’re going to
have a high-class problem of generating a tremendous amount of
excess cash,” said Arment, who is based in Birmingham,  Alabama ,
and has a buy  recommendation  on the stock.  Free cash flow, or cash from operations minus  capital
spending , will total $18 billion from 2012 to 2014, compared
with $8.5 billion in the three years ended in 2011, Arment
estimates. Carter Copeland, a Barclays Plc analyst in  New York ,
projects the total will be $14 billion in the next three years.  “One of the reasons we own the stock is that strong  cash
flow  generation which will accrue to shareholders over the next
several years,” said Chris Wolters, a managing director with
Epoch Investment Partners in New York.  Jet Upgrades  Boeing is done with major development of the 787 and 747-8
jumbo jet and is focused now on new variants of existing planes.
The planemaker is working to raise production 40 percent by the
end of 2014, which is significant for revenue because airlines
make about 40 percent of their payments upon delivery.  Converting a 3,953-jet backlog into cash is the “top
priority” for Boeing’s commercial business, Chief Executive
Officer Jim McNerney said. The money will go to small
acquisitions and technology and be returned to investors, he
said in a May 15 presentation, without giving details.  “Cash flow is improving with the increase in commercial
airplane deliveries,” Chaz Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, said in
a telephone interview. “There has been some decrease in R&D as
we come off the peak of the 787.”  Sweet Spot  Boeing hasn’t been in this kind of sweet spot since the
late 1990s, after the 777’s 1995 debut. As the 787 fell more
than three years behind schedule before entering service in
2011, and as the investment in the plane rose to what Arment
estimated is about $20 billion, Boeing halted buybacks and left
the dividend unchanged.  With a combined payout yield for dividends and repurchases
of 2.3 percent from last year, Boeing ranked 292nd on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its $1.2 billion payout was 102nd, while its market
value was No. 49.  Boeing may announce a dividend increase to 49 cents a share
in December from the current 44-cent payout, according to a
Bloomberg projection. The company last raised that amount in
December 2011, the first jump since 2008. Boeing left the
payment unchanged yesterday.  “As an investor I like to see the dividend increases,”
said Gary Flam, a partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors in  Los
Angeles  who helps manage about $6.5 billion, including Boeing
stock. “It’s a stronger sign of faith in your underlying
business than a share repurchase.”  Locked In  Higher dividends lock Boeing into returning cash to
shareholders because the payments can’t be reduced without
negative fallout, Flam said. Share repurchases can be stopped at
any time, he said.  Boeing stock shows the strain of delays on the 787, the
first jetliner built chiefly of composite materials. The shares
tumbled 30 percent through today since the day before the first
Dreamliner postponement, in October 2007. That was almost twice
the drop in the  S&P 500 Index  in the same period, and trailed
the 16 percent gain for Airbus SAS parent  European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co.   The stock fell 0.2 percent to $70.93 at the close in New
York. The shares have dropped 3.3 percent this year, while EADS,
based in Paris and Munich, has gained 7.5 percent.  Boeing’s bonds yield an average of 1.66 percent, less than
the 1.93 percent for EADS and 2.75 percent for all companies in
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Large Cap Capital Goods
& Building Materials index.  Buyback History  The planemaker’s last share-repurchase announcement was for
$7 billion in October 2007, and Boeing spent only $3.4 billion
and has $3.6 billion pending in the program. In the previous
three years, Boeing had spent $8 billion on buybacks, according
to a 2007 company statement.  “I would expect that the company leans more toward first
returning cash to investors through share repurchases,” said
Copeland, the Barclays analyst, who has an overweight/positive
rating on the stock. “Share repurchases have been a part of the
balanced cash deployment strategy we’ve seen in the past, and
they’ve since eliminated that.”  Some of Boeing’s cash will have to be pumped into its
retirement funds as pension liabilities rise because of low
 interest rates . Boeing expects to contribute about $1.5 billion
in cash to its pension plans in 2012 and said the amounts may
rise in future years, according to a Feb. 9 filing.  Defense Pressure  The company also may face pressure to deploy cash to
bolster profits at its defense unit, which accounted for 47
percent of 2011 sales, as U.S. military spending shrinks, said
Alex Hamilton, an EarlyBird Capital analyst in New York.  “With the looming defense cuts, they should hold on to
their cash and invest it internally,” Hamilton said. “You’re
going to get better returns.”  Boeing has reduced its ratio of total debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 1.7
times last year from as high as 5.2 times in 2003. The ratio at
EADS is 1.6. And its current crop of aircraft programs will be
less costly than the 787 and the 747-8. That should allow Boeing
to boost profit, according to Copeland.  The 737 MAX will have new engines, a sturdier structure, a
modified tail and winglets as part of a “very simple” upgrade,
 Jim Albaugh , chief of the commercial airplanes unit, said at the
May 15 conference. It will compete with Airbus SAS’s re-engined
A320neo, which gobbled up orders last year.  777 Overhaul  An overhaul of the wide-body 777, for which airlines have
been clamoring, probably will involve new engines and composite-
plastic wings. That plane probably will come after a stretched
version of the Dreamliner, Albaugh told reporters at a briefing
in Beijing on June 11.  Production increases are under way for the 737 and 777.  Output for the wide-body 777 is scheduled to increase to
8.3 a month by early 2013 from seven now, and the 737 will climb
to 42 in 2014 from 35. The 737 makes up the biggest chunk of
Boeing’s outstanding orders, with 2,605 in the backlog through
May.  Even more important will be meeting targets for the
Dreamliner, whose composite construction and supplier network
were blamed for the delays on the plane. Only this month did
Boeing assemble the first 787 that won’t require changes at a
post-production modification center, where 50 of the jets are
stacked up for reworking.  Dreamliner Production  Dreamliner monthly production will rise to 10 by the end of
next year from 3.5 now, Boeing has said. The model’s order
backlog is 843 planes, and deliveries through May totaled 11
planes.  Counting the production increases, revenue growth from the
787 will be more than $6.5 billion in 2013 compared with about
$3 billion from the 737 and 777,  Yair Reiner , an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, wrote in a June 24 report.  Production for the 787 will require $4 billion of working
capital this year, which is $3 billion less than in 2011. The
787 program may be cash neutral next year and will add to cash
flow in 2014, said Reiner, who has an outperform rating on the
stock.  Boeing’s  list price  for the Dreamliner is as much as $228
million, and buyers typically negotiate discounts from there.
The cost of building a Dreamliner probably will drop below the
selling price for the first time in 2014’s second half, Sterne
Agee’s Arment said. Boeing then will start recovering the
investment in the new plane, he said.  “What we would anticipate is the company will go out and
repurchase shares as well as modestly increase the dividend,”
said Wolters, the Epoch Investment managing director. “That
really comes down to them executing the production ramp on the
787.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
