Tropical Storm Debbyâ€™s winds dropped
to 40 miles (64 kilometers) an hour, just above tropical
depression status, as the system slowly moved east toward
landfall tomorrow on north-central Florida, the National
Hurricane Center said in an advisory shortly before 11 a.m.
local time.  Debby was about 70 miles west of Cedar Key and moving at 3
mph. Storm surge and high tides, along with heavy rain, remain a
threat to parts of Florida, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
