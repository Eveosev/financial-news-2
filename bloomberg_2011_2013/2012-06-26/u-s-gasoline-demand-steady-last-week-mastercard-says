U.S. gasoline demand was little
changed last week even as prices at the pump sank to the lowest
level since February, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 9.01 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended June 22, up 0.1 percent from 9 million barrels
consumed the prior week, MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report
showed. This month MasterCard changed the release schedule to
every two weeks from weekly.  The average pump price declined 7 cents in the past week to
$3.48 a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 3. Prices are down
46 cents since their year-to-day peak of $3.94 on April 6.
Drivers are paying 3.9 percent less than a year earlier.  The highest prices and biggest declines were on the West
Coast, where the average fell 14 cents to $3.89 a gallon. The
lowest prices were on the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon declined 6
cents to $3.26.  Fuel consumption was 3.5 percent below the year-earlier
level, the 43rd straight drop in that measure. Year-to-date
gasoline demand is 4.7 percent below 2011.  Fuel use over the previous four weeks fell 3.2 percent
below the same period in 2011, a record 66th consecutive drop in
that measure.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
