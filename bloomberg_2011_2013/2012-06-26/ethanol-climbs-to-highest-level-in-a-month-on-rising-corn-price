Ethanol increased to the highest
price in more than a month, rising with corn on speculation that
hot, dry weather will reduce U.S. yields.  Much of  Illinois , Indiana, eastern  Iowa  and Missouri have
had less than half the normal amount of rain in the past 30
days, National Weather Service data show. About 70 percent of
Illinois, the biggest corn and soybean grower except for Iowa,
is in moderate to extreme drought. Corn is beginning to
reproduce, making this the most critical time for moisture.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.186 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
increase was the third in a row.  Corn for December delivery climbed 30 cents, or 5.1
percent, to $6.24 a bushel on CBOT. It was the highest
settlement price for a most-active contract since September.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 6.5 cents to $2.245 a
gallon in the U.S. Gulf, 10 cents to $2.325 on the West Coast,
6.5 cents to $2.24 in  New York  and 7 cents to $2.18 in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
