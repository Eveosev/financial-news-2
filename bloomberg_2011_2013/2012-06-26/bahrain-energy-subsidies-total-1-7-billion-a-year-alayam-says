Bahrain spends 650 million Bahraini
dinars ($1.7 billion) a year on energy subsidies, Alayam
reported, citing Oil Minister Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza.  Electricity subsidies cost the kingdom 250 million dinars
and the remaining 400 million subsidize fuel and other refined
products, Mirza told the  newspaper . The government may focus
subsidies on low-income citizens, as many people on high
incomes, and expatriates, benefit from them at present, he said.  Bahrain, the smallest Persian Gulf oil producer, consumes
38 percent of its natural gas output to generate electricity,
Alayam quoted Mirza as saying. The kingdomâ€™s electricity peak-
load this summer will rise by 12 percent from a year ago, to
3,150 megawatts a day; maximum capacity is 4,000, Mirza told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
