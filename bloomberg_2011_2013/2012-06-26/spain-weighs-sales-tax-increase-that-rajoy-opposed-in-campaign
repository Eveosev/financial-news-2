The Spanish government is studying a
possible increase in  sales tax  following a recommendation from
the European Commission, according to a budget ministry
official.  Officials are considering revising the list of products
that benefit from reduced rates of 8 percent and 4 percent to
increase revenue, said the official, who asked not to be named
in line with policy. The standard sales tax rate is 18 percent.  The commission and the International Monetary Fund are
pushing Spain to raise tax on consumption to tilt the economy
more toward exports. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  pledged not to
increase the levy during his election campaign last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
