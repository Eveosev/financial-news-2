Italian notes had the biggest two-
day drop in seven months, and Spanish securities slid, after
borrowing costs rose at debt sales.  Spain’s bonds led losses in the euro area after Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded 28 Spanish banks and Bundesbank
President Jens Weidmann said there can be no pooling of issuance
in  Europe  until governments agree to give up their fiscal
sovereignty. German bunds slipped before European Union leaders
meet in two days about the crisis. The  European Central Bank 
said Cypriot bonds have become ineligible as collateral in
refinancing operations.  “Demand is subdued, even for shorter-dated paper,” said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. The EU summit will probably be “a bit
disappointing and for that reason we’d expect lower bund
yields,” he said.  The yield on Italian two-year notes climbed 35 basis
points, or 0.35 percentage point, to 4.68 percent at 4:41 p.m.
 London  time. The 88 basis-point increase in yields in the past
two days is the biggest jump since Nov. 9. The 3 percent
security due April 2014 tumbled 0.57, or 5.70 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,247) face amount, to 97.28.  Similar-maturity Spanish yields were 36 basis points higher
at 5.21 percent, adding to yesterday’s 42-basis point increase.  Italian Sales  Italy sold 2.99 billion euros of zero-coupon 2014 debt to
yield 4.71 percent, up from 4.04 percent at the previous auction
on May 28. The nation is due to offer 9 billion euros of bills
tomorrow and as much as 5.5 billion euros of 2017 and 2022
securities the day after. The government said today it would
sell at least 30 billion euros of new bonds in the third
quarter.  Spain  auctioned three-month debt at an average yield of
2.36 percent, compared with 0.85 percent at the last auction in
May, and six-month bills at 3.24 percent, versus 1.74 percent
last month.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in developed
markets today followed by Spain, according to measures of 10-
year debt, the spread between two- and 10-year securities and
credit-default swaps.  German 10-year  yields  rose three basis points to 1.50
percent, after falling yesterday to 1.46 percent, the least
since June 19. The Federal Finance Agency raised its debt sales
target for the third quarter today, saying the nation plans to
sell 71 billion euros of securities in the period, a 4.4 percent
increase from December.  Road Map  A 10-year road map, released today by four officials led by
EU President  Herman Van Rompuy , centered on common banking
supervision and deposit insurance and a “criteria-based and
phased” move toward joint debt issuance. German Deputy Foreign
Minister Michael Link told reporters in Luxembourg that “parts
of it read like a wish list.”  The Financial Times reported that the EU would have the
right to revise the budgets of euro-area countries that
contravene fiscal rules under proposals set to be considered at
this week’s summit.  “Although there is nothing concrete at this point, people
in the market judged the report as a step in the right
direction,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in London. “But I don’t think German yields will
rise much further from here as the market is not overly
optimistic ahead of the summit.”  Finland, Austria  Austrian, Dutch and Finnish securities fell as the nations
sold  government bonds .  The Dutch 10-year yield climbed five basis points to 2.04
percent, after falling 10 basis points yesterday. The
Netherlands sold 2.17 billion euros of 10-year debt at an
average yield of 1.995 percent, compared with 2.139 percent at
the previous sale on May 8.  Finland  began selling its first 30-year bond to tap
investor demand for longer-dated securities.  The sale will be for 1.5 billion euros and priced to yield
45 basis points more than the mid-swap rate, said a person
familiar with the sale, who asked not to be identified because
the terms aren’t set.  Austria said it plans to sell bonds due in 2019 and 2044
through banks. The seven-year security will be priced to yield
42 basis points more than the mid-swap rate while the 32-year
debt will yield 100 basis points more than swaps.  The mid-swap rate is a measure of the cost of exchanging
variable- and fixed-interest rate payments and is used as a
benchmark for European borrowing.  German bonds handed investors a 0.68 percent return this
year on a risk-adjusted basis, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies, taking into account volatility. That compares with a
0.51 percent gain from U.S. Treasuries and a 0.43 percent
advance in U.K. gilts. Finnish bonds returned 1.05 percent on
the same basis.  On an absolute basis, German debt earned 2.9 percent in
2012, with  Portugal  returning 31 percent, the most among 26
indexes tracked.  To contact the reporters on this story:
