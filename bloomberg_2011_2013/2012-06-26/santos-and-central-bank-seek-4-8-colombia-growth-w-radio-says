Colombia ’s government and central
bank board are seeking ways to sustain growth of 4.8 percent
this year, amid signs that the economy is slowing, W Radio said
on its  website , without saying where it obtained the
information.  President Juan Manuel Santos met with central bank board
members, including Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry, this
morning.  Santos also discussed the level of Colombia’s foreign
currency reserves and its credit line with the International
Monetary Fund, W Radio said.  The central bank’s press office declined to comment on the
story, saying the meeting was confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
