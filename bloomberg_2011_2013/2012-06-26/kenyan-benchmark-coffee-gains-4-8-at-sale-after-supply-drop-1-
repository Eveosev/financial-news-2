Kenya ’s benchmark coffee grade
climbed to its highest level in four weeks at a sale today after
supplies fell, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The benchmark AA grade rose 4.8 percent to an average of
$276.01 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from a week earlier,
the exchange said by e-mail from Nairobi, the capital.  Supplies of AA beans fell 20 percent to 913 bags and sold
for as much as $293 a bag compared with $301 last week, the
exchange said.  The exchange, a trading platform of the Kenya Coffee
Producers and Traders Association, said the average price for
all the coffee sold climbed 0.9 percent to $150.06 a bag after
total supply fell.  “Prices were steady and superior beans fetched good
prices,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at Nairobi-based
Alanwood Ltd. said by phone. “The quality of the coffee was
better than last week.”  Sales at the auction climbed 5.4 percent to 8,301 bags
worth $1.52 million from 7,875 bags valued at $1.42 million last
week, it said.  Supplies at the auction fell 5.5 percent to 18,107 bags
from last week, the exchange said. Kenya harvests its early crop
from May through July, while the main crop is reaped from
September through December, KCPTA says. Its coffee season runs
from Oct. 1 through September.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
