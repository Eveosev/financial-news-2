Residential real estate prices fell
in April at the slowest pace in more than a year, adding to
signs the U.S. housing market was firming.  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities
dropped 1.9 percent in April from the same month in 2011, the
smallest decline since November 2010, after decreasing 2.6
percent in the year ended March, the group said today in New
York. The median  forecast  of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey projected a 2.5 percent drop.  A turnaround in prices is a necessary step toward luring
more buyers and sustaining demand for housing, which is starting
to stabilize after precipitating the last recession almost five
years ago. Record-low borrowing costs, due in part to Federal
Reserve efforts to hold down long-term rates, may keep promoting
home sales in the presence of an 8.2 percent unemployment rate.  “Housing has picked up since the middle of last year,”
said  Ryan Wang , an economist at HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New
York, who correctly forecast the monthly gain in prices. “Sales
have improved and the inventory of homes for sale has been
falling, which has brought a bit more balance into the market
and fed into a bit of stabilization of prices.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from declines of
1.7 percent to 3.1 percent. The Case-Shiller index is based on a
three-month average, which means the April data was influenced
by transactions in March and February.  Another report showed  consumer confidence  in June fell to a
five-month low as Americans became less sanguine about the
outlook for jobs and incomes. The Conference Board’s  index 
dropped to 62 from a revised 64.4 in the prior month.  Stocks Rise  Stocks fluctuated after yesterday’s selloff in global
equities. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1
percent to 1,314.52 at 11:37 a.m. in New York.  Home prices  adjusted for seasonal variations climbed 0.7
percent in April, matching the prior month’s gain, which was
revised up from a previously reported 0.1 percent increase. It
was the best back-to-back gain since mid 2009. Unadjusted prices
increased 1.3 percent in April as 19 of 20 cities showed gains.  Phoenix showed the biggest adjusted monthly increase, with
prices rising 2.3 percent from March.  Detroit  showed the biggest
decrease at 2.1 percent.  The year-over-year gauge provides better indications of
trends in prices, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller group. The
panel includes  Karl Case  and  Robert Shiller , the economists who
created the index.  Atlanta’s Decline  Ten of the 20 cities in the index showed a year-over-year
decline, led by a 17 percent drop in Atlanta, the only city to
show a double-digit decrease.  Phoenix showed the biggest year-over-year increase, with
prices rising 8.6 percent in the 12 months to April.  “We finally saw some rising home prices,”  David Blitzer ,
chairman of the S&P index committee, said in a statement.
“While one month does not make a trend, particularly during
seasonally strong buying months, the combination of rising
positive monthly index levels and improving annual returns is a
good sign.”  Prices may be on an upward trajectory as the glut of unsold
houses that went on the market after the recession  shrinks .
There were 2.49 million existing homes for sale in May, down
from an average supply of 2.93 million in 2011 and 3.22 million
in 2010, data from the National Association of Realtors show.  Existing Homes  The same NAR report indicated the median price of an
existing home climbed 7.9 percent to $182,600 last month, the
highest since June 2010, from $169,300 in May 2011.  “Nobody feels like prices are going down anymore,” Larry Nicholson, president and chief executive officer of homebuilder
 Ryland Group Inc. (RYL) , said during a June 13 investor conference.
“Everything we see now would tell us the second half of the
year will be better than last year. We’re seeing the quality of
the traffic pick up. We’re seeing new traffic. The business has
gotten better and moving back towards a normalized process.”  Helping potential buyers step into the market, the average
rate on a 30-year fixed loan  dropped  to 3.66 percent last week,
the lowest in data going back to 1972, according to  Freddie Mac .  Even so, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
week the economy wasn’t getting a typical boost from a real
estate recovery. To spur faster economic growth and more
activity in housing, the central bank announced last week it
would buy securities to extend the maturities of assets on its
balance sheet, thereby lowering longer-term  interest rates .  ============================================================  1-months 3-months  1-year  2-years  3-years  earlier  earlier  earlier  earlier  earlier
