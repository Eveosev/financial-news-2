(Corrects name of Sands  China  Ltd. in second paragraph.)  Hong Kong  stocks  swung between gains
and losses after U.S. homes sales hit a two-year high, while a
Chinese official said the government has no immediate plans to
subsidize car purchases, even as HSBC Holdings Plc became the
latest bank to cut its forecast for China’s growth.  Techtronic Industries Co., a power-tool maker that relies
on  North America  for most of its sales, added 1.2 percent.
 Dongfeng Motor Group Co. (489)  fell 1.3 percent. Sands China Ltd.
dropped 5.6 percent, pacing declines among casino stocks, after
Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the gaming company.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.1 percent to 18,916.36 as of
10:06 a.m. in Hong Kong after dropping as much as 0.3 percent.
Volume was about 20 percent below the 30-day average before the
start of a European summit on June 28 and President Hu Jintao’s
visit from June 29 to July 1 for the 15th anniversary of the
city’s return to Chinese rule.  “With the slowdown in China and the Europe, the market is
still cautious and has no strong direction,” said Tim Leung,
who helps manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investments Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “In some cases the valuations are pretty attractive,
but the problem is there is no near term catalyst for the market
to rally.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks
advanced 0.2 percent to 9,385.15. HSBC cut its forecast for
China’s economic growth to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent this
year. The downgrade followed a cut by Citigroup Inc., which is
predicting the world’s second-largest economy will expand 7.8
percent.  Futures on Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index expiring this
month fell 0.1 percent to 18,937. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell
1.6 percent to 21.44, indicating options traders expect a swing
of about 6.1 percent on the gauge during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
