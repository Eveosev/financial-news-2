Asian currencies advanced after
housing data in the U.S. beat analysts’ forecasts, brightening
the outlook for the region’s exports as European leaders meet
this week to discuss ways to tackle the debt crisis.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, rose from
a three-week low after purchases of new homes in the U.S.
increased last month to the highest level since April 2010. The
 Philippine peso  gained the most in almost a week as a slide in
imports eroded demand for the U.S. currency.  “There was better-than-expected data in the U.S.,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. “The focus is still on the  euro zone ,” he said.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 42.47 per dollar as of
4:53 p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc, taking its
gain this quarter to 1.1 percent. Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.2
percent to 3.1957, South Korea’s won climbed 0.3 percent to
1,158.43 and Thailand’s baht strengthened 0.2 percent to 31.82.  Asian currencies declined this quarter with the exception
of the peso and yen as  Europe ’s financial crisis reduced demand
for emerging-market assets. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded
more Spanish banks yesterday as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
continued to oppose joint euro bonds to resolve the crisis as
officials prepare to meet in Brussels on June 28.  Rupee Leads Losses  India ’s rupee led losses in the quarter with a 11 percent
drop, touching a record low of 57.3275 per dollar on June 22. In
an effort to stem the decline, India’s government raised the
ceiling on overseas ownership of sovereign debt by $5 billion to
$20 billion yesterday. The currency weakened 0.2 percent today
to 57.1450.  The Asia Dollar Index has declined 2.3 percent since March
30. Its 60-day historical volatility dropped two basis points to
2.90 percent today and was 52 basis points lower than at the end
of the first quarter.  The Philippine currency gained today after an official
report showed imports fell 13.7 percent in April from a year
earlier, compared with a 3.3 percent contraction in March. The
trade deficit narrowed to $135 million from $1.05 billion.  “Manufacturers are still wary of stepping up purchases,”
said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .
“Ahead of the European summit, gains in Asian currencies are
going to be tentative.”  The baht rebounded from a three-week low after the
government said yesterday exports rose 7.68 percent in May from
a year earlier, beating the median forecast of 0.5 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey. Shipments fell 3.67 percent in April.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.990
against its U.S. counterpart, while the Vietnamese dong rose 0.1
percent to 20,895.  China ’s  yuan  was steady at 6.3629 and
Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.7 percent to 9,507.  To contact the reporters on this story:
