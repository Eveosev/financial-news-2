U.K. stocks  erased their earlier
gains as demand declined at an auction of Spanish debt.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index rose 0.94, or less than 0.1
percent, to 5,451.59 as of 9:58 a.m. in  London , having
previously increased as much as 0.4 percent. The gauge fell 3.1
percent over the previous three days. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index slipped less than 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index climbed 0.2 percent.  The FTSE 100 has declined 2.2 percent in the first half of
the year amid concern  Europe ’s debt Crisis is derailing global
growth. Stocks dropped yesterday on speculation this week’s
European Union summit won’t lead to decisive measures to contain
the debt crisis as German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  hardened her
resistance to debt sharing.  “Markets are getting jittery now ahead of the summit of EU
leaders at the end of this week and are wary they might be
disappointed with the outcome,” Michael Crowley, a Dublin-based
economist at Bank of Ireland Global Markets, wrote in a report.
“The most the summit is likely to do is outline possible steps
along the way towards creating the necessary construct to
support monetary union. The euro area is still likely to remain
in a crisis state for some time yet.”  Germany  will face an increasingly united bloc of euro-area
nations demanding more ambitious policies to help the currency
zone’s most debt-stricken members. The leaders of the 27 EU
states will attend pre-summit meetings as they work to narrow
their differences before the June 28-29 meeting.  Spanish borrowing costs jumped as the nation auctioned 3.08
billion euros ($3.85 billion) of bills today.  Spain  sold three-month bills at an average 2.362 percent,
compared with 0.846 percent at the last auction on May 22, and
six-month bills at an average rate of 3.237 percent, compared
with 1.737 percent last month. Demand for the three-month
securities was 2.6 times the amount sold, compared with 3.95
times in May, while the bid-to-cover ratio for the six-month
bills was 2.82 compared with 4.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
