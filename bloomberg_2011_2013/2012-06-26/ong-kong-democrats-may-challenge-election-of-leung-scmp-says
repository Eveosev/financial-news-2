Hong Kong’s Democratic Party plans
to ask the  High Court  to allow it to challenge the election of
Leung Chun-ying as the city’s new leader because he misled the
public about illegal structures at his home during his campaign,
the  South China Morning Post  reported today, citing Albert Ho,
the party’s chairman.  The party will ask the court to allow it to file an
election petition, a judicial review, or both, Ho said,
according to the report. In terms of the city’s laws, a petition
needs to be submitted within seven days of the election result
being declared, and a judicial review in fewer than 30 days, the
report said. The winner of the poll was announced on March 25.  The court may use discretion to accept late requests, Ho
said, according to the Morning Post.  The city’s Building Department last week found five
unauthorized structures at Leung’s house, the government said in
a June 22  statement . The chief executive-elect, who will take
office July 1, said yesterday that he was “disappointed in
himself” and was unaware that the structures were illegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
