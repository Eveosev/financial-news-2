Turkey ’s level-headed approach after
Syria shot down one of its warplanes over the Mediterranean
shouldn’t be misinterpreted for weakness, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said.  “Let our humility and level-headedness fool no one,”
Erdogan told his party in a speech at the parliament in Ankara.
“Turkey’s wrath is as harsh as its friendship is valuable.”  Turkey has referred the June 22 shooting, which it says
occurred over international waters and Syria says happened over
Syrian territory, to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which is meeting today to discuss a response.  Syria’s act was “hostile” and a brief violation of Syrian
airspace by the Turkish plane couldn’t justify the attack,
Erdogan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
