First Horizon National Corp. (FHN) ,
Tennessee’s largest bank by market share, advanced after saying
it was setting aside additional reserves to repurchase mortgages
from government-sponsored enterprises.  First Horizon climbed 3.8 percent to $8.21 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the biggest gain in almost three weeks. The Memphis-based
firm’s shares have climbed 2.6 percent this year, compared with
a 5 percent jump in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  First Horizon will take a $272 million charge in the second
quarter, primarily to repurchase mortgages from Fannie Mae and
 Freddie Mac , the lender said in a statement after yesterday’s
market close. The additional reserves, along with $161 million
set aside earlier, should cover current and future requests, the
firm said.  “We believe the event represents a significant milestone
in putting the GSE exposure behind them,” Compass Point
Research & Trading LLC analysts led by  Mike Turner  said today in
a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
