Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co. (900948) , the
biggest coal producer in the Chinese region bordering Mongolia,
is seeking as much as $1.1 billion in a reduced Hong Kong stock
offering, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg News.  Yitai Coal, which already has dollar-denominated  B shares 
listed in  Shanghai , is selling 162.7 million shares for HK$43
($5.54) to HK$53 each, the terms show. About $390 million of the
shares are already allocated to cornerstone investors including
 Datang International Power Generation Co. (991)  and Baosteel Resources
Co., the sales document shows.  The amount of stock being offered represents about 10
percent of Yitai Coal’s  enlarged capital , according to the
terms. An additional 24.4 million shares will be offered in the
overallotment option if there is sufficient demand. Yitai Coal
initially planned to raise $1.5 billion in  Hong Kong  and has cut
the size of its offering by almost a third.  Hong Kong equity offerings have decreased to their lowest
level since 2009 amid falling stock markets as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and  China ’s slowing economy hurt investor appetite for
new stock sales.  Inner Mongolia  has the biggest coal reserves among all
Chinese provinces, with about 700 billion tons at the end of
2008, according to the regional government’s  website .  Yitai Coal’s Shanghai-listed shares fell about 1 percent
this year as of yesterday’s closing price, giving it a market
value of $8.5 billion.  Yitai Coal is scheduled to start trading in Hong Kong on
July 12, the terms show.  BOC International Holdings Ltd. (3988) , China
International Capital Corp.,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  BNP Paribas
SA (BNP)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  are managing the sale, people with knowledge of
the transaction said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
