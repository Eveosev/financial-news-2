Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer, said it hired Ammar Al-Joundi as chief
financial officer. Al-Joundi is CFO at Toronto-based  Agnico-
Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM)   Al-Joundi’s appointment is effective July 10, Barrick said
in a statement today. Before joining Agnico-Eagle in September
2010, he worked at Barrick for 11 years, including as senior
vice president, finance.  Barrick said June 6 it appointed CFO Jamie Sokalsky as
chief executive officer, replacing Aaron Regent, after the
Toronto-based company was “disappointed” by its share price
performance.  Agnico-Eagle will “take the necessary time” to seek a
replacement for Al-Joundi, CEO Sean Boyd said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
