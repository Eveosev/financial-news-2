AS Tallinna Vesi (TVEAT) , Estonia’s biggest
water utility, said the country’s competition authority has
lodged an appeal against a tariff ruling favorable to the
company with the  Supreme Court .  The court has given the company until July 16 to respond
before it decides whether it will take the case, Vesi said in a
regulatory statement today. A Tallinn district court stated
earlier that the company’s tariffs are regulated by a public law
agreement rather than by an administrative act.  The ruling meant the competition watchdog has to prove that
Tallinna Vesi’s agreement with the municipality on providing
services damages a predominant public interest, otherwise
compensation can be claimed, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
