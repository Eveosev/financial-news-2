The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell from the most expensive in three weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 56.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:50 a.m.
in  London , from minus 58 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The measure reached 59 basis points on June 4, the
highest cost in 2 1/2 months.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 54 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros and is derived from a survey by the European Banking
Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to a gauge of overnight borrowing costs or overnight
indexed swaps -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were unchanged
at 27 basis points. The Euribor/Eonia OIS spread held at 43
basis points.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was unchanged at 22
basis points. The measure has held below the  European Central
Bank ’s deposit rate of 25 basis points for the seventh day.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, placing 750 billion euros ($938 billion) from 775
billion euros on June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
