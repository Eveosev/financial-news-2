Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, is reviewing a plan to sell oil and natural-gas
assets because the company wants to use gas for its operations
in  Brazil , said Vania Somavilla, Vale’s head of human resources
and sustainability.  “We are revising this in line with our strategy to keep
investments in gas,” Somavilla told reporters today in the city
of Moju. “We want to use gas because its a transition fuel.”  Vale hired banks including Citibank Inc. to sell its oil
and gas assets, and the banks are deciding on the best strategy
for its oil assets, Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira told
reporters.  Vale entered the hydrocarbon exploration business in Brazil
in 2007 and has stakes in both onshore and offshore blocks with
certified oil and gas resources equivalent to 210 million
barrels of oil, the company said in 2010.  The company said then it had 23 offshore blocks in 14
concessions in Brazil’s Santos, Espirito Santo and Para-Maranhao
basins and two onshore concessions in the Parnaiba basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
