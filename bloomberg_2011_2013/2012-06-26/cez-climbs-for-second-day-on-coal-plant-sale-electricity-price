CEZ AS (CEZ)  rose for a second day after
the biggest Czech utility said it agreed to sell one coal-fired
power plant to avoid an anti-monopoly fine and as the price of
electricity increased.  The shares climbed 1 percent to 739.5 koruna by the close
in Prague, paring losses so far this quarter to 7.4 percent. The
 PX (PX)  index of 14 stocks, in which CEZ has largest weighting at 20
percent, rose 0.7 percent to 884.1 today.  CEZ pledged to sell one power plant to settle a legal case
filed in 2009 by the European Commission, which was probing
whether the generator was blocking competitorsâ€™ access to the
power market, the company said in a statement today. Electricity
for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its
output, rose 0.7 percent to 48.85 euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
