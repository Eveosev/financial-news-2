Mol Nyrt. led gains in Hungary’s
stocks as German  consumer confidence  topped forecasts and U.S.
house prices fell at the slowest pace in more than a year,
boosting bets on recovery in the world economy.  The shares of Hungary’s largest refiner rose 1.9 percent to
15,880 forint by 4:17 p.m. in Budapest, paring its decline this
quarter to 13.7 percent. The benchmark BUX Index added 0.7
percent to 16,938.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
