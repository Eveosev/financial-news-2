New York Knicks  forward Amar’e Stoudemire was fined $50,000 by the  National Basketball
Association  for using a gay slur in a Twitter message.  Stoudemire, who had a $19.9 million salary last season, was
involved in an exchange with a Knicks fan on June 23 when he
used “offensive and derogatory language,” NBA executive vice
president of basketball operations Stu Jackson said.  Stoudemire received a Twitter message with an obscenity
from the fan and responded with a direct message that included
the slur. The message from Stoudemire became public when the
recipient re-tweeted it, leading Stoudemire to apologize in a
follow-up message.  Stoudemire previously made headlines when he cut his hand
and required surgery after punching a fire extinguisher case
following a playoff loss to the Miami Heat. The 6-foot-10
Stoudemire was the Knicks’ second-leading scorer last season,
averaging 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
