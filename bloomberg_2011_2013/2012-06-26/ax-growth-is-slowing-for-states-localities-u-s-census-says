Tax revenue growth slowed for U.S.
state and local governments during the first three months of
2012, showing lingering financial pressure three years after the
end of the recession.  The Census Bureau said today that the collections rose 1.5
percent during the quarter from a year earlier and revenue from
corporate income taxes dropped. The pace was down from 2.3
percent at the end of 2011 and 5 percent in the three months
through September, according to the Census data.  States, cities and counties are still struggling to recover
from an 18-month recession that battered their tax collections,
forcing officials to fire workers and cut spending when deficits
emerged in their budgets. The budget cutting has exerted a drag
on the nationâ€™s economic recovery, and even as tax collections
grow, governments have been hesitant to increase spending.  State and local government property tax collections
remained steady during the first quarter at $114.6 billion, the
Census Bureau said. Localities, which rely on real estate taxes,
saw them drop 0.9 percent from a year earlier to $110.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
