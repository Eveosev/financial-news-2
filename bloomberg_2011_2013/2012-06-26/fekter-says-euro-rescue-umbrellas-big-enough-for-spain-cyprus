Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the European Union rescue mechanisms will be big
enough for Spain and Cyprus.  “The rescue umbrellas that we opened will solve both
cases,” Fekter told reporters in Vienna today when asked if the
latest bailouts were affordable.  Regarding Greece Fekter said that next steps would have to
wait for the latest report from the so-called troika, comprised
of officials from the EU,  European Central Bank  and
International Monetary Fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
