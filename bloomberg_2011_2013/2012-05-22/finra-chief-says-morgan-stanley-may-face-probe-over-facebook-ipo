Morgan Stanley could face regulatory
scrutiny over claims that an analyst shared negative news about
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  with institutional investors before that firm’s
initial public offering last week, according to the head of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “If true, the allegations are a matter of regulatory
concern” to the industry-funded brokerage watchdog and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Finra Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Richard Ketchum said today in an e-mail.  Ketchum commented in response to a news report that an
analyst for Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter for the IPO,
lowered a Facebook revenue forecast after the social-networking
company said growth in mobile products could hurt its business.
Such a move could come under scrutiny from regulators if the
warning was only provided to institutional investors.  Finra’s chief didn’t say whether his Washington-based
agency is investigating  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   John Nester , a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
