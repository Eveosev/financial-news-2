Treasuries fell as investors
speculated the slide in 10-year yields to almost record lows was
difficult to sustain before European leaders meet tomorrow in
Brussels to address the region’s fiscal crisis.  U.S. 10-year note yields rose for a third day, the longest
streak in two months, before the U.S. auctions $99 billion in
debt starting today. Sales of existing homes in the U.S.
increased more than forecast in April. The central bank sold
$8.6 billion of Treasuries due from March to September 2013,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s  website .  “We were severely overbought,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The
market has only been able to be long because of the headline
risk in  Europe . You get to levels where you just can’t sustain
those moves, and we’re at those levels. There’s hope in Europe
with the meeting tomorrow.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.79 percent at 11:03 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 declined 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 19/32.  The yield dropped to 1.6886 percent on May 17, approaching
the record low 1.6714 percent set Sept. 23. It declined 12 basis
points last week.  Note Sale  The U.S. plans to sell $35 billion of two-year notes today,
the same amount of five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of
seven-year securities on May 24.  Two-year notes yielded 0.31 percent in pre-auction trading,
compared with 0.27 percent at the previous sale on April 24.
Investors  bid  for 3.76 times the amount of available debt in
April, the most since November at the monthly auctions.  Indirect bidders,  the category of buyers that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 32.1 percent at the last sale,
the lowest level since December.  “Twos will go fine,” said Jason Rogan, managing director
of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New
York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “At the end
of the day, Europe has been more willing to talk than act. Maybe
tomorrow will be more talk about solutions rather than enacting
anything.”  The two-year notes yielded 23 basis points more than
similar-maturity securities in  Germany . The  spread  reached a
quarter percentage point on May 17, the most in almost two
years.  European Union leaders are scheduled to meet tomorrow in
Brussels amid speculation  Greece  will quit the euro. They plan
to address the region’s fiscal crisis, damping demand for the
safest securities.  Purchases of previously owned houses, tabulated when a
contract closes, increased 3.4 percent to a 4.62 million annual
rate, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a rise to a 4.61 million rate.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents expectations
for the rate of inflation during the life of the securities,
increased for a third day. It climbed to as much as 2.21
percentage points today, the most since May 8.  Yield Forecast  The yield on the 10-year note will end the year at 2.4
percent, according to the median forecast of 68 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  UBS AG, one of the 21 primary dealers that deal directly
with the Fed, trimmed its forecast for the benchmark 10-year
yield to 2.4 percent by year-end from 2.7 percent on May 14,
based on figures provided yesterday for a Bloomberg survey by
Sophie Constable, an analyst in  London .  Volatility yesterday dropped to 69.1 basis points from 70.6
basis points on May 18, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury price swings based
on options. The gauge is below the one-year average of 87.94
basis points.  Trading volume dropped yesterday to the lowest since May
11. About $166 billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker. The average in 2012
is $242 billion. Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the
highest since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
