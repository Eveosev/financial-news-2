EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , Greece’s
second-biggest bank, said the failure of a proposed merger with
 Alpha Bank SA (ALPHA)  is incompatible with efforts to recapitalize the
Greek banking system.  “The cancellation of the merger means the loss of
synergies worth as much as 800 million euros ($1.02 billion) a
year which would have mitigated losses from the writedown on
holdings of Greek debt held by the two banks,” Athens-based
Eurobank said today in an e-mailed statement.  Alpha shareholders today approved the bank’s proposal to
cancel the merger with Eurobank, according to a filing to the
Athens bourse from the bank.  “The new entity that would have been formed by the merger
would now need 9 billion euros in extra capital and that would
have resulted in the nationalization of the bank,” Yiannis Costopoulos, president and chief exectuvie officer of Alpha,
 Greece ’s third-largest lender, told the bank’s shareholders
today in Athens.  To contact the reporters on this story:
