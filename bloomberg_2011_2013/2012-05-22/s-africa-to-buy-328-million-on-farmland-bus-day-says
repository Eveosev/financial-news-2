The South African  government  plans to
spend 2.7 billion rand ($328 million) buying more than 320,000
hectares of farmland to distribute to black farmers,  Business
Day  said, citing Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti.  An additional 1.2 billion rand will be spent on strategic
support to 416 new farmers, targeting farms lying unused after
being transferred to black farmers, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper quoted Nkwinti saying.  -- Editors: Ana Monteiro, Ben Holland  To contact the reporter on this story:
