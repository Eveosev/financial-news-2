Honolulu, a vacation draw for its
beaches and weather, was the most-congested U.S. city in 2011,
dethroning  Los Angeles , an Inrix Inc. study found.  Drivers in the city, the state of Hawaii’s largest, wasted
an average of 58 hours stuck in traffic last year, compared with
56 hours in Los Angeles, according the  Inrix National Traffic
Scorecard , released today. Honolulu jumped to No. 1, from No. 37
a year earlier, because of a change in the way Inrix counted
congestion, said Jim Bak, co-author.  “We’ve shifted to focus on travel time for individual
drivers, rather than overall congestion,” Bak said in a
telephone interview. “L.A. has 15 times more people and 20
times the roadways of Honolulu, so at the system level, it
obviously has much greater overall congestion.”  Congestion across the U.S. eased about 30 percent in 2011,
the result of sluggish economic growth, according to the study.
The decline was the steepest since 2008, when congestion fell 34
percent, according to Kirkland, Washington-based Inrix, a
provider of traffic data-services to clients such as Ford Motor
Co., MapQuest Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   Following Honolulu and Los Angeles in urban congestion were
 San Francisco ;  New York ; Bridgeport, Connecticut;  Washington ;
Seattle; Austin, Texas; Boston; and  Chicago . Los Angeles and New
York each had four of the 10 most-congested traffic corridors in
the U.S., according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
