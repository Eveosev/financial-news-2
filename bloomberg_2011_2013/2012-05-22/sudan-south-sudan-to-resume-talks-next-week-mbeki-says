Sudan  and South Sudan will resume
talks next week that were suspended after fighting in a border
area in April, African Union mediator Thabo Mbeki said.  The new round of talks will “look at all decisions made by
the African Union and  Security Council ,” Mbeki told reporters
yesterday in Khartoum.  The  United Nations Security Council  threatened in a May 2
resolution to impose sanctions against the two countries unless
they stopped fighting and resumed talks by May 16. Both
countries have accepted the African Union’s “road map” for
negotiations, which was strengthened by a Security Council
resolution calling on them to cease border hostilities and
return to talks.  Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since
 South Sudan  seceded from Sudan in July after a popular
referendum on independence intended to end a long-running civil
war. The south kept three-quarters of the formerly united
country’s oil output of about 490,000 barrels a day.  Tensions between the countries exploded last month when
South Sudan occupied the contested, oil-rich area of Heglig. It
pulled troops out 10 days later, saying it was complying with a
Security Council request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
