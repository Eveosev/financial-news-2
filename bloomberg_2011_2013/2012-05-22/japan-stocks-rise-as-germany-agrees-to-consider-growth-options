Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its biggest gain in five weeks, as
Germany said it will consider all ideas to boost euro-area
growth and  China  pledged to bolster its economy.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets more than a fifth of
its revenue from Europe, climbed 2 percent.  Fanuc (6954)  Corp. a
producer of robotics for Chinese factories, jumped 3.7 percent.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest oil explorer by market value,
gained 2.7 percent after crude prices advanced yesterday for the
first time in seven days.  “Investors are getting less pessimistic,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan’s fifth-
largest lender by market value. “Shares declined sharply on
concern the Chinese economy is slowing down and Greece may exit
the euro, but there’s pressure from the markets to keep the
situation from worsening.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.1 percent to 8,729.29
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the steepest increase since April
18. Volume on the gauge was 13 percent less than the 30-day
average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index gained 1.1 percent to 733.33,
with more than twice as many shares advancing as falling.  The Topix has plunged 16 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political gridlock in
Greece after an inconclusive election this month reignited
concern the nation will renege on austerity pledges required for
240 billion euros ($307 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today. The gauge gained 1.6 percent in New York
yesterday, the biggest rally since March 13, after Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged to focus more on bolstering growth.  China Indicators  A leading index for China released today rose in April at
the same pace as the prior month, offering investors some
comfort that the world’s second-biggest economy may avoid a
deeper slowdown.  Fanuc jumped 3.7 percent to 13,530 yen. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co., an excavator maker that gets almost
a fifth of its sales from China, climbed 2.6 percent to 1,540
yen.  “Stimulus measures by China, a country with the world’s
No. 2 gross domestic product, is positive for the world
economy,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co. “China may stimulate the economy or
markets as the nation’s exports are getting sluggish due to the
European economic slowdown.”  Germany Eyes Growth  Shares also climbed after German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  put renewed emphasis on growth in the euro zone as the
region’s governments grapple with Greek support for parties
opposed to austerity measures and bailouts. Schauble said
 Germany  and France agreed to do “everything necessary” to
ensure Greece remains in Europe’s single currency.  Nikon rose 2 percent to 2,201 yen. Shimano Inc., a maker of
bicycle parts that gets almost 40 percent of its sales in
Europe, added 1.5 percent to 4,625 yen.  The yen remained weaker as the  Bank of Japan  opened a two-
day meeting today amid speculation the central bank will boost
stimulus measures to support growth. The bank expanded its
asset-purchase program in February and April.  The yen depreciated to as low as 79.49 against the dollar
today, compared with 79.26 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 101.77
from 101.34. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Inpex Rallies  Energy stocks climbed, with Inpex rallying 2.7 percent to
465,500 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the nation’s
second-largest oil explorer by market value, rose 1.8 percent to
3,030 yen.  Crude oil for June delivery gained for the first time in
seven days in  New York  yesterday, rising 1.2 percent to settle
at $92.57 a barrel, its biggest advance since May 1.  Among companies that declined, Terumo Corp. lost 2.7
percent to 2,958 yen, the most in the Nikkei 225. The medical
tool maker’s shares fell after the Mainichi newspaper reported
Olympus Corp. is unlikely to seek a capital alliance for the
time being. Terumo was among companies that made an offer, the
report said, citing an unidentified executive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
