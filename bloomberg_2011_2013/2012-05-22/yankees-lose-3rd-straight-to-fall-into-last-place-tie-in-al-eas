The  New York Yankees  lost their third
straight home game to fall into a tie with the Boston Red Sox
for last place in the American League East division.  Felipe Paulino and two relievers held the Yankees to seven
hits as the Kansas City Royals won 6-0,  New York ’s sixth loss in
its past seven Major League Baseball games.  The Yankees went 0-for-13 with runners in scoring position
last night in a light rain as some of their fans booed at Yankee
Stadium.  “Our fans are passionate and they want us to win,”
Yankees manager Joe Girardi told reporters in the locker room
after the game. “And I understand that. So do the guys in that
room. If they’re unhappy with us, believe me, we’re probably
unhappier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
