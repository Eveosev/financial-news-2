HUK-Coburg Holding AG,  Allianz SE ’s
main competitor in the unprofitable German car-insurance market,
said profit fell 38 percent last year as the sovereign debt
crisis hurt investment income.  Net income declined to 199 million euros ($255 million)
last year from 319 million euros a year ago, the Coburg-based,
mutually owned insurer said in a statement today. Investment
income slid 17 percent to 797 million euros on writedowns on
equities and  government bonds .  Motor coverage, the biggest non-life insurance segment in
 Germany  with about 20 billion euros in premiums, has been
unprofitable since companies stepped up price cuts to win
business, starting in 2005. HUK said its gross premium income
rose 4.6 percent to 5.29 billion euros and it insured 160,000
more vehicles during the first four months of the year.  “Thanks to our broad risk provisioning, improved
investment income is possible in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Weiler said at a press conference in Munich today.
“It’s hard to predict how  capital markets  will develop in light
of the government debt crisis.”  HUK-Coburg took the top spot among German car insurers from
Munich-based  Allianz  in 2010. At the end of last year, Allianz
 covered  8.12 million vehicles in Germany,  Europe ’s largest auto-
insurance market. That trailed the 8.99 million vehicles covered
by HUK-Coburg at the end of 2011, which was up 3.6 percent from
a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
