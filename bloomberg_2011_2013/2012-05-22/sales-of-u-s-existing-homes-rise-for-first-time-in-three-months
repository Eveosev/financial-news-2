Sales of  existing  U.S. homes rose in
April, driven by broad-based gains in demand that signal the
market is stabilizing.  Purchases, tabulated when a contract closes, increased 3.4
percent to a 4.62 million annual rate, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed today in  Washington . The median
price jumped by the most in six years.  Owner-occupied properties are taking over from all-cash
deals by investors snapping up distressed houses, the agent’s
group said. Employment gains, depressed prices and record-low
 mortgage rates  may bring more dwellings within reach of
Americans, eliminating a source of weakness for the world’s
largest economy just as risks from  Europe ’s debt crisis climb.  “We are making incremental progress,” said  Millan Mulraine , a senior U.S. strategist at TD Securities Inc. in New
York, who correctly forecast the sales pace. “People are
becoming more confident about job prospects and about taking on
mortgages. This is all positive for the economy.”  Stocks erased gains on concern that  Greece  was making
preparations to exit the euro. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,316.63 at the close in  New York .
The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilder index climbed 1.9 percent.  The April sales pace was in line with the 4.61 million
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates of the 73
economists ranged from 4.47 million to 4.8 million. The prior
month’s pace was revised to 4.47 million, from a previously
reported 4.48 million. April’s total was just shy of the 4.63
million reached in January that was the highest in almost two
years.  Europe and Asia  Elsewhere, U.K. consumer prices climbed 3 percent in April
from a year earlier after a 3.5 percent gain in the 12 months
ended in March, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
 London . The rate is within the government’s boundaries for the
first time since February 2010.  Japan ’s foreign investments and assets, meantime, grew to
the second-highest level on record as companies used the
stronger yen to make acquisitions abroad.  The U.S. real estate market’s improvement has been slow to
evolve. Existing-home sales climbed to 4.26 million last year
from 4.19 million in 2010. Demand peaked at 7.1 million in 2005
during the housing boom. In 2008, sales totaled 4.11 million,
the least since 1995. Resales may rise to a 4.6 million to 4.7
million range this year and reach as much as 4.8 million in
2013, the Realtors group projected this month.  “We are breaking out,”  Lawrence Yun , NAR chief economist,
said in a news conference today as the figures were released.
“With each passing month, there is  job creation . Affordability
has been very high. This is a very good combination.”  Median Price  The median price of an existing home climbed 10 percent to
$177,400 from $161,100 in April 2011, today’s report showed. It
was the biggest year-to-year gain since January 2006 and
reflected a seasonal mix in demand toward bigger houses and
fewer distressed sales, Yun said.  Families return to the market at this time before the start
of a new school year, pushing up demand, he said. Cash
transactions, distressed properties and investors accounted for
a smaller share of all purchases last month, he said.  Purchases improved in all four regions, led by a 5.1
percent gain in the Northeast.  The number of previously owned homes on the market climbed
9.5 percent to 2.54 million. At the current sales pace, it would
take 6.6 months to sell those houses compared with 6.2 months in
March. April is usually the peak, or close to the peak, month
for inventory for the year, Yun said.  Single-Family Homes  Sales of existing single-family homes increased 3 percent
to an annual rate of 4.09 million, while those of multifamily
properties, including condominiums and townhouses, rose 6
percent to a 530,000 pace.  The group’s affordability index, which is based on a
combination of resale prices,  household income  and mortgage
rates, reached a record high in the first quarter, a report this
month showed.  Borrowing costs remain attractive. The average rate on a
30-year fixed mortgage fell to an all-time low of 3.79 percent
in the week ended May 17, according to data from  Freddie Mac 
going back to 1971. The average 15-year rate dropped to 3.04
percent, also a record low, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-
 finance company  said.  Rising employment and incomes may provide more support for
housing. The  unemployment rate  fell in April to a three-year low
of 8.1 percent as employers added 115,000 jobs, according to
Labor Department figures.  Pulte Orders  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
said orders rose 15 percent to 4,991 homes in its first quarter,
and backlogs increased 12 percent to 5,798 homes.  “It was the first quarter in several years that
fundamental demand came in stronger than expected,”  Richard Dugas , chief executive officer of the Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan-based company, said during an April 26 conference call
with analysts. “We are pleased with how the year has started
off, including a continuation of better sales activity thus far
in April.”  Foreclosure filings  fell to a five-year low in April as
lenders sought to avoid seizing property. The number of default,
auction and seizure notices sent to homeowners totaled 188,780
last month, down 14 percent from a year earlier and 5 percent
from March, according to RealtyTrac Inc.  To contact the report on this story:
