Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  analyst Richard Smith was named the best head of a European equity research
department covering the biggest stocks in a poll by Sammons
Associates, a London-based recruitment firm.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Paul Huxford ranked second and Terry Sinclair of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  was third. Charles Hall of Peel Hunt
LLP topped the ranking of the best heads of small- and mid-
capitalization equity-research departments.  The results are drawn from a survey of institutional fund
managers in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, Sammons
Associates said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The last year has been very challenging for the
industry,” Sammons Chairman Jonathan Evans said in the
statement. “Despite this, the heads of research have maintained
their levels of excellence in equity research for when the
markets return.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
