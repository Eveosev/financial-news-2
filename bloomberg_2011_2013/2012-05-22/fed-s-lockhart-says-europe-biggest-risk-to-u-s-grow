President  Dennis Lockhart  said the European debt crisis poses
the biggest risk to his prediction for a modest U.S. economic
expansion and gradual employment growth.  “I currently judge the risks to the U.S. outlook as tilted
modestly to the downside,” Lockhart said today in a speech in
 Hong Kong  that repeated remarks by him in  Tokyo  yesterday.
“Chief among them is the potential for broad spillover from
 Europe  to the U.S. and global economy resulting from financial
system disruption as well as further economic slowdown.”  Lockhart reiterated his view that policy makers need to
retain the option of starting a new round of bond buying to spur
the expansion, while saying such a move is unnecessary now.
Several Fed policy makers said a loss of momentum in growth or
increased risks to their economic outlook could warrant
additional action to keep the recovery going, minutes of their
April 24-25 meeting showed last week.  The Atlanta Fed president, in response to questions, said
yesterday that more easing may be necessary “if there is a
severe deterioration in the  U.S. economy  as evidenced by rising
unemployment that is the result of real job loss as opposed to
simply rising participation.”  Lockhart, 65, a former Georgetown University professor, has
led the Atlanta Fed since 2007. The Atlanta Fed district
includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and portions of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Tennessee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
