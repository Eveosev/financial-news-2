The South African Rugby Football
Union said it plans to introduce the sport at 1,000 junior
schools over the next three years in an effort to produce more
top black players.  “For us, it’s about overcoming a legacy of apartheid,
which saw the majority of our people not being exposed to the
game of rugby,” Oregan Hoskins, the union’s president, told
lawmakers in Cape Town today. “We are starting at the bottom of
the pyramid and working our way up. We see that as the only way
to get true transformation.”  While the governing body has spent more than 500 million
rand ($61 million) on development and transformation programs
since 1992, the upper echelons of the sport have remained
dominated by whites since the end of white segregationist rule
18 years ago. Just 51 black players have been selected to play
for the Springboks.  More black players would increase options for the selectors
of the national team, which trails  New Zealand ’s All Blacks and
 Australia ’s Wallabies in world rankings. About 79 percent of
 South Africa ’s 50.6 million people are black, 9 percent are
white and the balance is of mixed race or of Indian or Asian
descent, according to the government statistics agency.  South African rugby has undergone a major transformation at
school and club level, with black players accounting for 57
percent of the 322,689 participants in the under-11 to under-19
leagues, SARFU said in a written presentation. High schools play
a key role in nurturing rugby talent, with half of all
Springboks emanating from just 39 schools, it said.  The union intends to spend more than 72 million rand on
rugby development this year, including 10.1 million rand on
identifying and developing elite players, and 6.8 million rand
on coaching development. It plans to extend its school
development program to more than 400 high schools between 2016
and 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
