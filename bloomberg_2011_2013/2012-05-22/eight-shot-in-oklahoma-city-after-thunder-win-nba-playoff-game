Eight people were shot last night in
 Oklahoma City  about 10 minutes after the Thunder beat the  Los
Angeles Lakers  at Chesapeake Energy Arena to advance in the
National Basketball Association playoffs.  All the victims were hospitalized and one remains in
critical condition,  Oklahoma City Police Department  Captain
Dexter Nelson said in a telephone interview. A pregnant woman
was also treated for blunt trauma after the incident, which
occurred in the Bricktown district of Oklahoma City, a club and
restaurant area located a few blocks east of the arena, he said.  “Shortly after the Thunder-Lakers game a large crowd of
people were moving toward parking lots and the Bricktown area,
and there was some type of an altercation or scuffle between
some people in the crowd,” Nelson said. “At least one subject
pulled out a weapon and fired into the crowd.”  The Thunder beat the Lakers 106-90 to close the best-of-
seven second-round NBA postseason series in five games. Nelson
said police were unsure if the people involved in the incident
had attended the game or if the altercation was basketball
related.  The shooting occurred around 11:35 p.m. central time,
Nelson said. The game ended around 11:22 p.m.  Police don’t have a suspect in custody as of this morning,
Nelson said.  Information regarding the ages and genders of the victims
haven’t been disclosed, Nelson said. Aside from the one victim
in critical condition, all others were treated for non-life-
threatening injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
