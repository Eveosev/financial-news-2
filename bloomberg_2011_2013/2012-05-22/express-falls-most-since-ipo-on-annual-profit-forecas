Express Inc. (EXPR) , the apparel retailer
targeting 20- to 30-year-olds, fell the most since its market
debut two years ago after forecasting full-year profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Express dropped 25 percent to $17.22 at 1:03 p.m. in New
York, the biggest intraday decline since May 2010. The stock was
the second-worst  performer  in the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   The retailer, based in Columbus,  Ohio , has been expanding
while shuttering less profitable stores and its updated annual
outlook reflects certain non-cash expenses from delays in
opening two flagship locations in  San Francisco  and New York,
according to a statement today.  “We had anticipated these locations would open ahead of
holiday 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Weiss said on a
conference  call . “We now plan to open both flagship stores in
fall 2013, possibly sooner.”  Express projected profit excluding certain items of $1.79
to $1.89 this year. Analysts had estimated $1.95, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Express, which spent more on new initiatives and sourcing
costs in the first quarter and on a  loyalty program  for U.S.
stores, aims to end the year with 627 locations from 606 at the
end of the first quarter, according to the statement.  The company was controlled by private-equity firm Golden
Gate Capital beginning in 2007 until May 2010, when the company
raised $272 million by selling 16 million shares at $17 each.
The retailer brought in $2.07 billion in sales last year, with
about 65 percent coming from women’s merchandise and the
remainder from men’s.  First-quarter  net income  rose to $42.1 million, or 47 cents
per share, from $35 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier.
Analysts had projected profit of 49 cents a share, according to
a Bloomberg survey.  The retailer reported first-quarter sales of $496 million,
a 6 percent increase from a year earlier, according to today’s
statement. Analysts had estimated $503.1 million in the
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
