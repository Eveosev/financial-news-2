Tanzania, which vies with  Mali  to be
 Africa ’s third-biggest gold producer, posted a 44 percent
increase in earnings from exports of the metal in the year
through February, the central bank said.  Revenue from shipments increased $2.3 billion from $1.6
billion in the same period a year earlier, the Dar es Salaam-
based bank said in a statement on its website today. Exports of
gold and tourism receipts helped increase total exports to $6.8
billion from $6.1 billion, offsetting a decline in agricultural-
commodity exports, it said.  Imports increased 39 percent to $12.6 billion as the
country bought more oil to feed its thermal-power generators.
The bank also attributed the increase to purchases of machinery
for oil- and gas-exploration projects.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Ophir
Energy Plc (OPHR) , both based in  London , this month announced
discoveries of natural gas off the Tanzanian coast that may take
the country’s resources to 50 trillion cubic feet.  The deficit on the East African nation’s current account,
the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, widened to
$5.2 billion in the period from $2.2 billion previously, it
said. Reserves amounted to $3.5 billion, sufficient to cover 3.7
months of projected imports, while the country’s external debt
stood at $9.8 billion.  Following are agricultural exports in the 12 months through
February over the past two years:
