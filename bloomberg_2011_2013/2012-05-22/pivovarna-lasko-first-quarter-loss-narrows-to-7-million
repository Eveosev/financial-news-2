Pivovarna Lasko Group d.d. ,
Slovenia’s biggest drinks company, said its first-quarter loss
narrowed on lower interest payments after the disposal of
assets.  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR) ’s net loss was 5.5 million euros ($7
million), compared with 7.5 million euros a year earlier, the
Lasko, Slovenia-based company said in a regulatory filing.
Revenue dropped 16 percent to 56.2 million euros.  The company, which last month agreed with banks in Slovenia
to delay for a year about 160 million euros of maturing loans,
sold its juice-making unit Fructal d.d. to  Serbia ’s Nectar
d.o.o. last year. The transaction lowered interest payments by
11 percent from a year earlier, Lasko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
