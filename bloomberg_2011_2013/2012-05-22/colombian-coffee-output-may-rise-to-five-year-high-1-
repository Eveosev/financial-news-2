Colombia , the world’s second-largest
coffee supplier after  Brazil , said output is forecast to rise to
its highest in five years in 2013 because of drier weather.  Output may rise to 9 million bags from about 7.8 million
bags expected this year, Luis Munoz, chief executive officer of
 Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers , said in Bogota
after a news conference today. That would be the most since 11.5
million bags in 2008, according to the coffee federation’s data.  The crop will improve in the second half of 2012 from the
first six months of the year, when plants were damaged by heavy
rainfall, Munoz told reporters. A weather pattern, known as La
Nina, that brought above-average rainfall to Colombia has ended,
President  Juan Manuel Santos  said May 4.  Coffee futures have fallen 33 percent in a year as traders
forecast a bigger crop in Brazil, the largest producer of
Arabica beans favored by brewers such as Starbucks Corp.  Each bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
