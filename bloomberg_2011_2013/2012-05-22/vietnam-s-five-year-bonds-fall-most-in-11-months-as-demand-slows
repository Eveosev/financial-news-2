Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell the
most in more than 11 months on speculation demand slowed after
yields fell to a three-year low. The dong was steady.  Yields on benchmark debt dropped 306 basis points in 2012
to 9.49 percent on May 15, the lowest level since June 2009,
after regulatory restrictions on lending prompted banks to
invest surplus cash in government debt.  “Banks don’t see that yields will go down much further in
the short term, so they’re now in a position to take profit,”
said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at  Ho Chi
Minh City Securities Corp. (HCM)   Five-year bond  yields  rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 9.66 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest jump
since June 9, 2011.  The dong was at 20,847 per dollar, compared with 20,850
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State
Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
