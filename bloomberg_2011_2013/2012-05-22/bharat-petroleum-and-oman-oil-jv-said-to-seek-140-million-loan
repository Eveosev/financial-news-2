Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd. (BORL) , a joint
venture between  Bharat Petroleum  Corp. and Oman Oil Co., hired
Deutsche Bank AG to arrange a $140 million, eight-year loan,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The loan pays a margin of 345 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate and a fee of 1.5 percent for commitments
of $25 million or more, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private. The facility, which
has been in syndication for about three weeks, has attracted
about $175 million in pledges so far from six banks, the person
said. The loan is guaranteed by Bharat Petroleum.  Bharat Petroleum finance director S. Varadarajan didnâ€™t
answer two calls to his mobile phone seeking comment on the
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
