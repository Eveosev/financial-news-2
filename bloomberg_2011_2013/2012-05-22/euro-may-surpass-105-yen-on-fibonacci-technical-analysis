The euro may rebound to the highest
level in almost three weeks against the yen, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch, citing trading patterns.  “In the short term, the euro has scope to strengthen
beyond the 105 yen level, near the 50 percent retracement from
its high in March,” said  Tomoko Fujii , a Tokyo-based senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of America, without
specifying the time frame. She cited Fibonacci analysis, which
is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain
percentages after reaching a high or low.  The 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro’s decline
from its March 21 high of 111.44 yen to the low of 100.21 yen on
May 18 is at 105.82, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That would be the strongest level since May 3.  Europe ’s common currency has fallen more than 8 percent
versus its Japanese counterpart since the end of March amid
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  The euro slid 0.1 percent to 101.32 yen as of 8:39 a.m. in
 Tokyo  from yesterday’s close in  New York .  “The euro is looking oversold,” said Fujii. Its 14-day
relative strength index against the Japanese currency was at 31,
near the 30 level some traders see as signaling an asset may
reverse declines, after dropping to 23 on May 17.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
