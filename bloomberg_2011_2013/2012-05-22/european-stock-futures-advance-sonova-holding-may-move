European stock futures climbed,
indicating the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will rise for a second
day, amid speculation  China  and the euro area will do more to
bolster economic growth. U.S. index futures were little changed,
while Asian shares rose.  Rio Tinto Group may lead mining shares higher.  Sonova
Holding AG (SOON)  might be active after reporting full-year earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates.  CRH Plc (CRH)  may move after the
shares were upgraded at Credit Suisse Group AG.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June gained
0.7 percent to 2,155 at 7:09 a.m. in London. Futures on the FTSE
100 Index expiring the same month rose 0.7 percent. Contracts on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index jumped 1.4 percent.  “Some traders may be getting their hopes up on stories
that euro bonds will make an appearance on the agenda at this
Wednesday’s European Union summit, but given Germany’s resolute
opposition to such a move this may be wishful thinking and any
gains short lived,” Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at Capital
Spreads in  London , wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
