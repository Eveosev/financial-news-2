Hoku Corp. (HOKU)  hired Imperial Capital LLC
to restructure its debts as the supplier of solar products cut
jobs at an Idaho plant and closed a U.S. unit that sells solar
panels.  Imperial will help restructure about $278.8 million in
current liabilities, including $74.4 million of accounts payable
at Hoku Materials, a unit that manufactures polysilicon, the
company said today in a statement.  Hoku, based in Honolulu,  Hawaii , fired about 100 employees
at the unit’s polysilicon plant in Pocatello, Idaho, where
construction was halted in April. Unpaid construction payments
have led some lienholders to begin foreclosure proceedings,
according to the statement. The company also eliminated all
staff at its Tianwei Solar USA Inc. unit, which sold solar
panels made by Hoku’s parent company Tianwei New Energy Holdings
Co. Ltd.  China Merchants Bank Co. Ltd. has provided a loan to Hoku
to fund working capital while it restructures, though it is
“insufficient to pay down current liabilities, resume
construction, or start commercial operations,”  Scott Paul ,
Hoku’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Hoku’s other unit that installs solar energy systems, Hoku
Solar, is a “standalone business” and will not be affected by
the restructuring, Paul said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
