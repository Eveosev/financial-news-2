Peter Altmaier ,  Germany ’s environment
minister, should immediately begin to revise Germany’s renewable
energy law EEG “fundamentally,” Stephan Kohler, head of the
state-owned Dena Energy Agency, told Berliner Zeitung.  Politicians should establish a timetable for the energy
policy and federal ministries and the individual states should
agree on how to share responsibilities, the newspaper cited
Kohler as saying. A coordinator would be required, Kohler told
Berliner Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
