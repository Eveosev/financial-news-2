Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL) , a partner in
Israel’s Tamar natural gas field, dropped to the lowest in
almost six months after the utilities regulator asked for a gas
contract to be re-opened to adjust costs.  Delek Drilling  fell  2.7 percent to 12.55 shekels, the
lowest intraday level since Nov. 30, at 10:14 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
 Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL) , another partner in the field,
 retreated  2.8 percent to 2.291 shekels, the lowest intraday
level since Dec. 22. Isramco Negev 2 LP declined 2.3 percent to
0.508 shekels.  Israel’s Public Utilities Authority said Israel Electric
Corp. and the Tamar gas field partners will have to reopen their
contract to change costs, according to a statement published
yesterday on the authority’s website. The contract gives the
partners a monopoly over gas supply for several years and could
lead to excessive costs to consumers, the authority said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
