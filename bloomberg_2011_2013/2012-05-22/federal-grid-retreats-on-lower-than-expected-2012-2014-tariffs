Federal Grid Co. dropped after
 Russia ’s high-voltage power transmission monopoly said the
government will raise prices the state company charges less than
forecast.  Federal Grid fell 3 percent to 22.28 kopeks by 1:03 p.m. in
Moscow, the biggest decliner on the Micex Index and the steepest
intraday drop since May 18. The shares have retreated 21 percent
this year. The Micex lost 0.2 percent today to 1,295.37.  Russia’s Federal Tariff Service has confirmed an 11 percent
increase in Federal Grid power tariffs under the so-called
regulatory asset base, or RAB, starting July 1, the company said
today in a statement. Rates will rise 9.4 percent in July 2013
and by the same amount the following year, according to the
statement.  “The proposed tariff hikes are significantly below the
previous tariff proposal, which stipulated growth of 26-27
percent,” UralSib Capital analysts led by Matvey Taits said in
an e-mailed report today. “We estimate that the company could
lose 13 percent of the 2012-14 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization forecast by us. The lower-than-
expected tariffs jeopardize the implementation of the capex
program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
