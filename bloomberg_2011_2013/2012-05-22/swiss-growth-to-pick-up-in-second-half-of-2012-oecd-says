The  Swiss economy  will gather
strength in the second half of the year, paving the way for a
normalization in  interest rates  in 2013, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Swiss gross domestic product may rise 0.9 percent this year
and 1.9 percent in 2013, the Paris-based OECD said today.
Consumer prices are expected to drop 0.5 percent this year
before rising 0.1 percent in 2013, while the  jobless rate  is
seen declining for a third straight year in 2013 to 3.7 percent,
according to the group.  Switzerland ’s economy is showing some signs of recovery
after the central bank last year lowered its benchmark  interest
rate  to zero and imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro
to help protect exporters and ward of the threat of deflation.
 Consumer confidence  increased in April and the KOF leading
economic indicator jumped to a six-month high.  “Growth is expected to pick up from the second half of
2012 onward on the back of strengthening activity in
Switzerland’s main trading partners, and unemployment is
projected to decline slowly,” the OECD said. The  Swiss National
Bank ’s “policy rate may need to rise gradually in 2013.”  Consumer spending  may rise 1.2 percent this year and 1.6
percent in 2013, with exports of goods and services seen
increasing 1.4 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, according
to the latest OECD estimates. Gross fixed investment will
probably increase 2.8 percent in 2012 and 3.8 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
