Turkey’s request to purchase U.S.
Predator drones is bogged down in Congress, with some members
blocking sales as President  Barack Obama  pushes for approval,
Turkish President  Abdullah Gul  said.  Fighter jets such as  F-35 s and F-16s, which Turkey buys and
helps to build with the U.S., are a lot more dangerous than the
armed drones sought by the military, Gul told reporters in
 Chicago  after meeting with Obama during a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit.  U.S. resistance to the sale comes as a May 16 Wall Street
Journal article reignited debate in Turkey concerning a December
bombing which killed 34 smugglers wrongly identified as members
of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The military was
alerted to the group crossing into Turkey from Iraq by U.S.
officials after they were seen by a Predator, according to the
Journal. Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  called the account
“made up.”  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  is also working to
convince Congress to allow the sale of drones to Turkey, Gul
said, according to state-run Anatolia news agency. Turkey, which
already operates its own Israeli-made Heron unmanned aircraft
for surveillance, also hosts four U.S. Predators.  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
claimed more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
