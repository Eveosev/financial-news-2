BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
asset manager, issued $1.5 billion of bonds at its lowest
coupons on record to help fund a $1 billion share repurchase
from minority owner  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   The firm headed by Laurence Fink sold $750 million each of
1.375 percent, three-year notes to yield 100 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and 3.375 percent, 10-year debt
at 165 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The coupons are the least for three- and 10-year debt issued by
the company, Bloomberg data show.  BlackRock intends to use proceeds to fund the repurchase of
shares from Barclays, the New York-based money manager said in a
filing today. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate
purposes, including future debt repayments.  Brian Beades , a BlackRock spokesman, declined to comment.  The firm’s lowest coupons previously stood at 2.25 percent
on $500 million of three-year notes issued in December 2009 and
4.25 percent on $750 million of 10-year bonds issued in May
2011.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, will
sell its entire $6.1 billion, or 19.6 percent, stake in
BlackRock, the London-based bank said in a statement yesterday.
The sale comes before a new round of Basel rules would force
Barclays to set aside capital against the holding.  The bonds are expected to be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, the fifth-highest level of investment grade, according
a person familiar with the transaction who declined to be
identified because the sale is private. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
