OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  fell in New York after
Interfax news agency reported that  Russia  may not sell a stake
in the nation’s largest hydropower producer.  RusHydro’s American depositary receipts dropped 4.1 percent
to $2.56 in New York, making it the second-biggest decliner on
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies traded
in the U.S. The gauge dropped 0.9 percent to 85.90.  “An expectation of privatization was a strong driver for
the company’s stock,” Alexander Seleznev, an analyst at VTB
Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “People expected the company
would get a strategic investor and improve its corporate
governance as a result of privatization.”  Russia added OAO Rosneft, OAO RusHydro, Federal Grid Co.
and OAO MRSK Holding to its list of strategic assets, which may
preclude the government from privatizing them, Interfax
reported, citing President Vladimir Putin’s decree signed
yesterday.  A spokeswoman at the Kremlin declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News after normal business hours.  The government owned 60.38 percent of RusHydro as of March
31, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
