PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest
construction company, climbed for the first time in six days
after creditors withdrew motions to declare its Dromost unit
bankrupt.  The shares rose as much as 5.3 percent to 20.56 zloty, and
traded 5 percent higher at 20.5 zloty as of 9:02 a.m. in Warsaw.
PBG slumped 71 percent  this year , compared with a 1.9 percent
decline for the benchmark WIG20 Index.  The creditors Andrzej Kasprzak and Multibud sp. z o.o.
withdrew motions to declare the Dromost unit bankrupt after the
sides reached an agreement on the company’s debt, PBG said
yesterday in a statement. Dromost owed Kasprzak 863,126 zloty
($256,000) in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
