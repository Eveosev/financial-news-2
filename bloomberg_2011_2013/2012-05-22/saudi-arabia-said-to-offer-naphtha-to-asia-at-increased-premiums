Saudi Arabian Oil Co. offered to sell
supplies of naphtha in the second half of this year at higher
premiums than for the first half, according to three people with
knowledge of the talks.  The company offered the A-310 naphtha grade at $33 a metric
ton above Middle East benchmark prices, A-180 at $31 a ton and
Jubail naphtha at $29 a ton, the people said, declining to be
identified because the talks are confidential. Rabigh and Jeddah
naphtha were both offered at $25 a ton, they said.  For the first half of 2012, the company sold A-180 naphtha
at $19 above Middle East prices, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The A-310 grade loading from Ras Tanura was set at
$20 a ton, Rabigh at $17, Al-Jubail at $16.50 and Jeddah at $13.  Nobody answered an e-mail sent to Aramco’s media relations
department or a telephone call to the company’s Singapore
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
