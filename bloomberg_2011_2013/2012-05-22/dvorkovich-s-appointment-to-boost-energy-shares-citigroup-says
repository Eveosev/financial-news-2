OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom may gain
on expectations of reforms following President Vladimir Putin’s
decision to appoint Arkady Dvorkovich to oversee the  energy
industry  instead of Igor Sechin, according to Citigroup Inc.  Putin replaced Sechin, who opposed selling state assets,
with Dvorkovich as a deputy prime minister in charge of energy
yesterday. Dvorkovich is seen by investors as a “liberal and in
favor of privatization,” Citigroup analysts said in an e-mailed
note today.  “Classic cheap energy stocks, like Gazprom, Lukoil, may
gain on the appointment of Dvorkovich instead of Sechin,”
 Kingsmill Bond , chief equities strategist at Citigroup in
Moscow, said by phone. “We don’t know what the reforms will be
but clearly, as a rule, cheaper stocks tend to benefit on reform
agendas.”  Lukoil, Russia’s biggest non-state oil producer, lost 0.9
percent to 1,624 rubles by 5:27 p.m. in Moscow after rising 2.2
percent to 1637.90 rubles yesterday. Gazprom,  Russia ’s state-run
gas producer and exporter, added 0.9 percent to 143.32 rubles
after rallying 2.6 percent to 142.02 rubles yesterday.  Lukoil  trades  at 3.7 times estimated earnings,  compared 
with 9.3 times for PetroChina Co. Ltd. Gazprom trades at 3 times
estimated earnings.  Interfax reported today that Medvedev named Sechin to
become chief executive officer of OAO Rosneft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
