Rain is forecast to start falling
today and last for two days in  Russia ’s southern Krasnodar
region, where a month of dry weather damaged crops, according to
the  Federal Hydrometeorological Center .  A rainstorm is expected in the Volgograd region today and
heavy rains will cover the Republic of Adygea through May 24,
the state weather forecaster said. Those areas and the Krasnodar
region are located in the Southern Federal District, which
accounted for more than 24 percent of Russia’s grain crop last
year with about 22.7 million metric tons of cereals harvested,
according to state statistics.  Showers are predicted in the North Caucasus region today,
with wind speeds of up to 20 meters a second (45 miles an hour),
data from the forecaster showed. The area accounted for about 11
percent of last year’s grain crop with a 9.9 million-ton
harvest, the statistics showed.  The center forecast temperatures as high as 35 degrees
Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) today and tomorrow in the
southern part of the Volga Federal District. Farmers in the
region contributed about 23 percent of last year’s grain
harvest, reaping 21.2 million tons of cereals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
