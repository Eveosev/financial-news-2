Supplies of rubber, used in tires and
gloves, are set to exceed demand in the second half, reversing a
shortage and pressuring prices as growth slows in  Europe  and
 China . Futures fell the most in two weeks.  Output may top consumption by 400,000 metric tons in the
six months to December after a seasonal deficit of 150,000 tons
in the first half, said Chris Pardey, chief executive officer of
RCMA Commodities Asia, a Singapore-based trading company. A
surplus will persist through 2014, said Prachaya Jumpasut,
managing director of industry adviser  The Rubber Economist .  Futures have plunged 50 percent from a record in February
2011 as Europe struggled with its debt crisis and China expanded
last quarter at its slowest pace in almost three years. Chinese
vehicle sales dropped 1.3 percent in the first four months, the
worst performance since 1998, according to industry data. Price
declines will cut costs for tire makers such as  Bridgestone
Corp. (5108)  and Michelin & Cie. and threaten farmer incomes in
 Thailand , the biggest producer and exporter.  “The market is still bearish because of Europe’s problems
and as  China’s economy  slows,” said Kazunori Kokubo, managing
director at Yutaka Shoji Singapore Pte., a commodities broker.
The contract for October fell 3.9 percent today to 269.60 yen a
kilogram ($3,395 a ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. That
was the biggest drop for the most active contract since May 9.  Chinese Demand  The Chinese economy will expand 7.9 percent this quarter
from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey. That would
be the sixth quarterly deceleration after an 8.1 percent
expansion in the first three months. The drop in vehicle sales
boosted inventories at automakers to the highest level in at
least 16 months at the end of April, according to the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  “Prices will react negatively to lower demand,” said
Pardey who has traded commodities since 1985. Demand from China
may be unchanged from last year at 3.8 million tons, he said,
lowering an earlier forecast for 2 percent to 3 percent growth.  Futures rebounded 3.9 percent in the first two days of this
week after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said China will focus more on
boosting growth. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley
predict  interest rates  will be cut to counter the  slowdown .
 Germany  will consider all ideas to spur Europe’s growth, Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said May 21.  Thai Support  Prices were also supported after Thailand, which represents
33 percent of world output, said on May 18 it plans to buy more
than 10,000 tons on the Tokyo and Shanghai exchanges to boost
prices. The country reaffirmed a plan to drive prices to 120
baht ($3.82) a kilogram by buying from farmers, while saying it
intends to push rates to 180 baht next year, deputy farm
minister  Nattawut Saikuar  said last month.  The country will work with Indonesia and  Malaysia  to tackle
the slump, Nattawut said last week, without giving details. The
three nations represent about 70 percent of global supply.  “The Thai policy will continue supporting prices, probably
until the end of the year,” said Chaiwat Muenmee, analyst at
Bangkok-based broker DS Futures Co. “It may take a bit of time
for the government to implement the plans but it sounds serious
in taking action.”  Natural rubber consumption is set to expand 3.4 percent to
11.3 million tons this year, while production climbs 3.2 percent
also to 11.3 million tons, the  International Rubber Study Group 
said at a conference in  Singapore  today. Output may increase to
11.9 million tons in 2013, with demand rising to 11.8 million
tons, the organization said last month.  The surplus will probably widen to 469,000 tons this year
and to 566,000 tons in 2013 from 50,000 tons in 2011, before
falling to 194,000 tons in 2014 as price declines curb growth in
supplies, said Prachaya from the London-based The Rubber
Economist, who has studied the commodity for more than 30 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
