Russia ’s Transport Ministry backed
OAO Russian Railways’ plan to increase rail freight tariffs by
10.5 percent to 11 percent a year in the next three years,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing a ministry letter.  The increase, which still needs approval by other
ministries, is bigger than the previous plan to raise Russia’s
railway monopoly freight tariffs by 5.5 percent in 2013, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
