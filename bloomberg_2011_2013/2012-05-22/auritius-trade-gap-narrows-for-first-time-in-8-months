Mauritius’s trade deficit narrowed
for the first time in eight months in March as fuel-import bills
dropped by more than half.  The gap narrowed 22 percent to 5.3 billion rupees ($178
million) from 6.7 billion rupees a year earlier, Statistics
Mauritius said today in a  statement  on its website. Fuel imports
plunged 55 percent to 2.1 billion rupees, it said.  Imports fell 11 percent to 12 billion rupees, according to
the Port Louis-based statistics office. Exports decreased 0.8
percent to 6.7 billion rupees.  The Indian Ocean island nation, with a population of about
1.3 million people, is a net importer of food and fuels.  India 
is the country’s largest supplier while  Europe , led by the U.K.,
is the biggest buyer of Mauritian goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
