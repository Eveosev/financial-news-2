Norway’s krone had its biggest gain
in more than three months after economic growth accelerated more
than estimated in the first quarter.  The krone rose as much as 0.8 percent, the biggest gain
since Feb. 10. It was up 0.7 percent to 7.5630 per euro as of
5:42 p.m. in Oslo.  Economic growth accelerated more than estimated in the
first quarter as investments in offshore oil and gas fields
allowed  Europe ’s second-largest crude exporter to evade the
region’s debt crisis, data showed today. Gross domestic product,
excluding oil, gas and shipping output, grew 1.1 percent, after
a 0.8 percent expansion in the period through December, Oslo-
based  Statistics Norway  said. Growth was seen at 0.9 percent,
according to the median estimate of 11 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Total output was 1.4 percent.  The currency hit a four-month low against the dollar and a
three-month low against the euro last week amid concern over a
deepening  European debt crisis . It gained 0.1 percent to 5.9358
per dollar today, climbing for a third day.  The krone hit a nine-year high against the single European
currency in March as investors sought refuge from the European
debt crisis. Krone gains prompted an unexpected  interest rate 
cut in March and a warning from Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen that increased  risk aversion  may lead to a krone squeeze.  The central bank has cut its benchmark rates by 0.75
percentage point since December, reaching 1.5 percent, in part
to weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
