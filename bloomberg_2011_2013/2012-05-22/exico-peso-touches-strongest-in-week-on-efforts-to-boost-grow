Mexico ’s peso reached the strongest
level in a week on speculation European leaders will step up
efforts to support global growth, encouraging demand for the
Latin American nation’s higher-yielding assets.  The currency was little changed at 13.6929 per dollar at
8:29 a.m. in Mexico City after earlier appreciating to 13.6650,
the strongest level since May 15. The peso has gained 1.7
percent this year.  Mexico’s gross domestic product will expand 3.7 percent
this year, according to a survey of economists released
yesterday by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit. The economy was
expected to expand 3.5 percent this year in the previous
biweekly survey.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.21 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.03 centavo to 133 centavos per peso.  The currency rose 0.9 percent yesterday after Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged over the weekend to put more emphasis
on bolstering growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.  European leaders will do “everything necessary” to keep
 Greece  in the euro and focus on steps to aid economic expansion,
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
