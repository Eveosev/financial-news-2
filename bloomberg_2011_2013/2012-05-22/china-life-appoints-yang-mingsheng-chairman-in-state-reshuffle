China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, appointed Yang Mingsheng as chairman,
two months after the former regulatory official was named
chairman of its state-owned parent company.  Yang replaced Yuan Li, who resigned as chairman and
 executive director  “due to reallocation to other job duties,”
China Life said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today. Yang, a former vice chairman of the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission, was made chairman of China  Life Insurance 
(Group) Co. on March 19, according to a statement on the
parent’s website.  The appointment is part of a leadership reshuffle at four
state-run insurers after they were promoted to vice ministerial-
level corporations in November and their personnel affairs taken
over by the ruling Communist Party, China Business News reported
March 19. China Life Insurance Co.’s first-quarter profit fell
29 percent from a year ago as impairment losses on equity
investments surged.  Shi Guoqing and Zhuang Zuojin also resigned as non-
executive directors, the listed company said today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
