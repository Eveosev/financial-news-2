Russia  plans to export 19 cargoes of
Urals crude from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk from May 31 to
June 9, one more than in early May.  Each shipment is 100,000 metric tons, according to a
partial loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Russia will export 1.105 million tons of the blend from
Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea , little changed from the same
period in May, the plan shows.  The Novorossiysk loadings include one lot of 145,000 tons,
four shipments of 140,000 tons and four 80,000-ton cargoes. The
nation will also export one 80,000-ton lot of Siberian Light
from the port in the period.  Seven 100,000-ton lots are scheduled for June 1 to June 11
from the Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga, one more than in the same
period in May.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities. The complete June schedule will
be released later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
