Automobile owners in the U.S. see
fuel economy as the leading element they will consider in
purchasing their next car, according to a survey by  Consumer
Reports .  Of 1,702 car owners interviewed, 37 percent cited fuel
economy as the top concern, the Yonkers, New York-based product
tester and magazine publisher said in an e-mailed statement
today. Quality was cited as the main reason by 17 percent of
respondents, followed by safety at 16 percent and value at 14
percent.  “These results make it clear that high fuel prices are
continuing to impact driver behavior and influencing future
purchase considerations,” Jeff Bartlett, deputy auto editor of
Consumer Reports, said in an e-mailed statement. “This may be
foreshadowing a market shift by folks seeking relief at the
pump.”  U.S. auto sales are on pace to reach 14.3 million cars and
light trucks this year, the best showing since 2007, according
to researcher Autodata Corp. Annual deliveries are tracking for
a third-straight gain of at least 10 percent, only the fourth
such streak since the Great Depression.  The  Consumer Reports  National Research Center conducted the
survey in April, when the national price for regular unleaded
gasoline averaged $3.89 a gallon, according to AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring group. The average peaked this year at $3.94 on
April 4, according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
