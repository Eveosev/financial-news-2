Four people died in attacks by gunmen
in northeastern  Nigeria  in the past two days, spokesmen for the
security forces said.  Unidentified gunmen yesterday shot dead an assistant
superintendent of police in his car in Yobe state, the state’s
police chief, Moses Onirepi, said today by phone.  In Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, two civilians were
shot dead on May 20 by suspected members of the militant
Islamist Boko Haram group, said Victor Ebhaleme, the field
operations officer of the Joint Task Force in the state. One
civilian was killed in crossfire in Benesheikh town in Borno
when unidentified armed men attacked a police station on May 20,
state police commissioner Bala Hassan said by phone.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram for a surge of attacks since 2009 against government
buildings and security forces in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja, the capital. Boko Haram, which means “Western education
is a sin,” says it is fighting to establish an Islamic state in
Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
