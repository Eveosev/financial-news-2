Baron Benjamin de Rothschild said the
possible introduction of higher tax rates by President  Francois Hollande  may trigger an “exodus” of French entrepreneurs and
other rich people,  Bilan  reported.  “This hunt for the rich, most of whom are entrepreneurs
and contribute actively to the French economy, risks sparking an
exodus,” de Rothschild, chairman of Geneva-based  Banque Privee
Edmond de Rothschild , told the Swiss magazine. “Geneva could
benefit from this.”  Should  France  introduce an income tax based on nationality,
de Rothschild said he would probably give up his French
citizenship, Bilan reported in an interview to be published in
tomorrow’s edition of the magazine.  De Rothschild, 48, the sixth generation since Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his five sons bankrolled European governments in
the 19th century, holds a controlling stake in the Swiss private
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
