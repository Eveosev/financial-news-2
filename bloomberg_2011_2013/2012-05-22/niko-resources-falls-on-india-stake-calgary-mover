Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO) , the Canadian oil
and natural-gas producer that has lost a third of its market
value this year, fell after the company said it was abandoning
its stake in an oil field off the coast of India.  Niko fell 1.4 percent to C$33.58 at the close in Toronto.
Earlier the shares  declined  18 percent, the most since Oct. 26,
1995. The shares have fallen 30 percent this year.  “In this latest geological survey, the risks we saw were
too high,” Niko Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Edward Sampson said in a telephone interview today. The Indian
government’s price controls on oil and gas and the permitting
process also prompted Calgary-based Niko to abandon its interest
in the D4 block, Sampson said.  The company had a 15 percent interest in the exploration
block in the Orissa Basin offshore India, according to Niko’s
 website . Mumbai-based  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the field’s
operator, had a 55 percent stake and is also abandoning the
block, according to the statement.  BP Plc (BP/)  owned the remaining 30
percent, Sampson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
