A South African court found laborer
Chris Mahlangu guilty of the murder of white supremacist leader
Eugene Terre’Blanche.  High Court Judge John Horn made the ruling today at a
hearing in the central town of Ventersdorp which was broadcast
on the Johannesburg-based eNews Channel. He acquitted co-accused
Patrick Ndlovu of the killing, while convicting him of house-
breaking with intent to steal.  Mahlangu and Patrick Ndlovu were charged with bludgeoning
Terre’Blanche to death on his farm in Ventersdorp two years ago.
Mahlangu said he acted in self-defense, while Ndlovu denied
involvement in the attack.  Terre’Blanche led the  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging , or AWB,
a white nationalist group that opposed all-race elections in
1994 when power was transferred to the  African National
Congress .  Known for his oratory skills, Terre’Blanche rallied
supporters of his movement by appearing at gatherings on a
horse, flanked by youths known as the “ystergaard,” or iron
guard, dressed in khaki, military style uniforms. The AWB’s
symbol is three black interlocked 7s and an eagle.  Terre’Blanche was imprisoned in 2000 for an assault on a
black gas station attendant and then again the next year for
beating a security guard so badly that he is now permanently
disabled. He was released on parole three years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
