Berlinâ€™s new airport may cost about 3
billion euros ($3.8 billion) instead of the 2.5 billion euros
already announced,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Additionally, the nine-month delay in opening the airport
could cost about 500 million euros because of the expense of
keeping Tegel and Schoenefeld airfields open as well as
potential damage claims from airlines, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified airport observers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
