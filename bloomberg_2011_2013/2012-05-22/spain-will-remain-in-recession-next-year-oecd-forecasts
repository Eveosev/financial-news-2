  Spain ’s economy, the euro area’s
fourth largest, won’t recover next year as government and
private-sector funding conditions remain tight, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross domestic product will contract 0.8 percent in 2013
after shrinking 1.6 percent this year, the Paris-based OECD said
in a report today. That compares with the International Monetary
Fund’s forecast for 0.1 percent growth after contracting 1.8
percent this year.  Spain’s borrowing costs have jumped more than 100 basis
points since Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said on March 2 that
the country will miss its 2012 budget-deficit target,
approaching the 7 percent level that heralded bailouts in
 Greece , Ireland and Portugal.  “A further increase in the  risk premium  on yields of
Spanish  government bonds  would raise private-sector funding
costs and deepen the recession,” the OECD said.  Private consumption will fall 1.8 percent next year and
government consumption 4.5 percent as a result of austerity
measures and deleveraging in the private sector, the OECD said.
Unemployment will rise to 25.3 percent, it said.  The OECD predicts the government will miss its 2012 deficit
goal of 5.3 percent of GDP by 0.1 percentage point and its 3
percent target for 2013 by 0.3 percentage point. The nation’s
debt load will rise to 81.1 percent of GDP this year and 84.1
percent in 2013 after 68.5 percent in 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
