U.S. oil inventories climbed for a
ninth week, reaching a 21-year high, as growing production
bolstered a supply glut in the days before the Seaway pipeline
began to move crude to refineries along the  Gulf Coast , a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Stockpiles advanced 1.65 million barrels, or 0.4 percent,
to 383.3 million in the seven days ended May 18, according to
the median of 12 analyst estimates before an Energy Department
report tomorrow. The increase would take supplies to the highest
level since August 1990. Nine respondents forecast a gain and
three saw a decline.  Oil has fallen 17 percent from its 2012 high as U.S. output
surged to a 13-year peak.  Inventories at Cushing ,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York futures, rose to a record in last
week’s report. Enbridge Inc. and  Enterprise (EPD)  Products Partners LP
reversed the flow of the Seaway pipeline and started shipping
oil out of Cushing to the Gulf Coast on May 19.  “We are going to see the relief valve open up in next
week’s inventory report,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at
futures brokerage PFGBest in  Chicago . “The impact of domestic
production is showing up in these record inventories.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell 91 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $91.66 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract expired today. Prices are down from $109.77 on Feb.
24, the highest close for 2012.  Stockpile Report  Inventories climbed 2.13 million barrels to 381.6 million
in the week ended May 11, the highest level since August 1990,
last week’s report showed. Stockpiles at Cushing rose 1 million
barrels to 45.1 million.  The supply increases came as refineries operated at the
highest production level in almost eight months. The  utilization
rate  jumped to 88.3 percent in the week ended May 11 from 86.4
percent the previous week as plants returned to service after
seasonal maintenance programs.  “We are seeing crude continue to build even with refinery
utilization rates going so much higher,” said Jacob Corel, a
commodity analyst at Summit Energy Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“There is just too much oil coming in right now.”  The Bloomberg survey showed that companies boosted
operations to 88.6 percent of capacity last week.  “The completion of spring maintenance should cause oil
stocks to fall and product stocks to rise beginning in late
April and early May,” Tom Padlock, director of market research
at Chicago-based Olive and previously an analyst at MF Global,
said in a note to clients. “However, this year has been
atypical.”  Oil Production  U.S. oil output has increased for three consecutive years
as producers accelerated drilling with new techniques that made
it possible to free hydrocarbons trapped in shale and tight rock
formations.  Production rose to 6.15 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 11, the most since February 1999, according to the
Energy Department. Output was 9.5 percent greater than a year
earlier. With the Seaway reversal, “Cushing inventories will
draw down,” Corel said. “But at the same time there is a lot
of crude production at the region and a lot is going to depend
on flows into Cushing.”  Rising output from  Canada ’s oil sands has boosted supplies
from the biggest U.S. source of foreign oil and helped raise
inventories.  Imports from Canada  averaged 2.25 million barrels a
day in the four weeks ended May 11, 14 percent more than a year
earlier.  Supplies at Cushing  “There is still a lot of oil going into Cushing and a lot
of Canadian oil sand production, so supply is going to continue
to build up,” said Flynn, who predicted that Cushing
inventories rose 1.5 million barrels last week. “The reversal
of Seaway is historic.”  Enbridge (ENB)  and Enterprise completed the Seaway reversal on
May 17 and began accepting crude on May 19, according to the
companies.  The 500-mile (805-kilometer), 30-inch Seaway line will
initially be able to deliver 150,000 barrels per day, increasing
to more than 400,000 in the first quarter of 2013, and the
companies said in a statement last week.  The reversed line will supply refineries in Texas and
 Louisiana  that account for about 35 percent of U.S. capacity,
according to a filing from the companies with the  Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission .  Gasoline Stockpiles  Gasoline  supplies  probably fell 650,000 barrels to 203.7
million, the survey showed. Seven analysts forecast a decline
and five expected a gain. Inventories slid 2.8 million barrels
to 204.3 million in the week ended May 11.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.9
cent to $3.68 a gallon yesterday, according to Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S. motoring group. It was the
lowest level since Feb. 24. Prices have dropped 25.6 cents, or
6.5 percent, since reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4 as
crude tumbled 8.8 percent.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , including heating oil and
diesel, dropped 500,000 barrels to 119.3 million. Eight analysts
forecast a decline and four saw an increase. Distillates fell
969,000 barrels to 119.8 million in the week ended May 11.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
