Discoveries of unconventional oil and
gas reserves in the western hemisphere will not only reduce
price and supply volatility, but will also bring the end of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,  Roger Altman 
wrote in the Financial Times.  Technology has revolutionized energy supply with the result
that the U.S. now has a 100-year supply of natural gas, and oil
production is projected to rise sharply, meaning that within 20
years, production could match consumption in the western world
for the first time since 1952, Altman, chairman of  Evercore
Partners (EVR)  and a former U.S. deputy Treasury secretary wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
