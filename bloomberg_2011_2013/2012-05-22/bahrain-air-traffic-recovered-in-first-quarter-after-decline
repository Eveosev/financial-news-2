Traffic at  Bahrain International
Airport  rebounded in the first quarter, after a year-earlier
slump as regional unrest spread to the island nation.  Total passengers rose 12 percent in the period to 2.06
million, the country’s  civil aviation authority  said on its
website. Cargo increased 5 percent to 91,799 tons.  Passenger traffic fell 12 percent in 2011 and cargo volume
by 13 percent, the authority said. It cited “reduced business
activity due to the effects of the Arab Spring throughout the
region and a reduction in routes served.” Gulf Air, Bahrain’s
state-owned carrier, carried 8 percent fewer passengers while
private Bahrain Air had a drop of 21 percent.  Demonstrations broke out in February last year in Bahrain,
led by the country’s Shiite Muslim majority demanding democracy
and equal rights, as part of the wave of Arab revolts. A
crackdown by security forces left at least 35 people dead in the
first two months, and the opposition says more than 40 others
died since. Small-scale rallies still take place daily in Shiite
villages and sometimes spill into the capital, Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
