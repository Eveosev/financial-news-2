Altria Group Inc. (MO)  said it agreed to a
$500 million settlement over lease transactions challenged by
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  The dispute covered transactions between 1996 and 2003 in
which the company would buy ownership stakes in public
utilities, lease the assets back to the previous owners and take
 tax deductions . Altria, based in Richmond, Virginia, owns
cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris USA Inc.  The company took a $627 million charge last year in
anticipation of the resolution of the tax dispute. Altria will
record a one-time earnings benefit of $68 million because of the
difference between what it expected to pay and the final terms
of the settlement, the company said.  The company, one of the last to defend the validity of
leasing transactions that the government curtailed in 2004 and
2005, said the $500 million was composed of taxes and interest,
not penalties.  IRS spokeswoman Christina Dâ€™Amico declined to comment on
the settlement, saying federal law prohibits the agency from
discussing individual taxpayers.  The case is Altria Group Inc. v.  United States , 10-02404.  To contact the reporter on this story:
