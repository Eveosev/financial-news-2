European leaders should renegotiate
 Greece ’s bailout package to break the political deadlock in the
nation that has driven up prices of haven assets and weakened
the euro, according to High Frequency Economics.  “Only the European Union governments can open a door that
leads to a political solution for Greece,” Carl B. Weinberg,
founder and chief economist at High Frequency in Valhalla, New
York, wrote in an investor note today. “Most of the differences
between the parties in the Greek political mix would be mooted
and a new government could be formed if the EU governments would
back down and agree to negotiate new terms for Greece’s economic
adjustment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
