Hungary’s Fidesz party is willing to
consider granting exemptions from a proposed tax on financial
transactions, said Antal Rogan, the next parliamentary leader of
the ruling party.  The government may accept amendments to spare the
treasuries of companies with “substantial export activities”
from the levy, Rogan told lawmakers in Budapest today. The
ruling party insists that banks must shoulder much of the burden
from the tax, Rogan said, adding that parliament will have
“almost a month” to debate and approve the draft.  “The subject of the tax is the company, which in the
present case is the bank, and not the person using the
service,” Rogan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
