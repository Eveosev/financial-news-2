Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 20
percent at the end of April from a year earlier as production
increased, the government said.  Warehouses held 659.5 million pounds of the meat, up from
549.3 million on April 30, 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories climbed 8.1
percent from the end of March.  U.S. commercial pork  output  in the three months through
March 31 totaled 5.858 billion pounds (2.7 million metric tons),
up 2.4 percent from 2011, government data show. April pork
production in the U.S. may have been the fourth-highest on
record and up 3 percent from a year earlier, said  Bob Brown , an
independent market analyst in Edmond,  Oklahoma .  “Production and stocks seem to be correlated,” Brown said
in a telephone interview before the report was released. “The
higher the production, the higher the stocks.” The USDA will
report on April output on May 25.  Hog futures for July settlement fell 1 percent to settle at
86.15 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices reached 85.8 cents after the close of regular
trading, the lowest since May 15. The commodity is still up 2.2
percent this year.  As of April 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, surged 41 percent from a year earlier
to 74.8 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham were 46 percent higher at 112.6 million pounds.  While the report was “not wildly bearish by any means,”
the increase in stockpiles was “certainly not supportive” and
will “probably” weigh on hog prices tomorrow,  Dan Vaught , the
owner of Vaught Futures Insights, said in a telephone interview
from Altus,  Arkansas .  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of April were 18
percent smaller than a year earlier at 606.6 million pounds.
Beef supplies on April 30 rose 17 percent to 517.5 million
pounds, a record for the date, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
