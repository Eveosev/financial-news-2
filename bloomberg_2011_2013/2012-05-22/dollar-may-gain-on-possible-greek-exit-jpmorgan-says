The dollar may strengthen against all
its major peers except the yen amid a possible Greek exit from
the euro and economic slowdowns in  China  and the U.S., according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “Regardless of country-specific strengths outside  Europe ,
no currency but the yen could appreciate versus the dollar
during the deleveraging and volatility spike,” Kevin Hebner, a
foreign-exchange strategist for JPMorgan in  London , wrote to
clients today. “For the second time in six months, Greece’s
Economic and Monetary Union exit seems imminent.”  The New York-based bank reduced its euro forecast to $1.22
for the second quarter from a $1.34 estimate as of May 11. The
17-nation currency will trade at $1.24 by year-end, compared
with a previous forecast of $1.36. It traded at $1.27 today in
 New York .  Greek elections are scheduled for June 17 after an
inconclusive vote in May propelled an anti-bailout party to
second place.  Growth-linked currencies may weaken against the dollar as
an economic slowdown in China may trim commodity prices.
Canada’s dollar will weaken to C$1.04 by mid-year compared with
98 cents per  U.S. dollar , the report said. Australia’s dollar
may fall to 96 U.S. cents versus $1.08 and New Zealand’s
currency will trade at 73 U.S. cents, down from 82 U.S. cents.  The dollar may weaken to 78 yen at the end of the second
quarter. It traded at 79.98 today.  Hebner couldn’t be reached for additional comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
