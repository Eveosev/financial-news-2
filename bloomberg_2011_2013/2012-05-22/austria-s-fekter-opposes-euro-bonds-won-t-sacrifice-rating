Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said she opposes joint euro-area bonds as they would
cost the Alpine republic more interest.  “Like my colleague Schaeuble I am against euro bonds,”
Fekter told reporters in Vienna today. “I’m not willing that
Austria should potentially pay twice as high interest as we
currently do. As long as fiscal discipline of the euro nations
isn’t completely complied with, as long as stability isn’t
really really reached, as long as there is no direct influence
on how the states run their finances and which fiscal measures
they set, I won’t sacrifice the Austrian  credit rating .”  European Union leaders meet tomorrow in Brussels where
German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces growing pressure to ease
up on austerity measures after three years of the debt crisis
crimps expansion. Newly elected French President  Francois Hollande  has said he plans to discuss common euro-area bonds at
the meeting, while Merkel has rejected issuing such bonds,
saying that eliminating the gaps in bond yields would remove the
incentive for weaker countries to overhaul their economies.  Fekter said she was is less opposed to a test phase for EU
guarantees of “project bonds” sold by private builders of
infrastructure.  “This growth impulse shouldn’t be built on new debt, but
use existing funds, for instance the billions in the Structural
Funds, for this,” she said. “One should very thoroughly check
how sustainably this money was used until now for jobs, for
growth.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
