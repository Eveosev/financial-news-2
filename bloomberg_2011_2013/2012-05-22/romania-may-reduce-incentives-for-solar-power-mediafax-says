Romania â€™s energy-market regulator may
ask the government to reduce incentives for solar power
generation from 2013, as the number of green certificates
received by producers is too high, Mediafax reported, citing a
regulator official.  The regulator, also known as  ANRE , will make an assessment
of the incentives by the end of June, the Bucharest-based news
service said, quoting Zoltan Nagy-Bege, a regulator director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
