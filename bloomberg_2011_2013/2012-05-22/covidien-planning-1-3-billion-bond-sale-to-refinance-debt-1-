Covidien Plc (COV)  sold $1.25 billion of
three- and 10-year notes to refinance debt due in October at
record-low coupons for the maker of surgical accessories and
operating-room products, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company’s financing unit, Covidien International
Finance SA, issued $600 million of 1.35 percent bonds maturing
in 2015 to yield 95 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $650 million of 3.2 percent notes due 2022 with a
145 basis-point spread. Those are the lowest coupons on record
for equal-maturity debt sold by the company, Bloomberg data
show.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to redeem its $500
million of 5.45 percent securities issued in May 2008 as well as
for general corporate purposes, the Dublin-based company said
today in a regulatory filing.  “Covidien bondholders may be able to generate more return
for the risk by investing in these new issues,” Julie Stralow,
an analyst at Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , wrote in a note
before the deal priced.  The company last sold debt in June 2010, when it issued
$1.5 billion of three-, five- and 10-year bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The 1.875 percent notes maturing in
2013 priced to yield 72 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, and the 4.2 percent bonds due in 2020 had a 97
basis-point spread, the data show.  The new debt was  rated  A by  Standard & Poor’s . Moody’s
Investors Service graded it Baa1, three levels above junk grade.
BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed the
sale, Bloomberg data show.  Covidien said in December that it would spin off its
pharmaceuticals division into a separate company that would be
able to better compete in the growing pain-management area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
