FIFA today appointed a woman to its
executive board for the first time in the soccer body’s 108-year
history.  Lydia Nsekera, president of the Burundi Football
Association, was invited to become the 25th member of FIFA’s
executive committee, which is responsible for decisions
including the host countries of its $5 billion  World Cup .  Nsekera will take her position after FIFA’s 62nd Congress
in Budapest this week. A formal election for a regular female
committee member will be held in 2013 once FIFA’s new statutes
come into force, the organization said in a statement following
a meeting of the executive board yesterday.  The changes to the statutes come after FIFA’s President
Sepp Blatter started a program to overhaul several of the
organizations structures following a series of corruption
allegations that have tarnished the soccer body’s reputation.  The executive committee confirmed changes to its ethics
panel that creates two chambers, one that investigates offenses
and another that adjudicates, with two independent chairmen.
FIFA said an official expected to be named as head of its
adjudication branch has withdrawn because of ill health.  The appointment on Nsekera brings FIFA in line with
regional bodies in Europe and  Asia , which both have women on
their executive boards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
