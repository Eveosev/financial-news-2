Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting products, fell the most in five months after
Chief Financial Officer John Kurtzweil quit to join  Extreme
Networks (EXTR)  Inc.  Cree, based in Durham, North Carolina, dropped 6.5 percent
to $27.20 at the close in New York, the biggest decline since
Dec. 19.  Michael McDevitt was appointed interim chief financial
officer at Cree and Kurtzweil will continue until June 15 to
help with the transition, the company said today in a statement.  Cree hired the executive recruiter Russell Reynolds
Associates to lead a search for Kurtzweilâ€™s replacement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
