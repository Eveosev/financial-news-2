Banks must take “drastic” action to
restore profitability if they are to lure investors back to the
industry, Hugo Banziger,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s chief risk officer,
wrote in the Financial Times.  The industry hasn’t said enough about how it will make
banking “safe, useful and profitable,” as regulators prepare
stricter rules on capital to avoid further taxpayer-funded
bailouts, said Banziger, who will step down from his position at
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank at the end of May.  Firms should scale back their trading activities and
refocus  investment banking  on its three core competencies of
underwriting, market making and helping clients manage risk,
Banziger wrote in the newspaper.  Investment banking will become less profitable, and returns
on equity will fall to similar levels as utilities, Banziger
said. Banks will have to cut the number of traders they employ,
while compensation will have to “normalize” in line with other
 service industries , he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
