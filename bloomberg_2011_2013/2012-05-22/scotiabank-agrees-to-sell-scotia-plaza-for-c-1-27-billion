Bank of Nova Scotia  agreed to sell
its Scotia Plaza office complex in Toronto for C$1.27 billion
($1.24 billion) to two Canadian real estate trusts.  Dundee Real Estate Investment Trust (D-U)  and  H&R Real Estate
Investment Trust (HR-U)  agreed to buy the headquarters of  Canada ’s
third-biggest bank, the lender said today in a statement. The
sale is expected to close by June 20. Dundee would own two-
thirds of the property, and H&R would have the rest.  Scotiabank has agreed to a lease agreement to keep the bank
as the lead tenant of Scotia Plaza for “a number of years,”
said Sabi Marwah, the bank’s chief operating officer. The
complex has 2 million square feet of space.  Scotiabank said in January it planned to sell the 68-floor
office building on King Street in the city’s financial district.
The building is Canada’s second-tallest office complex after
First Canadian Place,  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s headquarters.  Canadian pension funds including Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System,
and Alberta Investment Management Corp., had said they’d
consider bidding for the Toronto property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
