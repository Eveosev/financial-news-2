Peruvian central bank President Julio Velarde said the bank is ready to tighten monetary policy if it
sees domestic demand fueling inflation.  The bank will raise either its benchmark interest rate or
 reserve requirements  if demand pressures increase, Velarde told
reporters in Lima today.  The bank boosted reserve requirements for the first time in
a year on May 1 as credit growth and an improved economic
outlook risk fueling inflation that’s been above the target of 1
percent to 3 percent for 10 months. While growth accelerated to
6 percent in the first quarter from 5.5 percent in the previous
three months, it remains below potential, Velarde said.  “Have no doubt that if we see inflation stemming from
demand pressures, which we don’t yet, we will act to adjust
monetary policy,” Velarde said. Raising  interest rates  or the
reserve ratio “have the same effect,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
