Prudential Financial Inc., the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, affirmed its plan to boost
return on equity to 13 percent from about 11 percent last year.  “The 13 percent is no longer an aspiration, it’s now a
goal, a very specific goal for 2013.” Chief Executive Officer
John Strangfeld said at a presentation held by the  Newark , New
Jersey-based insurer today. “We intend to achieve it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
