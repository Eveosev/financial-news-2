The  European Central Bank  declined a
request by the Greens party to reveal the names of banks which
received more than 1 trillion euros ($1.27 trillion) in central
bank funds between December and February, Financial Times
Deutschland reported.  The German newspaper said the ECB may be willing to
disclose the information “at a higher level,” FTD reported,
citing Gerhard Schick, the finance policy spokesman for the
German Greens.  To contact the reporters on this story:
