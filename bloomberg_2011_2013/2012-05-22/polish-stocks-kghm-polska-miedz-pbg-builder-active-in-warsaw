Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  lost 0.5 percent
to 2,085.34 at 11:08 a.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, added 0.6 percent to 123 zloty,
climbing for a second day. The metal rose in London trading
before a report that may show stronger sales of houses in the
U.S., underpinning prospects for demand in the world’s second-
biggest copper consumer.  PBG SA (PBG PW), the nation’s third-largest construction
company, rose 1 percent to 19.71 zloty, gaining for the first
time in six days after creditors withdrew motions to declare its
Dromost unit bankrupt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
