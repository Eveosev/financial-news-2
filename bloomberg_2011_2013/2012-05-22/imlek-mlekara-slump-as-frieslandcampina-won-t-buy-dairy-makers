Imlek AD (IMLK)  and  Mlekara Subotica AD (MLSU) ,
Serbian dairy producers, dropped in Belgrade trading after Royal
FrieslandCampina NV failed to reach a deal to buy the companies
from Danube Foods Group BV.  Imlek fell 4.8 percent to 2,850 dinars and Mlekara declined
6.3 percent to 1,500 dinars at 11:00 a.m. in Belgrade.  Serbia’s competition regulator approved the transaction on
April 26, after Salford Capital Partners Inc.’s Danube Foods
Group BV announced the sale of a 81.7 percent stake in Imlek and
81.8 percent of Mlekara on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
