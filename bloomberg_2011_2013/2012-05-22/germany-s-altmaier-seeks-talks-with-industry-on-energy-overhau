Peter Altmaier , installed as
Germany’s environment minister today, will pursue talks with
industry executives about Germany’s plan to shift its energy mix
to renewable sources such as solar and wind and away from
nuclear power.  Altmaier is seeking a “national energy consensus” that
will balance the interests of consumers, environmental groups
and the industrial producers that consume great quantities of
power, he told a gathering of wind-industry officials in Berlin
today.  “The energy overhaul will possibly be the central project
of this government,” he said. Germany has “no interest” in
having “highly competitive” companies leave the country when
they require more energy.  Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is planning to shutter
the country’s remaining nine nuclear reactors by 2022 and raise
the share of renewables in its power mix to at least 35 percent,
up from about 20 percent now.  Altmaier, 53, will be in charge of plans to build offshore
wind farms that will cover an area six times the size of  New
York  City and install enough  power lines  to stretch from London
to Baghdad.  The overhaul will require “greater coordination” between
Germany’s 16 states and the federal government, said Altmaier,
who’s a regular user of  Twitter . That will ensure power-
generation equipment such as  wind turbines  isn’t taken offline
in times of peak production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
