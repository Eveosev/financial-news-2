Italy’s 10-year bonds advanced for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in two months, on
speculation European leaders will announce additional steps to
boost the region’s economy at a summit this week.  Spanish securities also gained, with 10-year yields
dropping the most since January, after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday his country will consider all
ideas to bolster growth at the meeting in Brussels tomorrow.
German bunds fell as optimism the debt crisis will be contained
sapped demand for  10-year yields  within six basis points of a
record low.  Germany  is scheduled to sell two-year notes tomorrow
with a record-low coupon of zero percent, the Bundesbank said.  “There’s a vague idea we might get a policy response on a
broader European Union level,” said  Michael Leister , a rates
strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Investors realize that
a great deal of Armageddon-scenario is already priced in.
There’s a bit of profit-taking in bunds, given the record yield
levels we’ve reached.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 5.60 percent at 4:10 p.m.  London  time after
dropping to 5.59 percent, the lowest since May 14. The 5 percent
security due in March 2022 rose 1.23, or 1.23 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,277) face amount, to 95.965. The five-day advance is
the longest since the period ended March 2.  Spain ’s 10-year yield declined 18 basis points to 6.09
percent. It earlier fell as much as 20 basis points, the biggest
intraday drop since Jan. 27.  Jumpstart Growth  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  are seeking to balance France’s desire to
jumpstart growth with Germany’s preference for spending cuts as
a way of resolving the sovereign debt crisis.  “Everything will be on the table,” Hollande told
reporters yesterday. “All the tools, all the proposals will be
welcomed and I am not preparing this informal summit with my
government to create conflict.”  Germany’s 10-year yield climbed five basis points to 1.48
percent, after falling to an all-time low 1.396 percent on May
18. The  two-year  yield increased two basis points to 0.06
percent. It dropped to a record 0.031 percent on May 18.  Germany will auction 5 billion euros of notes maturing in
June 2014 tomorrow with a coupon of zero percent, the central
bank said. At the previous offering of two-year securities on
April 18, they were sold at a record-low average auction yield
of 0.14 percent.  ‘Lot of Demand’  “It’s uncertain whether the zero coupon causes any
technical issues,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “In core markets, there has been a lot of demand for
low-coupon paper relative to higher-coupon paper. Whether this
extends to zero-coupon paper is unclear.”  Spanish borrowing costs rose as the nation sold three- and
six-month bills. It auctioned 1.51 billion euros of three-month
securities at an average yield of 0.846 percent, up from 0.634
percent on April 24. Investors bid for 3.95 times the amount of
debt allotted, down from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 7.61.  The country also sold 1 billion euros of six-month bills at
1.737 percent, versus 1.58 percent on April 24.  The Netherlands auctioned 3 billion euros of notes
maturing in April 2015 at an average yield of 0.456 percent,
versus 0.618 percent at a previous sale on March 13.  Switzerland  sold 733 million francs ($780 million) of six
month-bills at a yield of minus 0.318 percent, versus minus
0.251 percent on April 10.  Austrian Bonds  Austria’s bonds gained, with 10-year yields falling four
basis points to 2.47 percent after reaching 2.462 percent, the
lowest level since Bloomberg began compiling data on the
securities in 1993.  Volatility on Spanish  government bonds  was the highest in
euro-area markets today followed by Ireland and  France ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps.  German debt has returned 3 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds dropped 3.5 percent,
and Italian securities gained 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
