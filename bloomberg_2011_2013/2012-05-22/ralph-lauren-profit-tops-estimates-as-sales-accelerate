Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) , the retailer of
its namesake brand clothing, rose after reporting profit that
beat analysts’ estimates because of sales gains at its own shops
and department stores.  Ralph Lauren  climbed 2.7 percent to $150.27 at the close in
 New York . The  shares  have advanced 8.8 percent this year.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ralph Lauren benefited
from gains in apparel and accessories sales in  North America  and
Europe in the fourth quarter. Luxury consumers continued buying
goods at full price as stronger financial markets earlier this
year bolstered their confidence.  Net income in the quarter ended March 31 climbed 29 percent
to $94.4 million, or 99 cents a share, from $73.2 million, or 74
cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said in a
statement today. The average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was 85 cents a share.  Ralph Lauren said gross margin -- the fraction of revenue
left after subtracting the cost of goods sold -- expanded to
57.1 percent, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of 56.1
percent.  Revenue climbed 14 percent to $1.62 billion. Analysts
estimated $1.6 billion. Sales at its own stores open at least a
year improved 12 percent, and wholesale revenue climbed 10
percent, the company said.  Ralph Lauren said its board authorized doubling its
quarterly  dividend  to 40 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
