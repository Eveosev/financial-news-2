PT Kharisma Pemasaran Bersama
Nusantara, which auctions  palm oil  from  Indonesia ’s state
plantations, failed to sell 16,000 metric tons it offered in
Jakarta today.  The company received the highest bids from PT Multimas
Nabati Asahan and PT Wilmar Nabati Indonesia at 8,200 rupiah a
kilogram ($886 a ton) for delivery from Belawan and Dumai port
in Sumatera, the company said in a faxed statement. That’s less
than the target price of 8,214 rupiah a kilogram.  Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
