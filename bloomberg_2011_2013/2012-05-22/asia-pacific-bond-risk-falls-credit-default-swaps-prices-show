The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 195 basis points
as of 8:38 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The index is on track to decline for a second day
from a four-month high of 200.3 on May 18, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 7 basis points to 208
as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG prices.
The benchmark is poised for its biggest daily decline since
March 27 after reaching 217.3 basis points on May 18, the
highest since Oct. 5, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 5 basis points to
194.5 basis points as of 10:39 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The gauge rose to 201 basis points on May 18,
its highest since Nov. 29, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
