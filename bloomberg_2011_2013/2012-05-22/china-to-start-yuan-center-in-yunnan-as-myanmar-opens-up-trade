China has started a cross-border  yuan 
center in a south-west province bordering Myanmar as that
country opens up to foreign business, according to a Chinese
government website.  The yuan center in the city of Ruili, in Yunnan province,
will promote exchanging yuan with the Myanmar kyat, along with
transporting and repatriating yuan, according to  a statement  on
the Ruili website posted yesterday.  China, Myanmar’s biggest trading partner, has urged other
countries to end economic sanctions as the southeast Asian
country opens up its economy and ends a half century of
isolation. Elections on April 1 allowed the country’s leading
dissident,  Aung San Suu Kyi , to take a seat in parliament.  Myanmar’s political changes may open a new trading route
from  China  to the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal, lowering
shipping costs for exporters in central China,  Dariusz
Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist with Credit Agricole
CIB in  Hong Kong , wrote in an e-mail.  “We expect an increase in trading volumes via Myanmar, and
opening of the cross-border CNY center in Ruili will help
accelerate the process,” Kowalczyk wrote.  Ruili aims to develop direct settlement as well as a
clearing service, according to the statement. In mainland China,
settlement of yuan takes place through a national system
operated by the central bank.  The U.S. government loosened a ban on American investments
in Myanmar this month, the strongest acknowledgment yet of the
political and economic transformation put in motion by Myanmar’s
government.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
