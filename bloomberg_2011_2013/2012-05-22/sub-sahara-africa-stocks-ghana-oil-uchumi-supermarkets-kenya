Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  climbed for a
fourth day, increasing 0.4 percent to 64.56 in Nairobi, the

0.1 percent to 1,823.69 in Port Louis.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,

biggest network of gasoline stations in the West African nation,
jumped 4.7 percent to 45 pesewas, the highest on record, as
investors bet a rebranding exercise will boost revenue.  “We see sales growing between 22 percent and 25 percent in
the first half,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Databank
Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today. “We
think rebranding of locations places the company in a strong
position in the fuel marketing business in Ghana.”  Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP)  , Kenya’s only publicly
traded retail chain, advanced for a ninth day, adding 3 percent
to 19.05 shillings, its highest in more than six years,
following a Daily Nation report about a dispute at one of its
key competitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
