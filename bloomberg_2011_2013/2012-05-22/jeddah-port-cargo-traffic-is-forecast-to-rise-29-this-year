Jeddah Islamic Port,  Saudi Arabia ’s
biggest, will see its cargo traffic rise 29 percent this year as
transshipments, petrochemical exports and local cargoes
increase, according to director general Saher Tahlawi.  Traffic will rise to 67 million tons, from 52 million in
2011, Tahlawi said at a conference in Dubai today. The port is
likely to handle 4.7 million twenty-foot-equivalent unit
containers, or TEUs, up from 4.01 million last year, he said.  Jeddah may build a fourth container terminal, having spent
5 billion riyals ($1.33 billion) on expanding equipment and
infrastructure during the past four years, Tahlawi said.  Saudi Ports Authority  controls the kingdom’s nine ports,
six commercial and three industrial. Excluding crude oil, of
which the kingdom is the world’s biggest exporter, the ports
handled 5.7 million TEUs last year, Tahlawi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
