Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d.,
Sloveniaâ€™s largest publicly traded bank, said profit in the
first quarter plunged 72 percent from a year ago as the bank set
aside more provisions to cover bad loans.  Net income dropped to 1.4 million euros ($1.8 million) from
5.1 million euros, the Maribor-based bank said in a regulatory
filing today.  Nova Kreditna last year reported a loss of 81 million
euros, the first since the lender sold shares to the public in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
