The owners of  New York â€™s  Alex Hotel 
and  Flatotel  are seeking  bankruptcy protection  as part of an
agreement with lenders who in January won a foreclosure lawsuit
for unpaid loans.  205 East 45 LLC, the owner of east midtown Manhattan-
located Alex Hotel, has $123 million in outstanding liabilities
with the lenders group, according to a Chapter 11 filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. EALC LLC, the
owner of Flatotel in west midtown Manhattan, has $245 million in
liabilities with the lenders, according to the filing.  Starting in January 2009, the owners failed to make
interest payments and repay principal on the loans, according to
the filing. A drop in tourism and business travel that began in
2008 led to plummeting demand for hotel accommodations and made
it impossible for the owners to refinance their debt
obligations, according to the filing.  The lenders, Rockpoint Group LLC, Atlas Capital Group LLC,
and the Procaccianti Group, acquired the secured loans from
Anglo Irish Corp. in 2010, according to the filing. The lenders
sued to foreclose on the loans the same year, according to the
filing.  The cases are In re 205 East 45 LLC, 12-12208, and In re
EALC LLC, 12-12209,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
