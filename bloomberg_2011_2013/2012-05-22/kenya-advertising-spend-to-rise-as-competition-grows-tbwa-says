Kenya ’s advertising market, which
grew more than 30 percent last year, is set for further
expansion because of intense competition among consumer goods
companies, according to TBWA Worldwide’s local unit.  “International companies are now facing stiffer
competition from stronger local companies,” Tim Smythe, chief
executive officer of TBWA East Africa, said in a phone interview
today from Nairobi.  TBWA, owned by  Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC) , set up an office in
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, in February as part of a plan for
expansion in East Africa. Clients there include Standard Bank
Group, Visa International, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Unilever Plc.
TBWA Worldwide, which has had an affiliate agency in Uganda for
six years, also plans to start a business in Tanzania next
month, Smythe said.  Advertising spending in Kenya grew 33 percent last year to
65.4 billion shillings ($769 million), according to the annual
report of Scangroup Ltd.,  East Africa ’s biggest marketing
company by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
