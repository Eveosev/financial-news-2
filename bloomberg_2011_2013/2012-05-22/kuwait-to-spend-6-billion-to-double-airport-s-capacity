Kuwait ’s government will spend $6
billion to almost double the number of passengers its
international airport is able to handle by the end of 2016, the
head of the country’s aviation regulator said.  Work will begin this year on adding a terminal and
renovating infrastructure to raise capacity to 13 million
passengers, Kuwait Civil Aviation President  Fawaz Abdul-Aziz Al-
Farah  told reporters in Dubai today. The airport, which is built
to handle 7 million travelers a year, received 8.5 million
passengers in 2011, and the figure may exceed 9 million this
year, he said.  The expansion is part of Kuwait’s $111 billion four-year
development plan announced in February 2010 to build a subway
and rail network, expand the airport and construct power
stations, hospitals, roads and a port for the nation of 3.7
million people. Neighboring Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates 
are building airports and expanding existing ones to accommodate
growth in travel.  Kuwait International Airport’s capacity may be expanded to
25 million passengers by 2025 and 50 million people by 2035, Al-
Farah said.  The emirate’s main carriers are  Jazeera Airways KSC (JAZEERA) , a low-
cost operator, and state-owned Kuwait Airways Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
