Stefan Quandt, a billionaire heir to
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) â€™s controlling family, plans to take
a controlling stake in Solarwatt AG, a producer of solar modules
and power plants.  Quandt, who already owns 36 percent of Dresden, Germany-
based Solarwatt, filed his intention to take control with the
federal cartel office, according to its website.  Solar makers in  Germany  are struggling with reduced
government support and competition from Chinese companies that
have created a glut of panels.  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the biggest
solar-cell maker,  Solon SE (SOO1) ,  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and  Solarhybrid
AG (SHL)  have all filed for insolvency since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
