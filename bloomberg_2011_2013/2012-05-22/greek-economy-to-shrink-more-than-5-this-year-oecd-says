Greece ’s economy will shrink more
than the government expects in 2012 and 2013 even if it makes
all structural changes laid out under the country’s bailout, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross domestic product will contract 5.3 percent this year
and 1.3 percent in 2013, after shrinking 6.9 percent in 2011,
the OECD said in a report published today. The European
Commission forecast on May 11 that the  Greek economy  will
contract 4.7 percent this year and show zero growth in 2013.  “These projections assume that the EU/IMF program of
fiscal consolidation and structural reform is fully
implemented,” the OECD said, referring to the bailout terms set
by the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . “If
the EU/IMF program were not implemented, the risk of debt
default would rise sharply, with incalculable consequences.”  Greece is in the fifth year of a recession that has been
amplified by austerity measures linked to the rescue, with the
 unemployment rate  reaching 21.7 percent in February. A caretaker
government was sworn in last week to lead the country to new
elections on June 17 after an inconclusive poll on May 6
propelled the Syriza party, which wants to annul the bailout,
into second place.  Greece’s budget deficit will drop to 7.4 percent of GDP
this year and 4.9 percent in 2013 from 9.2 percent in 2011, the
Paris-based OECD said. That compares with a target of 7.3
percent this year and 4.6 percent next year under the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
