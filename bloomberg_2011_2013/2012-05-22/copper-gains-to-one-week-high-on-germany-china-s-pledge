Copper gained to the highest level in
a week as the Chinese government sought to spur its economy and
 Germany  pledged to consider growth measures for Europe,
improving the outlook for metals.  The three-month delivery contract climbed as much as 1.1
percent to $7,816 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,777.75 by 3:13 p.m. Shanghai time. July-delivery metal
added 0.4 percent to $3.5145 a pound on the Comex.  China plans to speed up approval of infrastructure projects
to improve the economy, the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing an unidentified person. Premier  Wen Jiabao  called
for “putting stabilizing growth in a more important position,”
in remarks published May 20 by the official Xinhua News Agency.  “Stimulus measures such as speeding up the approval of
infrastructure projects can have significant implications in
terms of demand prospects,” Yang Xiaoguang, an analyst at
Jinrui Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen. “We expect the
Chinese economy to bottom in the second quarter and rebound
later this year.”  European leaders will do “everything necessary” to keep
 Greece  in the 17-nation euro, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said yesterday. The September-delivery contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange closed little changed at 55,850 yuan
($8,837) a ton.  Copper demand in China is expected recover in the second
half of the year as the world’s biggest metals consumer takes
