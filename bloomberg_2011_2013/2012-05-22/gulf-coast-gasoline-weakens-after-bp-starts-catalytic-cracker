Gulf Coast gasoline weakened after  BP
Plc (BP)  started a fluid catalytic cracker at the Texas City refinery
in Texas.  The 475,000-barrel-a-day plant also started an alkylation
unit that was shut, according to a person familiar with
operations at the plant.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast weakened 1 cent to 21.5 cents versus futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:15 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the lowest level since March 7.
Prompt delivery fell 2.01 cents to $2.715 a gallon.  Colonial Pipeline Co., the largest pipeline linking Gulf
Coast refiners with Northeast markets, issued an allocation
notice for gasoline on Line 1 for Cycle 31, according to a
bulletin sent to shippers.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in  New York  Harbor rose 0.25 cent to 5.75 cents a gallon versus
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
