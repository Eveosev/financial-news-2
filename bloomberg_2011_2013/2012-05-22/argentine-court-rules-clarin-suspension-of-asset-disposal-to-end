Argentina ’s Supreme Court said today
that a suspension of legal limits on media ownership, which may
force Grupo Clarin SA to sell assets, will end Dec. 7.  Clarin, the country’s biggest media company, in December
2009 won a court suspension of an article of a media law
approved two months earlier that would force it to dispose of
some holdings. The Supreme Court today said the suspension lasts
36 months, ending in December, according to the Center of
Justice Information website.  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who backed the
bill, said in 2009 that Clarin holds 73 percent of Argentina’s
radio, television and cable licenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
