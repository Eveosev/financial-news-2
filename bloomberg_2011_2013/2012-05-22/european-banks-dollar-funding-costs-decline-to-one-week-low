The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell to the lowest in more than a week, according to
a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 45 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, from
minus 51 yesterday at 4 p.m. in London. The measure was minus
41.5 basis points on May 4, the cheapest level since July.  “Relative to what we saw over the latter half of 2011 and
early this year, there is now very little evidence of strain on
the European banking sector’s dollar funding operations,” said
Chris Clark, an interest-rate strategist at ICAP Plc in London.  The one-year basis swap was 64.5 basis points below Euribor
from minus 69 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- narrowed to 35 basis points from 39, the lowest since
May 10. A decrease signals banks are less reluctant to lend.  The Euribor/OIS spread held at 38 basis points for the 13th
day, the lowest since Aug. 1.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 768 billion euros ($983
billion) with the bank from 790 billion euros on May 18.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for loans
over that period in euros, fell to 0.681 percent from 0.682
percent. One-week Euribor was unchanged at 0.317 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.467 percent. The three-
month dollar  FRA/OIS spread  was little changed at 45 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
