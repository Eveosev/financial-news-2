Serbia spent 25.3 billion dinars
($282.4 million) of its foreign-currency and dinar reserves kept
with the central bank in April to finance the budget before May
6 elections.  Dinar deposits fell 17.4 billion dinars to 51.8 billion
dinars, a two-month low, and foreign-exchange deposits
contracted 7.9 billion dinars to 70 billion dinars, the lowest
level since January 2011, according to central bank  data .  The government tapped the assets it holds with the
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije as budget revenue shrank and
spending rose, deepening the  budget deficit .  The outgoing Cabinet of Premier Mirko Cvetkovic has turned
to its reserves after agreeing with the  International Monetary
Fund  to freeze a $1.3 billion precautionary loan program and
leave it to the government that emerges from the May 6
parliamentary elections to renew the accord.  The government has not yet published budget figures for
April. The first-quarter budget deficit was 52.7 billion dinars,
compared with an IMF target of 26 billion dinars. The
Washington-based lender set a 61 billion-dinar target for the
end of June.  The first-quarter budget shortfall was equivalent to 6
percent of gross domestic product. Serbia’s 2012 budget targeted
this year’s deficit at 4.25 percent of economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
