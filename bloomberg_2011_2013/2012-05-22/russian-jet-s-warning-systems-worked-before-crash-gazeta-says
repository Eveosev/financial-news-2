Sukhoi hasn’t found any signs of
failure in systems of the SuperJet aircraft which crashed in
 Indonesia  on May 9, killing 45 on board, the government
newspaper  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  said.  The plane’s land-collision warning system was functioning
during the flight and alerted the crew to the danger, the
newspaper said, citing preliminary conclusions by Sukhoi experts
who analyzed the plane’s data recorder.  The jet crashed in mountainous area on its second flight of
the day carrying prospective customers and local journalists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
