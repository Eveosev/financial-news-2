Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest carmaker, plans to expand sales of its low-end Datsun
brand to the  Middle East , Africa, and  Latin America , Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said.  The company plans to sell Datsun cars in those regions
after introducing them in Indonesia, India and Russia starting
in 2014, Ghosn said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Hong
Kong today.  “We’re going to go step by step,” Ghosn said. “It’s
going to be affordable.”  Ghosn is reviving the Datsun brand after three decades to
capture demand for low-end cars in  emerging markets  as part of
Nissan’s plans to increase its share of global vehicle sales to
8 percent by March 2017. Nissan has said it expects Datsun, the
company’s third global brand, to account for as much as half of
its sales in those markets in five years.  Nissan rose 3.8 percent to 771 yen as of 10:44 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
added 1 percent.  In  China , the company plans to produce vehicles at “full-
speed” and stockpiling in the country is “not an issue for
Nissan,” Ghosn said. The Chinese auto market will probably
increase 7 percent to 8 percent this year, Ghosn said.  Ghosn, who’s in Hong Kong today to open the company’s new
Infiniti global headquarters there, reiterated the company’s
plans for Infiniti to account for 10 percent of the global
luxury car market by fiscal 2016.  On the yen, Ghosn said he expects the Japanese currency to
weaken to 80 to 85 yen against the dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
