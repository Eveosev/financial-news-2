The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission told  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  it should
continue providing detailed lending data about its riskier
Spanish clients when it files reports in the U.S.  The market regulator said it was “unable to concur” when
BBVA said it didn’t believe that quantifying its lending risk to
middle and lower-middle income customers and small and medium-
sized companies as a “risk factor” in its annual report would
“provide meaningful information to investors.”  The SEC and  Spain ’s second-biggest bank commented in
correspondence published today about BBVA’s 2010 annual report
filed in the U.S. BBVA, which has a Spanish loan book of more
than 200 billion euros ($254 billion), said residential mortgage
and consumer  loans  made to low and lower-middle income customers
made up 14 percent of the lending and loans to small and medium-
sized companies comprised 6 percent at the end of 2011.  Spanish banks are under pressure to provide more
information about their loan books as doubts about the health of
the financial industry drive up the country’s borrowing costs.
Moody’s Investors Service last week downgraded 16 Spanish banks
including BBVA, citing concerns about increasing soured loans.  BBVA said in its correspondence with the SEC that it would
keep updating the section in its annual report on risk factors
to give information on the breakdown of lending to Spanish
lower-income clients and smaller companies.  A spokesman for BBVA, who asked not to be named in line
with the bank’s policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
