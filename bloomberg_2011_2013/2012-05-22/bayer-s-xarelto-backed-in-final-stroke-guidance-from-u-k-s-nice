The U.K.’s National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence published final guidance
recommending  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Xarelto blood-thinner as a cost-
effective way to prevent strokes in people with an irregular
heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation.  Deciding whether to start treatment with the drug should be
made after the patient and physician have discussed Xarelto’s
risks and benefits compared with warfarin, an older treatment,
the health-cost agency, known as NICE, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
