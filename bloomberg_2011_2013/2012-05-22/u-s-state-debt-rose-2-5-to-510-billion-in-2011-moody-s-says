Tax-supported debt for U.S. states
rose to a net $510 billion in 2011 from $497 billion in 2010,
according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The year-over-year increase of 2.5 percent is down from an
annual rate as high as 10 percent in the previous two years, the
New York-based company said today in a report.  The rate for 2012 will be “comparable or slightly higher
than 2011 levels, but well below the large increases of 2009 and
2010,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
