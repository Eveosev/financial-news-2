Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  led declines among
the most-traded Chinese equities in the U.S. on speculation the
solar-panel maker will  disappoint investors  for a fifth quarter.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. fell 0.9 percent to 92.43
yesterday in New York. Trina,  China ’s fifth-largest solar-panel
maker, tumbled 8.7 percent to a three-year low. Technology
companies  iSoftStone Holdings Ltd. (ISS)  and  VanceInfo Technologies
Inc. (VIT)  sank at least 4 percent.  Trina will probably say that sales dropped 28 percent to
$398 million, according to the median estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, when it reports first-quarter earnings
today. The company reported net income that fell short of
 analysts’ estimates  in the last four quarters. Chinese solar
manufacturers have reported losses since the second quarter of
2011 as the industry has been plagued by overcapacity and as
European countries started to cut solar energy subsidies.  “We’re expecting that the second half of the year will
bring more pain than pleasure, and that Trina will underperform
over the next six months,”  Gordon Johnson , an analyst at Axiom
Capital Management in New York, said by phone. “Their guidance
may not be as good either.”  Nanjing-based solar maker  China Sunergy Co. (CSUN)  said yesterday
in its first-quarter earnings statement that “weak market
demand and industry oversupply will continue to adversely affect
its business during the first half of 2012.”  China ETF Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 0.7 percent to $33.63,
rising only once in the past 15 days. The  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  of mainland stocks advanced 1.1 percent to a three-day
high of 2,373.31.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares was little
changed at 1,316.63, reversing gains in the final hour of
trading as concern that Greece was making preparations to leave
the euro overshadowed economic optimism after a better-than-
estimated American housing report.  Trina, based in Changzhou in China’s eastern Jiangsu
province, fell to $5.33, the lowest level since March 2009.  The company’s  net loss  for the first three months this year
was $20.2 million, compared with $65.8 million in the previous
quarter, the analysts forecast.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s largest solar-panel
maker, dropped 2.5 percent to $1.98, the lowest since Oct. 3.
China Sunergy lost 6 percent to $1.25 in New York after saying
first-quarter revenue decreased 38 percent from the previous
quarter to $68.5 million.  The U.S. imposed tariffs of 31 percent to 250 percent on
Chinese solar-product imports, the Commerce Department announced
on May 17. Suntech was told to pay 31.22 percent, and Trina’s
levies were set at 31.14 percent.  VanceInfo, iSoftStone  American depositary receipts of Beijing-based VanceInfo
slid 5.3 percent to this year’s low of $9.34 while iSoftStone,
an information technology service provider, also based in
Beijing, dropped 4.4 percent to $6.72, the weakest level since
Oct. 7.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI) , based in
 Shanghai , lost 3.2 percent to $2.14, trading 2.3 percent below
its Hong Kong stock. The ADRs, each representing 50 Hong Kong
shares, have been trading with a discount since March 13.  Semiconductor granted 258 million options to buy its shares
at an exercise price of HK$0.346 per share, according to its
filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday.  Guangshen Railway Co. (GSH) , an operator of trains from China’s
province of Guangdong, jumped 4.3 percent in its second day of
advances to $16.70, the biggest one-day gain since Nov. 30.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission and the
railway ministry increased railway cargo transport rates by an
average of 9.5 percent from May 20, the China Securities Journal
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified railway official. The
benchmark coal transport rate was raised to 12.2  yuan  ($1.93)
per ton-kilometer from 10.8 yuan, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
