Japan  must keep its pledge to start
raising the  sales tax  in 2014 to control a public debt forecast
to exceed 220 percent of  gross domestic product  next year, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross public debt will be 223 percent of GDP next year, up
from the projected 214 percent in 2012, “pushing Japan’s public
finances further into uncharted territory,” the Paris-based
OECD said in a report released today.  Raising the 5 percent sales tax levy, which Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  wants to double by 2015, is a “top priority”
for the country and balancing the budget and reducing the public
debt burden is “essential,” the OECD said in the report.
Delays in restoring fiscal health in the world’s third-largest
economy could risk a run-up in government borrowing costs,
according to the report.  The OECD also said the  Bank of Japan (8301)  should continue
monetary easing measures until inflation is “firmly” positive
at the central bank’s target rate of around 1 percent.  Core
consumer prices , which exclude fresh food and are the bank’s
preferred gauge, rose 0.2 percent in March from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
