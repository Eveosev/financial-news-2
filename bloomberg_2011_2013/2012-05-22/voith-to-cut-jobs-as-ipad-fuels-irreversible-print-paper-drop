Voith GmbH, a German maker of
machines for the paper, energy and car industries, will cut 710
jobs as the success of tablet computers such as the iPad prompts
an “irreversible” drop in demand for printed paper.  Voith will eliminate the positions at sites in Germany and
 Austria  as it reviews factories where it makes its largest
machines to print paper, the company said in a statement today.
It plans to combine resources at German-speaking sites to adapt
to the “new market situation,” it said.  The rise of media distribution through smartphones and
tablet computers has led to falling demand for printed magazines
and newspapers, and Voith said it anticipates a “clear
cooling” of the market for graphic paper machines. Business has
also shifted to  Asia , where demand is greater for packaging
machines and where competition is fiercer, reducing the need for
equipment made in  Europe , Voith said.  Voith, based in Heidenheim, said it’s trying to avoid
laying off workers, and will seek to provide employees with
other jobs. While the market for graphic paper is encountering
an “irreversible decline,” demand for tissue paper and
packaging is increasing, Voith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
