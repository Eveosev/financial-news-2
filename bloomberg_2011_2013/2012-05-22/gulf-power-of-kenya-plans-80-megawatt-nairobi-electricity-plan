(Corrects name of company in headline and throughout story
first published on May 22.)  Gulf Energy Ltd., a Kenyan gas-
station operator and fuel importer, plans to build an 80-
megawatt power plant fed by heavy  fuel oil  from July as
electricity use grows at about 14 percent a year in  East
Africa ’s largest economy.  The site in Athi River, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southeast
of Nairobi, is due to be completed by July 2013, Abubakar Ali,
chief financial officer of Gulf Power Ltd., a subsidiary of Gulf
Energy, said in an interview today in Nairobi. Gulf Energy
entered a 20-year power purchase agreement last year with  Kenya
Power Ltd. (KPLL) , the sole electricity distributor, Ali said.  Demand is expected to reach 16,905 megawatts by 2031 from
1,520 megawatts in 2012, the Energy Regulatory Commission says.
Gulf Energy was the biggest private importer of fuel products by
volume in 2010 and 2011 in  Kenya , which has no oil or gas
reserves of its own in commercial production, Ali said.  The company, which has assets of $30 million and generates
about $1.5 billion in annual revenue, also operates in Uganda
and  Rwanda , and plans to expand into  Tanzania  this year followed
by Zambia and the east of  Democratic Republic  of Congo, he said.  About three-quarters of the 80 million-euro project will be
debt-financed. International Finance Corp., a unit of the World
Bank, the OPEC Fund for International Development and Standard
Bank Group Ltd. are each lending 20 million euros ($26 million).  Gulf Energy will raise the same in equity with a partner,
Ali said, declining to name the company as talks continue.  Risk Guarantee  The World Bank is providing a partial risk guarantee in
support of the project, he said. The site will be developed on a
build-own-operate contract for 20 years, according to the IFC.  The company also plans to open its newly built, $12 million
storage facility with capacity to hold 3 million liters (790,000
gallons) of petroleum products and 450 metric tons of gas stocks
in Nairobi in the second-half of this year, Ali said.  Gulf Energy is in talks with IFC on plans to sell liquefied
petroleum gas in units of as low as 200 grams (7 ounces), making
it easier to offer to low earners, he said. The  World Bank 
estimates 45 percent of Kenyans live on $1.25 a day or less.  “We have a lot people using charcoal and kerosene because
they can’t afford the equipment and to buy gas in 6-kilogram and
13-kilogram” canisters, Ali said. “This would be affordable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
