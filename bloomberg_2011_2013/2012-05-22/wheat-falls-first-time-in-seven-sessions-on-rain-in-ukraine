Wheat fell for the first time in
seven sessions on speculation that rain in parts of  Ukraine  and
 Russia  will ease concern about crop damage from dry weather.  Temperatures are also expected to decline in Ukraine,
according to the Meteorology Center in Kiev. That will benefit
wheat that’s at the critical stage when the head of the plant
that contains the grain emerges, Telvent DTN said today in a
report. Some rain is also expected in grain-growing areas of
Russia, Telvent said.  “There’s talk about a little scattered rain in Ukraine,”
said Jim Hemminger, a risk-management specialist at Top Third Ag
Marketing in  Chicago . “Wheat is so fickle, if it does get a
little rain” it can rebound from dry conditions, he said.  Wheat futures for July delivery dropped 1.2 percent to
$6.9525 a bushel at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price gained 18 percent in the previous six sessions as hot, dry
weather curbed production in the U.S. southern Great Plains and
in the  Black Sea region  that includes parts of Russia and
Ukraine.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
