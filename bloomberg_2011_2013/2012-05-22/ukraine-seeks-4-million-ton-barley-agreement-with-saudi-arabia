Ukraine is seeking to reach agreement
with  Saudi Arabia  on supplying as much as 4 million metric tons
of barley to the Middle East country, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  Saudi officials will arrive in Ukraine next month to
discuss an accord, Prysyazhnyuk said in a statement e-mailed
yesterday.  Ukraine aims to almost double grain shipments to Saudi
Arabia to 7 million tons, the minister said in March, without
giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
