Mauritius’s central bank has limited
leeway to cut its benchmark  interest rate , said Ridle Markus, a
strategist at Absa Capital.  “We do not believe that there will be significant further
reductions in the policy rate, though there may be scope for a
smaller reduction of perhaps 50 basis points at its June 11
meeting to 4.4 percent,” Markus said in an interview on May 21
in Ebene, south of  Port Louis , the capital.  The Indian Ocean island nation cut its economic growth
forecast for this year to 3.6 percent from 4 percent in March
because of declining demand in  Europe , its main trade partner.
The central bank has reduced its benchmark rate by 0.6
percentage point since December to 4.9 percent.  “The uncertainties and risks related to the  euro zone 
suggest that growth concern may rise relative to inflation,”
Markus said.  Inflation in April was little changed at 3.84 percent, the
lowest for 18 months. It may accelerate to about 4.6 percent by
year-end, Markus said. The rupee has weakened 0.7 percent
against the dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
