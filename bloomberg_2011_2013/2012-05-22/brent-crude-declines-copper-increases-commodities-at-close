The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.3 percent to 620.51 at 5:30 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials increased
0.5 percent to 1,474.685.  CRUDE OIL  Oil advanced for a third day in New York on signs that
voters in  Greece  may back austerity measures needed for a
European Union bailout, boosting confidence that the bloc’s debt
crisis can be contained.  Crude for July delivery increased as much as $1.04 to
$91.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $91.74 at 8:56 a.m. London time. The
contract rose 0.2 percent to $90.86 on May 25, the highest close
since May 22. Prices are down 7.2 percent this year. There will
be no floor trading in  New York  today because of the Memorial
Day holiday.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas extended its decline in New York amid forecasts
that cooler weather will follow a heat wave, limiting demand for
fuel at  power plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell 37 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $15.05 a barrel at 10:09 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
spread is at the narrowest since March 27.  Singapore gasoil swaps for June rose 15 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $119.25 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s
premium to gasoil was unchanged at $1.25 a barrel. This spread
between the fuels, also known as the regrade, is 67 percent
wider than it was a week earlier, signaling it is more
profitable for refiners to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  PRECIOUS METALS  BASE METALS  Copper for three-month delivery gained 1.2 percent to
$7,731 a metric ton by 10:01 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices are down 8 percent this month, on course for the biggest
drop since September. July-delivery copper rose 1.2 percent to
$3.4885 a pound on the Comex in New York, where floor trading is
shut today for the Memorial Day holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
