INA  Industrije Nafte d.d., the
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol  Nyrt,, announced
the start of an oil and gas research project in Croatia worth
500 million kuna ($84 million).  The project in Ivanicgrad, east of the capital Zagreb, will
be using enhanced oil-recovery techniques to produce an
additional 3.4 million tons of oil and 500 million cubic meters
of gas over the next 24 years, management board head Zoltan
Aldott said, adding that 500 million kuna will be invested in
the next three years, and a total of 1.1 billion kuna by 2022.  Economy Minister Radimir Cacic said at the same conference

percent. He also said the company’s “two partners” agreed to
hold on to the company’s retained profit ahead of a shareholders
meeting scheduled for June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
