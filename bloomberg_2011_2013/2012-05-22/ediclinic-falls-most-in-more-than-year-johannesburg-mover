Mediclinic International Ltd. (MDC) 
declined the most in more than a year after earnings per share
for the 12 months through March missed expectations.  Shares in South Africa’s second-largest publicly traded
private hospital group by market value fell 3 percent to 37.40
rand at in the close in Johannesburg, the biggest decline since
April 2011.  Diluted earnings per share adjusted for one-time items
increased 6.4 percent to 187.5 cents from a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today, missing the 211.5 cent median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The hospitals in Berne,  Switzerland , “have faced a number
of challenges, but the worst is over and in the next six to 12
months should be sorted,” Mediclinic Switzerland Chief
Executive Officer Ole Wiesinger said today in a telephone
interview from Stellenbosch,  South Africa .  Mediclinic’s net income climbed to 1.22 billion rand ($148
million) for 12 months through March 31 from 1.18 billion rand a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today as sales
rose 18 percent. Switzerland accounted for 46 percent of the
company’s revenue in 2011, according compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
