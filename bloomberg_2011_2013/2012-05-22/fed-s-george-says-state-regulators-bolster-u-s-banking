President Esther George said the U.S. banking industry and
economy have benefited from having both federal and state
supervisors.  “I’ve seen no evidence that other regulatory structures,
including single regulator models, fared better in the most
recent crisis,” George said today to the Conference of State
Bank Supervisors in Savannah,  Georgia . Criticism that dual
regulatory systems create incentives for lax examinations is
“without merit,” she said. George didn’t comment on monetary
policy or the outlook for the  U.S. economy .  After the 2008 credit crisis, Congress preserved the
separate state and federal supervisory systems, including
oversight by the Fed regional banks, as part of a strengthening
of regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in a Feb. 16 speech urged
supervisors to “insist on high standards for lending, risk
management and governance” to “protect banks from a possible
race to the bottom and new problems down the road.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
