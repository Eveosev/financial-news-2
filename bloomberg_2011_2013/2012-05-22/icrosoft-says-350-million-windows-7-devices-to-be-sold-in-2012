Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  expects 350 million
devices running its Windows 7 software to be shipped globally
this year as it prepares the next version of the operating
system to challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s dominance in tablet computers.  “It makes Windows the most popular single system,”  Steve Ballmer , chief executive officer of Microsoft, the world’s
largest software maker, said today. Ballmer, who spoke at a
forum in Seoul, didn’t provide comparative figures.  Corporate demand for programs including Windows 7 helped
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft report third-quarter profit
last month that exceeded estimates. The company is working on
Windows 8, the newest version of the operating system that can
be used in touch-screen devices, to help win back consumers and
narrow Apple’s lead in the market for tablet computers.  Microsoft will finish work on Windows 8 this summer and put
it on sale around October, people with knowledge of the matter
said in March.  The release of Windows 8 and demand for ultrabooks and
other thin notebooks should drive personal-computer sales in the
second half of this year, after modest shipment growth in the
first six months, IDC said in March. Global PC shipments will
rise 5 percent in 2012 after gaining 1.8 percent last year, the
market researcher said.  More than 103 million tablet devices will be sold in 2012,
with sales tripling to 326.3 million in 2015, according to
Gartner Inc. Apple is set to account for two-thirds of the
market in 2012, Gartner estimates. The company’s share will drop
to 46 percent by 2015, while Microsoft’s will climb to 11
percent.  Apple introduced the third-generation iPad in March,
raising pressure on Microsoft to recover sales lost to the Apple
device and revitalize slowing PC sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
