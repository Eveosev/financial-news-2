Euro-area officials need to do more
to show  Greece  that there is an alternative to giving up the
single currency,  Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development  Secretary General Jose Angel Gurria said.  “We cannot do anything about what the Greek voters decide,
but I don’t think we’ve been strong enough and clear enough in
terms of demonstrating that there is an alternative,” Gurria
told reporters today in Paris. “Are we offering the necessary
safety net and therefore a way not out of the euro but out of
the crisis? I think we can do better.”  European leaders gather tomorrow in Brussels to seek ways
to stem a sovereign debt crisis that is now in its third year as
Greek voters prepare to go to the polls again next month
following an inconclusive election on May 6. The euro has
dropped more than 3 percent against the dollar this month on
concern that Greece may opt to leave the 17-nation region.  Gurria said that the  European Central Bank  in particular
would reap gains by showing more firepower now rather than
waiting to use it until after a “hypothetical” Greek exit.  As to concern about “encouraging people to misbehave” by
offering more support, “frankly, we’ve gone way beyond that,”
he said. “You need to make the markets understand that you are
going to do whatever it takes to maintain this stability.  Europe 
has the capacity, it has the wealth. Europe is going to emerge
stronger from this, but in the meantime it’s got to face the
music.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
