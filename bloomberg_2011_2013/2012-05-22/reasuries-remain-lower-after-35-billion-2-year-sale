    May 22 (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fell on reduced demand for
haven assets before European leaders meet tomorrow in Brussels
to address the region’s fiscal crisis.  U.S. 10-year note yields rose for a third day, the longest
streak in two months after falling to almost record lows last
week. Treasuries remained lower even as the U.S. sale of $35
billion in two-year notes was met with stronger-than-average
demand. The U.S. will sell five-year notes tomorrow, the second
of three auctions totaling $99 billion.  “The market has been a little ahead of itself and as such
is a little overbought,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate
strategist in  New York  at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of 21
primary dealers that are required to bid at the auctions. “A
lot of that sentiment is driven by headlines from across the
pond.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.79 percent at 2:24 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 declined 14/32, or $4.38 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 20/32.  The yield dropped to 1.6886 percent on May 17, approaching
the record low 1.6714 percent set Sept. 23. It declined 12 basis
points last week.  Fewer Bullish Bets  Treasuries investors cut bets the securities will advance,
and raised neutral and short positions this week, according to a
weekly survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The percent of “net longs” dropped to four percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, from 11 percentage points
the previous week when it reached the highest level in more than
two months. The number of outright longs dropped to 21 percent
in the week ending yesterday, from 26 percent, the survey
showed.  The  yield  on the current two-year note rose one basis
point to 0.29 percent. The securities sold today drew a yield of
0.300 percent, matching the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.95, the
most since a record high 4.07 in November, and compared with an
average of 3.62 for the past 10 sales.  Auction Demand  “It was a tremendous auction,” said  Ray Remy , head of
fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.,
one of the primary dealers obligated to bid in U.S. debt
auctions. “The most important factor driving demand is the
European situation.”  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.5 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 33.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 12.9 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  U.S. two-year notes have gained 0.03 percent this year,
compared with a 1.3 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury is due to auction $35 billion of five-year
securities tomorrow and sell $29 billion of seven-year debt on
May 24. This week’s note offerings, combined with the May 17
auction of $13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $52.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.1 billion.  German Zeros  Germany  will borrow for free at a sale of two-year
government notes tomorrow, betting it can lure buyers seeking a
haven from the  European debt crisis .  Germany, the only country in the euro area with a stable
outlook on its AAA rating, will sell as much as 5 billion euros
($6.4 billion) of two-year notes carrying a zero-percent coupon,
a record low, Bundesbank data showed today. That’s down from a
fixed interest payment of 0.25 percent at the previous sale of
similar-maturity notes on April 18.  European Union leaders are scheduled to meet tomorrow in
Brussels amid speculation  Greece  will quit the euro. They plan
to address the region’s fiscal crisis, damping demand for the
safest securities.  “There’s hope in  Europe  with the meeting tomorrow,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA Inc. “The market has only been able to be long
because of the headline risk in Europe. You get to levels where
you just can’t sustain those moves, and we’re at those levels.”  Yield Forecast  The yield on the 10-year note will end the year at 2.4
percent, according to the median forecast of 69 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Purchases of previously owned houses, tabulated when a
contract closes, increased 3.4 percent to a 4.62 million annual
rate, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a rise to a 4.61 million rate.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents expectations
for the rate of inflation during the life of the securities,
increased for a third day. It climbed to as much as 2.21
percentage points today, the most since May 8.  Volatility yesterday dropped to 69.1 basis points from 70.6
basis points on May 18, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury price swings based
on options. The gauge is below the one-year average of 87.94
basis points.  Trading  volume  dropped yesterday to the lowest since May
11. About $166 billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker. The average in 2012
is $242 billion. Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the
highest since August.  The Fed sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries due from March to
September 2013 as part of its $400 billion debt-swap program,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
