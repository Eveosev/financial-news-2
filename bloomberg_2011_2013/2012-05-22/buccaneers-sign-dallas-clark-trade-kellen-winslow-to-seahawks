The  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  made a
change at tight end, signing free agent Dallas Clark to a one-
year contract and trading Kellen Winslow Jr. to the Seattle
Seahawks for an undisclosed draft pick in 2013.  Clark, 32, joins the Buccaneers after spending the past
nine seasons in Indianapolis, where he missed 15 games the past
two seasons. Clark was a top target for  Peyton Manning  and had
427 receptions for 4,887 yards and 46 touchdowns in 115 games
for the Colts.  “Clark is a consummate pro and proven playmaker,”
Buccaneers General Manager Mark Dominik said in a statement.  Winslow, 28, spent the past three seasons with Tampa Bay,
starting 40 of 48 games. He recorded 218 receptions for 2,377
yards and 12 touchdowns for the Buccaneers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
