OAO Rosneft rose the most in almost
two weeks after Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  said he
ordered Rosneftâ€™s board to appoint  Igor Sechin  as chief
executive officer.  Rosneft jumped 1.7 percent to 198.34 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest gain since May 11. The 30-stock Micex Index
rose 0.2 percent to 1,301.09. Rosneft has the fourth-largest
weighting on the index at 7 percent.  Rosneft will boost output and payments to the budget and
make its offshore projects a priority, Sechin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
