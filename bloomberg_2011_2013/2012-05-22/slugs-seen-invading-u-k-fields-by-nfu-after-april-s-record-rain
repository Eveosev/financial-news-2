U.K. farmers and growers should
prepare for a surge in damaging slugs in their fields this
summer after the wettest April on record created “ideal
conditions” for reproduction, the National Farmers Union said.  Slugs cause an estimated 8 million pounds ($13 million) of
damage to U.K. horticulture due to lost output, the NFU wrote in
a statement on its website today. In grain crops, a single slug
can kill 50 wheat seeds in the first week after planting,
according to the farm group.  The U.K. had its wettest April in records dating back to
1910, improving conditions for crops after a dry winter period.
Slugs, which can live six to 18 months, usually lay more eggs
after autumn and spring rains, according to the Pacific
Northwest  Insect Management  Handbook.  “April to May is an important peak of the breeding
cycle,” David Glen, a slug specialist with Styloma Research and
Consulting, was cited as saying by the NFU. “With conditions as
they are, slug activity will be very high, so populations are
primed to increase significantly.”  U.K. slug populations have grown in the past 20 years as
farmers preferred winter-sown crops, increased the area planted
with rapeseed and switched to cultivation techniques that reduce
tilling, according to the NFU.  Tilling and using slug pellets can control the pests,
according to the NFU. Farmers should consider applying pellets
around the time of planting, according to Glen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
