Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s third-biggest bank by market value, fell for a
third day and headed for its biggest decline in more than nine
months.  The stock dropped as much as 7.5 percent and was trading
6.4 percent lower at 22 shillings by 12:01 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. A close at that level would mark the largest fall since
Aug. 9.  “It is trading ex-dividend from today and most investors
are selling,” Davis Mika, a Nairobi-based independent stock
analyst, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
