Ural Mining & Metallurgical Co.,
 Russia ’s largest copper producer, won rights to the Elanskoye
nickel deposit in the Voronezh region, beating a bid by OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel, RIA Novosti reported.  Norilsk withdrew its bid for a second Voronezh deposit at
Elkinskoye following the decision, the company said today in an
e-mailed statement. Ural Mining declined to comment immediately.
A call to the offices of Voronezhnedra, which held the tender
for the deposits, went unanswered outside of normal hours.  The deposits in Russia’s last large untapped mining
province contain as much as 448,000 million metric tons of
nickel resources and 60,000 tons of copper.  Norilsk, Russia’s largest mining company, said on Feb. 27
it may bid for the deposits and invest as much as 50 billion
rubles ($1.6 billion) in their development.  To contact the reporters on this story:
