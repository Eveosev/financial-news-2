City Gate, an Australian-owned
shopping center in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, filed for
protection from creditors as it seeks to reorganize,  Imerisia 
reported.  APN Property Group Ltd. (APD) , which invested more than 80
million euros ($102 million) to build City Gate and has filled
only 55 percent of the space, wants to sell the mall eventually,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
