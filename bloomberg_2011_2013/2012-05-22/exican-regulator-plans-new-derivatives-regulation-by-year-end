Securities Commission is working on new regulations for over-
the-counter derivatives to comply with Group of 20 guidelines,
spokesman Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma said.  The changes will probably be ready this year and don’t
require congressional approval, Lopez-Moctezuma said today in an
e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
