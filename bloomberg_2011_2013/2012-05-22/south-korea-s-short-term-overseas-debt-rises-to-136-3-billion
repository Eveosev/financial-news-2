South  Korea ’s short-term overseas
debt rose in the first quarter as foreign investors purchased
Korean bonds amid Europe’s worsening sovereign-debt crisis.  External debt maturing in one year or less gained $169
million to $136.3 billion as of the end of March from a quarter
earlier, the Bank of Korea said in a statement today. Long-term
external debt increased to $275.1 billion from a revised $262.2
billion in the fourth quarter.  Today’s statement from the Bank of Korea comes after the
country’s currency dropped last week by the most in almost eight
months amid concern a political impasse in  Greece  may deepen
Europe’s debt crisis.  “The Bank of Korea will work closely with the government
to limit the risk,” today’s central bank statement said.  The  finance ministry  will “preemptively” act against any
external risks while closely monitoring changes in external debt
and capital flows, the ministry said in a separate statement
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
