OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s biggest
bank, is seeking to double its share in the Ukrainian consumer-
loan market this year as part of its expansion in the eastern
European country.  OTP, which entered Ukraine in 2006 and has subsidiaries in
nine countries in central and eastern  Europe , is relying on its
foreign units to boost profitability as domestic operations are
hampered by Hungary’s regulator policies and weaker forint.  “We’re focusing on consumer loans,” Tamas Hak-Kovacs,
appointed the chief executive officer of OTP’s Ukrainian unit in
March, told reporters in Kiev today. Consumer loans are going to
be the main strategy for the retail business, he said.  The lender may double its share in the Ukrainian consumer
loan market by the fourth quarter of 2012 from around 12 percent
a year earlier, Hak-Kovacs said. The bank will also continue
developing services for corporate clients, he said.  “We’re extremely committed to  Ukraine ,” Istvan Hamecz,
chairman of the unit’s supervisory board said. “We have money,
capital and liquidity to support” Ukrainian operations, he
said, adding the unit has no plans to increase capital.  The bank plans to keep its network of branches at 155 this
year, Hak-Kovacs said. This year’s profit may decline from 2011,
he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
