Former Australia rugby captain
Michael Lynagh said he’s been cleared to fly back to the U.K.
after suffering a stroke last month that his doctor said could
have killed him.  Lynagh, the Wallabies’ leading points scorer in
international rugby, was released from the Royal Brisbane and
Women’s Hospital on May 2 after falling ill April 16 while
catching up with friends in his former hometown.  “I have been given the all clear to fly home to  London ,”
Lynagh, 48, said today on his Twitter account. “I am hopeful
that this will happen towards the end of next week.”  Lynagh, a World Cup winner with the Wallabies in 1991,
spent six days in intensive care last month after he suffered a
cerebellar and occipital lobe stroke that was caused by a split
in an artery wall at the back of the right side of his neck. He
said he began to feel unwell after choking on a gulp of a beer
and laughing at the same time.  Rob Henderson , a neurologist who has been treating Lynagh,
said May 2 that such a severe stroke can be fatal.  Former fly-half Lynagh scored a record 911 points in 72
Tests for the Wallabies before retiring in 1995 as the
international game’s leading scorer. His world record tally
lasted until 1999, when it was surpassed by  Wales ’ Neil Jenkins.  Since retiring from all rugby in 1998, Lynagh has worked in
marketing and as a rugby analyst for U.K. broadcasters including
 Sky Sports . He lives in London with his wife and children.  “I am looking forward to getting back,” Lynagh added.
“All I am interested in is seeing my kids and my wife.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
