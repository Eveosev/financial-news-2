The pound extended a decline against
the dollar and 10-year gilts pared their losses after the
 International Monetary Fund  said Britain requires further
monetary easing to boost the economy.  The pound was 0.4 percent weaker at $1.5777 at 10:13 a.m.
London time. It fell to $1.5733 last week, the lowest level
since March 16. Sterling was little changed at 80.91 pence per
euro.  The  10-year gilt  yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.86 percent. The yield earlier rose to as
high as 1.90 percent.  The Bank of England needs to inject more stimulus into the
U.K. economy through more bond purchases or by cutting  interest
rates  as “large” risks from the euro-area crisis may derail
growth and inflationary pressures remain weak, the IMF said in
its annual review of the U.K. published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
