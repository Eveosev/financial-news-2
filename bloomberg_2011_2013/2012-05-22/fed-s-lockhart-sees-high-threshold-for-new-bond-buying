President  Dennis Lockhart  said the  U.S. economy  would need to
deteriorate further to warrant additional asset purchases, or
so-called quantitative easing, by the Fed.  “The bar for initiating another round of quantitative
easing should remain high,” Lockhart said today in response to
questions after a speech in Hong Kong. In order to support more
bond buying, “I would have to see a serious deterioration of
the economy,” such as “real layoffs, real job destruction” or
the threat of falling prices, he said.  Several  Fed policy makers  said a loss of momentum in growth
or increased risks to their economic outlook could prompt
additional action to spur the recovery, minutes of their April
24-25 meeting showed last week.  The U.S. jobless rate will probably fall slightly below 8
percent by the end of this year, Lockhart said.  The economy confronts headwinds including household
deleveraging and a “major drag” from housing on “consumer
thinking,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
