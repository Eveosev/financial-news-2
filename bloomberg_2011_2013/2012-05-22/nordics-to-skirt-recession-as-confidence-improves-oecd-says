The Nordic region will avoid a
recession, led by growth in  Norway  and Iceland as consumers and
investments buoy an expansion amid sliding exports.  Growth in the largest Nordic economy,  Sweden , will slow to
0.6 percent this year from 4 percent in 2011, while Finnish
output will abate to 0.9 percent and an expansion in  Denmark 
will recede to 0.8 percent, the Paris-based group said. Growth
in mainland Norway will accelerate to 2.7 percent and Iceland’s
expansion will reach 3.1 percent.  “The stance of monetary policy ought to remain
accommodative,” the OECD said of Sweden. “Thanks to steadfast
fiscal discipline in the past, Sweden now has room for
discretionary stimulus, which might be warranted if growth turns
out to be significantly weaker than expected.”  The region is withstanding a potential recession in the 17-
member euro bloc as fiscal health allows the countries to
largely avoid the austerity that is sapping growth in southern
 Europe . The Nordic countries, with the exception of  Finland , are
all outside the euro area.  Swedish unemployment  will rise to 7.6 percent this year
from 7.5 percent in 2011, and increase to 7.9 percent from 7.8
percent  in Finland , the OECD forecast. The  Danish jobless rate 
will rise to 7.6 percent from 7.4 percent, it said. In Norway,
unemployment will hold at 3.3 percent.  Norwegian economic growth  is picking up as it benefits from
being the world’s seventh-largest crude exporter, the OECD said.
Iceland’s economy will grow as the smallest Nordic country
recovers from a 6.8 percent slump in 2009 after its banks
defaulted on $85 billion in 2008.  Growth will accelerate in the four largest  Nordic countries 
next year, the OECD said. Swedish growth in 2013 will be 2.8
percent, Finland will expand 2.0 percent, Denmark 1.4 percent,
mainland Norway, which excludes oil and gas production, will
grow 3.6 percent. Iceland will expand 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
