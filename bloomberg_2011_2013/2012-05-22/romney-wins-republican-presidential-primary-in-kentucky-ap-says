Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee  Mitt Romney  won the Kentucky primary, according to the
Associated Press, the first of two nomination contests held
today.  Polls close later tonight in Arkansas with Romney favored
to win. In an AP tally, Romney began the day with 992 delegates
of the 1,144 needed to win the nomination at the Republican
National Convention Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida. A total of 75
delegates were at stake in todayâ€™s primaries.  The former Massachusetts governor may surpass the required
number on May 29, when 152 delegates are awarded in the Texas
primary. The presidential primaries end June 26 when Utah votes.  With 65 percent of precincts reporting in Kentucky, Romney
had 67 percent of the vote, according to the AP. Representative
 Ron Paul  of Texas, whose son Rand was elected to the Senate from
Kentucky in 2010, had 12 percent, followed by former Senator
Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania with 9 percent and former U.S.
House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  with 6 percent.  The results in the Democratic primary underscored the
political difficulties President  Barack Obama  faces in Kentucky,
which he lost by 16 percentage points to Republican John McCain
in 2008. With 65 percent of precincts reporting, Obama had 60
percent of the vote to 40 percent for an uncommitted slate of
delegates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
