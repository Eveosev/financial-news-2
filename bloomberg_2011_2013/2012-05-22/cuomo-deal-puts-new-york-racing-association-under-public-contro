New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  struck
a deal with the New York Racing Association, which runs the
state’s three biggest horse-racing tracks, to put the nonprofit
corporation under temporary public control.  The agreement reached today gives the governor the
authority to nominate a chairman and reduces NYRA’s governing
board to 17 from 25, giving the majority of appointments to
public officials, Cuomo said. After three years, the board will
revert back to private control.  “There have been a series of episodes that have shaken the
public trust and this is meant to restore the public trust,”
Cuomo said today at a press conference in  Albany , the capital.
“We know long-term this is not a venture for public government
to run.”  The Cuomo administration is investigating the racing
association after a report by the Racing and Wagering Board
found $8.5 million in winnings didn’t go to bettors because
management miscalculated the payouts over a 15-month period.  Cuomo, a 54-year-old Democrat, said reorganizing the board
also might help better develop the horse-racing industry, which
brings $2.4 billion each year to the state. Previously, the
board was mostly picked by NYRA, which operates the Aqueduct,
Belmont and Saratoga tracks.  Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Republican, and
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, have both agreed to
the changes and said their houses will approve a bill that’s
forthcoming.  To contact the reporter on this story:
