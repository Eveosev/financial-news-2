Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
added state stakes in the country’s hydropower generator,
electricity grid operator and distributors, and one share of OAO
Rosneft, to a list of strategic assets that precludes their
sale, Interfax reported, citing a government decree.  Putin signed an order yesterday listing the state’s 60.4
percent of OAO RusHydro, 79.5 percent of Federal Grid Co., 53.7
percent of OAO MRSK Holding, the managing company for
interregional electricity distributors, and 100 percent of OAO
System Operator, the Moscow-based news service said.  The government doesn’t exclude selling a stake in OAO
Rosneftegaz, which owns the state’s 75.2 percent stake in
Rosneft and 10.7 percent of OAO Gazprom, Interfax said, citing
Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
