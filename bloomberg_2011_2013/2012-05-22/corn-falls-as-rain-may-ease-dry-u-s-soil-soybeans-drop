Corn fell the most in more than four
months and soybeans declined to the lowest in seven weeks on
speculation that rain will improve prospects for newly planted
crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  As much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain forecast from
May 23 to May 24 will boost soil moisture from  South Dakota  to
 Iowa  before moving east into Illinois and  Wisconsin , Global
Weather Monitoring said in a report today. A second storm will
reach the Midwest beginning May 28. About 77 percent of U.S.
 corn  was in good or excellent condition on May 20, the highest
since 2007, the government said.  “The market is focused on the weather, and timely rains
the next three weeks will quickly boost the odds in favor of a
big corn harvest,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin, said in
a telephone interview. “These wetter forecasts are keeping
pressure on the markets today.”  Corn futures for July delivery plunged 5.7 percent to close
at $5.97 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the biggest drop since Jan. 12. Last week, the most-active
contract jumped 9.4 percent on speculation that hot, dry weather
will threaten U.S. production. Corn for December delivery, after
the harvest, retreated 3.4 percent to $5.22.  Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 2.1 percent to
$13.8225 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $13.75, the lowest
since March 30. The contract for delivery in November, after the
harvest, slid 1.8 percent to $12.8225.  Chinese Demand  Prices also fell on slowing Chinese demand for U.S.
supplies, said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity
Analytics & Consulting. There were no overnight sales
announcements from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Yesterday, the department said corn inspected for export in the
week ended May 17 fell 16 percent to 23.26 million bushels, the
lowest since January.  The  premium  paid for corn delivered to export terminals
near  New Orleans  fell 9 cents to an average of 78 cents over
July futures from 87 cents yesterday, USDA data show. Soybean
premiums fell 3 cents to 54 cents over July futures, the third
straight decline.  Pork prices in  China , the biggest hog producer and top
importer of soybeans, fell 1 percent last week, the 16th
straight decline, Xinhua news agency reported today, citing
Ministry of Commerce data. Corn is used in livestock feed.  “The trade expects that China is not going to be the
demand base for agricultural imports that they have been the
last 18 months,” Zuzolo said in a telephone interview.
“Trading funds are liquidating long positions in the grain
markets.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
