The Slovak government will probably
cut the amount of retirement savings citizens channel to private
funds as it seeks to narrow the  budget deficit ,  Pravda  reported,
citing Deputy Labor Minister Jozef Burian.  The country “can’t afford” to let private pension funds
collect as much as 9 percent of monthly wages as such outflow is
boosting the deficit of the public welfare system, the newspaper
quoted Burian as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
