European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny expects “difficult times” ahead.  “We will face some difficult times ahead,” Nowotny told
bankers and investors in Vienna today. “We won’t see a
turnaround from one day to the other.”  Nowotny said he hoped the Greek elections next month would
create a “sensible solution” for the Mediterranean country and
give the European Union “a partner who is capable of action.”
He declined to comment whether  Greece  would have to leave the
euro area.  Austria ’s central bank, which Nowotny heads, will probably
raise its economic forecast for the Alpine republic to 1 percent
from 0.7 percent, he also said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
