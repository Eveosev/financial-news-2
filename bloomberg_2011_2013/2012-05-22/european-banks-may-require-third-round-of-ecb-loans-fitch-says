The likelihood southern European
banks will require a third round of emergency three-year loans
from the  European Central Bank  is increasing as  Greece ’s debt
crisis worsens,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “If a third Longer Term Refinancing Operation is needed,
we believe it will be provided,” James Longsdon, a managing
director at Fitch’s financial institutions group in London,
wrote in a report today. The timing is “unlikely to be imminent
without a further significant shock, such as a Greek exit from
the euro.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB began the LTRO after bank funding
markets froze and yields on southern European government debt
hit euro-era records last year. Lenders in the region borrowed
489 billion euros ($623 billion) in December and a further 530
billion euros in February, according to the central bank.  The move initially helped boost bank  stocks  and ease
concern about lenders’ creditworthiness. The 43-member Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index rallied as much as 23
percent from the announcement of the LTRO on Dec. 8 to March 19.
The benchmark has since erased that gain. Similarly, the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index, which measures the cost of insuring the
senior debt of 25 European banks against default, fell to a low
of 181.472 in March, before increasing to 308.398 on May 18, the
highest since Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
