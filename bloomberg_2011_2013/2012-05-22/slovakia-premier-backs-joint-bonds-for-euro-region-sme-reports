Slovakia supports the idea of
introducing joint euro-area bonds as a means of preventing the
regionâ€™s debt crisis from spreading,  Sme  reported, citing Prime
Minister  Robert Fico .  The eastern euro-region member will back a proposal for
joint bond issuance should French President  Francois Hollande 
raise it at the next European Union summit, the newspaper quoted
Fico as saying. He also said he will support measures aimed at
supporting economic growth as well as a financial-transaction
tax, Sme reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
