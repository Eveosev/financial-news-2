Finland’s government raised its
borrowing estimate for this year as it announced a capital
transfer to the European crisis fund.  Borrowing will be a net 8.7 billion euros ($11.1 billion)
this year, up from 7.5 billion euros announced March 22, the
government said on its website today. Government debt is
expected to be at 45 percent of gross domestic product at the
end of 2012.  The biggest spending increase in the proposal is the
capital transfer of 1.4 billion euros to European Stability
Mechanism, set to start operation by July 1.  The proposal will be sent to parliament and published in
its entirety on May 24. The preliminary date for parliament’s
vote on the proposal is set on June 19, parliament spokesman
Sami Pekola said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
