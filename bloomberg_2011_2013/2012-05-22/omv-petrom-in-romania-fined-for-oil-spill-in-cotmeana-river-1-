OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,  Romania ’s biggest oil
company, said a broken pipe caused an oil spill in the Cotmeana
river in Arges county, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of
Bucharest, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The Bucharest-based company said 500 liters (132 gallons)
of crude oil was accidentally spilled and it plans to clean it
up today.  “The incident was immediately reported to environmental
authorities and the first measures were taken to limit the
pollution and to remove its effects,” the company said.  Petrom was fined 100,000 lei ($28,600) for the spill by the
country’s environmental watchdog. The  Environment Ministry  asked
for a review of the oil fields and the pipeline network to avoid
such accidents in the future, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
