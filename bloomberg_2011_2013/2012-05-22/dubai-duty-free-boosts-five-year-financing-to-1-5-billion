Dubai Duty Free boosted a loan to
$1.5 billion after lenders offered to provide the airport
retailer with more than the $1.1 billion originally sought, Colm
McLoughlin, executive chairman of the company, said.  The five-year facility will be used to develop Dubai
International Airport and may pay interest at 350 basis points
over benchmark rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It is made up of conventional and Islamic portions and banks can
lend in U.S. dollars or U.A.E. Dirhams.  Emirates NBD PJSC, Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, HSBC Bank Plc,
Citigroup Inc.,  Abu Dhabi  Commercial Bank PJSC and  Abu Dhabi
Islamic Bank  are involved in the transaction, which is due to
complete in the next few weeks, McLoughlin said.  Dubai Duty Free, which began operations in 1983, operates
18,000 square meters of retail space at Dubai International
Airport. This will grow by a further 8,000 square meters with
the opening of concourse 3, which is due to take place next
year, according to the companyâ€™s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
