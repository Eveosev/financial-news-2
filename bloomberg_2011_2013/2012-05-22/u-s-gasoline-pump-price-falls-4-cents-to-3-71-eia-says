Retail gasoline  in the U.S. fell
below year-earlier levels for a fifth week after oil futures in
 New York  touched a six-month low, dragged down by concern that
 Europe ’s debt troubles will curb fuel demand.  The national average price for regular gasoline dropped 4
cents to $3.714 a gallon from a week earlier, the Energy
Information Administration said in the report posted on the its
website. The price is down 3.5 percent from a year earlier and
the lowest since Feb. 20.  “Crude’s fallen 31 cents a gallon in three weeks, and
gasoline prices are down 12 cents,”  David Hackett , president of
Stillwater Associates, an independent fuel consultant, said in a
telephone interview yesterday from  Irvine ,  California . “If oil
continues to bounce around $92 or $93 a barrel, gasoline prices
will come off at least another 15 cents a gallon.”  Gasoline at the pump has tumbled 23 cents, or 5.8 percent,
since peaking at $3.941 on April 2 as refineries restored
service following seasonal maintenance and oil trades under $100
a barrel for the first time in three months.  Average U.S.  gasoline demand for the four weeks  ended May
11 dropped 2.6 percent from a year earlier to 8.76 million
barrels a day, Energy Department data show.  BP Plc (BP/) , based in  London , resumed production at the 234,000
barrel-a-day Cherry Point refinery in Washington state last week
following a three-month shutdown, a person familiar with
operations there said yesterday.  U.S. Refiners  Motiva Enterprises LLC, based in Houston, finished
scheduled maintenance at the 255,000 barrel-a-day Convent
refinery in  Louisiana  that began in mid-March, Emily Oberton, a
company spokeswoman in Houston, said May 16.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s Philadelphia refinery started a 200,000
barrel-a-day crude unit that was shut after a fire on May 9, the
company said in a filing with city regulators. The plant can
process 355,000 barrels of feedstock a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S.  oil inventories  climbed to the highest level in almost
22 years in the week ended May 11, rising 0.6 percent to 381.6
million barrels. Stockpiles grew by another 0.4 percent last
week to 383.1 million, according to a Bloomberg survey of nine
analyst estimates before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  Oil for June delivery rose as much as 44 cents to $93.01 a
barrel today in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile,
extending yesterday’s rise of 1.2 percent. Gasoline for June
delivery gained 1.35 cents to $2.9536 a gallon after rising 
1.8 percent yesterday.  Retail gasoline fell 6 percent in the U.S. Gulf Coast to
$3.489 a gallon, the Energy Department said. Gasoline in the
U.S. West Coast increased 5.1 percent from a year earlier to
$4.242 a gallon, the agency said.  “The West Coast is still seeing the tail end of some
refining problems, perhaps the remaining impact of the BP Cherry
Point problem,” Hackett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
