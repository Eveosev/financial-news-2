The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development raised its 2012 economic growth
estimate for  Israel  while cutting its projection for next year.  The OECD increased its forecast to 3.2 percent, in line
with the  Finance Ministry ’s prediction, from its November
estimate of 2.9 percent, according to a report released today.
The group reduced its projection for 2013 to 3.6 percent from
4.7 percent. The economy expanded 4.8 percent in 2011.  “Economic activity has been slowing in line with export
market developments but is expected to pick up on the back of
stronger external demand,” the OECD said in the report. “Trade
and private consumption, which were soft in the fourth quarter
of 2011, seem to be recovering.”  Israel’s economy grew a faster-than-expected 3 percent in
the first quarter, led by a rebound in exports. The economy is
expected to expand 3.1 percent this year, the  Bank of Israel ,
led by Governor  Stanley Fischer , said on March 26, raising its
forecast from December’s 2.8 percent. The bank’s research
department cited “positive indicators” for the economy
including imports, services exports and business expectations.  The Paris-based organization warned against a
“substantial” overshooting of deficit targets, and recommended
raising value added tax to help pay for “positive structural
reforms.” The government should resist pressure for further
concessions on the gasoline excise duty and should keep personal
income tax cuts “firmly off the policy agenda,” it said.  Underlying inflationary pressure is expected to rise
“slightly,” encouraging a resumption of policy-rate increases
by the Bank of Israel. The organization is forecasting  inflation 
of 2.2 percent in 2012 and 2.5 percent next year. The
government’s annual target is 1 percent to 3 percent.  The central bank held the  benchmark interest rate  at 2.5
percent for a third month on April 23. The monetary policy
committee is expected to leave it unchanged in its next decision
on May 28, according to all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
