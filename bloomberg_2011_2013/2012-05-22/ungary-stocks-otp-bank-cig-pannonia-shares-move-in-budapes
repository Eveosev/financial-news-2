The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index rose 0.9
percent to 16,747.55 by the close in Budapest, a third day of
gains, the longest such streak since March 14.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , the countryâ€™s largest lender,
advanced as much as 2.1 percent and last rose 0.4 percent to
3,535. forint. Speculation that  China  and the euro area will do
more to bolster economic growth boosted demand for riskier
assets.  CIG Pannonia Eletbiztosito Nyrt. (PANNONIA HB), a Hungarian
life insurer, fell 7.7 percent to 286 forint, a record low,
after reporting yesterday that its net loss widened 76 percent
in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
