Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern  Europe ’s third-biggest lender, may say first-quarter
profit rose 78 percent as it booked gains from bond buybacks and
asset sales in the period.  Raiffeisen’s net income probably rose to 479 million euros
($611 million) in the three months ended March 31, up from 270
million euros a year earlier, according to the average estimate
of 11  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank is  due to report 
results May 24 at 7:30 a.m.  Raiffeisen bought back hybrid bonds phased out by
regulators in the first quarter, pocketing a gain of 113 million
euros, it said in a list of “ extraordinary effects ” to be
expected in first-quarter results, published on its website.
Sales of financial investments led to a 150 million-euro gain,
it said in the same list.  Raiffeisen and its parent Raiffeisen Zentralbank

shortfall determined by the European Banking Authority by 1.9
