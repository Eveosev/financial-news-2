Japan  is seeking to buy 152,846
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S. and  Canada  in a
regular tender on May 24, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries said today.  The volume sought is the smallest since May 10, when the
government bought 151,416 tons, according to Toshiki Tojo at the
ministry’s grain-trade division. The ministry, which controls
overseas purchases and domestic sales of wheat to stabilize
supply, has bought 700,759 tons through regular tenders this
fiscal year, compared with 4.65 million tons in the year ended
March 31. Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
