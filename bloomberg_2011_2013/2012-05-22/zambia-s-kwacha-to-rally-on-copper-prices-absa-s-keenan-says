Zambia’s kwacha will strengthen 1.7
percent to 5,100 per dollar by “mid-year” as the price of
copper rises, according to Mike Keenan, currency strategist at
Absa Bank Ltd., Barclays Plc’s African unit.  “We are optimistic about the kwacha,” Keenan said in an
interview yesterday in Ebene, south of  Port Louis , the Mauritian
capital, at a conference organized by Barclays’ Mauritian unit.  The three-month delivery contract for copper climbed as
much as 1.1 percent to $7,816 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange today. The price is expected to reach $9,300 by the end
of 2012, Keenan said.  “We are constructive about copper prices, which when
combined with great foreign direct investment prospects into the
country’s mining sector collectively implies an improved balance
of payments situation,” he said.  Zambia’s central bank has left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 9 percent, with inflation accelerating to 6.5
percent in April from 6.4 percent in March.  “Lower inflationary pressures and heightened central bank
vigilance surrounding  price stability  are also conducive to a
firmer kwacha environment,” Keenan said.  The strategist is bearish on  Ghana ’s cedi. “The county’s
rampant demand for imported goods” has “created a strong
demand for dollars”, he said. “Despite tighter monetary
conditions, the cedi has remained on the back foot, which when
combined with the country’s solid gross domestic product growth
rates suggest that more rate hikes may be needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
