Belgian  consumer confidence  rose in
May to the highest in seven months as concerns over rising
unemployment subsided and households anticipated their capacity
to save will recover following a drop in  oil prices .  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the sixth-largest
economy in the 17-nation euro currency union, increased to minus
10 from minus 12 in April, the Brussels-based National Bank of
Belgium said today in an e-mailed statement. Thatâ€™s the highest
level since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
