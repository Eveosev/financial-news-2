Blackstone Group LP (BX)  won a two-year
extension on $2.65 billion of debt tied to its purchase of the
La Quinta hotel chain by paying down principal, retiring some
junior debt and agreeing to a higher  interest rate , said a
person with knowledge of the agreement.  The private-equity firm has been working for the past year
to restructure about $3.05 billion of debt, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Blackstone, based in  New York , bought the Dallas-based limited-
service  hotelier  in 2006 for about $3.4 billion, investing about
$475 million of equity.  To extend the debt maturity to July 2014, Blackstone paid
down about $180 million of senior debt, reducing that portion to
$2.16 billion, according to the person. It also bought about
$265 million of mezzanine loans at a discount to their face
value, retiring that debt. The restructuring was completed
today, the person said.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for Blackstone, declined to
comment. The agreement was reported earlier today by the Wall
Street Journal.  The new interest rate on the $2.65 billion of debt is the
London interbank offered rate plus 4.3 percentage points, up
from Libor plus 0.8 percentage point, the person said.  Blackstone has restructured almost $40 billion of
acquisition debt in the past three years, including loans on its
largest real estate purchase, the Hilton Worldwide hotel chain.  Blackstone also agreed to buy the Motel 6 lodging chain
from  Accor SA (AC)  for $1.9 billion, the Paris-based seller said in a
statement earlier today. The purchase includes 1,102 Motel 6
properties and Studio 6 extended-stay hotels in  North America 
with more than 107,000 rooms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
