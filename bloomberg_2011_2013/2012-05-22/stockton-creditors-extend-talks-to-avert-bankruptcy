Stockton, the California city on the
brink of bankruptcy, and creditors agreed to extend talks aimed
at restructuring its municipal debt for an extra 30 days.  The bargaining was set to end after 60 days under a
California state law. The extension will give negotiators until
June 25 to reach agreement, the city said today in a statement.  “This is a good sign,” Stockton Mayor Ann Johnston said
in the statement. “It means that our creditors understand our
fiscal circumstances and it indicates that they believe that it
is worth the investment of time and resources to work toward a
solution.”  The community of about 292,000 residents 80 miles (130
kilometers) east of  San Francisco  is trying to avoid becoming
the largest U.S. city to enter bankruptcy after mounting retiree
health-care costs, the recession and accounting errors left it
almost insolvent. The City Council in February agreed to pursue
the negotiations with creditors, which include the  California
Public Employees’ Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension,
and San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the nation’s largest
home lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
