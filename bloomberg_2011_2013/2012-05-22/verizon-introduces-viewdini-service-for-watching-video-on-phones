Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
wireless carrier, introduced a service called Viewdini that lets
users search for movies, television shows and other videos to
watch on their mobile devices.  Viewdini works with Verizon’s long-term evolution network
and can search thousands of titles from video services such as
 Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , Hulu Plus, mSpot, broadcaster and movie-studio
websites, Verizon’s FiOS,  Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA)  Xfinity TV and other
cable providers, according to a statement today.  The move could help boost mobile video viewing and increase
traffic on Verizon Wireless’s LTE network. The Basking Ridge,
New Jersey-based carrier plans to introduce data-share plans
this year designed to let subscribers pay one price for Internet
use on multiple phones, tablets and other devices. While this
could mean potentially lower prices for consumers, Verizon
Wireless is betting that it will encourage heavier use, enticing
them to buy higher-priced data plans.  The Viewdini service is free, though users may have to pay
for the videos they’ve searched for.  “It’s all about convenience and choice for the user,”
said Paul Macchia, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless.  To contact the reporter on this story:
