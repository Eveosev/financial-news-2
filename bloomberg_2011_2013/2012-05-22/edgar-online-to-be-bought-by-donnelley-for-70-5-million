R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. (RRD) , the
Chicago-based commercial-printing company, agreed to buy  Edgar

Online to begin adding to earnings in the first year after the
acquisition is completed.  “This is a natural fit with our growing portfolio of

for thousands of customers, including mutual funds, analysts,
institutional investors and regulators. The company already
works with Donnelley to deliver information, as well as Business
Wire, PR Newswire, LexisNexis,  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) ,  Oracle
Corp. (ORCL)  and  SAP Corp. (SAPE)   Shares of Edgar Online, based in Rockville, Maryland,
