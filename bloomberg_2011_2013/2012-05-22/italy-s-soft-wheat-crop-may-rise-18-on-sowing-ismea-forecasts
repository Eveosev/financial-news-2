Italy’s soft-wheat harvest may rise
18 percent this year on a “slight” increase in yields and a 17
percent expansion in the planted area, researcher Istituto di
Servizi per il Mercato Agricolo e Alimentare said.  Output of durum wheat, the hard variety of the grain used
to make pasta, may climb 9 percent as planting increases 14
percent, the Rome-based group wrote in an online report dated
May 18. That will more than make up for a 4 percent yield drop
stemming from drought in the southern region of Apulia, the
report showed.  Corn production is expected to be little changed, while the
Italian barley harvest may rise 9.5 percent as the growing area
expands by a similar magnitude, Ismea wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
