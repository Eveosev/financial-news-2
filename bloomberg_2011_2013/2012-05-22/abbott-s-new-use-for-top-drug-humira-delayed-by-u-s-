Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ’ bid to expand
use of its best-selling arthritis treatment Humira to ulcerative
colitis patients is being delayed by U.S. regulators.  “We did receive a complete response letter several months
ago and have provided additional information to the” Food and
Drug Administration, Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for the
Abbott Park, Illinois-based company, said in an e-mail today.
“We’re anticipating a decision by the end of the year.”  Ulcerative colitis is an inflammation of the large
intestine and rectum caused by unknown immune system problems,
according to the National Institutes of Health’s  website . The
condition can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool and
 weight loss . About 500,000 people in the U.S. have the disease,
according to the  Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America .  The disease is treated with generic drugs that reduce
inflammation or moderate the immune system. Patients who fail
those treatments may be given  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Remicade,
according to the NIH. Remicade, also used for arthritis, sold
$5.49 billion last year. Humira sold $7.93 billion.  Abbott gained less than 1 percent to $61.99 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The Humira delay was reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
