Spain ’s government plans to alter
electricity rates or taxes for a second time this year in a
package of “reforms” to be completed in the second half of
June, Expansion reported, citing Industry Minister Jose Manuel
Soria.  The new regulations will affect “all the technologies”
used to generate power, and if they include a tax it won´t be
“discriminatory,” Soria was quoted as saying at a lunch
briefing yesterday in  Madrid .   People in the power industry have begun to speculate that
the government, seeking to close the gap between costs and
income to the power system, is preparing a new tax, the report
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
