Ukraine’s corn harvest may climb to
24 million metric tons this year as farmers increase planting of
the grain, French farm adviser Agritel wrote on its website,
without providing a year-earlier figure.  Corn sowing in Ukraine is being finalized, and the area
planted with the grain rose to about 4.5 million hectares (11.1
million acres) from 3.5 million hectares in 2011, according to
Paris-based Agritel, which has an office in Kiev.  Production potential is “very large” because weather
conditions are mostly favorable for developing crops, the
adviser wrote. While temperatures are summery, frequent
downpours in central Ukraine are providing the water required
for growth, Agritel said.  Taking into account weather forecasts for coming days, only
the southern regions Odessa, Nikolaev, Kherson and the Crimea
still face drought concerns, according to Agritel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
