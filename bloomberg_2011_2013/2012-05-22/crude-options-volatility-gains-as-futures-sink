Crude-oil options volatility fell a
second day as futures remained within yesterday’s trading range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.97 percent at 12:55 p.m., on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 26.92 percent yesterday.
Volatility was at the lowest level since May 3.  “Right now, we’re in a tight range again and no one is in
a rush to buy puts or calls right now,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.10 to $91.47 a barrel
at 12:56 p.m. on the Nymex, within yesterday’s trading range
between $90.84 and $93.06. July crude, which becomes the front-
month contract tomorrow, fell 97 cents to $91.89.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $100 calls, which fell 13 cents to 28 cents a barrel
at 12:54 p.m. with 2,282 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options with 1,579 lots changing hands as
they rose 1 cent to 18 cents.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 58 percent of the 110,552 trades
in the previous session. July $80 puts were the most actively
traded, with 6,331 lots changing hands. They fell 25 cents to 17
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July $110 calls,
lost 3 cents to 11 cents on volume of 4,345.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,495
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 35,724 lots and
