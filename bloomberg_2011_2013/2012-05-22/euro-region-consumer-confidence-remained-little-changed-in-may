European  consumer confidence  remained
little changed in May as a worsening fiscal crisis and rising
unemployment clouded the growth outlook.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
rose to minus 19.3 from minus 19.9 in April, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today.
Confidence slumped to minus 21.3 in December, which was the
lowest in more than two years. Economists had forecast a drop to
minus 20.5, the median of 27 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey 
showed.  The commission is scheduled to publish the wider indicator
of euro-region economic confidence on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
