The pound fell for the first time in
three days against the dollar after a government report showed
U.K. inflation slowed last month more than economists forecast.  Sterling weakened against most of its 16 major counterparts
as the  International Monetary Fund  said the  Bank of England 
should resume monetary stimulus, or quantitative easing, to help
the flagging economy. The pound has strengthened 4.8 percent in
the past three months, the best performer of the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. Gilts declined.  “It looks like a line hasn’t been drawn under QE and
today’s inflation figures will slow down sterling’s recent
surge,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and
institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London.
“After the pound’s recent good run the market has found itself
a bit long and was looking for an excuse to sell.” A long
position is a bet an asset will rise.  The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5789 at 4:28 p.m.
 London  time after falling to $1.5733 on May 18, the lowest level
since March 16. The U.K. currency gained 0.2 percent to 80.75
pence per euro.  U.K. consumer prices rose 3 percent in April from a year
earlier, after increasing 3.5 percent in March, the Office for
National Statistics said in London. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast a gain of 3.1 percent.  Easing Recommended  The Bank of England needs to inject more stimulus into the
economy through more bond purchases or by cutting  interest rates 
as “large” risks from the euro-area crisis may derail growth
and inflationary pressures remain weak, the IMF said in its
annual review of the U.K. published today..  Bank of England policy makers halted their  bond-purchase
program  at 325 billion pounds this month. Minutes of the most
recent monetary policy meeting held on May 9-10 will be
published tomorrow.  U.K. government bonds declined for a second day after
 Germany ’s Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he will
consider all ideas to bolster euro-area growth, damping demand
for haven assets.  The 10-year  yield  climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.88 percent after reaching 1.90 percent,
the highest level since May 16. The 4 percent bond maturing in
March 2022 dropped 0.31, or 3.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 118.92.  Gilts have returned 1.1 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries gained 1.3
percent, and German bunds rose 3 percent.  Britain had an underlying budget deficit of 13.8 billion
pounds in April, the first month of the fiscal year, the  Office
for National Statistics  said.  The figure, which excludes support for banks, compared with
9.1 billion pounds a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.3 percent in
April from a year earlier and spending increased 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
