U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
strengthened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent widened for a third consecutive day.  Brent crude’s premium over WTI, based on July futures
prices, widened 64 cents, or 4 percent, to $16.59 a barrel at
1:40 p.m. in  New York . When Brent gains versus WTI, it typically
strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 15 cents to
$13.15 a barrel as of 11:51 a.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 55 cents to a premium of $16.40.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 30 cents to $11.20. Poseidon’s
rose 10 cents to $9.90, while Southern Green Canyon’s held at
$10. The three grades are used in the Argus Sour Crude Index.
 Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than the
other three, added 40 cents against WTI to a premium of $14.40.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium was steady at $1.90 and
Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
