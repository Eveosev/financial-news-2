Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  will unload
its  Boeing Co. (BA)  717 jets, returning the discount carrier to
flying just one type of plane, under a tentative sublease
agreement with  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)   Delta will become the biggest operator of the 717, a model
out of production since 2006, as it takes the 88 jets Southwest
acquired in buying AirTran Holdings Inc. in 2011. Atlanta-based
Delta said today the planes will replace less-efficient jets.  Shifting back to flying only Boeing 737s will help Dallas-
based Southwest curb training and maintenance expenses, and
dropping the  smaller 717  also rids the airline of a plane that
costs more to fly on a per-seat basis. Southwest is the largest
customer for the 737, the world’s most widely flown jetliner.  “It returns us to a single fleet type and improves our
overall economics,” Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven
said in an interview. “It improves our scheduling flexibility
and our ability to recover when operations go awry.”  Delta will use the 717s to replace 50-seat regional jets
and older DC-9s targeted to be removed from its fleet. The
purchase extends the airline’s strategy of adding used planes,
such as the Boeing MD-90s bought in April, to help retire some
of its aging aircraft.  Neither airline disclosed financial terms.  Southwest Drops  Southwest fell 0.8 percent to $8.27 at the close in  New
York , while Delta slipped 0.4 percent to $10.54.  Boeing made only 156 of the twin-engine 717s in seven years
of deliveries that ended in 2006. By comparison, the 737 has
amassed more than 9,300 orders since its first one in 1965, and
the best-selling variant made today can seat about 160 people,
according to Boeing’s website.  The 117-seat 717s would move to Delta over three years
starting in the second half of 2013 through 2015, Southwest said
in a statement. The airline has said it expects to end 2012 with
about 692 planes, including the 717s. Boeing Capital Corp. holds
the 717 leases and is a party to the Delta accord.  When Southwest agreed to acquire AirTran in September 2010,
the airline said it saw a role for the 717 in serving smaller
cities. The AirTran purchase closed in May 2011, and Southwest
said in August it wanted to drop the planes, after  fuel prices 
climbed 48 percent in the previous 11 months.  ‘Made Sense’  “If there was one factor that influenced the economics of
the airplane more than anything else, it was rising fuel
prices,” Van de Ven said. “At that point, it made sense for us
to try to get back to a single fleet.”  Once talks began with Delta, Southwest didn’t search for
any other carriers to sublease the planes, Van de Ven said.
Southwest’s leases extend through 2018 to 2024.  Delta’s acquisition of the 717s is contingent upon its
pilots approving a tentative agreement to cover the aircraft.
Voting will conclude June 30 on the accord, which also allows
Delta to add as many as 70 two-class, 76-seat regional jets.  “These actions pave the way for us to restructure and up-
gauge our domestic fleet, which will lower our costs, provide
more pilot jobs and improve the onboard experience for our
customers,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said in a
statement.  Southwest plans to keep its fleet count largely unchanged
as the 717s move to Delta at a rate of three a month starting in
mid-2013. Delta said the 717s won’t alter its seating capacity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
