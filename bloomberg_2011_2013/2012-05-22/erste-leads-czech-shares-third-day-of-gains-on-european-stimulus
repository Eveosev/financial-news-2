Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of  Austria  rose,
leading a third day of gains for Czech shares, as speculation
that Europe will join Chinaâ€™s efforts to bolster economic growth
fueled demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The stock climbed 2.5 percent to 375 koruna by 9:52 a.m. in
Prague, its third day of advances. The  PX (PX)  index of 14 companies,
in which Erste has an 18 percent weighting, climbed to a one-
week high, rallying 0.9 percent to 880.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
