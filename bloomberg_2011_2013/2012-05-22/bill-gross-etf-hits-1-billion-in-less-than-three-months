Bill Gross’s exchange-traded fund
attracted $1 billion in less than three months since its start.  The Pimco  Total Return ETF (BOND) , which began trading on the NYSE
Arca exchange on March 1, had $1.01 billion in net assets as of
yesterday’s close, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co.’s website. The fund advanced 4.8 percent through today,
compared with the 1.9 percent  return  for Gross’s $259 billion
Total Return mutual fund, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Pimco, based in  Newport Beach , California, started the
active ETF to blend the trading flexibility of ETFs with Gross’s
bond-picking prowess. Last month the firm began an actively
managed ETF that invests in global inflation-linked government
bonds denominated in local currencies, bringing the total number
of actively managed ETFs at Pimco to six. Its Enhanced Short
Maturity Strategy Fund has $1.65 billion in assets.  Barrons.com reported earlier today that the Total Return
ETF had accumulated $1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
