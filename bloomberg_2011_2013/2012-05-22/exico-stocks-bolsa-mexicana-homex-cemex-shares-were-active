The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  City. Stock symbols are in parentheses,
and prices are as of the close of trading in Mexico City.  The  IPC index  fell 0.1 percent to 37,481.19.  Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB  (BOLSAA MM), the operator of
Mexico’s securities exchange, climbed 2.9 percent to 24.98
pesos. Revenue from derivatives may surge because a proposed
rule change from the nation’s securities regulator would require
over-the-counter transactions to be cleared through the
exchange, Martin Lara, an analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.  Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma, a spokesman for the National
Banking and Securities Commission, said today that the exchange
expects to implement such a measure by the end of the year,
according to an e-mailed response to questions.  Construction-related companies were among the biggest
gainers on Mexico’s benchmark index after housing data beat
estimates in the U.S., which buys about 80 percent of Mexico’s
exports.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, climbed 0.5 percent to 7.68 pesos.  Desarrolladora
Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest homebuilder, gained 3.9
percent to 31.33 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
