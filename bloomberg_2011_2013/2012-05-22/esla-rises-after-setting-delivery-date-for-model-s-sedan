Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
maker led by Elon Musk, rose after the company said it will
begin delivering the Model S sedan to customers on June 22.  The  shares  gained 7 percent to $30.79 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest daily increase since May 10. They have
advanced 7.8 percent this year.  Tesla announced the start date today after saying earlier
this month that deliveries would begin in June rather than July
and that it has more than 10,000 orders for the battery-powered
vehicle. The first customers will get their cars at a ceremony
at Tesla’s Fremont,  California , factory, the company said today.  The delivery start “represents Tesla’s transition to a
mass-production automaker and the most compelling car company of
the 21st century,” Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and
co-founder, said in a statement today. The company, based in
 Palo Alto , California, said its goal is to deliver 5,000 cars
this year.  The automaker, named for inventor Nikola Tesla, wants to be
the leading producer of premium all-electric vehicles with the
addition of the Model S, followed by the Model X sport-utility
vehicle in 2013. Tesla has said the introduction of those
products and supply agreements to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Daimler
AG (DAI)  may bring the company’s first profit by next year.  The Model S, with a range of as much as 300 miles (483
kilometers) a charge, depending on the battery pack purchased,
should expand Tesla’s annual sales volume to at least 20,000
cars, Musk said this month. The car’s $57,400 base price, before
a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, is half that of the Roadster, a sports
car Tesla has sold since 2008.  The Model S is being built at a plant that was previously a
joint venture owned by Toyota and the former General Motors
Corp. The factory, partly funded with a $465 million U.S.
government loan, is also producing battery packs and motors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
