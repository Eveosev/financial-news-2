Like a good consultant, I had 106 slides on best practices in innovation — too many to digest. So I whittled them down to an executive summary with four simple points, each tied to an individual: an "Innovation Mount Rushmore." The virtual monument worked as an effective way to synthesize a complex field, and served as the basis for chapter 3 of  The Little Black Book of Innovation . The  original  Innovation Mount Rushmore had four faces: 1. A.G. Lafley , former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble, whose "consumer is boss" mantra urges innovators to always take an external perspective. Get out in the market and invest the time to understand the customer better than they understand themselves. 2. Robert N. Anthony Sr. , my grandfather and member of the Accounting Hall of Fame, whose classic workbook  Essentials of Accounting  reminds innovators of the double-edged nature of capabilities — every strength has a corresponding weakness. Corporations seeking new growth need to organize and act differently to avoid the "sucking sound of the core." 3. Thomas A. Edison , the legendary inventor, highlights how innovation is an active exercise, not an academic one, with memorable quips such as "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."  4. Mike Tyson , the great philosopher and boxer, reminds innovators not to overly obsess about developing a seemingly perfect plan with his line, "Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face."  More recent visitors to Innovation Mount Rushmore may have noticed some changes:  First, a demolition crew knocked off Edison's face and replaced it with  Pablo Picasso's . Edison and Tyson, it turns out, offered similar guidance, yet my Rushmore lacked guidance about translating inspiration into practical ideas. Picasso, the great Spanish artist, fills that need, reminding us, "Good artists copy, great artists steal." Innovators sometimes make the mistake of assuming they get extra points for doing something difficult, or something that's never been done before. But remember, innovation is something different  that has impact . Picasso's face reminds innovators to find the shortest path to impact.  Following Picasso's guidance is simple. Once you have framed the problem you are trying to solve, find the person in the world who has  already solved that problem . They might not be in your company, industry, or country, but they are out there. Find them and learn from them. The second change isn't obvious, but the plaque in front of Robert N. Anthony Sr. has new text. The original plaque was wordy and was aimed more at corporations than individuals. While the corporate lesson remains important, the new plaque is a bit simpler and more focused on individuals. It starts by recounting the first principle taught in  Essentials of Accounting : the dual-aspect concept. The bedrock principle of accounting, which emerged in Northern Italy in the 14th century, holds that every debit has a corresponding credit, and that every asset has a claim against it.  Innovators need to remember that every one of their strengths has a corresponding weakness, and that every capability has a disability.  Don't treat innovation as a sole pursuit. First, detail your innovation inventory, an honest assessment of your strengths and weakness. Be honest. Then, network to find people who bring different capabilities to the table. Who is the Wozniak to your Jobs? The Ballmer to your Gates? The Sandberg to your Zuckerberg? While the popular image of iconic innovators shows them toiling alone in their garage, the best innovations are created by teams with complementary skills. Come visit the Innovation Mount Rushmore. Following the simple guidance offered by Lafley, Picasso, Tyson, and Anthony, Sr. will help you increase the odds of innovating successfully.
