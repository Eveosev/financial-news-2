Yields on Mexican bonds linked to
inflation rose the most in three weeks after a survey showed
economists are paring estimates for consumer price increases.  Yields on the bonds due in 2013, known as Udibonos, climbed
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.11 percent at
4 p.m. in  Mexico  City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It was the biggest increase since April 27. The peso depreciated
1.5 percent to 13.9031 per dollar, paring its rally this year to
0.2 percent.  Mexican inflation will end 2012 at 3.69 percent, down from
the previous forecast of 3.73 percent, according to the median
projection of analysts in a biweekly survey released yesterday
by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  The central bank last week raised its growth forecast for
this year and said the risk to inflation has diminished, while
expressing optimism the economy can sustain its current growth.  “The outlook is one of contained inflation,”  Enrique Alvarez , the New York-based head of Latin America fixed-income
research at IdeaGlobal, said by phone. “At least at this point
you don’t have a large quotient of indicators that say that
you’re going to have a problem with inflation ahead.”  The central bank kept the key  interest rate  unchanged at
4.5 percent for a 26th consecutive meeting last month. Mexico’s
annual  inflation rate  fell to a six-month low of 3.41 percent in
April from 3.73 percent in the previous month, the national
statistics agency said May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
