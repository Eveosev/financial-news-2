EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable
energy unit of  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , will spend 3.2
billion euros ($4.1 billion) through 2015 on wind capacity.  It plans to add 2.3 gigawatts of wind generation, including
500 megawatts this year, in markets such as Poland, Romania and
 Brazil , the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said today in a statement.
The company had 7.5 gigawatts of capacity at the end of 2011.  EDP, the former power monopoly, is investing in dams and
wind turbines to cut reliance on fossil fuels and tap subsidies
for alternative power. EDP says its renewable energy unit is the
world’s third-biggest wind power producer. Growth will be based
on “a self-financing strategy,” the unit said, and it may pay
25 percent to 35 percent of earnings as dividends from 2013.  EDP Renovaveis rose 5.8 percent to 3.178 euros by the close
in Lisbon, paring the loss for the year to 33 percent.  The unit forecast earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 1.35 billion to 1.5 billion
euros in 2015, compared with 800 million euros in 2011.  Portugal  in December agreed to sell 21 percent of EDP to
China Three Gorges Corp. for 2.69 billion euros. The Chinese
company will also spend 2 billion euros to buy minority stakes
in EDP wind farms through 2015 and help with funding. EDP
Renovaveis today said it planned sell the equivalent of 20
percent of its capacity to China Three Gorges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
