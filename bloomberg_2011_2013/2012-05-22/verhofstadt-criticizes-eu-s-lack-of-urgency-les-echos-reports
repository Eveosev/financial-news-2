The European Union lacks a sufficient
sense of urgency in tackling the underlying failings of economic
and monetary union, as opposed to the immediate issue of Greece,
according to  Guy Verhofstadt , a member of the European
Parliament and former Belgian prime minister,  Les Echos 
reported.  The EU needs a common eurobond and can enforce budget
discipline by allowing only states that respect debt limits to
participate in a 2.3 billion-euro ($2.9 billion) amortization
fund to mutualize sovereign debt over 60 percent of gross
domestic product, the newspaper cited Verhofstadt as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
