Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s largest construction company by market value, rose to
a four-month high as investors bet its price could almost double
this year, according to Kundila Finance Ltd.  The stock gained the daily limit of 5 percent to 32.61 naira
by the close in Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest since
Jan. 18.  Julius Berger shares rose as high as 62.26 naira on June 30
and fell to 19.86 naira on Feb. 29, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. “If the company continues with the work it is
doing, its price could rise to the June level before the end of
the year,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-
based Kundila Finance, said by phone today. “Julius Berger is
the foremost construction company in  Nigeria  today.”  The company, which derives 65 percent of its earnings from
government projects, wants more private-sector deals to maintain
growth, Managing Director Wolfgang Goetsch said on Dec. 1.
Julius Berger will pay a 2.40 naira dividend per share for the
full year, it said on March 23.  Julius Berger is a unit of  Germany ’s  Bilfinger Berger AG. (GBF)   To contact the reporter on this story:
