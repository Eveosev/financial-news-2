Kenya ’s shilling retreated to its
lowest level in more than four months as investors leave the
market following a slump in yields on  government securities .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to 85.26 per dollar and was trading 0.1 percent
weaker at 85 by 12:03 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level
will be the lowest since Jan 27, taking the shilling’s slump
this month to 2.2 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The currency’s weakening is a result of the “exit of
investors from our money market following the decline in the
yields on government securities which had attracted considerable
interest from international investors earlier in the year,”
Finance Minister Robinson Githae said during an event at his
office today in the capital.  Kenya’s three- and six-month yields fell for the 18th
straight week after the government halved borrowing. The yield
on 91-day Treasury bills declined to 10.075 percent at a sale
May 17 from 20.799 percent tagged on similar-maturity debt sold
Jan 12. On 182-day bills, borrowing costs slid to 12.078 percent
on May 16 from 20.914 percent realized on Jan 23, according to
the central bank’s  website .  Bids for the three-month bills
declined to 3 billion shillings ($35 million) on May 17 compared
with 8.6 billion shillings on Jan 12.  Kenya has lowered its local borrowing target to 62.1
billion shillings from 119.5 billion shillings for the fiscal
year ending June 30, replacing shilling-denominated financing
with a $600 million syndicated loan arranged by Citigroup Inc.,
 South Africa ’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. and London-based
Standard Chartered Plc.  The central bank accepted 2.45 billion shillings of bids
for  repurchase agreements  at a weighted average rate of 17.959
percent after offering 7 billion shillings of the securities, a
Kenyan official, who declined to be identified in line with
policy, commented in a phone interview today from Nairobi.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.4 percent to 1,592.75 to the
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling appreciated 0.5 percent to
2,470 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
