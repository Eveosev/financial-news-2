Canadian Labor Minister Lisa Raitt
said the government is making “every effort” to help broker an
agreement between  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  and the
Teamsters to avert a strike that could begin as early as
tomorrow.  Talks taking place today in Ottawa are centered around
pension liabilities, Raitt said in an interview with CTV
Television. Raitt said the government has a “strong mandate”
to protect the economy and would be monitoring “very
carefully” the impact of any strike.  “It’s part of my job to make sure that people get their
deals done before we have work stoppages,” Raitt said. “Should
there be a work stoppage, we will be monitoring very carefully
the effect on the economy and acting appropriately.”  Raitt said referring the issue to the Canada Industrial
Labour Relations Board, as she had done during a dispute at Air
Canada, is not an option in this case because Canadian health
and safety would not be jeopardized.  Raitt said the impact on the economy would not be “an
immediate situation” because there is an alternative railway
that can offer service, referring  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
