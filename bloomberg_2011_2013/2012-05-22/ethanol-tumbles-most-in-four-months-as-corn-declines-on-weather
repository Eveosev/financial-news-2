Ethanol tumbled the most in more than
four months in  Chicago  as corn declined on speculation that
favorable weather in the U.S. Midwest will aid crops.  The biofuel fell 3.7 percent as its primary feedstock
dropped 5.7 percent on the expectation that rain will help corn
and lower the cost of making ethanol in the U.S. One bushel of
corn produces at least 2.75 gallons of the additive.  “It followed corn lower hard today,” said Will Babler, a
broker at First Capital Risk Management in Galena,  Illinois .
“You’ve got a failed weather rally and weakness in the export
market. Day to day, it’s going to track corn.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery plunged 8.1 cents to
settle at $2.131 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest decline since Jan. 12 and the lowest price since May
15. Ethanol has fallen 3.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago lost 3 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.15 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.235, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 0.5 cent to $2.235 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.375.  Corn for July delivery sank 36 cents to $5.97 a bushel in
Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
