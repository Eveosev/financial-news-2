Denmark’s Phoenix International A/S
signed a contract to build and operate an $86 million pipeline
factory in southern  Iraq , company and government officials said.  The plant will produce pipes for transporting oil, natural
gas and water, Rene Koch, the company’s chief executive officer,
said today in an e-mailed statement. The factory in the town of
Um Qasr in the southern province of Basra is licensed for 35
years, said Khalaf al-Badran, president of the Basra investment
committee, according to the statement.  Kameran Khisro Kiani, the company’s director in Iraq, said
the project would create 300 jobs in the province and save time
for the Oil Ministry when it needs to buy pipes, including those
required for single-point mooring facilities for tankers loading
crude in the  Persian Gulf . The ministry has installed two such
offshore units and plans at least two more.  Iraq is rebuilding its oil industry after years of warfare,
economic sanctions and neglect. The country is the third-largest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
after  Saudi Arabia  and  Iran , and it plans to hold a fourth
auction of energy-exploration licenses next week in Baghdad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
