Angola’s electoral commission
appointed Eldetrudes Costa as interim president, Agencia Angola
Press reported,  citing  Julia Ferreira, a spokeswoman for the
commission.  Costa, a national commissioner at the so-called CNE, will
replace Suzana Nicolau Ingles, the Luanda-based  news agency 
said. Ingles’s appointment was annulled by Angola’s Supreme
Court because she was a senior member of the Angolan ruling
party’s women’s league, Voice of America reported on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
