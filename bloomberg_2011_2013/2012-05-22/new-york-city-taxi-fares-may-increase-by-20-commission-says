New York  City cab riders may see
fares rise by as much as 20 percent, the biggest increase in
eight years, under a proposal before the Taxi and Limousine
Commission.  “The fare hasn’t changed since 2006, so it is reasonable
for taxi drivers and fleet owners to put this on the table,”
David S. Yassky, commissioner of the agency, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We will consider their petitions over the next
couple of months.”  The commission will hear the proposal May 31.  The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents 15,000
drivers, has been petitioning the commission for the past year
to increase fares by at least 15 percent, citing the high price
of gasoline and leases.  “Drivers work long and grueling hours and they shouldn’t
be earning today less than they did six years ago,” Bhairavi
Desai, the alliance’s executive director, said by telephone.
“It’s just a question of fairness.”  Drivers received their last comprehensive raise, of 26
percent, in 2004, when the average gallon of gasoline in the New
York City area cost $1.78. By last month, that price had more
than doubled to $ 4.09 , according to the New York State Energy
Research and Development Authority.  The weekly lease that taxi drivers pay to fleet owners has
increased to about $900 from about $600 in 2004, Desai said.  The average cost of an individual tax medallion rose in
April to $703,000 from $701,000 a month earlier, according to
the commission. A medallion, the aluminum plate found on the
hood of all cabs, gives owners the right to operate a taxi.  In 2009, the state Legislature added a 50-cent surcharge to
taxi rides to help fund the  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority , which runs the city’s subways, buses and commuter
railroads. In 2006, riders saw the price rise for each minute a
cab is stopped or in traffic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
