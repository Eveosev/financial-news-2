The presidents of the  Federal
Reserve ’s regional banks received an average salary of $342,000
last year, with William C. Dudley at the New York Fed taking
home the highest salary at $410,780.  The 12 regional bank presidents had total salaries of $4.1
million, according to the central bank’s annual report, posted
today on its  website . Salaries of the reserve bank presidents
are set by the Fed board with consideration for tenure and
comparable executive salaries in their regions. The salary of
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and the other governors is set by
federal law.  Bernanke’s 2011 salary was $199,700, the same as a cabinet
secretary. The Fed’s governors earned $179,700, the same as most
deputy secretaries. That’s less than many of the lower-ranking
officers at the regional banks. The 12 regional banks employ
1,264 other officers earning an average salary of $201,100.  Dudley, 59, joined the  New York  Fed in 2007 and became
president in 2009. Prior to joining the New York Fed he rose
through the ranks to become chief U.S. economist at Goldman
Sachs. His salary at the New York Fed was unchanged from last
year.  The other Fed presidents earn between $281,300 for St.
Louis’s  James Bullard  to $367,500 for San Francisco’s John Williams.  The staff at the 12 regional banks was little changed at
15,514 employees, compared to 15,419 staff on a full-time basis
at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
