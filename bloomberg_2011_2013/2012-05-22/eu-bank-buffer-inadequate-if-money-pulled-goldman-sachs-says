The 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.4 trillion)
liquidity buffer that  Europe ’s biggest banks have to guard
against a flight of deposits will be insufficient if there’s a
systemic loss of confidence, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
said.  While the buffer would be ample to protect against the loss
of confidence and a run on deposits at a single bank, it would
be inadequate if customers withdrew their money across the
region, the analysts including Jernej Omahen wrote in a note to
clients today.  “If deposit loss occurs as a result of a systemic event,
individual liquidity buffers would not prove effective,” they
wrote. “Fears of a euro breakup, for example, could give rise
to loss of depositor confidence on a systemic level. This would
call for a regulatory response.”  Greece ’s banking system lost 9 billion euros of deposits
this year and has seen outflows of 73 billion euros since the
2009 peak, the analysts said. Speculation that customers were
withdrawing money in  Spain  caused a 29 percent drop in the
shares of  Bankia SA (BKIA)  on May 17. The Spanish government denied
reports of a run on deposits at Bankia last week.  While there was concern that deposit flight had spread
beyond Greece to the rest of Southern Europe, there was no
supporting evidence, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
