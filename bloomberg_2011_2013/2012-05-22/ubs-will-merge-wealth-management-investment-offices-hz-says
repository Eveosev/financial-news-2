UBS AG (UBSN)  will combine the back offices
of its  wealth management  and investment banking divisions on
July 1, Handelszeitung reported, citing an internal memo to
staff and Andreas Kern, a spokesman for the bank.  Ulrich Hoffmann, currently head of operations in the wealth
management unit, will lead the combined department, which will
have 7,000 workers, the Swiss newspaper reported in a pre-
release of an article to be published tomorrow.  It is undecided if the merger will lead to job cuts, the
paper cited Kern as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
