Global youth unemployment has climbed
to almost 75 million and is projected to stay that high for
years to come, the International Labor Organization said.  The jobless rate among people aged 15 to 24 is forecast to
rise from 12.6 percent in 2011 to 12.7 percent this year and
remain there through 2016, the Geneva-based ILO said in a report
published today.  “Since 2007, the global youth unemployment rate has
started rising again, and the increase between 2008 and the
height of the economic crisis in 2009 effectively wiped out much
of the gains made in previous years,” the ILO said in the
report. “Nearly 75 million youth are unemployed around the
world, an increase of more than 4 million since 2007.”  In the European Union, where a debt crisis followed the
financial crisis, the youth unemployment rate rose to 18 percent
last year from 12.5 percent in 2007, the ILO report shows. Youth
unemployment in  Spain  soared to 46.4 percent in 2011 from 18.2
percent in 2007, according to Eurostat figures.  In North Africa, youth unemployment rose to 27.9 percent in
2011 from 23.1 percent in 2010 as a result of the Arab Spring,
the ILO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
