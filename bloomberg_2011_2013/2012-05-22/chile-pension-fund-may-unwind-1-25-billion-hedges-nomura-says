Chilean pension funds may have to
unwind hedging positions worth about $1.25 billion under
proposals presented on May 18 by the industry regulator,
depressing the peso, Nomura Holding Inc. said.  Pension funds will have to hedge at least 50 percent of
their foreign fixed-income holdings, and as much of 50 percent
of their foreign equity holdings, analysts  Tony Volpon ,  Benito Berber  and George Lei said in a note to investors. The current
rule stipulates a hedge ratio for the entire fund.  The pension fundsâ€™ current hedges are short on the dollar
and long on the peso in the forwards market, Nomura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
