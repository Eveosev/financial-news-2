Twenty of 85 workers trapped at the
Mimosa platinum mine in  Zimbabwe  have been freed, National Mine
Workers Union of Zimbabwe President Shadreck Polowelo said.  “A bearing caught fire, which resulted in the workers
being trapped inside the mine,” he said by phone from
Zvishavane. “Rescue efforts to bring those who are trapped are
still ongoing.”  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. owns Mimosa jointly with  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-largest producer of the
metal. The Mimosa operation produces about 100,000 ounces of
platinum in concentrate annually and comprises about 30 percent
of Aquarius’s output.  “The workers are in a safe area and we and the company
owners are on top of the situation,”  Mines Ministry Secretary
Prince Mupazviriho said during an interview at his office today
in Harare, the capital.  Aquarius retreated for an eight day, losing 2.1 percent to
83.15 pence by 11:52 a.m. in  London , heading for the lowest
close since May 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
