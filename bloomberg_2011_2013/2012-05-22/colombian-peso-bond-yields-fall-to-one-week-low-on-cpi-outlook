Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a one-week low, after the central bank said inflation
will end this year near the 3 percent mid-point target.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 7.13 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.238 centavo to 122.842 centavos per peso.  Inflation this year and next will be close to 3 percent,
while consumer-price increases in 2014 will be “slightly”
below that level, central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said May
18 in the presentation of the bank’s quarterly report. Colombian
markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  “People have been lowering their inflation expectations as
inflation has surprised on the low side this year,” said Daniel Escobar, the head analyst at Global Securities brokerage in
Bogota. “Uribe’s comments help give support to that optimism”
and the peso bond curve should continue to flatten, he said.  Consumer prices rose 0.14 percent in April, less than the
0.17 percent median estimate among 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation was 3.43 percent, within the central
bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range.  The gap between yields on Colombian government fixed-rate
peso bonds due July 2024 and April 2013 is 179 basis points, or
1.79 percentage points. That’s down from 183 basis points on May
16.  The peso rose from a four-month low after U.S. home sales
increased more than forecast and speculation grew that European
leaders will join  China  in stepping up efforts to support global
growth.  The currency advanced for the first time in seven days,
gaining 0.2 percent to 1,826.80 per  U.S. dollar . It touched
1,830.50 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 20. The peso
has jumped 6.1 percent this year, the second-best performance
after the Madagascar ariary among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
