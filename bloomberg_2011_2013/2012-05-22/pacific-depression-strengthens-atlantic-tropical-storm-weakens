Bud, the second tropical storm of the
2012  hurricane season , formed early today off  Mexico â€™s southern
Pacific coast, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm, bearing winds of 40 miles per hour (65
kilometers per hour), was about 600 miles south of the resort
port of Manzanillo, Mexico, the NHC said in a website  advisory .
Conditions are favorable at sea for Bud to grow into a hurricane
by tomorrow night, the Miami-based center said.  On the forecast track, Bud will curve from its present 12
mph west-northwest path more northward and then north-eastward
and may slow before coming ashore on the Mexican coast later
this weekend, the NHC said.  In the Atlantic Ocean, Alberto remains a tropical
depression with 35 mph winds while moving northeast at 15 mph on
a path between the U.S. East Coast and  Bermuda  and is expected
to weaken, the center said in a  separate  advisory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
