China  may need to boost imports of
liquefied natural gas by about 80 percent from current
contracted volumes to meet demand for the fuel, according to
Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  The world’s biggest energy user may need to purchase an
additional 37 million metric tons of LNG by 2030 on top of
current contracted volumes of 46 million tons, Graham Tyler,
manager of gas and power research for  Southeast Asia , said in
Singapore today. The country may import about 68 billion cubic
meters a gas a year from Russia via pipeline, he said.  Shale gas development in China may grow after 2023 because
the geology of the basins may require companies to develop new
drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, Tyler said.  China may link gas prices to oil in three to four years,
Tyler said. The country is implementing a price ceiling for
natural gas sold in Guandong and Guangxi provinces as part of a
trial that may extend across the country, according to the
National Development and Reform Commission.  Imports of LNG by China rose 34 percent to 1.13 million
metric tons in March from a year earlier, according to customs
data.  Japan , the world’s biggest LNG consumer, imported about
78.5 million tons in 2011, according to customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
