New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, rebounded from a seven-day drop
to its lowest in almost three years on investor optimism that
the euro area will step up economic stimulus.  The stock rose 1.9 percent to 105.5 koruna by 3:54 p.m. in
 Prague , helping the 14-member  PX (PX)  index add 1.2 percent today.  NWR slumped 13 percent in the previous seven days to the
weakest since July 2009, lowering the stockâ€™s 14-day relative
strength index to 25. Readings less than 30 suggest in technical
analysis an asset may rise. The RSI increased to 28 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
