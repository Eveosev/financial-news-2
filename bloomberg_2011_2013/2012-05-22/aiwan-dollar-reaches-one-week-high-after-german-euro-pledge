Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened to a
one-week high as a pledge by Germany not to let Greece leave the
euro reduced concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.
 Government bonds  dropped.  European leaders will do “everything necessary” to keep
Greece in the single currency, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said yesterday. Taiwan’s economics ministry said
yesterday it will expand a low-interest rate loan program to
improve exporters’ cash supply after official data showed orders
for overseas sales fell 3.5 percent in April from a year earlier,
following a 1.6 percent decline in March.  “Market optimism should be temporary as there continues to
be worries Greece will exit the euro,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “It’s
difficult for the  Taiwan dollar  to strengthen much under such
global economic conditions.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.546 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
It touched NT$29.460, the strongest level since May 15. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings traders use to price options, fell 40 basis points
to 5.3 percent.  Global funds sold $3 billion more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought this month, paring net purchases for 2012 to $952
million, according to exchange data.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.967
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
interbank lending rate  was little changed at 0.509 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
