Trading in Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. debt shrank in April to around one-sixth of its peak this
year when investors jockeyed to buy the defunct investment
bank’s debt before the record date for its first payment to
creditors, a report said.  Volume in Lehman debt, which has fueled the market where
traders buy and sell claims of distressed companies, dwindled to
$1.3 billion last month, from $6.4 billion in the 30 days before
the March 18 record date, SecondMarket Holdings Inc. said in the
report released today. Lehman set a $22.5 billion payment for
April 17, or 53 percent more than it previously estimated was
possible.  April trading in debt of bankrupt companies was the lowest
since February 2010, said SecondMarket, which tracks bankruptcy
filings on transfers of claims.  Lehman debt trades eclipsed transfers of other companies’
claims even at last month’s low rate. The MF Global Inc.
brokerage was the second most actively traded company, with
around $157 million of its debt changing hands. The amounts
refer to the face value of the claims, not the trading prices,
which reflect payment prospects and aren’t disclosed.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, New York-
based Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 listing debt of $613
billion.  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , the brokerage’s parent
company, filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31
with debt of almost $40 billion.  The Lehman case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
