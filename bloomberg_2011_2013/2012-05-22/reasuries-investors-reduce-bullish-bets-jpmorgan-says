U.S. Treasuries investors cut bets
the securities will advance, and raised neutral and short
positions this week, according to a weekly survey by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The percent of “net longs”  dropped  to four percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, from 11 percentage points
the previous week when it reached the highest level in more than
two months. The number of outright longs dropped to 21 percent
in the week ending yesterday, from 26 percent, the survey
showed.  The percent of shorts rose to 17 percent from 15 percent in
the same period. A long position is a bet that an asset will
increase in value, while a short is a wager it will decrease.  The percent of “neutrals” rose to 62 percent from 59
percent. It had risen to 66 percent in the week ending May 7.  The benchmark 10-year yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 7:52 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
