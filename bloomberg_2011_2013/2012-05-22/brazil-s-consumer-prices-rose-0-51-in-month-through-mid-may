Brazilian  consumer prices  rose less
than economists expected in the first half of this month as
growth in  Latin America ’s biggest economy continues to show
signs of weakness.  Prices, as measured by the IPCA-15 index, rose 0.51 percent
through mid-May, less than was expected by 41 of 45 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for a 0.56
percent increase.  While annual inflation slowed to 5.05 percent in mid-May,
the lowest level since October 2010, economists still expect the
central bank to miss the 4.5 percent target this year and in
2013 as a drop in the benchmark interest rate spurs economic
growth. Stimulus measures, such as tax cuts on vehicles and
consumer borrowing announced yesterday, may limit monetary
policy stimulus, said  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at
WestLB do Brasil.  “The figure brought some relief but not enough to bring
inflation back to target,” Rostagno said by telephone from  Sao
Paulo . “With yesterday’s measures, the market believes there’s
less room for stimulus via monetary policy.”  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2014, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 8.31 percent at 10:19 a.m.
Brasilia time. The real declined 0.43 percent to 2.0507 against
the  U.S. dollar .  As part of a stimulus package announced yesterday, the
central bank will reduce  reserve requirements  so lenders can
boost credit for car purchases. The government also cut taxes on
vehicles and will channel more subsidized funding to companies
that invest in equipment.  Economy Falters  Brazil ’s economic expansion faltered in the first quarter
even as the government cut borrowing costs to near record lows,
reduced taxes on home appliances and boosted subsidized credit.  Tombini reiterated yesterday that inflation would slow in
the coming months and that the impact of a weaker currency --
the real has declined 17 percent against the dollar in the past
three months -- would have only a “moderate” effect on
inflation. Economists are less certain, forecasting that
inflation will reach 5.21 percent in 2012 and accelerate to 5.6
percent next year, according a May 18 central bank survey.  While the cost of transport decreased 0.27 percent through
mid-May, prices of clothing jumped 0.97 percent, compared with
0.49 percent in the previous month’s report.  Rate Cuts  On April 18 the central bank cut the Selic rate by 75 basis
points to 9 percent in a bid to revive growth. Policy makers
have reduced the rate by 350 basis points since August, more
than any other Group of 20 nation.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will cut the
Selic to a record low 8.5 percent next week, and to at least 8
percent by October, according to Bloomberg estimates based on
 interest rate  futures contracts.  Brazil’s  economy  grew 2.7 percent last year, its second-
weakest performance since 2003. Economists in the latest central
bank survey forecast the economy will grow 3.09 percent this
year and 4.5 percent next year.  Tombini yesterday said that activity will pick up in the
remainder of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
