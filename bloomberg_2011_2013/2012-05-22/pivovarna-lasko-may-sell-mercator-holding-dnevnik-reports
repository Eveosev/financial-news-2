Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. will
probably sell its 23 percent stake in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR) 
d.d. on its own if other investors in the Slovenian retail chain
fail to join the process, Dnevnik newspaper reported, citing
Laskoâ€™s supervisory board President Vladimir Milenkovic.  The decision to form a consortium with other Mercator
owners, including lender Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., should be
adopted in two months, Milenkovic was quoted as saying by the
Ljubljana-based newspaper.  The previous attempt to sell a majority of Mercator to its
Croatian rival Agrokor d.d. failed after increased opposition
from Mercator management and Slovenian officials. Agrokor, which
abandoned its bid in February, may renew the effort, according
to the Croatian business newspaper Poslovni Dnevnik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
