Turkish security forces killed four
members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, while seeking a
local political leader kidnapped by the organization, Sabah
 reported .  Fighting broke out in the southeastern province of
Diyarbakir, where the PKK abducted the governing  Justice and
Development Party ’s district chief Veysel Celik on May 13,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. One policeman was
killed during the operation and four members of the Turkish
security forces were wounded, Sabah reported.  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by

autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
