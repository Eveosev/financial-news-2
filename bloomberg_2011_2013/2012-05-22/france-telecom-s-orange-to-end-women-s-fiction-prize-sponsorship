(Corrects headline, first paragraph in story published
yesterday to show ownership of Orange in U.K.)  Orange, a U.K. mobile-phone brand
owned by a joint venture of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) , plans to end its sponsorship of a prize for women’s
fiction after 17 years, as it focuses on film sponsorship in its
marketing strategy.  “Film resonates highly with smartphone users, both across
consumer and business segments,” Orange said today on its
 website . The company said it has concluded a sponsorship deal
with the British Academy of Film & Television Arts for 2013.  Orange sponsored the annual fiction prize since it started
in 1996. This year’s 30,000-pound ($47,300) prize is to be
awarded on May 30 in London.  The prize organizers “are in active discussions with a
number of potential new brand partners,” Kate Mosse, the
prize’s co-founder and honorary director, said in a  statement  on
the prize website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
