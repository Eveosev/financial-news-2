U.S. gasoline demand rose 1.3 percent
last week to the highest level since December as drivers paid
the lowest average prices in 12 weeks, according to  MasterCard
Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 9.09 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended May 18, up from 8.98 million the week before,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed. That’s the most fuel
purchased since the week ended Dec. 23.  The average pump price declined 3 cents in the past week to
$3.73 a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 24. Prices are 4.8
percent below a year earlier.  Fuel consumption was 0.9 percent below the year-earlier
level, the 38th straight decline in that measure.  “This past week’s year-over-year decline was the smallest
since the week ending Aug. 26,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst
and director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the
report. “Prices have fallen over 20 cents the past six weeks as
we approach the Memorial Day holiday and demand has picked up.  Fuel use over the previous four weeks fell 3.9 percent
below the same period in 2011, a record 61st consecutive drop in
that measure. That was the smallest decline since Jan. 20, Gamel
said.  The highest prices were on the West Coast, where the
average rose 12 cents to $4.26 a gallon. The lowest prices were
on the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon declined 7 cents to $3.55.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
