The following is the text of the
U.S. trade balance report for Feb. released by the Commerce
Department.  U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES
February 2012
Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis,
through the  Department of Commerce , announced today that total
February exports of $181.2 billion and imports of $227.2 billion
resulted in a goods and services deficit of $46.0 billion, down
from $52.5 billion in January, revised. February exports were
$0.2 billion more than January exports of $180.9 billion.
February imports were $6.3 billion less than January imports of
$233.4 billion.  In February, the goods deficit decreased $6.0 billion from
January to $61.4 billion, and the services surplus increased
$0.5 billion from January to $15.4 billion. Exports of goods
decreased $0.6 billion to $128.0 billion, and imports of goods
decreased $6.5 billion to $189.4 billion. Exports of services
increased $0.8 billion to $53.2 billion, and imports of services
increased $0.2 billion to $37.8 billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $0.6 billion from
February 2011 to February 2012. Exports were up $15.4 billion,
or 9.3 percent, and imports were up $16.1 billion, or 7.6
percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The January to February decrease in exports of goods reflected
decreases in automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.8
billion); foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.5 billion); and
industrial supplies and materials ($0.1 billion). Increases
occurred in other goods ($0.5 billion) and  consumer goods  ($0.3
billion). Capital goods were virtually unchanged.  The January to February decrease in imports of goods reflected
decreases in consumer goods ($2.7 billion); industrial supplies
and materials ($1.5 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines ($1.0 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.6
billion); and capital goods ($0.4 billion). An increase occurred
in other goods ($0.1 billion).  The February 2011 to February 2012 increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in capital goods ($4.3 billion); industrial
supplies and materials ($3.3 billion); automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($2.0 billion); other goods ($0.9 billion);
and consumer goods ($0.9 billion). A decrease occurred in foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.6 billion).  NOTE: Total goods data are reported on a balance of payments
basis unless otherwise specified. Commodity and country detail
data for goods are on a Census basis. Monthly statistics are
seasonally adjusted unless otherwise specified. For information
on data sources and definitions, see the information section on
page A-1 of this release, or at www.census.gov/ft900 or
www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/tradnewsrelease.htm
. The next FT-900 release is May 10, 2012.  The February 2011 to February 2012 increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials ($5.9
billion); capital goods ($4.6 billion); automotive vehicles,
parts, and engines ($4.0 billion); other goods ($1.1 billion);
and foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.4 billion). A decrease
occurred in consumer goods ($3.3 billion).  Services  Exports of services increased $0.8 billion from January to
February. The increase was mostly accounted for by increases in
travel, other private services (which includes items such as
business, professional, and technical services, insurance
services, and financial services), and royalties and license
fees. Changes in the other categories of services exports were
small.  Imports of services increased $0.2 billion from January to
February. The increase was more than accounted for by increases
in travel, other private services, and passenger fares. A
decrease in other transportation (which includes freight and
port services) was partly offsetting. Changes in the other
categories of services imports were small.  The February 2011 to February 2012 increase in exports of
services was $4.8 billion. The largest increases were in
royalties and license fees ($1.7 billion), other private
services ($1.2 billion), and travel ($1.2 billion). Within other
private services, the largest increases were in financial
services and in business, professional, and technical services.  The February 2011 to February 2012 increase in imports of
services was $3.5 billion. The largest increases were in other
private services ($2.1 billion) and travel ($0.6 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increases were in
business, professional, and technical services and in insurance
services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in February, exports of goods and
services averaged $180.1 billion, while imports of goods and
services averaged $229.8 billion, resulting in an average trade
deficit of $49.7 billion. For the three months ending in
January, the average trade deficit was $50.2 billion, reflecting
average exports of $178.9 billion and average imports of $229.1
billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The February figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars,
with Hong Kong $3.1 ($2.1 for January), Australia $1.7 ($1.6),
Singapore $0.7 ($0.8), and Egypt $0.2 ($0.2). Deficits were
recorded, in billions of dollars, with China $19.4 ($26.0),
Japan $7.0 ($6.2), OPEC $6.4 ($10.0), European Union $5.9
($8.5), Mexico $5.8 ($4.2), Germany $3.6 ($4.1), Canada $2.8
($4.9), Ireland $2.2 ($2.3), Venezuela $1.9 ($2.0), Nigeria $0.9
($1.3), Taiwan $0.8 ($1.3), and Korea $0.4 ($1.4).  Advanced technology products exports were $23.3 billion in
February and imports were $29.2 billion, resulting in a deficit
of $5.8 billion. February exports were $0.9 billion more than
the $22.5 billion in January, while February imports were
virtually unchanged from January.  Revisions  Census Basis (not seasonally adjusted)  For January, exports of goods were virtually unrevised and
imports of goods were revised down $0.1 billion. Goods carry-
over in February was $0.1 billion (0.1 percent) for exports and
$1.1 billion (0.7 percent) for imports. For January, revised
export carry-over was $0.2 billion (0.2 percent). For January,
revised import carry-over was $0.2 billion (0.1 percent).  Balance of Payments Basis (seasonally adjusted) For January,
exports of goods were virtually unrevised and imports of goods
were revised down $0.2 billion. For January, exports of services
were revised up $0.2 billion and imports of services were
revised up $0.3 billion. The revisions to both exports and
imports of services mostly reflects upward revisions in travel
and passenger fares.  NOTICE Changes to End-Use Commodity Classification Effective
with the January 2012 statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau and the
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have revised the
classification of several end-use commodities. These changes
were made to achieve a consistent classification between exports
and imports and to improve the grouping of the commodities based
on their end-use characteristics. These changes also reflect the
results of work performed by the World Customs Organization
(WCO) as part of its long-term program to review the
nomenclature of the international Harmonized System from which
the end-use commodity classifications are derived. The last WCO
modifications to the Harmonized System were introduced in March
2007 with the January 2007 statistics.  For both exports and imports, the most significant
reclassifications involved various semiconductor media, such as
“smart cards” and flash memory cards, which have been reassigned
from consumer goods and industrial supplies and materials to
semiconductors and related devices within capital goods. In
addition, for imports, electronic book devices and batteries
used to power vehicles have been reassigned from capital goods
to consumer goods and automotive vehicles, parts, and engines,
respectively.  Upcoming Revisions to Goods and Services On June 8, 2012, the
U.S. Census Bureau and BEA will release “U.S. International
Trade in Goods and Services: April 2012” and “U.S. International
Trade in Goods and Services: Annual Revision for 2011.” With
these releases, statistics on trade in goods, on both a Census
basis and a balance of payments (BOP) basis, and statistics on
trade in services will be revised beginning with 2009. The
revised statistics on trade in goods will reflect
reclassifications of several end-use commodities (see above), as
well as recalculated seasonal and trading-day adjustments. The
revised statistics on goods on a BOP basis and on services will
also appear in “U.S. International Transactions: First Quarter
2012” and in the annual revision of the U.S. international
transactions accounts (ITA’s), both to be released by BEA on
June 14, 2012. In addition to the changes mentioned above, BEA’s
annual revision of the ITAs will reflect newly available and
more complete source data and minor improvements to estimation
methodologies.  Profile of U.S. Importing and Exporting Companies, 2009 - 2010  On April 12, 2012 the U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Division
will release the report, “A Profile of U.S. Importing and
Exporting Companies 2009-2010”. The Profile is created from
import and export merchandise trade data and company
characteristics contained in the Census Bureau’s Business
Register. The Profile provides government and private sector
data users with information on the characteristics of companies
involved in trade including employment size, type of company,
and major foreign markets.  This year, the report contains two new export exhibits: •
