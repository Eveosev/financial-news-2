Japan  is able to cut greenhouse gas
emissions as much as 25 percent by 2030 from levels in the 1990s
even without nuclear generation if it expands renewable energy
and power-saving measures, a government research institute said.  The cuts could be as much as 39 percent assuming the nation
gets 35 percent of its generation through nuclear, the  National
Institute for Environment Studies  said in a report today.  Japan is debating its energy mix as only one of its 54
atomic reactors is online after the March earthquake and tsunami
that crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station.  The instituteâ€™s report was to be presented at a meeting of
an advisory group for the  environment minister  scheduled today
to discuss Japanese low-carbon policies and measures after 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
