Japanese utilities will use 300,000
more barrels of oil a day in 2012 than before last year’s
nuclear crisis unless it restores some of its atomic reactors,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  Japan  will also need an additional 23 billion cubic meters
of liquefied natural gas to meet demand if utilities can’t
access idled reactors, the IEA said today in a report.  Japan relied on nuclear power for almost 30 percent of its
electricity before the disaster at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic station. It had just one of its 54
reactors operating as of March 26, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “A no-nuclear scenario can’t be ruled out, as public
opinion channeled through local governments currently remains
skeptical concerning the nuclear industry, despite the apparent
economic imperatives supporting nuclear capacity restarts,” the
IEA said in the report.  Japan’s government endorsed new safety measures on April 9
to allow switching on two  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  reactors.
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda is meeting with government
officials today to discuss restarts, Kyodo reported.  With the return of some reactors, crude and fuel-oil demand
will be 250,000 barrels a day more than before the earthquake
and tsunami in March 2011 wrecked three reactors at Tepco’s
Fukushima plant northeast of  Tokyo , the IEA said. LNG demand
will be 19 billion cubic meters more, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
