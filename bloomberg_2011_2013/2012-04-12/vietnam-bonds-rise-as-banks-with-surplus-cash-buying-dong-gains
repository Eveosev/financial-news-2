Vietnamese bonds rose, with
benchmark five-year yields sliding to the lowest in almost 17
months, on speculation banks are taking advantage of increased
cash availability to buy debt. The dong advanced.  Government notes climbed for a sixth straight day after
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said on the central bank’s website
yesterday that lenders’ current surplus funds totaled 130
trillion dong ($6.2 billion), without giving comparative data.  “Bonds are still a good investment channel now, so almost
every bank wants to buy more bonds especially when they have a
funds surplus,” said Do Thi Lan Anh, a fixed-income dealer at
Vietnam Technological and Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi.  The  yield  on five-year notes fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.20 percent, the lowest level since Nov.
17, 2010, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. Three-year yields dropped five basis points to 11.09
percent, the least since Feb. 18, 2011.  The dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,825 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Ven Ram, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
