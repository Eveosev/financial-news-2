Belarus plans to convert all of its
state-owned transportation enterprises aside from  Belarusian
Railway  into open joint stock companies by 2015, paving the way
for the government’s divestment program.  “Shares in these companies should be sold to investors who
pledge to maintain the companies’ main specialization in
transportation,” Transportation Minister Ivan Scherbo told
reporters after a parliamentary hearing in the capital, Minsk
today.  The structure of Belarus’s flagship state air carrier
 Belavia  may be changed into a joint stock company next year,
Scherbo said, without elaborating if the government had any
offers to buy the airline after a possible reincorporation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
