Cosan SA Industria e Comercio ,
which controls the world’s largest sugar-port terminal, said
it’s in preliminary talks to buy  BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s $1.7 billion
stake in Brazil’s largest natural-gas distribution company.  Cosan and BG haven’t reached a binding agreement on the
60.1 percent stake in  Cia de Gas de Sao Paulo (CGAS5)  - Comgas, and will
inform the market of developments, Cosan said in a regulatory
filing today. BG confirmed the talks in a separate statement.  BG, the U.K.’s third-biggest oil and gas producer, is
considering selling the gas distribution assets as it ramps up
spending on oil production projects in deep waters off the coast
of Brazil. BG is a minority partner in the country’s largest oil
field, Lula.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled
producer, is the field’s operator.  “In the short term, depending on the amount involved, the
transaction would add too much pressure to Cosan’s leverage and
cash position,” Erick Hood, an analyst at brokerage SLW
Corretora, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. “For Comgas
shareholders it could be positive, depending on the value.”  Cosan, based in Sao Paulo, fell 3.7 percent to 32.25 reais
at 4:15 p.m. in Sao Paulo after dropping as much as 5.6 percent,
the biggest decline since Feb. 22. BG rose 1.2 percent to 1,407
pence in London.  Cosan also jointly owns the sugar-cane processor with Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and gets part of its sales from fuel and
lubricant distribution.  To contact the reporters on this story:
