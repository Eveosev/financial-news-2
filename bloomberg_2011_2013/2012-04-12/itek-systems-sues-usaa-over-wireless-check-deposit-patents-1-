Mitek Systems Inc. (MITK) , a document-
imaging company, sued United Services Automobile Association,
known as USAA, accusing it of infringing five patents for making
check deposits with mobile electronic devices.  USAA, an insurer based in San Antonio, agreed to use San
Diego-based Mitek’s software, then developed its own mobile-
deposit system by creating “a knockoff product,” lawyers for
Mitek said in a complaint filed in federal court today in
Wilmington, Delaware.  Mitek contends it “will continue to suffer irreparable
harm” because USAA is wrongly using technology protected by its
patents and has violated a contract that limits transaction-
volume.  Mitek seeks a  jury trial , unspecified damages and a court
order to stop the infringement by USAA, which provides banking,
insurance, and retirement services to the U.S. military and
their families.  The case is related to a lawsuit filed by USAA against
Mitek on March 29 in federal court in  San Antonio  alleging it,
not Mitek, invented the technology.  Mitek fell 25 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $6.09 in Nasdaq
stock market trading in  New York .  Paul Berry, a spokesman for USAA, said he hadn’t seen the
suit and couldn’t immediately comment.  The case is Mitek v. USAA, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
