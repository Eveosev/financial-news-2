Egypt  will offer 5 billion Egyptian
pounds ($828 million) of treasury bills after two parliamentary
committees approved an economic plan as a precursor to securing
foreign aid. The nation’s dollar bonds fell.  The North African country will seek bids for six- and 12-
month notes valued at 2 billion pounds and 3 billion pounds,
respectively, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It
sold similar-maturity notes at  14.856 percent  and  15.729 percent 
at last week’s auction.  The two committees gave their support to the state plan
that is part of its request for a $3.2 billion loan from the
 International Monetary Fund , Ashraf Badreldin, a lawmaker with
Egypt’s biggest parliamentary bloc, the Freedom and Justice
Party, said this week. The IMF said it would stay in contact
with Egyptian authorities in “the coming weeks as they finalize
the remaining details of their economic program.”  Yields on Egyptian domestic debt have receded from record
highs after the central bank reduced the local-currency reserve
requirement for local banks last month, making more cash
available to invest in government debt. The  finance ministry 
sold 4 billion pounds of  nine-month securities  yesterday at an
average yield of 15.529 percent, down from 15.622 percent at the
previous auction. It was seeking to raise 3 billion pounds.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 fell less than one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 7.1 percent at 9:08 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate jumped 29 basis points
yesterday, the most since Dec. 13. The Egyptian pound gained
less than 0.1 percent to 6.0398 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
