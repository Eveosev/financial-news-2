Gerresheimer AG (GXI) , a German maker of
glass and plastic products for the health-care industry, rose
the most in six months after higher first-quarter sales prompted
the company to raise its revenue forecast for this year.  Gerresheimer expects  sales  to increase by 7 percent to
8 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast for a gain of
5 percent to 6 percent, the company said in a  statement  today.
The manufacturer maintained a forecast for adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 19.5
percent of sales. That measure declined to 16.5 percent in the
first quarter, from 17.7 percent a year earlier.  The shares  rose  as much as 7.5 percent to 34.52 euros in
 Frankfurt  trading, the biggest intraday jump since Oct. 6. The
stock was up 4.4 percent at 10:23 a.m., giving Gerresheimer a
market value of 1.06 billion euros ($1.39 billion).  “The increased sales guidance is a positive surprise, and
it’s mainly due to strength in operating business,” said
Edouard Aubery, an  analyst  at Equinet Bank AG in Frankfurt.
“For this year, improving profitability in tubular glass will
be key, as well as sales growth in plastic systems. Earnings
momentum will increase, with the biggest improvement coming in
the second half.” Aubery recommends that investors buy the
stock and predicts it will rise to 37 euros within a year.  First-quarter sales at the Dusseldorf-based company rose
almost 14 percent to 268.8 million euros, while net income
declined 4.2 percent to 6.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
