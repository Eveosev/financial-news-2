Voestalpine AG (VOE)  Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Eder said demand in its steel unit would be
better in the first half of fiscal 2013 than in the second half
of fiscal 2012.  Eder sees complete utilization in its stainless steel,
metal forming and railway system units, he told reporters in
Vienna today. Prices in the three units will be at the “lower
end of the average, but far away from the trough,” he said,
adding that he sees “a continuation of the capacities, the
revenue and the results of the last quarters.”  Voestalpine’s fiscal year starts in April and runs through
March.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
