Reddy Ice Holdings Inc. (RDDY) , a maker
and distributor of about 1.8 million tons of ice a year, filed
for bankruptcy protection from creditors.  The company and a subsidiary, Reddy Ice Corp., listed
consolidated assets of $434 million and debt of $530.8 million
as of Dec. 31 in Chapter 11 documents filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, where it is based. Reddy Ice Corp.
also sought protection.  Reddy Ice’s 2011 annual report was delayed because
management needed more time to “finalize and analyze” its
financial statements, the company said in a March 30 filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reddy Ice also said it
was in talks on restructuring and reducing debt.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Reddy Ice’s corporate credit
rating two grades to CC after the SEC filing. Noteholders are
likely to receive from zero to 10 percent recovery in a default,
S&P said. Moody’s Investors Service on April 3 reduced Reddy
Ice’s corporate family rating to Ca from Caa1.  Reddy Ice reported a net loss of $36.2 million for the
first nine months of 2011 on sales of $273.6 million. The
company, with origins dating to the early 1900s, sells its
products in 34 states and the District of Columbia.  Arctic Glacier Inc., a producer, marketer and distributor
of packaged ice to consumers in the U.S. and  Canada , filed for
bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Feb. 22.  The case is In re Reddy Ice Holdings Inc., 12-32349,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
