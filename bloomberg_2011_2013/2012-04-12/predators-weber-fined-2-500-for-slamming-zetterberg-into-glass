Nashville Predators defenseman Shea Weber was fined $2,500 by the  National Hockey League  for
slamming  Detroit Red Wings  forward Henrik Zetterberg into the
glass at the end of a first-round playoff game last night.  The fine is the maximum allowed under the league’s
collective bargaining agreement, Senior Vice President of Player
Safety and Hockey Operations Brendan Shanahan announced today on
the NHL’s website. No suspension accompanied the fine for what
Shanahan termed a “reckless and reactionary play.”  As time expired in the Predators’ 3-2 home victory,
Zetterberg checked Weber against the boards behind the Nashville
net. Weber threw a punch at Zetterberg in response, then grabbed
the forward’s head from behind and hit it against the glass.  The Most Valuable Player of the 2008 playoffs, Zetterberg
was slow getting to his feet following the hit but should be
available to play tomorrow the second game of the best-of-seven
series, according to Shanahan. Weber, a three-time All-Star and
team captain, was assessed a two-minute penalty for roughing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
