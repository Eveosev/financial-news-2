Divisions at the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission could prompt a panel of regulators from
other agencies to intervene in a debate over strengthening rules
governing the $2.6 trillion money-market fund industry, three
people familiar with the situation said.  If the SEC is unable to reach agreement, the Financial
Stability Oversight Council, established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank
Act to monitor large risks to the economy, may decide to
officially designate money funds as “systemically important.”
That would increase pressure on the SEC to overcome industry
opposition and internal disagreements to propose new rules.  “I expect FSOC to declare  money-market funds ”
systemically significant “if it becomes clear the SEC cannot
act,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, co-founder and managing partner
at Washington-based Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a
regulatory consulting firm. “And I expect them to do so by the
summer.”  SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  has warned since November that a
run on money-market firms could damage the economy, a view
shared by the Obama administration and other regulators. She
hasn’t been able to convince a majority of her colleagues on the
five-member commission to join her on tighter rules that could
include  capital requirements  or a change to the industry’s
traditional $1 share price.  SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment on the
prospect of an FSOC intervention. Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley wouldn’t comment on behalf of the FSOC.  Fed Pressure  Other regulators, particularly those at the  Federal
Reserve , are stepping up the pressure on the SEC to act soon. In
an April 9 speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
conference, Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said that though the SEC
strengthened rules on money-market funds in 2010, more needs to
be done.  “The risk of runs remains a concern,” he said at the
speech in Stone Mountain,  Georgia . “Additional steps to
increase the resiliency of money-market funds are important for
the overall stability of our financial system and warrant
serious consideration.”  Concern over money funds, once seen as among the safest of
investments, grew after the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5
billion  Reserve Primary Fund (REPXX) , which triggered a broader run that
contributed to a freeze in global financial markets. The run
calmed only after the Treasury Department temporarily guaranteed
money-fund shareholders against losses and the Fed began buying
fund assets at face value to help them meet redemptions.  Trillions in Assets  All U.S. money funds now hold a combined $2.56 trillion in
assets, including $919 billion in institutional prime funds,
according to research firm iMoneyNet in Westborough,
 Massachusetts . The largest funds include  JPMorgan Prime Money
Market Fund (CJPXX) ,  Fidelity Cash Reserves (FDRXX)  and  Vanguard Prime Money
Market Fund. (VMMXX)   The rules the SEC adopted in 2010 introduced liquidity
minimums, average maturity limits and new disclosure
requirements. Additional options include ending the funds’
traditional $1 share price. Although the stable price is a
central selling point for the funds, critics say it also makes
them more vulnerable to runs because investors are likely to
flee after even small losses that don’t immediately reduce the
$1 share value.  At the Fed conference this week,  Eric Rosengren , the
president of the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , dedicated an
entire speech to the links between money-market funds and
financial stability.  Excessive Risk  “There may be opportunities for SEC policy making and
monitoring to inhibit funds from taking on excessive credit
risk,” he said. “The SEC limitations placed on credit risk are
currently too broad to avoid significant credit risk exposure.”  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner , who is the FSOC’s
chairman, has also called on the SEC to address the risk that he
says money-market funds pose.  Still, Republican SEC Commissioners Daniel Gallagher and
 Troy Paredes , remain opposed to new rules. In several recent
speeches, Gallagher has outlined a philosophy of keeping the SEC
out of debates over whether a particular company or industry
poses a systemic risk to the economy.  “Contrary to the perceptions of some, we are not systemic
risk regulators,” Gallagher said March 8 at an investor adviser
conference in Arlington, Virginia. “Dodd-Frank created the
Financial Stability Oversight Council to take on that systemic
risk role and although the SEC chairman is a member of the FSOC,
the Commission is not. Given the SEC’s mission and the nature of
investing in securities, the commission cannot -- and should not
-- endeavor to eliminate risk-taking.”  Swing Vote  Commissioner  Luis Aguilar , a Democrat, is uncommitted and
is seen as the swing vote that could deny Schapiro the majority
she would need to issue a proposal for public comment. Aguilar
was the general counsel at money-management firm  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) 
during the 1990s.  The SEC has also been hobbled because of intense opposition
to additional regulation from money-market funds. Christopher
Donohue, the chief executive officer of Pittsburgh-based
 Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , the third-biggest U.S. money fund
provider, said Jan. 27 that his firm would sue the SEC if it
went forward with a proposed rule.  In an April 6 comment letter to the SEC, Marie Chandoha,
the president of Charles Schwab Investment Management, said the
types of changes Schapiro has discussed could “devastate”
money-market funds.  Proposals ‘Unworkable’  “Proposals such as requiring money-market funds to float
their net asset values or imposing a mandatory holdback that
would prevent investors from having immediate access to all of
their assets are unworkable for funds and for individual
investors,” Chandoha wrote.  In one sign of increased pressure, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce has bought all the advertising space inside the
Washington metro stop adjacent to the SEC’s headquarters and
plans to cover the walls, floors and fare card machines next
week with orange and purple banners challenging the proposed
changes.  “Money market funds work for American investors,” reads
one of the banners. “Why risk changing them now?”  Intervention  The FSOC could intervene into the money-market debate in
one of two ways -- by declaring the industry’s activities
systemically important or by designating individual funds as a
systemic risk. If the FSOC declared the sector as risky, the SEC
would have to either propose rules or explain why it is unable
to do so.  That would increase pressure on either Aguilar or the
Republican commissioners to support a rule, said  Cornelius Hurley , the director of the Morin Center for Banking and
Financial Law at  Boston  University.  “If you have a 15-member council, 10 of whom can vote,
telling you to do something and you don’t, you have some serious
explaining to do,” Hurley said.  Individual funds must have assets exceeding $50 billion to
be declared systemically significant. There are seven such
funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and they would
be subject to heightened supervision by the Fed if they were
declared significant.  It is not clear whether Schapiro would be willing to cede
work on one of her signature issues to regulators at other
agencies, Hurley said. That underscores why Congress created the
FSOC as part of the 2010 financial-regulatory overhaul.  “We’ve witnessed instances in which agencies are captured
by the industries they regulate,” he said. “Schapiro is trying
to push back against that and having difficulty mustering a
majority to do it. This is the proper role of FSOC to take a
more eclectic view.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
