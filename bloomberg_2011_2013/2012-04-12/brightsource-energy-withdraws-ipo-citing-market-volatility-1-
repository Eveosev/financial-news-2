BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) , a
developer of solar-thermal systems for electricity and enhanced
oil production, withdrew its planned initial public offering,
citing adverse market conditions.  The Oakland, California-based company said in a statement
today that it intends to withdraw the registration it filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  “While we received significant interest from potential
investors, the continued market and economic volatility are not
optimal conditions for an IPO,” John Woolard, BrightSource’s
president and chief executive officer, was quoted as saying in
the statement on  Business Wire .  BrightSource anticipated raising about $210.1 million from
the offering and a planned sale of shares to Alstom Power Inc.
and Caithness Energy LLC’s development unit in a concurrent
private placement, according to the March 30 SEC  filing .  The company said it planned to spend the money raised from
the share sale to develop U.S. solar-thermal power plants, which
use mirrors to focus sunlight on boilers that make steam to
drive turbines. The company has 13 contracts to sell power from
projects totaling 2.4 gigawatts of capacity to the electric
utilities of  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  and  Edison International (EIX) , according to
the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
