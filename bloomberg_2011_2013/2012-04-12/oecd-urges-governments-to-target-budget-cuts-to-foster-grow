The  Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development  urged governments seeking to trim
budget deficits to target inefficient spending and select tax
increases that won’t distort the economy.  “Given that spending cuts are largely unavoidable, a key
question is how to maximize the positive and minimize the
negative impacts on long-run growth,” the Paris-based OECD said
in a report today. “There is scope to increase revenue by
measures to broaden the tax base, particularly by bringing so-
called tax expenditures -- tax credits and deductions.”  Total government debt in the OECD’s 34 member states has
risen to more than 100 percent of their combined economic output
in the wake of the financial crisis that began five years ago,
the organization estimates. Japan, Greece and  Italy  are the
three countries with the highest debt burden, while  Australia ,
Luxembourg and  South Korea  are those with the lowest.  “Due to the scale of consolidation needs, most countries
will need a sustained period of fiscal tightening, acting on
both the revenue and spending side,” the OECD said.  Governments may be able to find “efficiency gains” in
spending on health and education that yield savings of between
0.5 percent and 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, the OECD
said. Broadening tax bases and eliminating tax breaks may raise
revenue equivalent to 1 percent of GDP, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
