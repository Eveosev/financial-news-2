The following is the text of
the new house price index report for February released by
 Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.3% in February,
following a 0.1% increase in January.  The metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa was the top
contributor to the increase in February. The positive impact of
this region on the overall index was slightly offset by the
decrease observed in  Vancouver .  From January to February, Regina (+2.4%) posted the largest
monthly price advance, followed by Halifax (+1.2%) and St.
Catharines-Niagara (+1.1%).  In Regina, price increases were primarily the result of
higher land development costs as well as increased material and
labour costs.  In Halifax and St. Catharines-Niagara, the rise in prices
was predominantly explained by higher material and labour costs.  In February, prices were unchanged in 5 of the 21
metropolitan regions surveyed.  The most significant monthly price declines were recorded
in Charlottetown (-0.5%) and Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton
(-0.4%).  Builders in Charlottetown reported lower negotiated selling
prices in February, while those in Saint John, Fredericton and
Moncton reduced their prices to stimulate sales as a result of
slower market conditions.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 2.3% in February, following
a 2.4% increase the previous month. The main contributor to the
advance was the metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa.  The largest year-over-year price increases were recorded in
Regina (+5.9%), Toronto and Oshawa (+5.8%) and Winnipeg (+3.8%).  Other notable year-over-year increases in contractorsâ€™
selling prices were observed in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo
(+2.7%) and Ottawa-Gatineau (+2.6%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 3 posted 12-
month price declines in February, with Victoria (-2.4%) posting
the largest decrease.  Note to readers  The New Housing  Price Index  measures changes over time in
the selling prices of new residential houses agreed upon between
the contractor and the buyer at the time of the signing of the
contract. It is designed to measure the changes in the selling
prices of new houses where detailed specifications pertaining to
each house remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index are
market selling prices less value added taxes, such as the
Federal Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax.  This release presents data that are not seasonally adjusted
and the indexes published are final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
