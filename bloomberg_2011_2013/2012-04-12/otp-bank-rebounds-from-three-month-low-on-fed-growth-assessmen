OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungaryâ€™s largest
lender, rebounded from the lowest close in almost three months
as the Federal Reserve said the  U.S. economy  continues to
expand, boosting bets on a recovery in the world economy.  The shares rose 0.7 percent to 3,625 forint by 10:10 a.m.
in Budapest. The stock fell to 3,600 forint yesterday, the
weakest since Jan. 18., after the news website Origo reported
that Hungary plans to introduce a financial transaction tax from
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
