The European Union’s plan to
abolish sugar output limits in 2015 will encourage more
concentration of beet sugar production in the bloc, according to
the  European Association of Sugar Traders , known as ASSUC.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, last
year proposed to end sugar quotas on Sept. 30, 2015 as part of
the 27-nation bloc’s agricultural policy reform. The quotas cap
the amount of sweetener produced to be sold within the EU.  “EU sugar policy as a whole should promote and defend
conditions which provide for a multitude of participants and for
regional diversity,” the association, which represents more
than 60 companies in  Europe , said in a statement e-mailed today.
“ASSUC therefore supports the maintenance of the quota system
for the EU sugar market for as long as necessary.”  The association also urged the EU to review a limit on
exports of the sweetener, according to the statement. A ruling
from the  World Trade Organization  in 2005 limited EU exports of
subsidized sugar to 1.37 million metric tons.  The 2006 reform of the bloc’s sugar sector has “suppressed
export subsidies” and therefore the ruling is “obsolete,”
ASSUC said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
