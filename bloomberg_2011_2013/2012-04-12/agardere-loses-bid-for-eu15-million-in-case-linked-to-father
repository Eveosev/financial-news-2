Arnaud Lagardere, chief executive
officer of  Lagardere SCA (MMB) , lost a human rights court bid for 15
million euros ($19.7 million) over a French case involving his
late father that dates back to 1992.  While the  European Court  of Human Rights in Strasbourg,
 France , said the French state had violated Lagardere’s right to
a fair hearing, it ruled he hadn’t been able to establish a
direct link between the breach and the damages he claimed. The
court, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights,
awarded Lagardere 10,000 euros in damages and 10,000 euros in
costs plus interest and tax, in a  judgment  published on its
website.  Jean-Luc Lagardere, the late chairman and founder of
Lagardere, died in 2003. A French court of appeals in
Versailles, near Paris, said two years later that
Arnaud Lagardere and the rest of his father’s estate must pay 14
million euros in relation to a complaint filed by shareholder
Alain Geniteau in 1992, accusing Jean-Luc Lagardere of misusing
company assets.  Lagardere spokesman Ramzi Khiroun didn’t immediately reply
to a request for comment on his mobile and by e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
