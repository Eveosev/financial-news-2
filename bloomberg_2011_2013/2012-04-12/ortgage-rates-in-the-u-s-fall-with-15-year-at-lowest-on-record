Mortgage  rates  in the U.S. fell,
with the 15-year average hitting a record low, as weak job
growth and concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis drove investors to
the safety of the Treasuries that guide home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage declined to 3.88
percent in the week ended today from 3.98 percent,  Freddie Mac (FMCC) 
said in a statement. The rate was 3.87 percent in February, the
lowest in  Freddie Mac  data dating to 1971. The average  15-year (NMCM15US) 
rate dropped to 3.11 percent from 3.21 percent. The previous low
was 3.13 last month, according to the McLean, Virginia-based
mortgage-finance company.  The 10-year  Treasury yield , a benchmark for mortgages, fell
below 2 percent for the first time in almost a month on April 10
as yields on Spanish and Italian bonds increased. The U.S. Labor
Department said April 6 that employers added 120,000 jobs in
March, the fewest in five months and less than the most
pessimistic estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “There was a tempering of optimism,” said  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage-data
firm in Pompton Plains,  New Jersey . “The market was getting a
little ahead of itself about where the economy was domestically
and globally.”  Home-loan applications in the U.S. dropped for the eighth
week in the last nine as fewer homes were refinanced. The
Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  decreased 2.4 percent in
the period ended April 6, the Washington-based group reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
