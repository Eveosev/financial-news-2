London police said their anti-
terrorism hot line wasn’t hacked by activists following an
investigation into claims calls were recorded.  “We are confident the MPS communication systems have not
been breached and remain, as they always have been, secure,”
Ailsa Beaton, director of information for the  Metropolitan
Police Service , said in an e-mailed statement. “We are
satisfied that any recording would have been made via the
receiving handset only and not from an attack on internal
systems.”  The Met said earlier today that the anti-terrorism hot line
may have been accessed by unidentified “hoaxers” who recorded
phone calls and other conversations between hot-line staff.  The investigation comes as the police force known as
Scotland Yard is investigating the LulzSec group of hackers who
have attacked websites of businesses and government agencies. A
British man arrested as part of a joint U.K. and U.S.
investigation was denied bail last month after he contacted a
co-conspirator in the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
