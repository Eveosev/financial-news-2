Carmelo Anthony  scored 32 points
and had 10 rebounds as the New York Knicks beat the Milwaukee
Bucks 111-107 to boost their chances of reaching the National
Basketball Association playoffs.  The Knicks improved to 30-28, two games ahead of the Bucks
(28-30) in the race for the eighth and final postseason berth in
the Eastern Conference. New York’s win gives it a split of its
four regular-season games against the Bucks. The Knicks are a
game behind the  Philadelphia 76ers , who are seventh in the
standings after a 93-75 win at the Toronto Raptors last night.  Tyson Chandler had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Iman Shumpert contributed 16 points last night for the Knicks, who
are playing without the injured Amar’e Stoudemire and Jeremy Lin. Monta Ellis led the Bucks with 35 points and 10 assists,
while  Brandon Jennings  scored 22 points.  New York, which has won seven of its past 10 games, has
eight games remaining in the regular season, which ends April
26.  The Knicks return to Madison Square Garden for their next
three games, against the  Washington Wizards , Miami Heat and
 Boston Celtics (2111Q) .  Milwaukee’s next three games are against the Detroit
Pistons and Wizards on the road, and at home against the Indiana
Pacers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
