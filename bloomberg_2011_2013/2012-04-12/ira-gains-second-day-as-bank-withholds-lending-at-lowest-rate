The lira strengthened the most in
more than two weeks after the Turkish central bank withheld
lending at its lowest rate for a second day.  Turkey ’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 1.7973 per
dollar at 5:06 a.m. in Istanbul, heading for the biggest gain
since March 26 on a closing basis. The  yield  on two-year
benchmark debt declined nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 9.35 percent.  The lira has rallied 5.2 percent this year, recouping some
of last year’s 18 percent depreciation. Central bank governor
Erdem Basci yesterday halted lending at the lower end of the
interest rate corridor, 5.75 percent, after the lira weakened to
a three-week low on growing concern the European debt crisis may
worsen. The central bank received bids for 8.24 billion ($4.6
billion) in its one-week repo auction today. It lent 2 billion
liras at 10.92 percent, the highest rate since Jan. 20.  “The central bank has lent support to the lira again,”
Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in e-mailed comments. The lira might
“sustainably break the 1.80 support” against the dollar, she
said.  The overnight lending rate on the  interbank repo market 
fell for the first time in three days to 9.9 percent from 10
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
