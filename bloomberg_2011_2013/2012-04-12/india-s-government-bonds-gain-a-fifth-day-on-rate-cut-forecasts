India ’s 10-year bonds rose for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak since December, on
optimism the central bank will lower  interest rates  next week to
support  economic growth .  Eleven of sixteen economists in a Bloomberg News survey
predict the  repurchase rate  will be cut 25 basis points to 8.25
percent at the  Reserve Bank  of India’s policy review on April
17. Three forecast no change while two see a reduction of 50
basis points. Indian manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in
three months in March, a private report showed on April 2. The
Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 54.7 from 56.6 in February,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  “A cut in rates is absolutely certain now,” said R.S.
Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of currencies and bonds at
 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ)  “Growth is increasingly
becoming a concern.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.53 percent as
of 9:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the lowest level since March 27.  Official data may show today annual gains in  factory output 
slowed to 6.7 percent in February from 6.8 percent the previous
month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
 Reserve Bank of India  boosted the  repurchase  rate 13 times
between March 2010 and October 2011.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 8 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
