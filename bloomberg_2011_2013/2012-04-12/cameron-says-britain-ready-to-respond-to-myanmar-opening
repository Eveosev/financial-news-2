U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said Britain is “ready to respond” to steps to make Myanmar a
democracy and that he will thank the nation’s President Thein
Sein for action already taken to liberalize the political
process.  “If Burma moves towards democracy then we should respond in
kind and we should not be slow in doing that,” Cameron told BBC
Radio 5 today as he traveled to Malaysia on the third day of a
visit to  Asia . “But first I want to go and see on the ground
for myself how things are going.”  Cameron is scheduled to travel to Myanmar tomorrow, where
he will become the first major head of state to visit the former
military junta since it held by-elections on April 1. Myanmar
dissident  Aung San Suu Kyi ’s National League for Democracy won
43 of 45 seats it competed for in the contest.  Myanmar is pushing the U.S. and European Union to end
sanctions after Thein Sein released political prisoners, eased
media restrictions and dismantled a fixed  exchange rate  that
hindered investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
