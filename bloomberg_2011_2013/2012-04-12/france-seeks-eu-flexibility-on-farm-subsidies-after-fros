French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire asked the European Union for “flexibility” on farm-
subsidy payments after farmers suffered crop damage from
freezing weather.  Le Maire wrote to EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos
on April 10, the agriculture ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. The minister guaranteed farm unions that area
payments will be made for frozen plots provided weeds are
correctly managed, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
