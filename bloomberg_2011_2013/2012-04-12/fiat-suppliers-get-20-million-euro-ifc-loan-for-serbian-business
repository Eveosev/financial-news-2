The  International Finance Corp .
will lend 20 million euros ($26 million) to a metal-stamping
factory in  Serbia  which will supply parts to the local  Fiat SpA (F) 
plant.  The IFC, the  World Bank ’s private lending arm, approved the
loan to PMC Automotive Serbia, a joint venture between Italian
automotive suppliers CLN Group and PROMA Group, the lender said
in an e-mail today.  The loan is part of an IFC effort to support “the revival
of the car industry in Serbia and the creation of new skilled
jobs,” it said.  PMC Automotive, with 370 workers, will supply parts to
Fiat’s plant, which starts production of its new subcompact with
improved fuel efficiency this month. The plant’s current
20,000-car capacity will expand to 140,000 in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
