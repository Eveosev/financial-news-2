Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) , a U.K. fund
manager that invests in emerging markets, said assets under
management increased 9.1 percent in the fiscal third quarter to
$65.9 billion as markets advanced.  Net inflows from clients in the period added $1.2 billion
to funds under management for the period ending March 31 and
$4.3 billion came from  investment performance , the London-based
company said in a statement today. The firm said it is
performing “in line” with management’s expectations.  “Consistent with Ashmore’s long standing investment
approach of adding risk during periods of market volatility such
as that experienced in our first half, all investment themes
have subsequently delivered positive investment performance in
what has been a strong third quarter,” Ashmore said in the
statement.  Ashmore, which has almost half of its assets invested in
emerging-market debt, has risen 16 percent in London trading
this year. The firm’s flagship  Emerging Markets Liquid
Investment Portfolio (ASHEMLI)  fund, with $3.9 billion of assets, is up
6.8 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
