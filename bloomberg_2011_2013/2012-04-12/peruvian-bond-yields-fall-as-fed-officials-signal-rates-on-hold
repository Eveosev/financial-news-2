Peruvian dollar-denominated bonds
gained as signs the  Federal Reserve  will keep U.S. borrowing
costs at a record low boosted demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.6 percent at 11:27 a.m. in Lima. That’s
the lowest yield since the security was issued in 2007. The
price rose 0.21 cent to 128.71 cents per dollar.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  endorsed the central bank’s
view that borrowing costs are likely to stay low through 2014 to
prop up the world’s largest economy. The Fed Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said it’s “still too soon to
conclude that we are out of the woods.” The  Bank of Japan  will
pursue “powerful easing” to overcome deflation, Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said today after policy makers kept their key
rate between zero and 0.1 percent.  “People just can’t find yield anywhere,”  Enrique Alvarez ,
head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal, said
by phone from New York. The Fed officials’ comments suggest
“you may have a longer period of zero  interest rates ” and
“there may be more liquidity if needed.”  Peru’s central bank will probably keep borrowing costs
unchanged at 4.25 percent for an 11th month at a meeting today,
according to all 10 economists in a Bloomberg  survey .  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.66 per U.S. dollar,
from 2.6620 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points to 164,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
