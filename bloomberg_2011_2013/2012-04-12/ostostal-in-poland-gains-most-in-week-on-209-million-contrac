Mostostal Warszawa SA (MSW) , the Polish
unit of Spainâ€™s  Acciona SA (ANA) , rose the most in more than a week
after the construction company won a contract to build a waste-
to-energy project.  The shares added as much as 1.6 percent to 14.88 zloty, the
most since April 3, and traded 1.5 percent higher at 11:50 a.m.
in Warsaw.  Mostostal secured a 666.2 million-zloty ($209 million)
order from Szczecin, the north-western Polish city, the company
said on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
