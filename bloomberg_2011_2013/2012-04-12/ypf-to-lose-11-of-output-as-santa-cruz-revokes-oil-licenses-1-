YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest energy
company, will lose an additional 11 percent of crude production
after Santa Cruz province revoked three licenses yesterday,
saying the oil producer wasn’t investing enough.  Santa Cruz Governor Daniel Peralta issued a decree ending
the oilfield concessions because Buenos Aires-based YPF was
“mocking us” with its investment plans, according to a
 statement  on the provincial government website late last night.  YPF has lost at least 15 oil concessions in six provinces
since March 13, representing about 16 percent of the company’s
output, according to energy secretariat data. Provincial
governments started ending licenses after the government of
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  demanded YPF boost
investments and output in an attempt to curb fuel imports.  Newspapers including El Cronista Comercial and Ambito
Financiero have reported this week that the Argentine government
will announce today the acquisition of a stake of at least 30
percent in YPF, citing sources it didn’t identify.  The concessions  Santa Cruz  pulled yesterday are Canadon
Vasco, Los Perales-Las Mesetas and Pico Truncado-El Cordon. YPF
yesterday presented a 5 year-plan to invest $4.4 billion in 11
concessions in Santa Cruz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
