Oil markets are better supplied for
the first time since 2009 as “sluggish” demand and OPEC output
at its highest in more than three years eased inventory
depletion, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Global oil inventories may have increased by more than 1
million barrels in the first quarter, the Paris-based IEA said
in its monthly Oil Market Report today. The agency kept its
world demand estimate for 2012 little changed at 89.9 million
barrels a day.  Iranian (OPCRIRAN)  output may tumble more than 20 percent by
mid-summer as international sanctions take effect, it said.  “The cycle of repeatedly tightening fundamentals evident
since 2009 has been broken for now,” said the IEA, which
advises 28 nations on  energy policy . “The earlier tide of
remorseless market tightening looks to have turned.”  Brent crude futures have climbed 12 percent this year,
trading at $120 a barrel today in London, amid concern that
tougher embargoes against  Iran  will cut supply and stoke
political tension in the  Middle East . Prices have been tempered
by “speculation on a potential strategic stock release,” said
the IEA, which didn’t comment on the likelihood of such
emergency measures in its report.  Perceived Shortage  A monthly report from Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries also released today echoed the IEA’s assessment that
supply levels are adequate.  “The oil market is well-supplied,” OPEC’s Vienna-based
secretariat said. “High prices cannot be justified by the
current market fundamentals. Instead it is more the impact of
geopolitical factors and a perceived shortage of oil, rather
than evidence of any actual or impending shortfall, that is
keeping prices high.”  Worldwide oil demand will increase by 800,000 barrels a day
in 2012, or 0.9 percent, to 89.9 million a day, according to the
IEA. That’s 20,000 barrels less than forecast last month. OPEC
projects that consumption will increase by 900,000 barrels a
day, or 1 percent, to 88.6 million a day.  Inventories held by companies in the 34 most-industrialized
nations fell by 12.4 million barrels in February, compared with
an average drop for the period of 38.8 million, the IEA said.  While that leaves supplies in those countries, which make
up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
below their five-year average, at 2.63 billion barrels, in terms
of days of consumption stockpiles rose by 1.2 days to 59.6 days.  Iranian Embargo  An embargo on Iranian crude by the European Union and
allied nations scheduled to take effect in July has already cut
the Islamic republic’s production by 250,000 barrels a day to
3.3 million a day, a level which may fall to 2.6 million in the
middle of the year, the IEA estimates.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global supply, has
“already shown that they can step into the breach to replace
lost volumes,” the agency said.  OPEC (OPCRTOTL)  bolstered production by 135,000 barrels a day last
month to 31.43 million a day amid higher output from  Libya (OPCRLIBY)  and
 Iraq , the IEA estimates. That’s about 1.3 million barrels more
than the producer group will need to provide this year,
according to the IEA. OPEC will next meet for a review of
production targets in June.  Output growth outside OPEC may also have a “calming effect
on prices as the year progresses,” the IEA predicted.  While the agency holds a “fairly cautious view” on the
recovery of production after a slump of 500,000 barrels a day in
March amid losses in the  North Sea ,  Canada ,  Yemen  and  Sudan , it
expects non-OPEC supply to increase later in the year.  Output from non-OPEC producers will rise by 700,000 barrels
a day this year to an average of 53.4 million barrels a day in
2012, according to the IEA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
