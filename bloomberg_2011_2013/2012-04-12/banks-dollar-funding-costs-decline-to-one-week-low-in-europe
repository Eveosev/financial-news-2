The cost for banks to convert euro
interest payments into dollars fell for the second day to the
cheapest level in a week, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 52 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:40 a.m. in
London from minus 55 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The measure reached minus 57 on April 10, the most expensive
since March 19.  The one-year basis swap was 54 basis points below Euribor
from minus 56, the highest cost since March 2. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  European banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed with the Euribor-OIS spread, the difference
between the borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, at
41 basis points. The measure reached an eight-month low at 40
basis points on April 10.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 653 billion euros ($858 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based bank, up from 788 billion euros on April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
