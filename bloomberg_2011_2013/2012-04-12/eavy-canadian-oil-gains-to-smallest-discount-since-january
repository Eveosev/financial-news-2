Western Canada Select, a heavy
Canadian oil, surged to the smallest discount versus West  Texas 
Intermediate in three months as refiners returned from seasonal
maintenance, boosting demand.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  restarted a crude unit at its Memphis,
Tennessee, refinery after maintenance, Bill Day, a company
spokesman in  San Antonio , said today in an e-mail.  CVR Energy
Inc. (CVI)  completed planned work at the Coffeyville refinery in
Kansas and the plant is operating at 115,000 barrels a day,
 Steve Eames , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail March 26.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $1.45 to $18.05 a
barrel versus WTI at 2:02 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The margin is the smallest since Jan. 6.  Syncrude’s discount narrowed $1.55 a barrel to $1.25 a
barrel, the smallest discount since Feb. 15. Bakken oil’s
discount was steady at $9 below WTI.  The discounts for West Texas Sour and WTI oil priced in
Midland, Texas, also narrowed against the U.S. benchmark priced
in Cushing,  Oklahoma . The grades have both strengthened the past
few days after  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  said last week it
would begin deliveries on a pipeline system that transports
crude from West Texas to Houston.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed 50 cents to $6.50 a
barrel. WTI at Midland strengthened 25 cents to a $6.25
discount.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium narrowed 45 cents to $19.50
a barrel over WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  decreased 40 cents to a
premium of $20.60 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $17.50 a barrel
over WTI, and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  added 35 cents to a premium of $13.10.
Poseidon’s premium widened 10 cents to $11.85, while Southern
Green Canyon’s increased $1.10 to $11.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
