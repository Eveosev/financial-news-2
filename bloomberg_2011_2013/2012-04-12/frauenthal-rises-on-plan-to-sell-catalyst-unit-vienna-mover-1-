Frauenthal Holding AG (FKA) , an Austrian
car parts maker, rose the most in a month after saying it plans
to sell its catalyst unit.  Shares  climbed  6.2 percent, their biggest gain since March
8, and closed at 10 euros a share in Vienna. More than 44,600
shares traded hands, about 20 times the average volume over the
last 30 days, according to Bloomberg data.  The company, which is based in the Austrian capital, said
yesterday after markets closed that its management board decided
to start negotiations with potential strategic partners and
interested buyers for its industrial honeycombs unit, which
produces SCR catalysts for thermal power stations and diesel
motors, heat sinks and casting filters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
