A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk dropped the most this year after Federal Reserve
officials indicated that  borrowing costs  will stay low to
support the economic recovery.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
declined 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 96.8 basis points at
5:04 p.m. in  New York , according to Markit Group Ltd. That’s the
biggest decline since Dec. 20.  The gauge slid as Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  endorsed
“highly accommodative” policy in a New York speech yesterday,
saying the central bank probably won’t meet its goal of full
employment for years while inflation remains in check. New York
Fed President William C. Dudley said today in Syracuse, New
York, that he still supports holding the target lending rate
close to zero through late 2014.  The credit-default swap index is reacting to “the sudden
and dramatic shift in  risk aversion  as the market moves from
risk-on to risk-off to risk-on again,”  Adrian Miller , a fixed-
income strategist at GMP Securities LLC in New York, said by e-
mail. “Under such a seesaw environment, we see a narrowing of
transactional breadth.”  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has fallen since touching
105 basis points on April 10, the highest level since January.  Bank Swaps Drop  Credit-default swaps on U.S. banks decreased, with
contracts on  Citigroup Inc. (C)  declining 21.2 basis points to 240.9
basis points and those on  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  falling 19.6
to 260, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Contracts on  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped 20.9 to 259.8,
and those on its Merrill Lynch & Co. unit declined 24 to 280.2,
the data show.  Swaps on debt from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  fell
23 to 217, CMA data show. Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and
Credit Suisse Group AG are preparing bids for a $7.49 billion
mass of real estate debt assumed by the  Federal Reserve Bank of
New York  in 2008, according to people familiar with the
potential sale.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Credit-default swaps tied to  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  eased after it
settled a lawsuit with Aurelius Capital Management LP in which
the hedge fund claimed the 2009 split of MBIA’s bond-insurance
business hurt owners of $240 billion of debt while benefiting
stock investors. The contracts declined 3.1 percentage points to
14.4 percent upfront, and those on its unit MBIA Insurance Corp.
dropped 3 percentage points to 25.5 percent upfront, CMA data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
