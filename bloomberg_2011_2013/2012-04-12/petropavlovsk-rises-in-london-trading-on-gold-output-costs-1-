Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  climbed the most
in more than seven weeks in London trading after the operator of
Russian  gold mines  said production of the precious metal
expanded by 60 percent and costs declined.  Petropavlovsk jumped 4.6 percent to 524.5 pence by the
close in the city, the biggest advance since Feb. 21. The
companyâ€™s gold production in the first quarter was 120,800
ounces, compared with 75,400 in the same period a year earlier,
London-based Petropavlovsk said today in a statement.  The mining company said cash costs per ounce mined fell to
$587 from $633 a year earlier. Petropavlovsk reiterated its
full-year output target of 680,000 ounces.  Gold companies are seeking to boost production to benefit
from bullion prices that have risen for 11 straight years. Gold
for immediate delivery averaged $1,691 an ounce in the first
three months of 2012, compared with $1,388 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
