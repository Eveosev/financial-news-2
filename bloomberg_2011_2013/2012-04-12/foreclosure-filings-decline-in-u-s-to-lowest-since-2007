Foreclosure filings in the U.S.
fell in the first quarter to their lowest level in more than
four years after lenders under legal scrutiny slowed actions
against delinquent homeowners, according to RealtyTrac Inc.  Default, auction and repossession notices were sent to
572,928 properties, down 2 percent from the previous three
months and 16 percent from the first quarter of 2011. It was the
lowest quarterly tally since the fourth quarter of 2007, the
Irvine, California-based data firm said today in a statement.
One in every 230 U.S. households received a filing.  “The low  foreclosure numbers  in the first quarter are not
an indication that the massive reservoir of distressed
properties built up over the past few years has somehow
miraculously evaporated,” RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer
Brandon Moore said in the statement. “The dam may not burst in
the next 30 to 45 days, but it will eventually burst, and
everyone downstream should be prepared for that to happen.”  The five largest banks agreed Feb. 9 to a $25 billion
settlement after their foreclosure practices were subjected to a
16-month probe by all 50 state attorneys general. The accord
removed some barriers to property seizures and cleared the way
for lender actions to resume without releasing banks from
individual or class-action claims or criminal liability.  Estimates of the number of homes that will be lost to
foreclosure or distressed sale range from 1.6 million currently
in the pipeline -- the forecast from  Santa Ana , California-based
 CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)  -- to 8 million homes over the next five years,
according to Oliver Chang, a housing analyst with Morgan Stanley
in  New York .  Surge of Foreclosures  A surge of foreclosures was started between August and
November of 2011, and with legal delays it now takes an average
of 370 days to finish the repossession process,  Daren Blomquist ,
a RealtyTrac spokesman, wrote in an e-mail.  “We’d expect many of those foreclosure starts from last
year to become completed foreclosures around the same time
period this year,” he said.  Filings totaled 198,853 in March, down 4 percent from
February and 17 percent from a year earlier. It was the first
time since July 2007 that the number fell below 200,000.  The largest decreases occurred in states with no court
supervision of repossessions, led by  Arkansas  with a 79 percent
decline from a year earlier and Nevada with a 62 percent drop,
RealtyTrac said. Both states passed laws that “disrupted the
normal foreclosure process,” according to the data firm.
Filings fell 55 percent in  Washington , 41 percent in Arizona, 31
percent in  Texas  and 21 percent in  California .  Connecticut, Florida  States with judicial oversight of the process had increases
from the first quarter of 2011, with filings rising 45 percent
in Indiana, 38 percent in Connecticut and 26 percent in
Massachusetts,  Florida  and South Carolina, RealtyTrac said. They
were followed by Pennsylvania, with a 23 percent gain.  Judicial states had bigger decreases in filings last year
from “artificial” delays, resulting in backlogs that are
showing up in gains now, Blomquist said.  Nevada  had the nation’s highest rate of foreclosure filings
per household at one in 95 in the first quarter, followed by
California at one in 103 and Arizona at one in 106.  Georgia  was
fourth at one in 119, and Florida fifth at one in 123.  California led in filings with 133,245 properties receiving
notices, accounting for 23 percent of the U.S. total. Florida
was second at 73,344 and Illinois third at 37,660. Georgia
followed at 34,234, Michigan had 27,934 and Arizona had 26,956,
according to RealtyTrac, which sells default data from more than
2,200 counties representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
