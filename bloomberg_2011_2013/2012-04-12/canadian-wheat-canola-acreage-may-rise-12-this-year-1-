Canadian grain and oilseed growers
may boost seeding by 12 percent this year amid favorable
weather, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said today.  Total planted area may rise to 26.345 million hectares
(65.1 million acres), up from 23.524 million a year earlier, the
government agency said in an e-mailed statement. Production of
grains and oilseed may rise 7.4 percent to 70.72 million metric
tons, boosting exports 1.4 percent to 33.568 million and
increasing reserve inventories before the 2013 harvests 11
percent, the agency said.  Canadian farmers may boost wheat planting by 11 percent
this year to 9.68 million hectares from 8.737 million in 2011.
Production may rise to 26.1 million tons, from 25.261 million
harvested last year. Canada is the fourth-largest exporter,
trailing the U.S., Australia and  Russia .  Wheat futures have declined 9.5 percent in the past year on
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as world inventories are forecast
to rise to the highest since 2001 before this yearâ€™s northern
hemisphere harvest.  Canola plantings are expected to increase 8.1 percent from
last year to a record 8.25 million hectares, Agri-Food Canada
said. Prices are up 11 percent this year on the ICE Futures
Canada exchange in Winnipeg.  The area seeded with barley will rise 22 percent to 3.2
million hectares, from 2.619 million a year ago, the agency
said. Oat planting may jump 27 percent to 1.6 million hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
