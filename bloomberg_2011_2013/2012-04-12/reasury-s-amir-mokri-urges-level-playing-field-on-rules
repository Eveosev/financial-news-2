Global regulators need to work
together toward a “level playing field” of financial rules, a
U.S. Treasury official said.  The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul creates “a dynamic,
forward-looking regulatory apparatus that seeks to restore
market discipline,” Cyrus Amir-Mokri, the Treasury’s assistant
secretary for financial institutions, said at a conference in
 New York  today.  “There should be a level playing field for all firms and
regulatory coordination,” Amir-Mokri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
