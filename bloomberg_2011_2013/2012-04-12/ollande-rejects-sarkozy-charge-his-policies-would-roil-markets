French Socialist Francois Hollande
rejected Nicolas Sarkozy’s charge that his election in next
month’s presidential vote would drive borrowing costs higher and
rattle investors.  “It’s the right that’s terrified” and not markets,
Hollande said today on France 2 television. “The only cause for
worry is to continue the failed policies” of Sarkozy.  While Sarkozy tops opinion surveys for the election’s 10-
candidate first round on April 22, Hollande would win the head-
to-head runoff on May 6, the polls suggest. The challenger had a
six percentage point lead over the incumbent, 53 percent support
to 47 percent, in a Harris Interactive poll published April 10,
the same as the previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
