Kenya ’s shilling strengthened the
most this month, as the central bank removed money from the
market for the fourth straight day through  repurchase
agreements .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.2 percent, the most on a closing basis since March
28, to 83.05 per dollar and traded at 83.15 as of 3:34 p.m. in
Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya received 10.1 billion shillings
($121 million) in bids and accepted 5 billion shilling for
seven-day repurchase agreements at a weighted average rate of
15.54 percent, Godfrey Putunoi, a bank official, said by phone
today from the capital.  The bank has removed a total of 24.6 billion shillings from
the market since April 5, after the monetary policy committee
indicated it would intervene to curb volatility.  “We will continue with the current tight monetary policy
until we are sure we are out of the woods,” Finance Minister
Njeru Githae told reporters yesterday.  The committee retained the central  bank rate  at 18 percent
to ensure that inflation continues to decline toward the
government target while maintaining exchange rate stability.  The  inflation rate  declined for a fourth month to 15.61
percent in March from 16.69 percent in the previous month, the
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said last month.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to
1,580 per dollar and was trading 0.3 percent higher at 1,585 at
3:42 p.m. The Ugandan shilling weakened for a second day,
depreciating as much as 0.4 percent to 2,515 per dollar.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
