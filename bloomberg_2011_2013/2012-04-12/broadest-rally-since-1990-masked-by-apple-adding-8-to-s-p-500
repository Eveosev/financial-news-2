While  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s influence on the
three-year bull market in American equities is among the biggest
ever exerted by a  single stock , the rally would be doing just
fine without it.  The world’s most valuable company has surged  653 percent 
since March 9, 2009, accounting for 8 percent of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index’s climb to 1,368.71 from 676.53, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The impact is second only to  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO)  between 1998 and 2000, data compiled by Birinyi
Associates Inc. show. At the same time, the S&P 500 has almost
doubled since March 2009 even when Apple is excluded.  Apple’s ascent is distracting investors from the broadest
stock market advance since at least 1990, according to Mike Holland, founder of New York-based Holland & Co., which oversees
more than $4 billion. While bears argue that U.S. earnings are
too reliant on the iPhone and iPad maker, bulls such as Holland
say signs of a recovering economy are setting the stage for
income growth and share increases in companies from  Google (GOOG)  Inc.
to Exxon Mobil Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “No doubt there’s an Apple effect, but the naysayers are
exaggerating it,” Holland, who oversees more than $4 billion,
said in an April 3 phone interview. “Companies have done
extremely well, and yet the valuations have gone down because of
all of the headlines.”  Approaching Records  Of the 479 stocks that have been in the S&P 500 since March
2009, 458 have risen. A  version of the benchmark gauge  that
eliminates rankings by market value is posting its biggest
annualized return in a bull market in at least 22 years, while
the  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  and S&P MidCap 400 Index are approaching
records. Gains have put the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
doesn’t include Apple, 11 percent away from its October 2007
 all-time high , while the  S&P 500  needs to climb 14 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple has done more than any other stock to push the S&P
500 up since the bull market began,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Cupertino, California-based Apple became the world’s most
valuable company last quarter, topping Exxon Mobil with a market
capitalization that has since approached $600 billion. Apple
added more than three times as much as International Business
Machines Corp. and General Electric Co., the next-biggest
contributors.  Second to Cisco  The influence of Apple is second to Cisco’s in the history
of bull markets since 1982, according to data compiled by
Birinyi. The world’s biggest maker of computer-networking
equipment accounted for  9.4 percent  of the 60 percent gain in
the S&P 500 between August 1998 and March 2000, the data show.
 Intel Corp . and Microsoft Corp. each accounted for almost 7
percent during that cycle, the data show.  Apple advanced  48 percent last quarter , the 11th-largest
increase among the  500 constituents  of the benchmark gauge for
U.S. equities. While the 12 percent rise in the index shrinks to
a  10.4 percent advance without Apple , that still would have been
the best start to a year since 1998, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “The rally has been much more than Apple,” said Howard Ward, a money manager at Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye,  New York ,
who helps oversee $36 billion. “Apple no doubt has added some
sparkle to the technology sector, but all market sectors have
risen.” The rally since October “coincided with six months of
better-than-expected economic data,” he said.  Weekly Decline  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 1,398.08  last week 
after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may refrain from more
stimulus and a Spanish bond auction exacerbated worries about
the European debt crisis. Stocks lost 2.8 percent in the two
trading sessions after an April 6 report showing the U.S. added
120,000 jobs in March, missing the 205,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  After a 0.7 percent advance yesterday, the S&P 500 was up
8.8 percent in 2012. The index gained 1 percent to 1,382 at
10:49 a.m. New York time today.  The index is still up 25 percent since Oct. 3 as the
 unemployment rate  fell to 8.2 percent and reports on
manufacturing and housing helped boost investor speculation that
the economy will avoid a recession. The  Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index (CESIUSD) , which shows whether U.S. data beat or fell short
of forecasts, climbed from October through the end of 2011,
peaking at 91.9 on Jan. 6, while fourth-quarter earnings for the
S&P 500 exceeded estimates for a 12th straight period.  Income Doubled  Apple’s contribution to the rally is even greater than it
appears because it earned so much more than analysts were
predicting, according to Douglas Kass, the  money manager  who
recommended buying stocks when the market bottomed in March
2009. The company beat revenue forecasts by $7.3 billion, the
most ever, when it reported quarterly results on Jan. 24. Net
income more than doubled to $13.1 billion as Apple sold 37
million iPhones and posted $46.3 billion in sales. The total
ranks among the highest quarterly profits on record.  “I’ve called this the NBA rally; it’s Nothing But Apple,”
Kass, the  Palm Beach , Florida-based founder of Seabreeze
Partners Management Inc., said in an April 5 phone interview.
“Without Apple, earnings performance would be tepid and the
stock market performance, though still pretty good, would have
been reduced,” he said. “Its dominance is extremely unusual.”  S&P 500 earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 climbed
10 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Without Apple the
rate was 6.7 percent. Profits have risen for the past three
years, and analysts project they’ll increase 8.3 percent in 2012
and 13 percent in 2013, Bloomberg data show. The price-earnings
ratio for the S&P 500 fell 8.9 percent last year, and even after
the multiple rose to 14.2 yesterday, it’s still 14 percent below
its average since 1954, data show.  Exxon, Google  Exxon Mobil, based in Irving,  Texas , trades at 9.8 times
reported earnings, compared with 12.1 a year earlier, and New
York-based JPMorgan has a price-earnings ratio of 9.5, or 33
percent below the S&P 500. While Google’s multiple is 21, that’s
still 7.9 percent below the average since the bull market
started in March 2009.  Alcoa Inc. this week was the first  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  company to report  first-quarter results . The largest
U.S. aluminum producer reported an unexpected profit, sending
the shares up 6.2 percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 3.  Jonathan Golub , the UBS AG strategist who argued in
February that record Apple profits obfuscated “that the
underlying earnings trend is really weak,” now says worse-than-
expected energy-company earnings made income seem lower than it
really was. While Apple was “masking the slowness,” the second
half of  earnings season  made up for the weaker performance of
energy companies, he said. Golub projects profit will rise
without a repeat of Apple’s first quarter, boosting the S&P 500.  ‘Absolutely Not’  “It’s absolutely not a couple of individual names driving
the rally,” Golub, the New York-based chief market strategist
at UBS, said in an April 3 phone interview. “That should really
be comforting to individual investors and investors in general
because it means if you have a portfolio, by and large most
companies are doing well, and so are you.”  Indicators used by price and volume chart analysts show the
breadth of the rally.  More than 57 percent  of companies listed
on the New York Stock Exchange are trading above their 200-day
average levels. That compares with 6.8 percent on Oct. 3, when
the S&P 500 sank to its low for 2011.  Annualized Return  The rally has also been widespread based on the  S&P 500
Equal-Weighted Index (SPW) ’s annualized return. The index, which gives
each company the same contribution regardless of size, returned
34 percent on an annualized basis since March 2009, 5.8
percentage points more than the S&P 500. That’s the best return
and best relative performance for a bull market since 1990, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple is “obviously a really big stock, no kidding,”
Brian Barish, who helps oversee about $7 billion as Denver-based
president of Cambiar Investors LLC, said in an April 4 phone
interview. “But we’re seeing pretty good profit growth in most
of the companies that we look at. The bull market would be
happening regardless.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
