(Corrects previous record close in second paragraph.)  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR)  jumped to its highest
in more than a year after the owner of the Redbox movie-rental
kiosks said first-quarter sales and profit exceeded its February
forecast, driven by higher prices.  The shares  soared 7.3 percent to $65.78 at the close in  New
York , just short of the record closing high of $66.98 on Nov.
24, 2010. The stock has risen 44 percent this year.  Profit from continuing operations was $1.62 to $1.66 a
share, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said yesterday in
a statement. Sales advanced to $567 million to $569.2 million.
Analysts predicted first-quarter profit of 89 cents a share on
sales of $538.6 million, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Final results will be released on April 26.  The increase underscores investor confidence that Coinstar
has adapted to new terms with movie studios, including a delayed
release schedule imposed by some. Coinstar said it benefited
last quarter from lower-than-expected card-processing fees and
the popularity of titles including “Moneyball,” “Puss and
Boots” and “50/50.”  “We continue to see upside potential from the price
increase and lower credit card fees than planned,” Ronald Bookbinder, an analyst at Benchmark who recommends buying the
shares, said in a note to investors.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal Pictures and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox
have negotiated agreements with Coinstar to delay rentals until
28 days after DVDs are first released for sale. The company
initially had trouble adjusting to the new schedule. In February
2011, Coinstar lowered its first-quarter forecasts for sales and
profit, saying the delays caused executives to misjudge demand.  Two months ago, the company had forecast first-quarter
sales of $530 million to $555 million, and profit excluding some
items of 76 cents to 91 cents a share in its core businesses.
The company reported revenue of $424.1 million in the first
quarter of 2011.  For the year, profit from continuing operations will be
$4.40 to $4.80 a share on revenue of $2.16 billion to $2.28
billion, Coinstar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
