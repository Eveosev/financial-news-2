Ghana  has backed out of a housing
deal with STX Corp. of  South Korea , and will try to recover
investments made in the company and retrieve assets provided for
houses to be built in the West African nation, the Daily Graphic
reported.  Ghana’s attorney-general is studying the deal to ascertain
damages that the government can claim from the abandoned deal,
the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Enoch Teye Mensah,
minister of water resources, works and housing.  The residential project announced in 2009 was expected to
provide 30,000 homes for security personnel at a cost of $1.5
billion for its first phase, the newspaper reported. Calls made
to the office of STX’s Ghana unit didn’t connect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
