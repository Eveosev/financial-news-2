OAO Raspadskaya, a Russian coking
coal producer, increased its coal reserves by 26 percent last
year, Interfax reported, citing the companyâ€™s memorandum for a
planned eurobond sale.  The coal producer had 1.314 billion tons of reserves at the
end of 2011, up from 1.046 billion tons a year earlier, the news
service said.  The company cut its 2015 production target to 16.7 million
tons, from an 18.5 million-ton forecast published last year,
Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
