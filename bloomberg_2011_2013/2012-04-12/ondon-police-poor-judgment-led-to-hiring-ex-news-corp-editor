London ’s Metropolitan Police top
commanders showed poor judgment in hiring a former senior
executive at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of the World when the tabloid was
embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal, a police watchdog said.  The finding today by the Independent Police Complaints
Commission follows two investigations of the police hiring of
Neil Wallis’s company for media relations work in 2009 and the
hiring of his daughter, the regulator said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
