A fake grenade mounted on a plaque
that said “Complaint Department: Pull Pin” forced evacuations
of workers at  Bank of America Corp.’s  Merrill Lynch and  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  in New York today, police said.  The New York City Police Department was called to 2 World
Financial Center at about 11 a.m. local time after building
security reporting finding a suspicious package containing what
appeared to be an explosive device, a police spokeswoman said.  The NYPD’s bomb squad gave an “all clear” after
determining that the package was a “grenade-like novelty
item,” Paul Browne, an NYPD spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The 44-story  building , owned by Brookfield Office
Properties Inc., sits across from Ground Zero and was damaged
during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
It is home to the offices of Merrill Lynch and Nomura, as well
as  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and  Deloitte & Touche .  Nomura evacuated its U.S. headquarters in the building
because of the police investigation and “returned to business
as usual” after police gave the all-clear, Jonathan Hodgkinson,
a spokesman for Nomura, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
