Gulf Cooperation Council countries
need to develop a missile defense shield as threats to the
region are “more complex than ever,” the  United Arab Emirates ’
state-run news service WAM  reported , citing an official.  “We are asking our allies to help us individually and
collectively,” GCC Secretary General Abdul Latif Bin Rashid Al Zayani was cited by the agency as saying. “The shield, as a
solution, should be flexible and comprehensive. It should be a
workable solution and not theoretical.”  Threats include biological and nuclear terrorism,
cybercrime and financial crime, as well as ballistic missile
threats and missile defense systems, the official said.
Cooperation between the six-nation GCC, which includes  Saudi
Arabia , the U.A.E., Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait, is key and
sends a “strong message to our allies and enemies,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
