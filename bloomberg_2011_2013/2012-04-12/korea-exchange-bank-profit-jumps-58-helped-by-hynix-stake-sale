Korea  Exchange Bank, the lender
acquired by  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  in February, said first-
quarter profit rose 58 percent, boosted by gains from the sale
of its stake in SK  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)   Net income  climbed to 313.9 billion won ($275 million) from
198.6 billion won a year earlier, Seoul-based KEB said in a
regulatory filing today. That compares with the 268 billion-won
average estimate of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Korea Exchange Bank became a  Hana Financial  unit after the
parent completed 4.4 trillion won in payments to Dallas-based
Lone Star Funds and Export Import Bank of Korea. Hana Financial
plans to publish first-quarter results tomorrow, reflecting its
58 percent ownership in KEB.  The  net interest margin , a measure of profitability from
lending, narrowed to 2.47 percent from 2.63 percent a year
earlier, KEB said in a separate statement on its website.
Provisions against bad debt fell 28 percent to 106.9 billion
won, the statement said.  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  recorded a 133.1 billion won after-tax
gain from selling 10 million shares in Hynix, it said in the
statement. As part of a shareholder group the bank led a 3.4
trillion-won sale of Hynix to SK Telecom Co. last year,
completing the transaction in February.  Korea Exchange Bank  shares  rose 2.6 percent to 8,670 won
before the earnings release. The stock has advanced 18 percent
this year, compared with the benchmark Kospi indexâ€™s 8.8 percent
rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
