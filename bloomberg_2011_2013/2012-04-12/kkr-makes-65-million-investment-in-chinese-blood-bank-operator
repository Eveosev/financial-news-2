  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by  Henry Kravis  and George Roberts, agreed to buy $65
million of convertible notes issued by  China Cord Blood (CO)  Corp.,
according to a regulatory filing.  The notes, which yield 7 percent, can be converted into
shares at $2.838, the document showed. China Cord Blood rose 5.6
percent to $2.85 in New York trading yesterday.  China Cord Blood, listed on the New York Stock Exchange
since 2009, collects umbilical cord blood from newborns. The
company has exclusive licenses to service Beijing city and the
Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, covering 180 million people
and 1.9 million births a year, according to a statement from KKR
and China Cord Blood yesterday.  China  spent twice as much on health care last year as in
2008 and health insurance coverage more than tripled to 96
percent of citizens last year compared with 2003. China Cord
Blood’s  profit almost doubled  to $14 million in the latest
fiscal year as sales jumped, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s shares have lost 15 percent in the past
year.  Citigroup Inc. advised New York-based KKR on the
transaction, according to the statement.  China Cord Blood marks KKR’s first investment in a Chinese
health care company. The private-equity fund owns stakes in
Chinese companies in industries ranging from financial leasing
to farming and cement. The New York-based fund in September
formed a real estate venture with  Sino-Ocean Land Holdings Ltd. (3377) 
with each firm committing $70 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
