New York  gasoline strengthened as
European prices rose for the fuel and after imports to the U.S.
East Coast declined.  Eurobob gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $1,158 to $1,174 a metric ton, according to a survey
of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board.
Thatâ€™s up from $1,148 to $1,160 yesterday. Gasoline  imports to
the East Coast  fell 33 percent to 506,000 barrels a day last
week, according to the Energy Department.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor narrowed 1 cent to 1.25
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 11:48 a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery rose 5.52 cents to $3.3282 a gallon.  Gasoline inventories on the East Coast fell 1.9 million
barrels to 56.9 million barrels, the government reported
yesterday.  The discount for regular gasoline in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)
