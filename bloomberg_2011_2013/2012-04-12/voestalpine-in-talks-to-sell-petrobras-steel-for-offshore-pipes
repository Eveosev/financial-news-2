Voestalpine AG (VOE) , Austria’s biggest
steelmaker, is in talks to supply  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  with
tube plate for deepwater pipes in the Atlantic basin off Brazil.  “Technically this isn’t possible today,” Voestalpine
Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Eder told reporters in Vienna
today. “One still needs a lot of preparation. We are in
negotiations and in two years our development will be advanced
enough to go down to 4,000 meters (13,000 feet).” The talks are
exclusive, he said, declining to provide further details.  Voestalpine, based in Linz, said in its  corporate blog  on
April 2 that its heavy-plate unit won the biggest order in its
history for the Rota Cabiunas project off  Brazil . “132,000 tons
of sour-gas resistant plate will be supplied,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
