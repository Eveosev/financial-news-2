Treasuries fell before the U.S.
sells $13 billion of 30-year securities in the final of three
note and bond auctions this week totaling $66 billion.  U.S. debt  rallied earlier as a report showed initial
jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week, reigniting concern
the economic recovery is slowing. The  Federal Reserve  bought
$4.5 billion in Treasuries as part of its plan to bolster the
economy. Producer prices were unchanged in March, the Labor
Department reported.  “Yield levels are a little too rich at this point and the
market may have a hard time digesting supply,”
said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at
Jefferies Group Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed.  The benchmark 10-year note yield rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 12:33 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due February 2022 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 15/32. The yield fell as much as three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, earlier.  Thirty-year bond yields rose three basis points to 3.22
percent.  Value Measure  Valuation measures show government debt has dropped from
the most expensive levels in almost five weeks. The term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed, reached
negative 0.58 percent today after touching negative 0.65 percent
on April 10.  It reached negative 0.26 percent on March 19, the least
expensive since October. A negative reading indicates investors
are willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.23 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 3.383 percent at the previous
auction in March. Investors  bid  for 2.7 times the amount of debt
offered last month, versus the average of 2.65 percent for the
past 10 auctions.  The U.S. sold $21 billion in 10-year notes yesterday. The
auction drew a yield of 2.043 percent, compared with a forecast
of 2.040 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the Fed’s
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.08, compared with an average of 3.13 for the past 10 sales.  The government announced plans to sell $16 billion of five-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on April 19. The
U.S. sold $12 billion of the securities at the previous sale
Dec. 15.  Price Swings  Volatility rose yesterday from the lowest in a month. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury
price swings based on options, rose to 76.3 basis points. It
dropped to 75 basis points on April 10, the lowest since March
13. It reached 93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest level
this year.  Wholesale prices in the U.S. excluding food and fuel rose
more than forecast in March. The so-called core producer price
index climbed 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent rise the previous
month, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists projected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The overall gauge was
little changed after a 0.4 percent rise.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt known as the
breakeven rate, was 2.31 percentage points. The average for the
past decade is 2.14 percentage points.  Inflation Outlook  A  measure  of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed
uses to help guide monetary policy was at 2.55 percent, below
its 2.76 percent average during the past decade. It touched 2.78
percent on March 19, the highest in 2012.  It reached 3.23 percent in August, the highest since
December 2010. The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate
projects annual price increases over a five-year period
beginning in 2017.  Jobless claims climbed to 380,000, the most since Jan. 28,
the Labor Department reported. The median forecast of 46
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop in jobless
claims to 355,000 in the week ending April 7.  U.S. employers added 120,000 jobs in March, lower than the
205,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before the
Labor Department report on April 6.  “Combined with the weaker nonfarm payrolls, this uptick in
initial jobless claims will cause people to reassess their
assumptions that the labor market will continue to improve,”
said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The Fed bought Treasuries due from May 2020 to November
2021, according to the New York Fed’s website. The central bank
is replacing $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings
with longer maturities to hold down borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
