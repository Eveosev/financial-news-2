The amount of 0.1 percent sulfur
gasoil to be delivered through the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in April decreased to 71,800 metric tons, according to data on
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s website.  That compares with 100,100 tons in March and 153,500 tons
in April last year. The contract expired today at midday London
time at $997.50 a ton.  The number of deliveries for low-sulfur gasoil rose to
30,000 tons, compared with 14,800 tons in March. That’s the
fourth expiry of the new contract and the largest delivery since
it started trading last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
