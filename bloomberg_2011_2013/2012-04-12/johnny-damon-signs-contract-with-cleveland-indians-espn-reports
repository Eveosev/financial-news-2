Johnny Damon  signed with the
 Cleveland Indians ,  ESPN reported , bringing the 38-year-old free-
agent outfielder to his fourth Major League Baseball team in as
many years.  Damon, who won World Series titles with the New York
Yankees and Boston Red Sox, confirmed to ESPN that he’s finished
a deal with the Indians, though terms weren’t disclosed. Indians
spokesman Bart Swain didn’t immediately return messages seeking
comment on the report.  Damon, a career .286 batter who is 277 hits shy of 3,000,
joins a team that entered today with a major-league-worst .176
batting average.  Damon spent last season with the Tampa Bay Rays, hitting
.261 with 16 home runs, 73 runs batted in, 79 runs scored and 19
stolen bases. He’s spent his entire 17-year career in the
 American League , also playing with the Yankees, Red Sox, Detroit
Tigers, Oakland Athletics and Kansas City Royals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
