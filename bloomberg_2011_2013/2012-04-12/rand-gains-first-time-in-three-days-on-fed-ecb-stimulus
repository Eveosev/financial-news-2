The rand weakened, poised for a
second weekly drop, as metals including copper fell after
 China ’s gross domestic product grew less than forecast, raising
concern about demand from the largest metals user.  South Africa’s currency retreated 0.6 percent to 7.9174 per
dollar as of 10:51 a.m. in Johannesburg. The currency has lost
0.4 percent this week. The yield on the nation’s 6.75 percent
bonds due 2021 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 7.95 percent.  China’s economy  expanded 8.1 percent in the first three
months from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today. This was the slowest pace in 11 quarters, and
compared with a median estimate of 8.4 percent in a Bloomberg
News survey. China is the biggest buyer of South African raw
materials, according to government data for 2011.  “The hangover from this morning’s data is likely to weigh

further weakness,” Nomvuyo Guma, a currency strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed
comments.  Three-month copper dropped as much as 2 percent on the
London Metal Exchange. The contract has lost 3.1 percent this

65 percent of  South Africa ’s exports, according to government

three days as raw materials producers including BHP Billiton
Ltd. and Sasol Ltd. declined.  The rand’s one-month implied volatility against the dollar
rose 10 basis points to 15.1 percent, the highest since March
23. Implied volatility has climbed 75 basis points this week,
indicating options traders are expecting wider currency swings
in coming weeks.  The yield on South Africa’s $1.5 billion of 4.665 bonds due

percent, the lowest since March 14, according to data compiled
