Saracens coachAndy Farrell will
remain at the Premiership rugby club, rejecting the opportunity
to join  England ’s coaching setup on a permanent basis.  Farrell will continue at Saracens “for the foreseeable
future, and will not be accepting any other position in rugby
union,” his club said in a  statement  on its website today.  He was part of England’s interim coaching setup during the
Six Nations, assisting Stuart Lancaster who has since been named
as permanent coach.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
