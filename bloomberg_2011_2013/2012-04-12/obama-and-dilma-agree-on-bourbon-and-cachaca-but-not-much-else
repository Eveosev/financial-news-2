For Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff , this week's  two-day American visit  was a big one. She had already been to  China ,  India  and  Germany , and had even hosted President  Barack Obama  in Brazil last year. But in world-diplomatic terms, nothing rates quite as high as the White House. Rousseff was also following in the footsteps of her popular predecessor,  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , a president with natural charisma who made his presence felt on the world stage, and who was memorably  described  by Obama as "my man." Consequently, the Brazilian media were following her every move, and while it was observed that Dilma, as she's known, didn't get the full state dinner recently awarded to U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron , many noted approvingly that the 90-minute meeting the presidents conducted was double the allotted time. They made some notable progress. Rousseff discreetly supported Obama's re-election in hoping for a better economic situation under his leadership "in the next years." Obama called the Brazilian leader "my good friend" and  praised  her "incredible" leadership. They discussed easing visa requirements, gave much emphasis to a science program that could send thousands of Brazilian students to the U.S., and made plans to expand energy cooperation. But the Brazilian press quickly focused on the things that were not said. Veteran journalist Ricardo Setti, in a  post for the weekly news magazine Veja , noted that, for one thing, the two never mentioned some long-simmering arms-sales disputes. Nor was  Brazil 's long-standing ambition of a permanent seat on the  United Nations Security Council  even touched on, Setti wrote. "Brazilian diplomacy, on this crucial point, did not advance one millimeter." Throughout the coverage of the visit, there was a sense that the only reason the U.S. is paying attention to Brazil these days is because there's more money here. Brazil offers relatively stable growth, substantial oil reserves and a vast potential market for American goods in its booming lower-middle class -- but the economic relationship remains unequal. Dilma, for instance, once again  attacked U.S. monetary policy , which she blames for flooding the Brazilian economy with dollars. The influential economics journalist Miriam Leitao,  writing in O Globo , noted the large trade imbalance between the two countries. Brazil's 2011 trade deficit with the U.S. reached a record $8.2 billion. Much of this is because Brazil is increasingly importing American ethanol, gasoline and diesel because of a shortage of domestic refining capacity and falling ethanol production. Even though the U.S. ended a tariff on ethanol in December, Brazil still lacks the capacity to meet its internal demand, never mind export. Luiz Augusto Neves, president of the Brazilian Center for International Relations,  told O Globo : "The relations between Brazil and the U.S. are far below what they could be. It is a relationship without enthusiasm." Obama was big on generalized praise of Brazil, but ended up giving away very little in practical terms -- compounding the sense of an unequal relationship. As business daily Valor  noted in an editorial , Dilma didn't look particularly content in the  official photo : In the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, journalist Clovis Rossi  pointed out  a related "great omission" of the meeting: the uprising in  Syria . He quoted from a joint statement the leaders released, then gave his take: This silence on Syria seemed to typify the current relationship. The U.S. wants access to the Brazilian market. It wants Brazil's oil when it starts flowing properly. It just doesn't think Brazil is grown-up enough to start playing international politics with the big boys. Perhaps that attitude was best encapsulated in a little commercial present Obama offered Brazil: After about 40 years of discussions, the U.S.  officially recognized  the sugar-cane spirit cachaca -- used to make caipirinha cocktails -- as a genuine Brazilian product, which means it can be sold in American liquor stores as "cachaca" and not just "Brazilian rum." Brazil, in turn, pledged to recognize American bourbon and Tennessee whiskey. Distillers cheered. But booze can only do so much to improve a "relationship without enthusiasm."
