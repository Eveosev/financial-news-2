Ethanol futures climbed a second
day in  Chicago  after an Energy Department report showed
inventories fell the most in almost four months.  Prices rose 0.2 percent a day after the government said
ethanol  stockpiles  fell to 21.8 million barrels, the lowest
amount since Feb. 17, and  production of conventional gasoline
blended with the biofuel  increased 0.9 percent to 5.26 million
barrels a day, the most since Dec. 16.  “You had a pretty healthy draw yesterday,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “That really perked
up interest. That’s the best report the EIA gave on ethanol in a
long time.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 0.5 cent to settle
at $2.241 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 1.7 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast added 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.36 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive advanced 1 cent to $2.275, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago jumped 1 cent to $2.215 a gallon and in
 New York  the biofuel climbed 1 cent to $2.29.  The additive is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
