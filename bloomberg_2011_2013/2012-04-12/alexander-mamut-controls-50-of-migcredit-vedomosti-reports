Russian billionaire  Alexander Mamut 
controls 50 percent of Migcredit, which provides so-called
micro-financing,  Vedomosti  reported, citing two people it didn’t
identify.  Migcredit, which started to operate last year, lends small
amounts to people on low incomes who can’t afford bank loans;
the maximum effective interest rate on money borrowed from
Migcredit may reach 360 percent, the newspaper said.  Russia’s micro-financing market totaled 36 billion rubles
($1.2 billion) in 2011, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
