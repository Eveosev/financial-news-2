Belarus values the Minsk Automobile
Plant, known as MAZ, at $1.1 billion, Belta reported,  citing 
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko.  Belarus expects soon to form a joint holding company
between MAZ and  OAO KamAZ (KMAZ) , the Russian truckmaker partly owned
by  Daimler AG (DAI) , with each of the companies transferring 49
percent of its shares to the combined entity, Semashko was
quoted as saying by Belta. Belarus is seeking a 46 percent stake
in the joint venture, handing control to  Russia  with 54 percent,
Semashko said, according to Belta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
