Tourist arrivals in  South Africa 
rose to a record last year as the country built on its success
of hosting the 2010 soccer World Cup and attracted more visitors
from Asia, Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk said.  The number of international visitors increased 3 percent to
8.34 million in 2011, after rising 15 percent the year before,
Van Schalkwyk told reporters in Cape Town today. Arrivals from
 China  surged 24 percent to 84,883 and from India by 26 percent
to 90,367.  “The 2010 FIFA World Cup was a once-in-a-lifetime global
showcase for our country, which gave us unprecedented
international media exposure,” the minister said. The
tournament also “left us with modern world-class tourist
infrastructure.”  South  Africa  aims to attract 15 million foreign visitors
annually and for the tourism industry’s contribution to Africa’s
largest economy to more than double to 499 billion rand ($63
billion) by 2020. Even so, “the economic climate remains
difficult and competition for tourist arrivals remains fierce,”
Van Schalkwyk said.  The number of visitors from the U.K., South Africa’s
largest tourist market, slumped 7.2 percent to almost 420,500
last year, the minister said. He cited a slowing U.K. economy
and increased air passenger duty taxes for deterring travel.  Tourist arrivals from  Germany  rose 9.3 percent to almost
236,000 last year, while those from the U.S. increased 1.9
percent to 287,614, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
