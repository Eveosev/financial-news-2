Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and Mexico, gained the most in
three months in Lima trading as investors bet first-quarter
earnings will exceed estimates and metal prices rebounded.  Southern Copper, a unit of Grupo Mexico SAB, jumped 5.5
percent to $31.65 at the close, the biggest one-day gain since
Jan. 3. The stock has dropped 16 percent over the past year.  “The market is staking out positions ahead of next week’s
earnings release,” Javier Frisancho, a trader at Lima-based
brokerage Kallpa Securities SAB, said by phone. “The recovery
in copper prices also helped.”  Copper rose the most in more than a week on speculation
that slower economic growth will prompt policy makers to add
more stimulus measures in  China , the world’s biggest metals
consumer. Copper futures for May delivery climbed 2.2 percent to
settle at $3.7205 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
