The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a  yield  of 3.233 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in February 2042, yielded
3.225 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New
York time. The yield at last month’s long-bond auction was 3.383
percent. The record low was 2.925 percent at December’s sale.  The March 14 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.7, versus a 2.65 average at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 29 percent of the bonds at the
March sale, compared with 29.2 percent at the February auction.
The average for the past 10 offerings is 30.8 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.7 percent at
last month’s sale, matching their takedown of the February
offering. The average at the past 10 auctions is 17.1 percent.  U.S. 30-year bonds have lost 4.65 percent this year,
compared with a 0.33 percent decline in the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long
bonds returned 36 percent in 2011, more than triple the 9.8
percent gain by Treasuries overall.  Today’s auction is the last of three Treasury note and bond
offerings this week totaling $66 billion. The government sold
$32 billion in three-year notes on April 10 and $21 billion in
10-year notes yesterday.  This week’s sales will raise $23.1 billion of new cash as
maturing securities held by the public total $42.9 billion.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
