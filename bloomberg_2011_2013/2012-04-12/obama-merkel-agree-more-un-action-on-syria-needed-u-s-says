President  Barack Obama  and German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  agreed that more “resolute action” on
Syria is needed by the United Nations Security Council to end
the government’s brutal crackdown, the White House said in a
statement.  The two leaders discussed the situation in Syria and the
negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program during a
telephone conversation today, according to the statement.  Obama and Merkel both are concerned that Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad isn’t complying with the terms of a cease-fire
negotiated by special envoy Kofi Annan, the White House said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
