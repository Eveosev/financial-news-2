The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.3 percent to 685.41 at 6:16 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.5 percent to 1,587.742.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped for the first time in three days, erasing a
weekly gain, after  China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace in
11 quarters and  Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister said the kingdom is
determined to see lower prices.  Crude for May delivery fell as much as 78 cents to $102.86
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange and was at $103.16 at 5:50 a.m. Singapore time. The
contract gained 0.9 percent yesterday to $103.64, the highest
close since April 3. Prices are down 0.1 percent for the week.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas  futures slipped to a 10-year low in New York
after a government report showed that stockpiles rose less than
average last week.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell $1.36, or
8.6 percent, to $14.45 a barrel at 10:14 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
spread is the narrowest since Jan. 10, 2011 and has declined 7.2
percent so far this week on concern that global demand is
slowing.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose to 30 cents from 25 cents
at the end of last week. A wider spread indicates that prices of
diesel have weakened more than  aviation fuel .  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,672.85 an ounce by 4:22 a.m. in Singapore. Prices are up 7
percent in 2012 after advancing for 11 consecutive years. June-
delivery futures dropped 0.4 percent to $1,674.20 on the Comex.  BASE METALS  Copper for three-month delivery retreated 1.5 percent to
$8,095 a metric ton on the LME. Prices are down 3.2
percent this week. The May-delivery contract fell 1.4 percent to
$3.668 a pound on the Comex in New York.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa for July delivery advanced 2.5 percent to 1,453
pounds ($2,315) a metric ton by 10:55 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. The price touched 1,458 pounds a ton, the highest since
April 3. Cocoa for July delivery climbed 2.4 percent to $2,195 a
ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery slid 0.3
percent to $622 a ton in  London . Raw sugar for July delivery was
