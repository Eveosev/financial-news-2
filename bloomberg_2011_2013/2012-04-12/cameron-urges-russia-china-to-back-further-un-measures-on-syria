U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
urged Russia and  China  to back further United Nations measures
to “tighten the noose” around President Bashar al-Assad’s
regime in Syria.  Assad is deliberately flouting the peace plan drafted by
Kofi Annan, the UN special envoy to Syria, Cameron told BBC
Radio 5 as he travelled to Malaysia on the third day of a visit
to Asia. Cameron said he feels
an immense sense of frustration because the world came together
behind the Annan plan, including countries such as China and
Russia.  “Now is the time to say to the Russians and the Chinese,
look at the man we are dealing with, look at the appalling way
he is behaving,” Cameron said. “We need to go back to the UN
and tighten the pressure, tighten the noose.”  Syria  is facing the prospect of stronger action by the
 Security Council  after it failed to comply with an April 10 UN
cease-fire deadline. Russia has wielded its veto power on the
Council, the UN’s decision-making body, to protect Syria from
efforts by Western nations and their Arab allies to consider
sanctions against Assad’s regime and call on him to step aside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
