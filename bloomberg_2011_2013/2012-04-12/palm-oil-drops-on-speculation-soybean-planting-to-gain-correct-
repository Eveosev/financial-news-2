Palm oil  declined the most in more
than two months on speculation that U.S. farmers may increase
soybean planting, potentially boosting supplies of the crop that
can be crushed to make a substitute oil.  The June-delivery contract fell 1.5 percent to close at
3,559 ringgit ($1,161) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest drop for the most-active contract since
Jan. 30. Futures closed at 3,613 ringgit on April 10, the
highest since March 7, 2011. Markets in Malaysia were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  The soybean  premium  to corn in the harvest season has
gained 18 percent since Jan. 31, bolstering profit prospects for
the oilseed, which is cheaper to produce, Brian Basting, an
analyst at Advance Trading Inc., said yesterday. Soybeans
rallied 16 percent between January and March, the biggest
quarterly price rally in more than a year.  “There’s talk that more acreage may be switched to
soybeans from corn, because the soybean price is more
attractive,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, trading head at Kuala-
Lumpur based LT International Futures (M) Sdn. Palm was due for
a “sharp correction” after the gains, he said.  Soybean stockpiles in the U.S. will total 250 million
bushels (6.8 million tons) on Aug. 31, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said April 10, cutting its forecast from 275 million
bushels in March. Analysts had predicted inventories would fall
to 242 million bushels, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The USDA data were “within expectations -- no surprise
bullishness -- so some profit-taking came in and pushed the
market lower,” Chandran said, referring to soybeans, which
dropped 0.4 percent yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$13.6775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for
May was little changed at 56.52 cents per pound.  Palm oil for September gained 0.3 percent to close at 8,932
yuan ($1,416) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month advanced 0.3 percent to 9,950
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
