Cytec Industries Inc. (CYT) , the second-
biggest producer of carbon-fiber composites for airplanes, said
greenhouse-gas limits and rising fuel-efficiency standards will
drive “outlandish” sales growth to automakers seeking lighter
materials.  Sales to vehicle makers in 5 to 10 years may surpass
aerospace, which currently accounts for 90 percent of advanced
composite sales, Chief Executive Officer Shane Fleming said
today in a telephone interview. Cytec, based in Woodland Park,
New Jersey, gains “critical mass” in the auto market with its
purchase of U.K. competitor Umeco Plc announced today, he said.  Carbon fiber, used in golf clubs and  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787
Dreamliner, will be used in more cars as producers such as
 Daimler AG (DAI)  adopt lighter materials to meet European Union limits
on carbon dioxide, Fleming said. Ford Motor Co. said today it is
working with Dow Chemical Co. to develop carbon fiber parts that
can boost  energy efficiency .  “This is going to be a significant market,” Fleming said.
“The percentage growth numbers look outlandish because you are
starting off a small base.”  Cytec is buying Warwickshire, England-based Umeco for 550
pence ($8.78) per share, a 46 percent premium to Umeco’s closing
price yesterday. The company also announced first-quarter
earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Hexcel Corp. is the world’s biggest producer of carbon-
fiber composites for aerospace, Fleming said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
