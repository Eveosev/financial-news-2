Egypt ’s Energy Petroleum
Construction and  Iraq ’s Atlalat al-Furat won contracts valued at
$95 million to build 1,500 homes south of the Iraqi capital
Baghdad, said Alaa Ibraheem, the president of the provincial
investment commission.  Energy Petroleum will build 684 homes within three years
for $44 million near the city of Hilla in Babel province,
Ibraheem said in a telephone interview today. Atlalat al-Furat
will build another 816 homes south of Hilla, he said. Babel
province needs more than 100,000 housing units, Ibraheem said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest crude-oil
reserves, is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an
economy and infrastructure damaged by years of conflict,
sanctions and lack of investment. In March 2010, the government
approved a plan to build 1 million homes by 2014 for low- and
mid-income families to reduce the country’s housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
