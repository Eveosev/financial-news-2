Nerlens Noel, ranked as the top
high school basketball player in the country by ESPN.com and
Scout.com, has committed to play for the national champion
 University of Kentucky .  Noel, a 6-foot-10 player from Everett, Massachusetts, had
narrowed his choices to Kentucky, Syracuse or Georgetown. He
announced his decision last night on ESPNU.  Kentucky won the National Collegiate Athletic Association
men’s championship on April 2 with a starting lineup that
included freshmen Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, both
of whom have declared for the National Basketball Association
draft and won’t be returning to the Wildcats.  The player rated by ESPN as the No. 2 recruit in the nation,
Shabazz Muhammad of Las Vegas, committed to attend the
University of California,  Los Angeles . The 6-foot-6 guard also
had been considering Kentucky and Duke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
