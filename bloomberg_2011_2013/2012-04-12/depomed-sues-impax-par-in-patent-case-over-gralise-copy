Depomed Inc. sued the generic-drug
makers  Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL)  and  Par Pharmaceutical Co. (PRX)  to
prevent them from selling copies of Gralise, a medicine that
treats pain after shingles infections.  Impax and Par are seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell generic versions of  Gralise , according to a
complaint filed April 10 in federal court in Trenton,  New
Jersey . Depomed, based in Menlo Park, California, said the
copies for 300 and 600 milligram tablets would infringe six
patents. It seeks a court order to prevent sales until the
patents expire.  Impax, based in Hayward, California, confirmed in a
statement today that it filed an FDA application challenging the
patents. Allison Wey, a spokeswoman for Par, based in Woodcliff,
New Jersey, didnâ€™t immediately return a call seeking comment.  On March 2, Depomed also sued Actavis Group Hf, Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Incepta Pharmaceuticals Co., claiming
they infringed the same six Gralise patents.  The case is  Depomed Inc. (DEPO)  v. Impax Laboratories, 12-cv-2154,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporters on this story:
