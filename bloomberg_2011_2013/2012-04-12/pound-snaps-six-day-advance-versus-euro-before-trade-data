The pound snapped a six-day advance
against the euro before a report economists said will show the
 trade deficit  widened in February.  Sterling weakened against 12 of its 16 major peers. The
goods-trade gap widened to 7.65 billion pounds ($12.2 billion)
from 7.53 billion pounds in January, the  Office for National
Statistics  will say today, according to the median of 18
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Gilts fell before Britain
sells 2 billion pounds of bonds due in June 2032 today.  The pound was little changed at 82.45 pence per euro at
8:21 a.m. London time. It appreciated to 82.30 pence on April 9,
the strongest level since Jan. 9. The U.K. currency rose 0.2
percent to $1.5934.  Sterling has strengthened 0.8 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro weakened 0.5 percent, and
the dollar dropped 2 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points to 2.07
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
