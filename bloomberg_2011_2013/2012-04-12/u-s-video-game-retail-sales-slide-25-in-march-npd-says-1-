U.S. sales of video-game hardware,
software and accessories tumbled 25 percent in March to $1.1
billion from a year earlier, researcher NPD Group Inc. said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Retail sales totaled $1.47 billion a year earlier, when
Nintendo Co. introduced the 3DS handheld game player in the U.S.
market.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , buoyed by its Kinect motion-sensing
peripheral and entertainment partnerships with ESPN, HBO and
other providers, has led console sales for 15 consecutive
months, according to NPD, a research firm in Port Washington,
New York.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, sold 371,000 Xbox
360 consoles, down from 433,000 a year ago, the company said in
a separate e-mailed statement, citing NPD figures.  It was the
13th consecutive month that the company has topped 40 percent in
market share, NPD said.  Video-game makers voluntarily report their sales tallies.
Nintendo and  Sony Corp. (6758)  often don’t report monthly figures, and
they didn’t for March.  Nintendo probably sold 235,000 Wii consoles and 240,000 3DS
handhelds, said  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush
Securities in  Los Angeles , in an April 9 research note.  Sony sold 325,000 console units, down 10 percent from a
year earlier, and about 125,000 of its new PlayStation Vita
handheld model, Pachter said, citing checks of U.S. sales
outlets and company data. Retail sales of packaged video games
have fallen sharply for about two years as consumers purchase
games for play on smartphones and social networks such as
Facebook Inc., NPD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
