Treasuries  declined  for a second
day after the U.S. sold $13 billion in 30-year securities in the
final of three note and bond auctions this week totaling $66
billion.  The yield on the 30-year securities climbed to the highest
level since April 6 as the Standard & Poor’s 500-Index posted
its biggest two-day gain in 2012.  U.S. debt  rallied earlier as a
report showed initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose last
week, reigniting concern the economic recovery is slowing.  “In addition to the supply, risk assets are contributing
to the softer tone in Treasuries,” said  Richard Bryant , a
trader at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “Risk assets
in general are well bid, so we’re seeing a give and take back
between riskless and risk assets. The auction had reasonably
balanced demand.”  The yield on the 30-year bond rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.21 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
security due February 2042 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face
amount, to 98 11/32. The yield rose as much as three basis
points and declined as much as two basis points.  The 10-year note yield increased two basis points to 2.05
percent. The  S&P 500 Index  was up 1.4 percent.  Auction Statistics  The securities sold today drew a yield of 3.230 percent,
compared with a forecast of 3.233 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the Fed’s primary dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.76,
compared with an average of 2.65 for the past 10 sales.  “The auction was decent, as the market provided cheaper
yields that proved to me more attractive, and the market has
done better now that we have supply out of the way,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in  New York , one of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers required to bid at the
auctions.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30.7 percent of the bonds, the most
since January and compared with an average of 30.8 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 13.4 percent of
the bonds, versus an average of 17.1 percent for the past 10
auctions.  Debt Sales  Today’s auction is the last of three Treasury note and bond
offerings this week. The government sold $32 billion in three-
year notes on April 10 and $21 billion in 10-year notes
yesterday.  This week’s sales will raise $23.1 billion of new cash as
maturing securities held by the public total $42.9 billion.  The government announced plans to sell $16 billion of five-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on April 19. The
U.S. sold $12 billion of the securities at the previous sale
Dec. 15.  U.S. 30-year bonds have lost 4.65 percent this year,
compared with a 0.33 percent decline in the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long
bonds returned 36 percent in 2011, more than triple the 9.8
percent gain by Treasuries overall.  The Fed bought $4.5 billion in Treasuries as part of its
plan to bolster the economy. The Fed bought Treasuries due from
May 2020 to November 2021, according to the New York Fed’s
website. The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-
term debt in its holdings with longer maturities to hold down
borrowing costs.  Market Value  Valuation measures show government debt has dropped from
the most expensive levels in almost five weeks. The term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed, reached
negative 0.60 percent today after touching negative 0.65 percent
on April 10.  It reached negative 0.26 percent on March 19, the least
expensive since October. A negative reading indicates investors
are willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Volatility rose yesterday from the lowest in a month. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury
price swings based on options, rose to 76.3 basis points. It
dropped to 75 basis points on April 10, the lowest since March
13. It reached 93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest level
this year.  Wholesale prices in the U.S. excluding food and fuel rose
more than forecast in March. The so-called core producer price
index climbed 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent rise the previous
month, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists projected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The overall gauge was
little changed after a 0.4 percent rise.  Inflation Measure  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, was 2.31 percentage points. The average for the
past decade is 2.14 percentage points.  A  measure  of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed
uses to help guide monetary policy was at 2.55 percent, below
its 2.76 percent average during the past decade. It touched 2.78
percent on March 19, the highest in 2012.  It reached 3.23 percent in August, the highest since
December 2010. The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate
projects annual price increases over a five-year period
beginning in 2017.  Jobless claims climbed to 380,000, the most since Jan. 28,
the Labor Department reported. The median forecast of 46
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop in jobless
claims to 355,000 in the week ending April 7.  U.S. employers added 120,000 jobs in March, lower than the
205,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before the
Labor Department report on April 6.  “Combined with the weaker nonfarm payrolls, this uptick in
initial jobless claims will cause people to reassess their
assumptions that the labor market will continue to improve,”
said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  To contact the reporters on this story:
