The Australian dollar rallied to a
one-week high after data showed that employers added almost
seven times the number of workers in March than forecast, easing
prospects the Reserve Bank will cut  interest rates .  Australia’s bonds fell as Asian stocks rose, pushing all
government yields below their three-month averages.  New
Zealand ’s dollar gained against most major peers after a report
showed the nation’s manufacturing industry expanded in March.
Demand for both South Pacific currencies was also supported
after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  backed the case
for more U.S. easing, and commodities prices climbed.  “It’s quite a strong report at face value,”  Annette Beacher , the Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific research at TD
Securities Inc. said of the Australian jobs report. “There were
some expectations that the RBA would need to cut rates by 50
basis points, but this report reminds you that the economy is
not falling apart. The Aussie is well supported.”  Australia ’s dollar earlier touched $1.0386, the strongest
since April 3, before trading at $1.0378 as of 3:49 p.m. in
Sydney, 0.8 percent higher than yesterday’s close in  New York .
The Aussie advanced 0.9 percent to 84.01 yen.  The nation’s government bonds  declined , pushing the yield
on the 10-year security up by as much as three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.92 percent. Three-year  yields  rose
eight basis points to 3.33 percent.  New Zealand’s currency added 0.3 percent to 82.02 U.S.
cents from yesterday when it climbed 0.4 percent. The so-called
kiwi rose 0.4 percent to 66.41 yen.  Hiring Surge  Australian payrolls rose by 44,000, the statistics bureau
said in Sydney today. That compares with the median estimate for
an increase of 6,500 in a Bloomberg News survey of 24
economists. The jobless rate held at 5.2 percent, compared with
projections for a rise to 5.3 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia on April 3 held its benchmark
interest rates unchanged at 4.25 percent. A  Credit Suisse Group
AG index  based on swaps indicates the RBA will lower rates by 87
basis points, or 0.89 percentage point, over the next 12 months,
compared to 94 basis points indicated yesterday.  Yellen endorsed the U.S. central bank’s “highly
accommodative” policy, saying the Fed probably won’t achieve
its goal of full employment for years. The central bank bought
$2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to support
the economy, and it has pledged to keep interest rates low
through late 2014.  ‘Stimulative’ Language  “Fed members speaking are dovish members, and they will
provide some stimulative type of language,” said  Imre Speizer ,
a strategist in Auckland at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s
second-largest lender. “Right now, QE3 doesn’t seem to be on
the table, but it’s certainly possible. I see some upside for
the next day or two” in Aussie and kiwi.  Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New Zealand said
today their Performance of Manufacturing Index was at 54.5 in
March from 57.7 in February. A reading of more than 50 indicates
that manufacturing is expanding.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose 0.6 percent
following a 0.6 percent gain in the MSCI’s World Index
yesterday. The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw
materials added 0.6 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
