Egypt’s wheat production is
forecast to rise 1.1 percent this year as farmers plant more and
use improved seeds, the  United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture
Organization  said.  Farmers may harvest 8.46 million metric tons of wheat from
8.37 million tons in 2011, the Rome-based UN agency wrote in a
 report  on its website today. The outlook for winter crops to be
harvested from May is “generally favorable,” the FAO said.  Egypt’s domestic wheat is mostly irrigated. The country is
the world’s largest importer of the grain, with shipments
forecast to climb to 10.5 million tons in the year through June
from 10.4 million tons in 2010-11, the according to data from
the International Grains Council.  “The good wheat-crop performance was due to larger planted
area and to the increased use of improved seeds which
contributed to increase yields,” the FAO wrote.  Egypt  harvested an above-average wheat crop last year,
according to the FAO.  Corn production in 2012 is forecast to climb 3.1 percent to
7.55 million tons from 7.32 million tons, while paddy production
of rice is seen unchanged at 5.8 million tons, according to the
FAO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
