Hungary will hold on to the 16
percent flat personal income tax system and keep in place
regulations requiring a two-third parliamentary majority to
change the levy,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing a government
official.  Neither the European Union nor the  International Monetary
Fund  have requested that Hungary scrap regulations on the flat
tax system in exchange for starting bailout negotiations, the
Budapest-based daily said, citing Adam Balog, deputy state
secretary at the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
