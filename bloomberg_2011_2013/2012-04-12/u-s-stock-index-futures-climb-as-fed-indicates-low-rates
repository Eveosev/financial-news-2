U.S. stocks rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest two-day rally in 2012,
on policymakers’ signals that  interest rates  will remain low.  Commodity shares gained the most among 10  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  groups.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy for the economy,
added 2.2 percent.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  surged 7.2 percent, the
biggest advance since 2009, after Gartner Inc. said the global
personal-computer industry grew in the first quarter as the
company remained a market leader.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  added 1.8 percent
at 4:54 p.m. New York time as profit beat estimates.  The  S&P 500  advanced 1.4 percent to 1,387.57 at 4 p.m. New
York time, rising 2.1 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 181.19 points, or 1.4 percent, to
12,986.58. About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges today, or 8 percent below the three-month average.  “We have the ingredients for a better tone to the
market,” said  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $15 billion as chief
investment officer for Fifth Third Asset Management in
Cincinnati. “The bar was set low, we might have a good earnings
season and a couple of Fed officials are providing some
rhetoric. If there’s an erosion of economic conditions, it’s
likely that we’re going to see action by the Fed.”  Equities rose today as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen and New York Fed President William C. Dudley endorsed the
central bank’s view that borrowing costs are likely to stay low
through 2014. Those comments overshadowed investors’
disappointment after a report showed that more Americans than
forecast filed claims for jobless benefits last week.  Chinese Data  American stocks also joined a global rally as investors
awaited a report at 10 p.m. New York time that’s forecast to
show  China ’s economy expanded 8.4 percent last quarter. The
 Bloomberg China-U.S. Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. added 2.5 percent.  Today’s gain extended this year’s advance in the S&P 500 to
10 percent as investors piled into stocks amid better-than-
estimated economic and corporate data. While S&P 500 per-share
profit growth slowed to 0.8 percent during the first three
months of the year from 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, it
will accelerate to 8.3 percent during all of 2012, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s very difficult to kill a rally that we’ve seen over
the last few months in one shot,” said  Michael Shaoul , chairman
of Marketfield Asset Management in New York, which oversees more
than $1.6 billion. “Without ‘new’ news it will be very
difficult to send this market lower. Ultimately, earnings are
going to be important. I would expect good domestic earnings.”  Biggest Gains  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 rose today as companies most-
dependent on economic growth had the biggest gains. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index added 2.6 percent.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
advanced 4.6 percent to $106.44.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , which this week
reported an unexpected profit, rallied 2.7 percent to $10.17.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  climbed 1.9 percent to $44.84.  Hewlett-Packard jumped 7.2 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$25.10. The company accounted for 17.2 percent of worldwide PC
shipments, Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner said yesterday.
Total global PC shipments climbed 1.9 percent to 89 million
units, after predictions of a 1.2 percent drop, according to
Gartner. Another research firm, IDC, also reported a surprise
increase for the quarter.  Google rallied 2.4 percent to $651.01. After the close of
regular trading, the shares rose 1.8 percent to $662.60. First-
quarter profit before certain costs was $10.08 a share. Analysts
had  projected  $9.64 on average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Stock Split  The company announced plans for what it calls an effective
stock split, introducing a new class of nonvoting capital stock.
The shares will be distributed through a stock dividend to
existing shareholders.  “The viability of Google is still very, very strong,”
said Ron Josey, an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC in New York. He
recommends buying the stock, which he doesn’t own himself.
“There’s still a lot of room for growth across its multiple
businesses.”  Tomorrow, investors will get a first look at bank results
when JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co. kick off earnings, about an
hour apart. Citigroup Inc. is set to announce results April 16,
followed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America and Morgan
Stanley.  AT&T Inc. (T)  gained 1.3 percent to $30.84 after the company’s
shares were raised to the equivalent of buy at JPMorgan. The 9-
month share-price estimate is $33.  $31.6 Billion  McKesson Corp. (MCK)  jumped 3.9 percent to $91.34. The largest
U.S. drug distributor based on revenue rose to its highest level
since 1998 after the company won a $31.6 billion contract from
the Department of  Veterans Affairs .  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  slipped 5.8 percent to $49.51. Roche Holding
AG, which bid $51 a share to buy the maker of DNA analysis
equipment, said publicly available information doesn’t justify a
higher price.  Before capping a two-day rally, the S&P 500 had tumbled 4.3
percent from an almost four-year high on April 2. The retreat in
the index may not be over, as a gauge of bullishness reached
levels that coincided with the market’s peak in 2007 and
preceded the biggest pullback in both of the last two years.  The Consensus Bullish Sentiment index on stocks, based on a
weekly survey of brokerage strategists and newsletter writers,
exceeded 75 percent for seven weeks through April 3, the longest
streak since Kansas City, Missouri-based Consensus Inc. began
compiling the data in 1983.  S&P 500’s Drop  The index fell to 69 percent this week as the  S&P 500 (SPX)  had
the worst five-day drop since November amid concern the recovery
in the American labor market is slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis
is worsening.  Increasing bullishness is considered a contrarian indicator
by some analysts who follow price charts to make market
predictions, because investors who have bought shares now have
less money to purchase stocks.  “We’re concerned at what we view as very complacent
bullish sentiment, almost frothy, and it needs to be unwound,”
John Kattar, chief investment officer at Eastern Investment
Advisors in Boston, which manages $1.7 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “We should see some fear creeping back
into the market, but we’re a long way from that happening yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
