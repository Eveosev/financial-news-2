An Indian court sentenced 18 people
to life in prison for the killing of nearly two dozen Muslims
during religious rioting in the western state of Gujarat a
decade ago, the  Press Trust of India  reported.  The court in Gujaratâ€™s Anand district sent five others to
jail for seven years, the  news agency  said, citing the ruling.  All those sentenced were convicted this week for setting
fire to a house in Ode village where Muslims had taken shelter
in March 2002. The attack, and others that raged through
Gujarat, followed the deaths of 59 Hindu pilgrims in a fire
aboard a train in the state.  A court in March last year sentenced 11 Muslims to death
and 22 others to life in prison for conspiring to set fire to
the train carriage in the town of Godhra. The subsequent riots
killed more than 1,000 people, the majority of them Muslims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
