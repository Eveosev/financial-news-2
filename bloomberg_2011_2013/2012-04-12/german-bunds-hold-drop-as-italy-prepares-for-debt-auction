German  government bonds  held a
decline from yesterday, as Italy prepared to auction as much as
5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of bonds.  German two-year  note yields  were six basis points from the
record low set two days ago before a report that economists said
will show euro-area industrial production fell in February.
Italy plans to sell debt due between March 2015 and August 2023
today after it met its target at an auction of bills yesterday.  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.79 percent
at 7:26 a.m. London time. The price of the 1.75 percent bond due
July 2022 was at 99.64. Two-year notes yielded 0.15 percent,
after falling to as low as 0.091 percent on April 10.  Industrial output in the 17-nation euro region fell 0.2
percent from a month earlier, after staying unchanged in
January, according to the median of 23  estimates  in a Bloomberg
News survey. A separate report showed  France â€™s inflation rate
unexpectedly rose in March.  German bunds returned 0.9 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds gained 1.8 percent,
and Italian securities rallied 8.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
