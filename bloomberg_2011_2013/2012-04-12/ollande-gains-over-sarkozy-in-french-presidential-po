French Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande  would defeat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  by 57 percent to
43 percent if the final round of the presidential election due
May 6 were to be held now, a CSA opinion poll showed.  Hollande’s score in the poll jumped three percentage points
from a previous CSA poll held April 2 and 3, while Sarkozy
dropped three points, the polling company said in an e-mail
today.  About 27 percent of voters intend to back Hollande in the
first round set for April 22, down two points in a week,
according to the CSA poll for BFM TV, 20 Minutes newspaper and
RMC radio. Sarkozy’s support fell by four points to 26 percent,
the survey found.  Jean-Luc Melenchon, a Communist-backed candidate, would get
17 percent of the vote in the first round, and National Front
candidate Marine Le Pen would get 15 percent, CSA said.  French voters will choose from among 10 candidates in the
first round of the election and the two front-runners will face-
off in the second. CSA interviewed 1,123 registered voters for
the survey on April 10 and 11. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
