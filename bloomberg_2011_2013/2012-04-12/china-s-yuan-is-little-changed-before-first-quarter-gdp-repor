The yuan was little changed before
a report tomorrow that’s expected to show the economy expanded
in the first quarter at the slowest pace in almost three years.  Gross domestic product  rose 8.4 percent from a year earlier
following an 8.9 percent increase in the previous three months,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The People’s Bank of  China  may cut  interest rates  in
the “immediate future” as inflation isn’t too high,  Michael Kurtz , chief Asian equity strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
wrote in a report dated yesterday. The central bank raised the 
yuan’s reference rate  by 0.05 percent to 6.2984 per dollar
today, the strongest level since March 30.  “China’s growth is likely to exceed Premier Wen Jiabao’s
7.5 percent target so the risk of a hard landing is low,” said
Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based currency analyst at  Bank of East
Asia Ltd. (23)  “However, the yuan will trade between 6.30 and 6.3150
in the near-term unless the upcoming economic data could give
some positive surprises.”  The yuan closed at 6.3073 per dollar in Shanghai, from
yesterday’s close of 6.3081, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency is allowed to move as much
as 0.5 percent either side of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.04 percent
to 6.3060. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.05
percent to 6.3424, a 0.6 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yuan’s one-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 2.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
