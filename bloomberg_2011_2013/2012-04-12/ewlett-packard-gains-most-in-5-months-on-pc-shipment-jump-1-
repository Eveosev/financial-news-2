Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
biggest personal-computer maker, rose the most in three years
after researcher  Gartner Inc. (IT)  said the global PC industry
unexpectedly grew in the first quarter as the company remained a
market leader.  Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, advanced
7.2 percent to $25.10 at the close in New York, the biggest jump
since March 2009. The stock, which has fallen 2.6 percent this
year, was the fifth-best  performer  today in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  The company accounted for 17.2 percent of worldwide PC
shipments, Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner said yesterday.  Total global PC shipments climbed 1.9 percent to 89 million
units, after predictions of a 1.2 percent drop, according to
Gartner. Another research firm, IDC, also reported a surprise
increase for the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
