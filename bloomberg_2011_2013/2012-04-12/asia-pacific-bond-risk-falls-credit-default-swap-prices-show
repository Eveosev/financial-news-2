The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 4 basis points
to 155.5 basis points as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The benchmark is set for its first
drop since April 3, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 166 as of 8:10
a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 2 basis points to 166
basis points as of 9:13 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
