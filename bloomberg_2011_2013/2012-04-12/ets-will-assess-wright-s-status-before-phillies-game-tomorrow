The  New York Mets  will assess David Wright’s playing status before tomorrow’s game against the
 Philadelphia Phillies .  The five-time Major League Baseball All-Star was cleared to
resume playing as soon as he felt able after his broken finger
was evaluated today by a local hand specialist.  Wright, 29, fractured the middle joint of the little finger
on his right hand while sliding into first base on April 9.  The Mets went 4-0 with Wright in the lineup and are 0-2
without him. The third baseman was batting .583 with one home
run and four runs batted in prior to the injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
