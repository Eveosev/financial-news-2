Ukraine’s government is seeking a
new loan from VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest bank, to
refinance debt,  Ekonomicheskie Izvestia  reported without saying
where it got the information.  Ukraine wants to secure the funds to repay a $2 billion
loan from VTB that comes due in June, the newspaper said. The
country wants the new facility to mature in a year with a
possibility of extending it for another year, Izvestia said.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Jennifer M. Freedman  To contact the reporter on this story:
