Russia’s federal government plans
to move outside Moscow starting from late 2014 or 2015, RIA
Novosti reported, citing President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s top
economic aide, Arkady Dvorkovich.  The authorities will prepare a proposed timetable for the
shift within the next three months, Dvorkovich was cited as
saying by the news service. The intention is to transfer all
federal government buildings as well as both houses of
parliament, he said.  Relocating the government would ease traffic congestion and
spur infrastructure upgrades in the surrounding areas, Moscow
Deputy Mayor Andrei Sharonov said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
