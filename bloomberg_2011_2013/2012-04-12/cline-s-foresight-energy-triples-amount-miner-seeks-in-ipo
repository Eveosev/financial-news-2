Foresight Energy Partners LP (FELP) , the
coal producer run by billionaire Christopher Cline, filed to
raise $300 million in a U.S. initial public offering, triple the
amount first sought.  The company, which disclosed the new amount in a regulatory
filing today, had earlier filed to raise $100 million. The
amounts are placeholders used to calculate fees and may change.  Foresight operates the most productive underground  coal
mine  in the U.S. and generated more than $500 million in  sales 
last year, according to the filing. Cline, who also serves as
principal strategy officer, previously developed coal deposits
in the Illinois basin and the Appalachian region.  Coal production rose 44 percent last year to 10.4 million
tons, Foresight  said . The company operates underground longwall
mines in central and southern  Illinois  and has about 3 billion
tons of coal reserves.  The miner, which is applying to list on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker FELP, plans to use the IPO proceeds to
make a distribution to Foresight Reserves. Foresight didn’t
disclose how many shares will be offered or prospective prices
in the IPO, which Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are leading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
