Kreider Farms, a dairy and egg
operation in Manheim, Pennsylvania, keeps its chickens in too-
tight quarters, showing the need for a federal egg-cage law,
according to the  Humane Society  of the U.S.  The business’s cages are smaller even than industry norms,
the Washington-based animal advocacy group said today as it
released an undercover video showing  dead birds  being taken from
quarters too tight for living animals to spread their wings.  Chicken cages may become larger under an agreement between
the Humane Society and the United Egg Producers, the industry’s
largest trade group, should Congress approve by June 30 a bill
codifying the size of enclosures. Kreider Farms is not a part of
that agreement. The bill would cost $4 billion over 15 years,
according to industry estimates, and double cage space for each
hen to at least 124 square inches (800 square centimeters).  “This investigation is an example of why we need a federal
policy that improves the treatment of egg-laying birds,” said
Michael Markarian, the Humane Society’s chief policy officer.  Ron Kreider, the president of Kreider Farms, said the
company is building new facilities that will increase cage space
and ventilation. The Humane Society video is taking chicken
farming out of context, he said in an e-mailed statement.  “The reality of  food processing  can be off-putting to
those not familiar with animal agriculture,” he said. “When
dealing with millions of birds, there is always a small
percentage of dead birds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
