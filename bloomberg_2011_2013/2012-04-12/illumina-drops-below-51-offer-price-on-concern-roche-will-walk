Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , which has twice
rejected unsolicited takeover bids from  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , fell
below the $51-a-share current offer as investors grew concerned
that the Swiss drugmaker would abandon the deal.  Illumina dropped 5.8 percent to $49.51 at 4 p.m. New York
time in the biggest  decline  for the San Diego-based company
since October. Roche raised its offer on March 29 to $51 a
share, or about $6.7 billion, from $44.50 in January. It was the
first time the shares dipped below the bid price.  The current offer is “more than adequate to serve as a
basis” to start talks and “is full, fair and extremely
attractive by every conceivable financial metric,” Roche, based
in Basel,  Switzerland , said today in a statement. The drugmaker
won’t raise the bid without starting talks with Illumina, Roche
Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan told analysts and
investors on a conference call.  “There is no reason for us, whatsoever, to increase our
offer unless we get into negotiations,” Schwan said. “And so
far, this is not the case.”  Illumina’s gene-mapping technology may help Roche, the
world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs, tailor medicines to
individual patients. A spokesman for Illumina declined to
comment today.  “The concern is the possibility that Roche may just say,
‘We don’t want to deal with this anymore,’” said  Les Funtleyder , a  fund manager  who helps oversee $100 million,
including Illumina shares, at Miller Tabak & Co. “That Roche
might actually be serious about walking away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
