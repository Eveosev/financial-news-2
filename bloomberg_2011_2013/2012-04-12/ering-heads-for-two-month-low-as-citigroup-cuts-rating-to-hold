Cia. Hering (HGTX3) ,  Brazil ’s second-
biggest clothing retailer, fell to the lowest in two months
after Citigroup Inc. cut its recommendation to the equivalent of
hold from buy.  Hering dropped 1.4 percent to 44.19 reais in Sao Paulo, the
lowest closing level since Feb. 15. The benchmark Bovespa index
rose 2.9 percent.  “The combination of current level of valuation and ‘not so
exciting’ short-term results make us more cautious about the
stock performance,” Carlos Albano, an analyst at Citigroup,
wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. “The company’s
sales performance, which already reported meaningful
deceleration in 2011, should decelerate even further” in the
first quarter of 2012.  Hering’s sales rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, down from a 43 percent increase in the first
quarter of 2011, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock trades at 18.5 times Citigroup’s 2012 earnings
estimates. That compares with a ratio of 18 for larger
competitor  Lojas Renner SA (LREN3) , which also has a recommendation the
equivalent of hold at Citigroup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
