PPR SA (PP)  fell in Paris trading after
Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock on concern its Gucci unit
will underperform luxury peers in 2012 and continued challenges
at sporting-goods maker Puma will weigh on profitability.  PPR  declined as much as  2.8 percent to 123.25 euros, the
lowest intraday price since Feb. 23, and was trading at 123.4
euros as of 11:56 a.m.  “The shares will struggle to outperform until we see clear
signs that PPR is progressing towards its long-term vision of
becoming a luxury/lifestyle conglomerate and overcoming the
challenges to making a faster exit from the slow growth and low
margin non-core retail assets,” Louise Singlehurst, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley in  London , wrote today in a note, lowering her
rating on the stock to underweight from equalweight.  Gucci’s revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter, while
Puma may need further investment to regain its competitive
stance, according to Singlehurst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
