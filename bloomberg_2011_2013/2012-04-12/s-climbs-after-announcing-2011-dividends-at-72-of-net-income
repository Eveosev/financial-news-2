OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,  Russia ’s
largest mobile operator, gained the most in a month in U.S.
trading after the company said its board recommended paying 72
percent of net income as dividends for last year.  American depositary receipts of MTS, as the company is
known, rose 2.6 percent to $18.31, the most since March 13 on a
closing basis, at 12:21 p.m. in New York. The stock has gained
25 percent this year after declining 30 percent in 2011.  “MTS has proved to be a reliable dividends payer and
market had a positive reaction to the news,” Konstantin Chernyshev, head of research at UralSib Financial Corp in
Moscow, said by phone.  MTS, as the company is known, said its board recommended
paying a total of 30.4 billion rubles ($1 billion) in an e-
mailed statement today. It may pay 14.71 rubles a share or $1.01
per American depositary receipt, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
