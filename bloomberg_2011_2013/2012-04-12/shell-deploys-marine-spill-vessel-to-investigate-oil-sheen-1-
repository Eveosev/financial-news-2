  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  deployed an
oil-spill response vessel after finding “a light sheen” of oil
between its Mars and  Ursa (RIGBP163)  production areas in the  Gulf of
Mexico , according to a company statement.  “Shell has no current indication that the sheen originates
from its wells,” Kelly op de Weegh, a company spokeswoman, said
in an e-mailed statement. The sheen’s origin is unknown, she
said. It covers an area one mile by 10 miles (1.6 by 16
kilometers), according to the statement.  The Mars and Ursa platforms are still operating, she said
in a later e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
