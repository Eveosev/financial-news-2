Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
raised about 300 million ringgit ($97.7 million) selling five
credit-linked notes to individual investors in  Malaysia  since
November, according to an e-mailed statement.  The Singapore-based lender said in an April 9 statement it
would sell its sixth credit-linked note in the currency next
month, after becoming the first bank in the Southeast Asian
nation to sell the securities to individuals last year.  The five-year notes will be linked to the credit of
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Standard Chartered
Plc and Bank of China Ltd., OCBC said in the statement. The
notes will pay interest of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent a year,
according to the statement.  Eleanor Danker, a Kuala Lumpur-based spokeswoman for OCBC,
declined to immediately comment on the issuance when asked by e-
mail how much the bank plans to raise via the sale.  Credit-linked notes are debt securities issued and
underwritten by banks linked to the bonds or credit-default
swaps of a separate entity. The investors are exposed to losses
if either the bank that sold the note or the entity that the
note is tied to defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
