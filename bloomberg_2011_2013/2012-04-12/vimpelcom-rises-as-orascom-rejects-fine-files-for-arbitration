VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  rose the most in
three weeks in U.S. trading after the company’s subsidiary said
it rejected a $1.3 billion fine against its Algerian unit and
submitted an arbitration notice against the North African
nation.  VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-largest wireless operator by
subscribers, climbed 2.3 percent to $10.85 at 3:35 p.m. in New
York, the biggest one-day advance since March 22 based on
closing prices.  VimpelCom’s subsidiary  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, is disputing the $1.3
billion fine imposed by an Algerian court against the Djezzy
unit for allegedly violating foreign-exchange regulations,
according to a statement e-mailed today.  Algeria is in talks to buy a stake in Djezzy from
VimpelCom, which merged with Orascom last year. It is still
discussing a purchase price for the 51 percent stake, Finance
Minister  Karim Djoudi  said in an interview on March 29.  “If the $1.3 billion fine is lifted, the sale value
discussion will be resolved and the stock will gain,” Iouli Matevossov, an analyst at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said by phone.  VimpelCom remains open to “finding an amicable resolution
with the Algerian government,” it said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
