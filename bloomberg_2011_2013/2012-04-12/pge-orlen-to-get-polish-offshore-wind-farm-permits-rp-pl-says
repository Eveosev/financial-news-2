PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest power
utility, and oil refiner  PKN Orlen (PKN)  will “in days” receive
permits to build wind farms on the Baltic Sea, Rp.pl reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The Ministry of Transport, Construction and Maritime
Economy, which has already issued one such permit for Kulczyk
Investments, may reject the rest of the 59 applications it had
received to build the facilities, the website of Rzeczpospolita
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
