Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK)  sank the most in
two months in Frankfurt trading after saying that first-quarter
profit will be less than forecast.  Profit for the operator of health-care facilities will be 5
million euros ($6.6 million) to 9 million euros lower than
targeted, after “positive earnings contributions” were
deferred to later in the year, the Bad Neustadt, Germany-based
company said today in a statement. Rhoen-Klinikum reaffirmed
full-year sales and earnings goals.  The shares fell 2.9 percent to 14.16 euros, the steepest
drop since Feb 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
