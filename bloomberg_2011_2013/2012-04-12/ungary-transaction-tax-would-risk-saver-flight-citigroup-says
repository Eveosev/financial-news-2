Hungary ’s proposed financial
transaction tax would weaken the banking sector because it may
push savers to withdraw their funds from local lenders,
Citigroup Inc. said today.  News website Origo reported yesterday that the government
is planning to introduce a levy on transactions such as bank
transfers and cash withdrawals from next year as part of
measures to narrow the  budget deficit .  “A transaction-based tax may weaken the Hungarian banking
sector’s capital position further by leading to a flight from
liquid private sector savings,”  Eszter Gargyan , a Budapest-
based economist at the bank, wrote in a research report today.  The Economy Ministry won’t comment on Origo’s report on the
tax “pending a government decision” on the matter, the
ministry said in an e-mailed response to questions from
Bloomberg yesterday.  Cutting ministries’ spending, another part of the budget
measures, “without restructuring suggest high implementation
risks,” Citigroup’s Gargyan said.  “The above factors, in our view, indicate that Hungary-
specific news may be disappointing in the coming weeks,
delivering an underperformance in local assets,” Gargyan added.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest lender, rose 1.1 percent
to 3,640 forint by 9:31 a.m. in Budapest, rebounding from the
lowest close since Jan. 18 yesterday. The forint was little
changed at 298.04 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
