Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, slumped 52
percent in the latest week as  Morocco  didn’t take any wheat for
the first time in seven weeks.  Export shipments dropped to 89,985 metric tons between
April 5 and April 11 from 189,434 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. Exports included
86,685 tons of soft wheat.  Algeria was the biggest destination, taking 50,929 tons of
soft wheat compared with 59,470 tons the previous week, while
 Mexico  took 26,600 tons of wheat, the first shipped to the
country from Rouen since at least August 2010. Morocco was the
main destination a week ago, taking 85,250 tons.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  English Channel , which shipped out 17 percent and
11 percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
