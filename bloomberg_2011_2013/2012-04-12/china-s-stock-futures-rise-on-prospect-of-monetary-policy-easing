China’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to its biggest gain in two months, amid
speculation government data tomorrow will show economic growth
slowed, giving policy makers scope to loosen monetary policy.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (601088)  and China Coal Energy Co. advanced
more than 2 percent on expectations an earthquake in  Indonesia 
will strain supplies from the world’s largest exporter of
thermal coal. Citic Securities Co. advanced to a nine-month high
after the stock-market regulator approved 11 more overseas
investors to buy yuan-denominated securities. Hainan Airlines
Co. rallied on a plan to receive assets from its parent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 41.94 points, or 1.8
percent, to 2,350.86 at the close, its biggest advance since
Feb. 8. The gauge climbed before data tomorrow that will
probably show the economy expanded 8.4 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace since 2009, according to the median of
41 economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Industrial
production and retail sales accelerated in March while spending
on fixed assets slowed, other government reports may show.  “The market is waiting for tomorrow’s data, which may
definitely show the economy is slowing down,” said Wang Weijun,
a strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “That may
justify the government taking measures such as a cut in  interest
rates  to boost growth.”  Economic Slowdown  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 2 percent to 2,570.44. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, added 1.8 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 18.7
today, the highest level since March 2. About 7.5 billion shares
changed hands in the gauge yesterday, 14 percent lower than the
daily average this year.  The Shanghai index has gained 6.9 percent this year on
speculation the government will cut lenders’ reserve
requirements and borrowing costs to boost the economy. Stocks in
the gauge are valued at 9.9 times estimated earnings, compared
with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6, according to weekly
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  China  may cut interest rates in the “immediate future” as
inflation isn’t too high to prevent further easing of monetary
policy,  Michael Kurtz , chief Asian equity strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc., wrote in a report dated yesterday. Reports this
week showed the inflation rate rose by a faster-than-estimated
3.6 percent in March, while growth in imports and exports
slowed.  Loan Data  Policy makers have cut the amount banks must keep in
reserves twice since November to free up cash for lending, in a
bid to insulate the world’s second-largest economy from the
effects of a global slowdown. Interest rates haven’t been
reduced since 2008.  New local-currency lending was 1.01 trillion yuan ($160.1
billion) in March, the People’s Bank of China said on its
website after the market closed. That compared with the median
797.5 billion yuan estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 28
economists and 710.7 billion yuan the previous month. M2 money
supply climbed 13.4 last month, accelerating from a 13 percent
growth in February, the central bank said.  Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal producer, gained 2.3
percent to 26.24 yuan. China Coal, the second largest, added 2.3
percent to 9.19 yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. (601001) , the third
biggest, climbed 2.9 percent to 13.24 yuan.  The 8.6-magnitude quake in Indonesia hit 431 kilometers
(268 miles) off the coast of the western province of Aceh, one
of the nation’s poorest provinces, where 170,000 people died or
went missing in a tsunami in 2004.  Brokerages Gain  China’s Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Price Index, which tracks
power-station coal prices at six ports, rose 0.6 percent to 782
yuan a metric ton yesterday compared with a week earlier,
according to the Qinhuangdao Seaborne Coal Market website.  China Hainan Rubber Industry Group Co. (601118) , the nation’s sole
listed producer of natural rubber, jumped 6.5 percent to 7.19
yuan on speculation the quake will disrupt supply from
Indonesia, the world’s second-largest producer of the commodity.  Citic Securities (600030)  led a gain among brokerages on
expectations they will benefit from the regulator’s plan to
expand the qualified foreign institutional investor, or QFII,
program. The stock climbed 4.1 percent to 12.99 yuan, its
highest close since July 15.  GF Securities Co., China’s second-biggest listed brokerage,
gained 3.9 percent to 30.84 yuan. Haitong Securities Co., the
third largest, advanced 4.4 percent to 10.22 yuan.  More QFIIs  JPMorgan Asset Management UK Ltd., American International
Assurance Co. and nine other overseas investors were approved by
the China Securities Regulatory Commission to receive investment
licenses, according to data on the regulator’s website today.  The regulator has approved 158 QFIIs so far, the data
showed. The CSRC said on April 4 it increased the QFII quotas to
$80 billion from $30 billion.  Hainan Airlines (600221)  rose 2.2 percent to 4.60 yuan. The company
will receive stakes in Hong Kong Airlines and Grand China Air
from the parent, the carrier said in a statement yesterday.  Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S. rallied the most in a
month yesterday, led by solar companies.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index’s advance yesterday was
the biggest since March 13. Solar company  Suntech Power Holdings
Co. (STP)  posted the largest gain on the gauge as Satcon Technology
Corp., a maker of inverters that connect renewable energy to
electricity grids, said bookings surged 130 percent in the first
quarter from the last three months of 2011.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Chan Tien Hin,  Matthew Oakley   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
