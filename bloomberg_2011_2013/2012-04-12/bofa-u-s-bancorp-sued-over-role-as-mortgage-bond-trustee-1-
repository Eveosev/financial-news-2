Bank of America Corp.  and U.S.
Bancorp were sued by a pension fund that accused the banks of
failing to fulfill their obligations to protect investors in
mortgage-backed securities.  The banks “regularly disregarded” their responsibilities
as trustee for Washington Mutual Inc. mortgage bonds and caused
millions of dollars in losses for investors, the Policemen’s
Annuity and Benefit Fund of the City of  Chicago  said in a
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in  Manhattan .  The banks knew that loans backing the securities didn’t
live up to their promised quality, that mortgage loan files were
incomplete, and failed to take action to enforce WaMu’s
obligation to repurchase defective loans, according to the
complaint.  Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined
comment on the complaint. Teri Charest, a U.S. Bancorp
spokeswoman, said the Minneapolis-based bank would fight the
allegations. U.S. Bancorp succeeded Bank of America as trustee
for the trusts at issue, according to the court filing.  “The complaint contains numerous misstatements and
mischaracterizations of U.S. Bank’s role as trustee,” Charest
said in an emailed statement.  Earlier this month, a federal judge in  New York  ruled that
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  must face claims over its role as
trustee for investors in Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage
bonds.  The case is Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of the
City of Chicago v. Bank of America NA, 12-2865, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
