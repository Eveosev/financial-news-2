The retreat in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index may not be over, as a gauge of bullishness
reached levels that coincided with the market’s peak in 2007 and
preceded the biggest pullback in both of the last two years.  The Consensus Bullish Sentiment index on stocks, based on a
weekly survey of brokerage strategists and newsletter writers,
exceeded 75 percent for seven weeks through April 3, the longest
streak since  Kansas City , Missouri-based Consensus Inc. began
compiling the data in 1983. The index fell to 69 percent this
week as the  S&P 500 (SPX)  had the worst five-day drop since November
amid concern the recovery in the American labor market is
slowing and  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Optimism has grown as the S&P 500 finished its best first-
quarter rally since 1998, bolstered by better-than-expected
economic data and corporate earnings. Increasing bullishness is
considered a contrarian indicator by some analysts who follow
price charts to make market predictions, because investors who
have bought shares now have less money to purchase stocks.  “We’re concerned at what we view as very complacent
bullish sentiment, almost frothy, and it needs to be unwound,”
John Kattar, chief investment officer at Eastern Investment
Advisors in  Boston , which manages $1.7 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “We should see some fear creeping back
into the market, but we’re a long way from that happening yet.”  Five-Day Decline  The  S&P 500  yesterday snapped a five-day decline after
Alcoa Inc. reported an unexpected first-quarter profit. The
benchmark measure reached its highest level since May 2008 on
April 2 and fell 4.3 percent over the following five days.
Katter said he expects to see a pullback of 5 percent to 10
percent.  Consensus says a reading above 75 percent in its sentiment
index suggests the market may be poised to fall, while a reading
below 25 percent signals a potential rebound. The measure has
averaged 43 percent since its inception.  Since 2007, there were five other occasions when brokerage
strategists and newsletter writers were so optimistic. The
Consensus index exceeded 75 percent for four straight weeks in
May 2007 and again for the week of Oct. 16 that year. The S&P
500  peaked  at an all-time high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007.  Sentiment readings reached 76 percent in April and May of
2010. That year, the S&P 500 hit a 19-month high on April 23
before slumping 16 percent to the year’s low.  In 2011, the sentiment index exceeded 75 percent only in
March. The equity gauge reached its peak of the year the next
month and tumbled 19 percent through October, the worst decline
since the  bull market  began in 2009.  The S&P 500 is down 2.8 percent this month after rallying
12 percent in the first quarter. The retreat may push the
benchmark measure toward 1,340, a level close to the index’s
intraday low on March 6, according to  Katie Stockton , chief
market technician at Greenwich, Connecticut-based MKM Partners.  “The pullback has not run its course yet, but it has been
constructive so far,” Stockton wrote in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
