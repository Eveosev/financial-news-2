Sweden’s  inflation  rate fell to the
lowest in 17 months after the largest Nordic economy contracted
at the end of last year.  The inflation rate fell to  an annual  1.5 percent from 1.9
percent the previous month,  Statistics Sweden  said today. That
was in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey of
six economists .  Monthly prices  rose 0.3 percent.  Adjusted for
mortgage costs , prices rose an annual 1.1 percent and  a monthly 
0.4 percent.  Sweden’s Riksbank cut its  main rate  for a second meeting to
1.5 percent in February and predicted unchanged rates over the
next year to keep inflation close to its 2 percent target as
growth slows. The bank in February forecast consumer prices
would rise an annual 1.6 percent in March.  “Inflation pressure is low and a weak development of the
real economy should prompt the bank to” halve the rate to 0.75
percent by September,  Andreas Jonsson , an economist at Nordea
Bank AB in  Stockholm , said before the report.  The  Swedish economy  will shrink 0.5 percent this year,
Danske Bank A/S predicted on April 4 after output fell 1.1
percent in the fourth quarter.  Industrial production  fell an
annual 7.1 percent in February, the most since 2009, Statistics
Sweden said on April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
