Russian oil and condensate
production will grow less than previously forecast because of
delays at an Arctic offshore field developed by OAO Gazprom, the
 International Energy Agency  said.  Output is likely to rise 1.1 percent this year, one
percentage point less than earlier estimated, as the start of
the Prirazlomnoye oil field,  Russia ’s first Arctic offshore
project, is postponed from this year, the IEA said today in its 
monthly oil market report.  “The oft-delayed field is now expected to come online in
2013, although we remain skeptical of Gazprom’s timelines,” said
the Paris-based energy adviser to 28 industrialized nations.  Prirazlomnoye in the  Barents Sea  is a bellwether as Russia
plans to tap offshore resources in the Arctic to help offset
declines at aging Western Siberian fields.  Russia’s liquids production was 10.6 million barrels a day
in March, unchanged from January and February, the IEA said.
First-quarter output expanded 1 percent from the same period in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
