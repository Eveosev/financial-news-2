Commercial University Ltd.  in New
Delhi offers degrees in commerce, one of hundreds of private
colleges trying to fill an education gap as  India ’s growth
creates a middle class eager for its children to succeed.  The operation doesn’t have a campus, nor are its degrees
recognized by the government. Commercial University, based in a
post office building between the capital and the sprawling
streets of the old city, is one of more than a dozen
institutions labeled as “fake” in an  alert  on the website of
the University Grants Commission, India’s college regulator.  Bogus degrees are a symptom of the crisis in India’s higher
education that prompted Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to promise
1,000  new  universities and hire S. Ramadorai, former chief of
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., to upgrade the system. Failure
to prepare students for India’s new industries risks squandering
the nation’s biggest competitive advantage -- the youngest
population among the world’s top 10 economies -- and has forced
companies led by  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  to build their own colleges.  “There is a need to bridge the gap between what is
required to do the job and where the education system leaves the
students,” said Srikantan “Tan” Moorthy, head of education
and research at Infosys, the nation’s second-biggest software
company. “Bridging that gap, in our experience, takes quite
some effort.”  Singh, Moorthy and overseas universities that want to build
campuses in India are running out of time. India needs to add
340 million skilled workers in the next decade if the country is
going to lift economic growth to 10 percent, the prime minister
said.  ‘Significant Gap’  “India can reap the demographic dividend of a young
population provided the young citizens of the country are
educated and possess the skills required for earning a decent
livelihood,” Singh said at a skill development conference in
January. “There is a significant gap between the requirement
and the supply which, unless checked, will constrain our
economic growth.”  The government raised spending on education by 24 percent
last year to $10.2 billion and  plans  to add 14 universities, 374
colleges and 20 software engineering institutes. Singh hired
Ramadorai, former chief of  Asia ’s largest software-services
provider, to head a panel to advise on ways to improve skill
development.  China, which produced a decade of more than 10 percent
average growth to become the world’s second-largest economy, had
a  literacy  rate in 2000 of 91 percent for people older than 15,
according to the  World Bank . Only 63 percent of Indians that age
were literate in 2006. The median age of India’s population is
25.1 years, compared with 34.5 years in China, according to data
from the  United Nations .  Elite Schools  India’s  higher-education  challenge is typified by its top
universities -- the seven Indian Institutes of Technology and
six Indian Institutes of Management that were set up after
independence to provide engineers and administrators. The list
has been expanded  since  the beginning of last decade with seven
more IIMs being added and eight new IITs.  These  institutes  get as many as 50 applicants for each
place, compared with 17 at Harvard, even though none are ranked
in the world’s top 300 universities by the London-based Times
Education Supplement.  Together, the IITs produce only about 9,600 graduates a
year -- fewer than Moscow State University -- and many students
leave to work abroad. Alumni include Ajit Jain, a potential
successor to  Warren Buffett  at Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha,
 Nebraska , who went to IIT Kharagpur; and Pepsico Inc. Chief
Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  who earned an MBA at IIM Calcutta.  Low Enrollment  India has one of the lowest gross enrollment  ratios  for
college of just 13 percent, half the global average and below
the 23 percent in  China , according to  KPMG . India’s government
said it hopes to achieve 30 percent by 2020. The ratio measures
the number of students enrolling in college after finishing
school.  The deficit has encouraged a proliferation of schools
claiming to offer higher education, some of which don’t provide
a recognized degree, prompting the University Grants Commission
to start its  alert  service. Delhi’s Commercial University, one
of those singled out by the commission, said on its website it
issues degrees under its own name and students can “legally
describe themselves” as graduates even though it doesn’t have
official recognition. A company official who wouldn’t give his
name declined to comment when contacted by phone.  Even those who make it through accredited universities are
often not ready for employment, according to educators at
 Infosys (INFO)  and  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s second-biggest
lender. K. Ramkumar,  executive director  at  ICICI (ICICBC)  said most
university curricula and teaching methods are out of date.  ‘Mug the Paper’  “It is not application-based teaching, it is purely memory
based,” he said. “You mug the paper and answer 20 questions
and get the marks. The trouble is, when they come to ICICI or
any other company, they aren’t able to recall any of that
knowledge.”  Infosys has taken matters into its own hands with its own
350-acre (140-hectare) campus on the edge of Mysore, India’s
ancient silk-weaving center. With its green lawns, marble-
floored atrium and sweeping Doric-collonaded facade, it looks
like someone dropped an  ivy-league  college into the middle of
the dusty cotton and maize fields of Karnataka state.  Two hours’ drive from India’s software capital of
Bangalore, Infosys’s Global Education Centre, or GEC, is a $330
million  response  to the education deficit, putting about 20,000
graduate recruits through the 23-week residential course each
year to get them up to speed.  Car Ban  Students in crisp shirts and suits gather at the one of
seven food courts that can seat more than 3,500 people, or take
a campus bicycle from the nearby rack. Cars are banned from most
parts of the campus, the only other transport is a fleet of
electric golf carts.  Some head to the dorms, a chain of two-story buildings that
spells the company name in low-rise letters; or the recreation
center, with squash courts, bowling alley, swimming pool, and
aerobics studio. The laundromat, supermarket and medical center
are more Caltech than Karnataka.  Nearby, a geodesic dome houses three cinemas that screen
movies at the weekend. Inside, hundreds of new hires are filling
out salary forms, a reminder that this is a business, not a
philanthropic venture. Infosys spends about $6,000 per student,
equivalent to about $120 million or roughly 8 percent of its
$1.5 billion profit in the financial year ended March 2011.  Steve Jobs  The aspirations of the project are illustrated by the
classroom names in the glass and concrete education center --
Robert Noyce, John Pierpont Morgan,  Steve Jobs .  In one room, hunched over a terminal, 22-year-old Preety
Thakur is trying to figure out how to deal with a client request
for more information options in a software package, applying
skills she learnt in her morning class. It’s a world away from
her life in Baddi, a small industrial town in the mountains of
 Himachal Pradesh  in northern India.  “When I entered this campus, it was a dream come true,”
she said as colleagues around her rush to meet a deadline. “The
educators are world class. In college it was mostly theoretical.
Here there is a lot of emphasis on practical learning.”  Infosys is trying to instill the same application-based
learning in 450 state-run colleges through a program called
Campus Connect.  Like Infosys, ICICI responded to the shortage of qualified
graduates by running courses at four institutes including the
ICICI  Manipal  Academy for Banking and Insurance based near
Mangalore in Karnataka.  Boot Campus  “The classes that we conduct are very similar to working
in our bank,” Ramkumar said. “We start at about 8 a.m. and we
go to sleep by 11 p.m. Work ethics, value and organization’s
culture are drilled into people. I am proud to say that the
structure is modeled on how armed forces recruit their officers
like the Indian Military Academy, Westpoint and Sandhurst.”  Around 13 million students were enrolled in higher
education in India in 2008, the third-highest number after the
U.S. and China, according to a report in December by advisory
company KPMG.  Singh plans to double the enrolment ratio in the next eight
years by adding as many as 1,000 more universities. The
government accepted recommendations of the  National Knowledge
Commission  to boost higher education spending and periodically
revise the curricula.  “They have been promising to do it but it is already too
late -- we are in a crisis,” said T.V. Mohandas Pai, director
of Manipal Universal Learning, a private university and a former
director of human resources at Bangalore-based Infosys. “The
government’s mindset in education is one of control. The
students are not gaining adequate skills because investment is
not there and the curriculum is very dated.”  Talent Crunch  In a February survey of more than 1,000 Indian recruiters
by Naukri.com, a job search website, 61 percent said they face a
talent crunch while hiring. India does not allow private
colleges to earn a profit. The fee structure is regulated and
there are more than three government bodies that set the rules.  Narayanan Ramaswamy, head of education for KPMG in India,
said the country needs to streamline the rules and attract
foreign institutes to improve competition.  At present, foreign universities are banned from offering
degrees in India and legislation to allow them to set up
operations is pending in parliament. Some including  Kellogg
School  of Management and Wharton School, University of
Pennsylvania, have partnered with Indian colleges who issue a
local degree at the end of the course.  Wharton Way  “If there is a Wharton or others who come in and prove
that their teaching is good, then we will see discerning Indian
students heading to such institutes,” Ramaswamy said. “By not
having any quality institutes here, you are only promoting
mediocrity.”  The lack of skilled workers in India is a major growth
constraint for 51 percent of businesses, according to a report
released in January by Grant Thornton International Ltd., a
global consulting and accounting company. That’s compared with
an average of 38 percent in Asia-Pacific excluding  Japan .  Factory workers in India are almost four times less
productive than in Thailand and five times less productive than
in China, according to a  report  released last month by McKinsey
& Co.  “There is basic minimum that is expected and even that is
not happening in many cases,” said Ramaswamy. “If an engineer
cannot articulate his logic properly, why should I hire him?
Nearly 50 percent of students we are looking at are not worth
recruiting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
