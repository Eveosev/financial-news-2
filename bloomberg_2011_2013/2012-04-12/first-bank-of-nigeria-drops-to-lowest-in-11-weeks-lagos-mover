First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, dropped to its
lowest in more than 11 weeks on investor concern it hasn’t yet
released earnings, Lambeth Trust and Investment Co Limited said.  The stock fell 3.5 percent to close at 9.26 naira in Lagos,
the commercial capital, the lowest since Jan. 25.  “Investors are worried that First Bank has not released
its full-year result after other major banks released theirs,”
David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth,
said by phone today. “They feel the delay sends a signal that
all may not be well with the result.”  First Bank has filed its results with the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  and they will be released on April 17, Babatunde
Lasaki, a spokesman for the bank, said by phone today. “Nothing
is wrong with our result,” he said.  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria introduced December as a common
year-end for all the country’s lenders, as part of banking-
sectors reforms following a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 that
threatened the industry with collapse. The Nigerian Stock
Exchange gives companies listed on it 90 days from the end of
the period to release their results. Some of the lenders in
 Africa ’s most populous nation, including Zenith Bank Plc and
 Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , have since released their full-year
results.  First Bank shares have risen 4 percent this year, compared
with a 0.2 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
