French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
will meet  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin in the next few days to discuss the future of the
carmaker’s Aulnay plant.  At a meeting today with unions at the factory, Sarkozy said
he would meet Varin and arrange a three-way meeting with unions,
Industry Minister Eric Besson and Peugeot’s management next
week, Jean-Pierre Mercier, a representative for CGT union said
in a phone interview. No date has been set yet, he said.  Sarkozy, who faces the first round of presidential
elections on April 22, met with the three main unions at the
plant located north of Paris after Aulnay workers organized a
protest outside the president’s campaign headquarters.  Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a spokesman for Peugeot, declined to
comment.  Europe ’s second-largest carmaker said in September that
it will review the Aulnay factory because of a lack of
competitiveness. The plant employs about 3,300 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
