Mostostal Warszawa SA (MSW) , the Polish
unit of  Acciona SA (ANA) , won a 666.2 million-zloty ($209 million)
order from Szczecin to build a waste-to-energy project, the
northwestern Polish city said on its website yesterday.  Mostostal, which earlier this year won two Polish
incinerator orders from Krakow and Bydgoszcz, will sign the
contract on April 23 at the earliest, Szczecin said. The company
beat offers from  Vinci SA (DG) ,  Rafako SA (RFK)  and Integral Engineering
und Umwelttechnik GmbH.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
