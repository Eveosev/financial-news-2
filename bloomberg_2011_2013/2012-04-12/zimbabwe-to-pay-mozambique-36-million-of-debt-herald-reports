Zimbabwe will pay Mozambique’s
 Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa SA  $36 million this week to cut
its debt and restart power imports, the  Herald  reported, citing
Energy Minister Elton Mangoma and unidentified officials in
Zimbabwe’s power utility Zesa (Pvt) Ltd.  Zimbabwe isn’t able to clear its entire debt to the
Mozambican power generation company of $76 million because
consumers owe Zesa about $140 million, the Harare-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
