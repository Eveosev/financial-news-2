Former Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin will file a complaint in  Germany ’s
constitutional court against the European Stability Mechanism
and the region’s fiscal pact,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported,
citing an interview with the Social Democrat.  Both the euro area’s financial backstop and the fiscal
discipline accord violate the rights of the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament, the newspaper cited him as saying.  The justice minister under former Chancellor  Gerhard
Schroeder  will file the complaint after the ratification of the
ESM and the fiscal pact, scheduled for before the summer break
starting in July, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
