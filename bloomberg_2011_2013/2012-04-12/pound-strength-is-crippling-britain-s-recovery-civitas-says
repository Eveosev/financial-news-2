Britain’s  exchange rate  is
“crippling” the economic recovery, and devaluing the pound by
as much as 25 percent could push growth back to an annual 4
percent, research group Civitas said.  The pound’s “significant” drop since 2008 hasn’t been
enough to make U.K. exports competitive on world markets, and a
future decline in the currency is inevitable, according to John
Mills, the author of the Civitas  report published in London
today . A devaluation of as much as 15 percent would balance the
U.K.’s trade deficit, he said.  “The exchange-rate policy which we have pursued for
decades has made it much more expensive to run most
manufacturing operations here than in other parts of the
world,” Mills said. “Getting the exchange rate down is a
matter on which, in the end, we will have no choice.”  Data yesterday showed the U.K. trade deficit widened to the
most in three months in February as exports of cars and heavy
machinery fell, especially to the U.S.,  China  and  Russia .
British manufacturing has become less competitive as some Asian
countries devalued their currencies, boosting their
competitiveness and hurting the  U.K. economy,  Mills said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
