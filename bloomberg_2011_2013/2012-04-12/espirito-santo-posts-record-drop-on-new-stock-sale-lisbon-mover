Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest publicly traded bank, slumped the most in four months in
Lisbon trading after announcing a plan to sell as much as 1.01
billion euros ($1.3 billion) of new stock.  The shares  fell  almost 11 percent to 1.04 euros in the
Portuguese capital, giving the lender a market value of 1.53
billion euros.  Espirito Santo, based in Lisbon, said yesterday after the
close of trading that it will offer 2.56 billion shares to
existing shareholders at a subscription price of 39.5 cents
each. The stock price closed yesterday at 1.167 euros.  The rights offer will allow the bank to buy out its partner
in an insurance unit and to increase its core Tier 1  capital 
ratio to 10.75 percent from 9.21 percent. Espirito Santo said it
also agreed to buy 50 percent of the BES Vida insurance unit
from  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  for 225 million euros.  Holders of 50.6 percent of the bank’s stock have indicated
they intend to exercise their subscription rights in the capital
increase, according to the company. A group of investment banks
have agreed to seek subscribers or subscribe themselves to new
shares representing as much as 49.4 percent of the offering, the
lender said.  Espirito Santo Financial Group SA (ESF) , the parent company of
Banco Espirito Santo, said today it plans to raise as much as
400 million euros by selling new shares to strengthen its core
Tier 1 capital and to take part in the bank’s capital increase.
Its stock fell 1.2 percent to 5.14 euros in Lisbon.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , Portugal’s second-biggest
bank, fell 6.5 percent to 11.6 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
