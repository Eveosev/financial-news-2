Standard & Poorâ€™s  anticipates a 15
percent decline in French real-estate prices by the end of 2013,
 Le Figaro  reported, citing a report by the credit rating
company.  S&P based its estimates on a contraction in lending in
France, citing an earlier credit crunch from September 2007 to
March 2009 that led to a 10 percent drop in prices, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
