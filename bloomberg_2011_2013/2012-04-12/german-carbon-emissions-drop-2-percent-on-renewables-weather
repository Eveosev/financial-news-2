German greenhouse-gas emissions
fell 2.1 percent in 2011 over the previous year as milder
weather and more power from renewable-energy generators reduced
the need to burn fossil fuels, the government said.  Emissions of gases blamed for global warming, including
carbon dioxide, reached about 917 million metric tons in 2011,
down 26.5 percent from 1990 levels, government environment
agency Umweltbundesamt said today in a  website statement , citing
preliminary calculations.  “While the emissions reductions were benefited by
relatively mild weather, the growing share of renewable power
and lower power exports also led to lower emissions,” Jochen Flasbarth, the head of the agency, said in the statement.  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest economy, seeks to reduce its
greenhouse-gas emissions 40 percent from 1990 levels by the end
of this decade. Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in March 2011 ordered
the closure by 2022 of the country’s nuclear reactors, which
produce almost emission-free power, and replace them with more
renewable generators and efficient fossil fuel-fed plants.  The latest data, which includes a 2.4 percent drop in CO2
emissions to 799.7 million tons, shows that the German emissions
reduction targets can be reached “also with an accelerated
nuclear exit,” Flasbarth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
