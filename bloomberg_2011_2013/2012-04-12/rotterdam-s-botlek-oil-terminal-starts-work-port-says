The Botlek Tank Terminal, an oil-
storage facility in Rotterdam port that is a joint venture of
HES Beheer NV and  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , officially started
operations, the port said.  The terminal, built on the site of a former grain silo, has
capacity to store 200,000 cubic meters (52.8 million gallons) of
edible-oil and petroleum products, the Port of Rotterdam wrote
in a  statement  on its website today.  The first phase of the investment amounted to about 70
million euros ($92 million), and capacity will be expanded to
more than 700,000 cubic meters in a second phase, the port
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
