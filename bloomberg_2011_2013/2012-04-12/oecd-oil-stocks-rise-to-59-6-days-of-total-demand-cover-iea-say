Commercial oil inventories in
industrialized nations fell less than average in February, the
 International Energy Agency  said, boosting its estimate for
forward-demand cover.  Stockpile levels among members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development fell by 12.4 million
barrels, compared with a five-year average of 38.8 million, the
IEA said today in its monthly Oil Market Report.  “Firm global supply and rising OPEC exports, amid muted
refining activity, built OECD crude oil stocks,” the IEA said.  The agency raised its estimate for forward-demand cover,
which is calculated based on average daily consumption for the
next three months, according to its website. Forward-demand
cover rose to 59.6 days in February, up 1.2 days from the
previous month, the IEA said.  Crude holdings increased by 17 million barrels in February,
gaining 5.2 million barrels in  North America , 7.5 million
barrels in  Europe  and 4.3 million barrels in the Pacific, the
IEA said.  The number of days of forward cover is one indicator the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries looks at to assess
the balance of supply and demand in oil markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
