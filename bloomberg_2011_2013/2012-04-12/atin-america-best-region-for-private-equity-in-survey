Institutional investors expect
Latin America excluding  Brazil  to be the most attractive region
for private-equity deals over the next year, according to a
survey by the  Emerging Markets  Private Equity Association.  The region climbed from fourth place a year ago, while
Brazil, the top market in the 2011 survey, fell to second.  China 
and emerging  Asia  were third and fourth. Empea surveyed 106
institutional investors between December 2011 and February 2012.  “There has been a significant amount of capital going into
Brazil over the last 24 months and less going into other markets
in Latin America,” said Sarah Alexander, chief executive
officer of Empea. “This implies this area is almost virgin
territory for deal-making,” she added.  The survey found that 54 percent of investors plan to
expand or begin investment in  Latin America , excluding Brazil.
Southeast Asia came close behind with 53 percent planning to
expand or begin investments in the region.  In contrast, Central and Eastern Europe was ranked by
institutional investors as the least attractive region for
private equity deals. The region may see some impact from the
sovereign-debt crisis, said Alexander.  The survey found that global market volatility had little
to no impact on investors’ plans to increase their commitments
to emerging markets. Three-quarters expect their commitments to
emerging markets to increase over the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
