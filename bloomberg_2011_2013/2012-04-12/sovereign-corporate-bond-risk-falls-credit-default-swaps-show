The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell 2.5 basis points to 271.5
at 8 a.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 14 basis
points to 660, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings fell 2.75 basis points to 140.25 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell seven basis points to 240 and the
subordinated index declined 10 to 388.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
