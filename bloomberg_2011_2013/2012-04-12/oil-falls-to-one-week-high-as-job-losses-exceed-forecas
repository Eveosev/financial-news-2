Oil rose to its highest price in a
week in  New York  after gasoline stockpiles declined more than
forecast in the U.S., the world’s biggest user of the fuel.  Futures climbed as much as 0.7 percent. U.S. gasoline
inventories fell  4.3 million barrels , the Energy Department said
yesterday. Supplies were projected to drop 1.38 million barrels
in a Bloomberg News survey. The decrease countered figures that
showed imports and  demand  for the motor fuel fell. Oil markets
are better-supplied for the first time since 2009, the
 International Energy Agency  said today.  “There is demand out there,”  Robert Montefusco , senior
broker at Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, said in an interview
with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television. The economic
outlook “is improving but we’re getting contradictory
signals.”  Crude for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose as much as 67 cents to $103.37, the highest price since
April 5, and was at $103.16 a barrel at 1:05 p.m. London time.
Prices are up 4.4 percent this year.  Brent oil for May settlement slipped 19 cents to $119.99 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract’s  premium  to New York-traded West
Texas Intermediate narrowed to $16.84 from $17.48 yesterday.  Gasoline Demand  Refinery utilization  fell 1.9 percentage points to 83.8
percent of capacity last week, according to the Energy
Department. That’s the biggest drop since the period ended Feb.
24. Motor-gasoline products supplied, a proxy for demand, shrank
102,000 barrels a day and  imports  slid 180,000 barrels a day.  Prices at the pump may have peaked for the year. Regular
gasoline, averaged nationwide, declined for a fifth day to
 $3.915 a gallon  on April 10 after surging 20 percent and
reaching $3.936 on April 4, according to data from AAA, the
biggest U.S. motoring club. Americans have purchased 5.3 percent
less gasoline so far this year than in 2011, data from credit-
card receipts analyzed by  MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s SpendingPulse showed
on April 10.  U.S. distillate inventories, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, declined  4 million barrels , the Energy
Department report showed. They were forecast to slip 250,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in the
Bloomberg survey. Crude stockpiles rose 2.8 million barrels
compared with a projected increase of 2 million.  Sluggish Demand  Oil markets are better-supplied as “sluggish” demand and
OPEC output at more than a three-year peak eased inventory
depletion, the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly Oil Market
Report today. Global oil inventories may have increased by more
than 1 million barrels in the first quarter.  “The cycle of repeatedly tightening fundamentals evident
since 2009 has been broken for now,” said the IEA, which
advises 28 nations on  energy policy . “The earlier tide of
remorseless market tightening looks to have turned.”  Oil prices  have gained this year on concern that tension
with  Iran  will disrupt global supplies.  France  remains “open”
to the possibility of a release of crude stockpiles by IEA
member countries to keep prices in check, Industry Minister Eric Besson said yesterday.  Crude’s advance in New York created a so-called bullish
engulfing pattern on the candlestick chart, signaling increased
buying, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also
settled above the 100-day moving average, which represents
technical support today at $101.63 a barrel.  Natural gas futures in New York closed below $2 per million
British thermal units yesterday for the first time in a decade
on a growing supply glut caused by mild weather and record
production. Prices for May delivery slid 2.3 percent to $1.984
per million British thermal units on the Nymex yesterday, the
lowest settlement price since Jan. 28, 2002. They fell as low as
$1.976 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
