European Union Climate Commissioner
 Connie Hedegaard  said she’s pushing Qatar to adopt a green
growth program before it hosts the annual round of United
Nations climate treaty talks in November.  Qatar, the first member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to host the discussions aimed at limiting
global warming, illustrates the scale of the challenge the world
faces to cut greenhouse gases, Hedegaard said today in a phone
interview. She spoke from Doha after meeting Qatar’s Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah.  “When you drive through the city of Doha at night, you
just think, ‘Wow, look how big our challenges are when we’re
talking about more  energy efficiency , less energy consumption
and a low-carbon world,’” Hedegaard said. “The bright lights
are all over. It would send a strong signal if  Qatar  came
forward with concrete proposals on how they will pursue a more
climate-friendly growth strategy.”  Qatar is the world’s largest emitter per capita of carbon
dioxide and will host two weeks of meetings that start Nov. 26
in Doha. The nation is the world’s biggest producer of liquefied
natural gas, and oil and gas accounted for 58 percent of the
country’s economic output in 2011.  “You have these tall, tall skyscrapers, and there are
lights literally in every window because why turn off the lights
when energy is for free,” Hedegaard said.  Durban Agenda  At the last round of discussions in Durban,  South Africa ,
delegates agreed to devise by the end of 2015 a new climate deal
that would set legal targets to limit  greenhouse gases  for
almost 200 nations and enter into force in 2020 at the latest.  Priorities for this year’s discussions include how to
reduce the “ambition gap” in emissions reductions between now
and 2020, Hedegaard said. The UN Environment Program in November
said that current pledges to reduce greenhouse gases by 2020
need to double in order to keep the planet on a trajectory that
limits warming since industrialization to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit).  The 27-nation EU will include its longstanding goal of a
20-percent reduction in greenhouse gases in the 30 years through
2020 as its pledge in an eight-year second commitment period
under the the existing climate treaty, the  Kyoto Protocol ,
Hedegaard said. The EU also maintains its willingness to cut by
30 percent if other nations follow, she said. The first
commitment period, lasting five years, ends this year.  Aviation and Shipping  “It’s important to have this discussion about increasing
the numbers, but parallel to that there is also another way:
simply to look at specific issues,” Hedegaard said. “Could we
do something with aviation and shipping? Could we do something
with other sorts of gases?”  Another priority for Doha is to ensure funds for emission-
cutting programs and defenses against the effects of  climate
change  in developing nations don’t dry up in 2013, Hedegaard
said. A three-year period of “fast-start” climate aid ends in
2012, and developed nations must begin ramping up to the $100
billion of annual climate aid they’ve pledged by 2020, she said.
In Durban, nations set up a Green Climate Fund to channel part
of that aid, and this year are working to get it up and running.  “I’m absolutely confident there will be money in the fund
next year because there have already been European member states
who have said they will put the funds in,” Hedegaard said. “If
the world community is going to deliver what they agreed in
Copenhagen (in 2009) to have reached not less than $100 billion
by 2020, then it’s clear substantial money has to come in
2013.”  Meeting Ministers  As well as meeting Al-Attiyah, who will preside over of the
climate discussions in November and December, Hedegaard spoke
with Qatari Environment Minister Abdulla bin Mubarak Al Madadi,
according to her office.  “I have stressed in my conversations here the importance
of a presidency showing willingness to pursue a more green kind
of growth, a climate-friendly kind of growth,” Hedegaard said.  The commissioner said that while she had toured a research
institute in Doha that was examining issues of climate, food and
water security, the government should aim to “come forward with
a more coherent strategy as to how they will embrace the
challenges of the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
