TNK-BP, which has halted its  Linik (TLNICRUD) 
oil refinery in Ukraine indefinitely, plans to use fuel imports
for its retail stations in the country.  The company’s 160 retail outlets will make up the main part
of its business in Ukraine,  German Khan , TNK-BP’s executive
director, told reporters today in Kiev.  TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-largest crude producer, is cutting
half of its staff in Ukraine after the operations lost money in
the last two years, according to an April 9 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
