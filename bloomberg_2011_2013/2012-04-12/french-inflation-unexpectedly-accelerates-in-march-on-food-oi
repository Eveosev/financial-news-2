France ’s inflation rate
unexpectedly rose in March as higher food and energy prices
countered a stagnant economic growth.  Consumer prices  rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, compared with a 2.5 percent
increase in February, the Paris-based national statistics
office, Insee, said today. Economists forecast a 2.3 percent
gain, the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  The higher inflation rate came in the face of a slowing
economy and  joblessness  that has reached its highest level in 12
years in part because prices for food and energy continue to
climb. Food prices were up 3.7 percent, while energy prices
gained 6.5 percent.  “Energy got more expensive in March, lifted by the higher
oil price,” Insee said today. “Food prices are up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
