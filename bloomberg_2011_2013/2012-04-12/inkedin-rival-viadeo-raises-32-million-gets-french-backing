Viadeo, the second-biggest social
network for professionals after  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , raised $32
million from a pool of investors, including $13 million from the
French sovereign fund, FSI.  Other investors include Allianz SE and Jefferies Group Inc,
as well as Viadeo’s existing shareholders Idinvest and Ventech
and Middle Eastern private funds which were not named. The money
will be used to finance business in the  emerging markets , Viadeo
said today in a statement.  “We needed an investor that could stay with us for the
long run, so we went to the FSI in October,” Viadeo founder Dan Serfaty said in an interview. “The FSI is really filling a gap.
They’re the only ones in France that can provide financing of
that size.”  Viadeo has no plans to list its shares on the stock market,
Serfaty said.  LinkedIn, based in  Mountain View ,  California , raised $352.8
million in an initial public offering on the New York Stock
Exchange in May.  With 45 million registered members, Viadeo is second to
LinkedIn, which has 150 million members according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
