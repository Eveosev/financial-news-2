Zimbabweans in  South Africa  send as
much as 6.8 billion rand ($860 million) back to their home
country each year, said People Against Suffering, Oppression and
Poverty, a civil society group.  Between 70 percent and 80 percent of the remittances are
sent to Zimbabwe through “informal channels,” such as friends
or transport operators, the Cape Town-based group, known as
Passop, said in a statement dated April 10, on its  website .
Based on a survey of 350 migrants, about 90 percent of
Zimbabweans living in neighboring South Africa send money home
regularly, the group said.  As many as two million Zimbabweans are estimated to live in
South Africa, according to Passop, most of them having left
their country because of political violence and a decade-long
recession that ended in 2009. President  Robert Mugabe ’s  Zimbabwe 
African National Union-Patriotic Front and the Movement for
Democratic Change formed a power-sharing government after a
disputed 2008 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
