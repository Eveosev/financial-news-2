President Narayana Kocherlakota said he expects U.S. inflation
to rise above the central bank’s 2 percent target next year,
contributing to a need for tightening in central bank policy.  “The outlook for the  unemployment rate  has improved, and
the outlook for inflation has risen,” Kocherlakota said today
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. His comments repeated those made
in a speech April 10. “Recent accommodative steps will lead to
both core and headline inflation being above 2 percent in
2013,” he said.  Policy makers are confronting mixed signals about the
economic recovery. Kocherlakota’s view that higher rates may be
warranted as early as this year is at odds with Fed Vice
Chairman  Janet Yellen , who said yesterday that borrowing costs
are likely to stay low through 2014.  “My own belief is that we will need to initiate our
somewhat lengthy exit strategy sometime in the next six to nine
months or so, and that conditions will warrant raising rates
sometime in 2013 or, possibly, late 2012,” Kocherlakota said.  Kocherlakota, 48, will vote on the policy-setting FOMC in
2014. Last year, in his first rotation as a voting member, he
dissented from two FOMC decisions to boost monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
