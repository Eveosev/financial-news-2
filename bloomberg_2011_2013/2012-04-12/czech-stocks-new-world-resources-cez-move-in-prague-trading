The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
was little changed at 940.00 at the close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
0.6 percent to 788.9 koruna. A report today showed industrial
output in the euro area, where CEZ exports part of its output,
unexpectedly increased in February, driven by a weather-related
surge in energy output.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   rose 3.2 percent to 130.5
koruna, the steepest jump since March 26. The biggest Czech
producer of coking coal was upgraded to buy from underperform at
Bank of America Corp., which said rising prices of the commodity
may boost NWR’s earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
