The  European Central Bank  said it
has “serious concerns” about the independence of the Hungarian
monetary-policy authority even after the government amended
legislation to meet conditions to start bailout talks.  “The ECB reiterates its observations” that “constant
changes in the composition of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s
decision-making bodies” give rise to “serious concerns whether
this could be used to influence the decision-making process to
the detriment of central bank independence,” the ECB said in a
 legal opinion  on a draft law amending central bank legislation,
dated April 5.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive, on March 7
took a formal step toward seeking a court order to require
Hungary to redraft laws on the judiciary and the data-protection
agency and asked for more information on planned changes to a
new central bank law within one month. It may take as long as
seven weeks to assess Hungary’s response, the European Union
said today.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , who’s battling to avert a
recession, asked the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  for
a bailout in November as the forint fell to a record low and the
country’s credit rating was cut to junk. Talks have yet to start
as Hungary has failed to show that independent institutions such
as the central bank are free of government influence.  The ECB “strongly recommends not deleting” an article
establishing that the central bank governor, his deputies and
other members of the Monetary Council “may be dismissed only if
they no longer fulfill the conditions required for the
performance of their duties or have been guilty of serious
misconduct,” according to the document.  “Neither the Fundamental Law nor the Law on the MNB would
specify whether the Parliament or  Hungary ’s President are
empowered to dismiss the Monetary Council member,” the ECB
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
