Iran  cut the premium on its light
and heavy grades sold to  Asia  in May, according to a company
official, mirroring  Saudi Arabia â€™s price changes last week.  National Iranian Oil Co. priced its  light  crude at a
premium of $2.66 a barrel to the monthly average of regional
benchmarks Dubai and Oman, said the official, who declined to be
identified because of company policy. The premium is down 35
cents from April.  Iranian  Heavy (AOSPHVAS)  and  Forozan (AOSPFNAS)  Blend were both cut by 10 cents
to premiums of 79 cents a barrel and 97 cents a barrel,
respectively. The following table gives differentials of Iranian
crude supplied to Asia. Prices are in U.S. dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
