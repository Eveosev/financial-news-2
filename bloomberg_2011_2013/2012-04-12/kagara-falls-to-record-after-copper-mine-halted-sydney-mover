Kagara Ltd. (KZL) , an Australian base-
metal mining company, tumbled to its lowest on record in Sydney
trading after suspending a mine in the northeastern state of
Queensland to cut costs.  The stock fell 14 percent to 12 Australian cents today, the
lowest close since the Perth-based company went public in
December 1999.  Kagara, which had a loss of A$48.9 million ($51 million) in
the six months ended Dec. 31, suspended the Baal Gammon copper
mine in Queensland, according to a company statement today. The
move follows an announcement last month to halt an underground
mine and exploration activities in the state after lowering its
zinc and copper output target for the year. Kagara also sold its
nickel assets to  Western Areas NL (WSA)  for A$68 million in March.  “Kagara continues to review business operations and focus
on core producing assets,” according to today’s statement.
“This includes a restructure of its banking arrangements which
have impacted Kagara’s short-term  cash flow . As a result of this
tightening of cash flow, mining operations at Baal Gammon have
been suspended.”  The stock has declined 53 percent this year and is the
second-worst performer on the  S&P/ASX 300 (AS52)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
