Reddy Ice Holdings Inc. (RDDY) , the maker
and distributor of about 1.8 million tons of ice a year, said it
would seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors.  The Dallas-based firm said today it reached agreements with
debt holders for a Chapter 11 reorganization to give second-lien
noteholders new stock, while current shareholders will receive
as much as 17 cents a share.  The reorganization is supported by holders of 60 percent of
the first-lien debt, 58 percent of the second-lien debt, and 92
percent of the discount notes. Noteholders will complete voting
on the plan by May 8. Reddy Ice expects to emerge from
reorganization within 45 days after the Chapter 11 petition is
filed.  Reddy Ice filed financial statements today showing a $69.5
million net loss in 2011 on revenue of $328.5 million. The
company cited assets of $434 million and debt totaling $530.8
million.  The company traces its history to the early 1900s, and
sells ice in 34 states and the  District of Columbia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
