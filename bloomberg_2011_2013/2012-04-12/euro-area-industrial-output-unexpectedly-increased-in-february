European  industrial production 
unexpectedly rose in February, led by  France  and the
Netherlands, adding to signs of economic stabilization after a
fourth-quarter contraction.  Production in the 17-nation euro area increased 0.5 percent
from January, when it remained unchanged, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a drop of 0.2 percent, the median of 23 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News (EUITEMUM)  survey showed. From a year earlier, production
decreased 1.8 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  on April 4
noted a “low-level”  economic stabilization  in the euro area
and said the region’s economy should “recover gradually” this
year. The European Commission forecasts a 0.3 percent
contraction in 2012.  A 0.2 percent drop in industrial output in Germany,
Europe’s largest economy, was offset by a 0.2 percent increase
in France and a 13 percent jump in the Netherlands, according to
today’s report. Spanish production fell 0.5 percent. No data
were available for Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
