Turkey may call on fellow NATO
members to reinforce its border with Syria if violations persist
and the United Nations  Security Council  fails to take action,
Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said, according to Sabah.  Shots were fired across the Turkish border in the past week
at refugees who were attempting to escape from Syria. NATO’s
statutes treat an attack on one member as an attack on the whole
alliance, requiring a collective response. Turkey may invoke
those rights if there’s no improvement in the situation, Erdogan
told reporters during a visit to China, Sabah said.  Turkey pressed China to reverse its stance on Syria at the
Security Council, where it twice vetoed calls for the departure
of President Bashar al-Assad, Erdogan said, according to Sabah.
Turkey will step up talks with Russia, which also blocked the
measures, and the prime minister will travel to  Saudi Arabia 
today to discuss developments, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
