Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center, fell
6.4 percent, the biggest weekly decline this year, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped 1.41 million barrels in
the seven days to yesterday to 20.7 million,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement. Supplies
were the lowest in eight weeks.  Middle-distillate (SPIVMDIS)  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 1.04 million barrels, or 10.4 percent, to
11 million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the highest in
three weeks.  Supplies of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were up 5,000 barrels at 10.8 million, a five-week
high, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
