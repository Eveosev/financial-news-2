The high temperature in  Washington 
may reach 90 degrees next week for the first time this year as
warm weather moves across the mid-Atlantic region, according to
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Washington may peak at 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius)
on April 16, said Rogers, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland.  “Temperatures should surge into the upper 80s and low 90s
for this event, but it should not have the typical humidity
levels of equivalent summer temperatures,” he said.  Commodities traders watch temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Other forecasts aren’t predicting such high temperatures.
The  National Weather Service  said Washington may reach 83 on
April 15 and 84 on April 16, while MDA EarthSat Weather said
temperatures may be 87 and 88 on those days.  As the week wears on, the weather may moderate. Rogers said
average temperatures in the mid-Atlantic region will be about 5
degrees above normal from April 17 to April 21.  MDA said southern California and the U.S. Southwest will be
5 to 7 degrees above normal while the central part of the
country will remain seasonal during the same time frame.  The normal average temperature for April 19 in  New York  is
about 54, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 50 in
Boston, 51 in Chicago, 59 in  St. Louis , 63 in Atlanta, 64 in
Dallas, 70 in Houston, 51 in Seattle and 62 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
