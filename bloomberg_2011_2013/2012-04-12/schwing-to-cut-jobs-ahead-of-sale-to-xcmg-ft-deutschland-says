Schwing GmbH, a German maker of
construction machinery, is cutting more than a fifth of jobs at
its headquarters in Herne ahead of the company’s sale,  Financial
Times Deutschland  said, citing Eva Kerkemeier of the IG Metall
union.  The elimination of 170 jobs from 800 in Herne was probably
a pre-condition to the sale, Kerkemeier said, according to the
German newspaper.  China ’s  XCMG Construction Machinery Co. (000425)  has
agreed to buy Schwing, FTD said, citing unidentified people from
the financial industry and the manufacturer.  Workers will get 600 euros ($788) per year they were
employed by the company, FTD said  To contact the reporter on this story:
