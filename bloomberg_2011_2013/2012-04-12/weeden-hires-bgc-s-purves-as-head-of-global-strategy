Weeden & Co. has hired Michael Purves as chief global strategist and head of equity derivatives
research to help build the brokerage’s options business.  Purves joins the Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm from  BGC
Partners Inc. (BGCP)  where he held a similar role. He was part of a
group of traders who left Pali Capital Inc. in December 2009
together with  Richard Anthony  to join BGC Partners in New York.  “I will continue my work here on macro conditions,
precious metals, and selected single stocks,” Purves wrote
today in an e-mail to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
