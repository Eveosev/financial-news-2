Greece  moved closer to concluding
the biggest debt restructuring in history by exchanging 20.3
billion euros ($26.7 billion) of bonds issued under foreign law
for new securities.  Together with the domestic-law bonds dealt with a month
ago, it means that Greece has re-organized 198.6 billion euros
of debt, according to a statement on the Finance Ministry
 website . That’s about 96.6 percent of the 205.5 billion euros of
notes eligible for restructuring, the government said.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  called elections yesterday,
stating that his interim government had completed its tasks of
carrying out the sovereign debt exchange and securing a 130
billion-euro rescue package designed to stop the economy
collapsing. In March, Greece forced holders of sovereign notes
issued under domestic law to accept a 53.5 percent cut in the
face value of the bonds, wiping about 100 billion euros off what
the nation owes.  Greece warned foreign-law holdouts, too, that it will press
for debt relief on the remaining securities “in due course.”
It extended the deadline for responses to April 20, after which
certain sweeteners will no longer be available, according to the
Finance Ministry statement, dated yesterday.  Investors in seven series of bonds where negotiations were
adjourned have until April 13 to respond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
