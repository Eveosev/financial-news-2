Scangroup Ltd. (SCAN) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest marketing company by sales, rose to the highest in
almost 11 months on bets it will announce higher full-year
earnings next week.  Scangroup shares advanced 2.9 percent to 53.50 shillings,
the highest level since May 25 last year, as of 12:49 p.m. in
Nairobi, gaining for a second day.  “Buoyed by strong full-year 2011 earnings expectations
ahead of the company’s results announcement on 18th April
2012, Scangroup may see increased demand from both local and
foreign investors,” Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said today
in an e-mailed note to clients.  Scangroup was rated hold in new coverage by Dyer & Blair
Investment Bank on April 3. The Nairobi-based bank set a 12-
month price target of 61.4 shillings.  “The main reason supporting the share price is
expectations of profit growth,” John Kamunya, an analyst at
Dyer and Blair, said in a phone interview today. “I expect
between 40 percent to 50 percent growth in profit after tax.”  The company made several acquisitions last year and sales
are expected to jump after Scangroup clients performed well and
increased their expenditure, Kamunya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
