U.K. gilts fell for a second day
after demand declined at an auction of 20-year bonds as
investors sought higher-yielding alternatives.  The pound strengthened against the dollar and the yen as
stocks advanced around the world after central bankers in the
U.S. and  Japan  said they were considering additional stimulus
measures. The 2 billion pound ($3.19 billion) sale of 20-year
bonds attracted bids for 1.39 times the amount offered, down
from 1.63 times at the previous auction last month.  “There’s limited demand at these low yields,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“The yield is close to recent lows. There’s obviously a bit of
a risk-on” trade and that is reducing demand for the safety of
gilts, she said.  The yield on the  benchmark  10-year gilt rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.09 percent at 4:05 p.m.
London time. The 4 percent bond due in March 2022 dropped 0.385,
or 3.85 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 116.985. The
yield declined to 2.01 percent on April 10, the lowest level
since Feb. 28.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen yesterday
endorsed the central bank’s view that borrowing costs are likely
to stay low through 2014. Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said today he also supports the policy.  Bank of Japan 
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in  Tokyo  that policy makers will
“pursue powerful easing” to help overcome deflation.  Annual Loss  U.K. gilts has handed investors a 0.5 percent loss this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S.
Treasuries fell 0.4 percent, while German bunds rose 0.9
percent, the gauges show.  The yield on the 4.25 percent bonds due in June 2032, which
were auctioned today, rose four basis points to 3.05 percent.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index of stocks advanced 1.6 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.1 percent.  The pound advanced for a second day versus the dollar,
gaining 0.3 percent to $1.5951, and rose 0.4 percent to 129.14
yen. Sterling dropped 0.2 percent 82.60 pence per euro.  The euro may decline to the lowest in almost two years
against the pound, after failing to rise above a key level of
resistance, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  Europe ’s shared currency is poised to decline to 81.41
pence over the next month after being unable to strengthen above
82.87 pence this week, Steve Miley, London-based head of
foreign-exchange technical analysis, wrote in a note today.  An “inability to push above here highlights inherent
market weakness,” Miley wrote. “With the 21-day moving average
at 83.12 pence bearing down, the risks into April are firmly
seen lower.” Resistance refers to an area where sell order may
be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
