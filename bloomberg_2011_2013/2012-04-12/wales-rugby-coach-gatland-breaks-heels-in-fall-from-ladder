Wales  rugby coach Warren Gatland
will undergo surgery after breaking both of his heels in a fall
from a ladder, the Welsh Rugby Union said on its website.  Gatland lost his balance and fell about 10 feet while
cleaning windows at his family beach house in his native New
Zealand three days ago, the WRU said. His legs are currently in
casts and he’ll have the surgery to reconstruct his right heel.  The injuries are not expected to have a major impact on
Wales’s preparations for its international tour of Australia in
June, the  WRU said .  “I have spoken to Warren on a number of occasions since
his fall and have told him he will lead the tour to  Australia 
unless anything unforeseen happens in the prognosis of recover
we are working to,” WRU Chief Executive Officer Roger Lewis
said.  Gatland led Wales to a Grand Slam victory in this year’s
Six Nations championship. Wales plays the Barbarians, an
invitational team, on June 2 before travelling to Australia for
three Tests against its national team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
