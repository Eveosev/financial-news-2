Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said the Fed should hold the main
 interest rate  near zero through 2014, while voicing concern more
central bank bond-buying would spark anxieties about inflation.  “I haven’t seen any set of information that should suggest
to me we should change that view,” Dudley said today, referring
to the Fed’s outlook for keeping interest rates close to zero at
least through late 2014.  A new round of asset purchases by the central bank, known
as quantitative easing, may “create more anxiety on the part of
some that it would lead to future inflation,” Dudley said in
response to audience questions after a speech in Syracuse, New
York. “It’s not free to do another round of quantitative
easing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
