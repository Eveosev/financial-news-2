Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  rose to the
highest in two weeks after  Barclays Capital  rated the stock
overweight, the equivalent of buy, in new coverage due to
improving profitability after a decade of underperformance.  Shares in  South Africa ’s fourth-largest bank jumped as much
as 1.2 percent to 169.71 rand and closed up 0.9 percent at
169.15 rand in Johannesburg, the highest since March 29.  Nedbank’s  return on equity  averaged 18 percent between 2005
and 2011, compared with 22 percent for the sector, Barclays
Capital analyst Richard Ladbrook said in a research note. Net
income for the year through December rose 26 percent to 6.5
billion rand ($820 million) as it expanded its retail banking
network and charged clients more for transactions, raising its
ROE to 15.3 percent from 13.4 percent, the lender said Feb. 29.
The bank is targeting a return on equity of 18 percent to 19
percent, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said at the time.  “Nedbank’s historically lower ROE was largely a function
of below-peer, post-risk returns on advances and lower levels of
non-interest revenue,” Barclays Capital analyst Richard Ladbrook said in a research note. “We expect Nedbank to reach
towards the sector average ROE of 20 percent in 2014, mostly
driven by anticipated continued success in the retail banking
turnaround.”  Ladbrook has a price estimate of 211.72 rand for Nedbank.
He recommends investors buy  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest banking group, with a 29.87 rand price estimate
for the stock, and sell  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s
largest lender. Shares of FirstRand gained 0.8 percent to 23.90
rand.  Standard Bank  declined 0.7 percent to 111.15 rand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
