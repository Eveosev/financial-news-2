  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s costs for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson’s personal
use of company-owned aircraft increased sixfold in 2011,
according to a U.S. regulatory filing.  Tillerson’s personal use of company planes cost $197,323
last year, compared with $29,409 in 2010, Irving, Texas-based
Exxon said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. The expense was included in executive compensation
disclosures that showed Tillerson’s total compensation rose 17
percent to $34.9 million in 2011, including stock awards and
deferred compensation.  The increase in costs associated with Tillerson’s personal
use of company planes stemmed in part from escalating fuel prices
and maintenance expenses, as well as more trips,  Alan Jeffers ,
an Exxon spokesman, said today in a telephone interview.  “For security reasons, the board requires the chairman and
CEO to use company aircraft for both personal and business
travel,” Exxon said in the filing. The board “considers these
costs to be necessary, security-related expenses rather than
perquisites, but per the disclosure regulations we report the
incremental cost of aircraft usage for personal travel.”  Exxon rose 16 percent in  New York  last year as civil
conflicts in North Africa and the  Middle East  helped push Brent
crude prices to a full-year average above $110 a barrel. Profit
for 2011 jumped 35 percent to $41.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
