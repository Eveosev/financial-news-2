President Narayana Kocherlakota said European governments making
“headway” in closing budget gaps have reduced the probability
of another flare-up in the region’s debt crisis.  “Conditions are certainly better than they were at the end
of last year,” Kocherlakota said today in response to questions
after a speech in White Bear Lake,  Minnesota . “We’re in a much
better place than we were six months ago.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
