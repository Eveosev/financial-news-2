The ruble strengthened to the
highest level in a week, gaining for a second day, after the
prices for oil,  Russia ’s biggest export, rose on a report
showing U.S. fuel stockpiles declined more than expected.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 29.444 per
dollar at the close in Moscow, its strongest closing level since
April 3, after rising 0.4 percent yesterday. The yield on
Russia’s 119 billion rubles ($4 billion) of local OFZ bonds due
2021 slipped one basis point to 7.97 percent.  Crude futures rose 1.1 percent to $103.82 a barrel in  New
York  after a 1.7 percent jump yesterday as U.S. gasoline
inventories retreated 4.3 million barrels, more than the 1.38
million-barrel drop projected by a Bloomberg News survey.  The ruble advanced 0.2 percent to 38.79 per euro and
strengthened 0.4 percent to 33.6497 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency
depreciating, with non-deliverable forwards projecting the ruble
at 29.827 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 30.0588 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
