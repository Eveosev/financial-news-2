Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced the
most in five weeks after the central bank held its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low and predicted inflation will
remain manageable. Bonds fell.  Bank Indonesia  held its reference rate at 5.75 percent
today, as forecast by all 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The monetary authority predicted that consumer-price gains will
be within 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent in 2013.  “Aside from maintaining rates, Bank Indonesia also said
they are confident future inflation will be manageable, which
helps the rupiah strengthen,” said Wiling Bolung, head of
treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.  The rupiah rose 0.5 percent to 9,163 per dollar as of 4:45
p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain since March 7, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
reached 9,208 after an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off Aceh
province yesterday, the weakest level since March 23.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 6.75 percent for
a sixth day.  The rupiah, the worst performer of 2012 among the 10 most-
traded Asian currencies excluding the yen, weakened this year
because of dollar demand from importers and concerns about a
global economic slowdown and faster domestic inflation, the
central bank said today, adding it has intervened in the
foreign-exchange and bond markets to stabilize the currency.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6
percent, the highest level since March 16, according to closing
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
