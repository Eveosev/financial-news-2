Sugar traders are bearish for a
seventh consecutive week, the longest stretch since at least
2007, on prospects for the first supply glut in four years.  Sixteen of 22 analysts expect raw-sugar prices to decline
next week and one was neutral, according to Bloomberg’s weekly
sentiment survey that began in April 2007. Global production
will exceed demand by 10 million metric tons in the 12 months
ending in September, equal to about a year of U.S. consumption,
according to Singapore-based Olam International Ltd., which
trades and processes commodities in 65 countries.  Prices that surged to a 30-year high in February last year
spurred farmers to plant more cane and beet, expanding global
production to a record this season. Futures traded in New York
slumped 9.9 percent in the past three weeks on mounting concern
about another glut next season.  Thailand , the world’s second-
biggest exporter, may ship the most supply ever this year, the
country’s Office of the Cane & Sugar Board said on April 11.  “We have a surplus this year and it looks like we will
have another one next year and that is more bearish than we
initially thought,” said John Stansfield, a senior analyst at
Olam in London. “The last time the glut for two consecutive
years was so big, prices were significantly lower.”  Erases Gains  Sugar’s retreat in the past three weeks to 23.08 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. means it’s little changed this year
and left futures 36 percent lower than the three-decade high of
36.08 cents reached in 2011. Prices averaged 11.16 cents from
October 2006 to September 2008, the last time there was two
consecutive annual supply gluts. Production  costs  have risen
since then, setting a higher floor for prices, Stansfield said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose 5.9
percent this year compared with an 8.1 percent increase in the
MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities. Treasuries lost 0.4
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Global production will advance 4.2 percent to 168.2 million
tons this year, compared with a 2.1 percent gain in consumption
to 160 million tons, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates. Olam anticipates a surplus of 7 million tons in the
next season. The 10 million-ton surplus for 2011-12 would be the
first in four years and is up from a February forecast of 9
million tons, Stansfield said.  Production in  India , the second-biggest producer after
 Brazil , climbed 13 percent to 23.2 million tons in the six
months ended March 31, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said
April 3. Thai shipments may rise 20 percent to 8 million tons in
2012, the Office of the Cane & Sugar Board’s Secretary General
Prasert Tapaneeyangkul said in an interview.  Trading Commission  Hedge funds  and other speculators cut their  bets  on higher
prices by 12 percent in the week ended April 3 and now hold
118,339 U.S. futures and options, data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show. The net-long position was
143,577 contracts on Feb. 28, the most since August.  Production in Brazil, the world’s biggest grower, was
damaged last year by dry weather and frost, driving prices up 56
percent from May to July. The center south of Brazil, which
accounts for about 90 percent of the country’s production, was
forecast in March last year to have record cane production of
568.5 million tons by industry group Unica. Output was actually
493.3 million tons. Unica yesterday forecast this year’s harvest
in the center south at 509 million tons.  Sugar for May delivery on ICE Futures U.S. is trading at a
3.3 percent premium to the July contract, compared with as
little as 1 percent three months ago, an indication that traders
are still concerned about near-term supply.  Sugar Consumption  “The premium May raw-sugar futures command over July
suggests that supplies are tight for now ahead of the start of
the center south Brazil crop,” said Peter de Klerk, an analyst
in  London  at Czarnikow Group Ltd., which traded sugar in more
than 90 countries last year.  Sugar consumption rose every year since 1994, USDA data
show. Demand will be a record 167.8 million tons this season,
according to the  International Sugar Organization , whose members
include 86 countries. Declining prices and economic growth will
drive buying, said Leonardo Bichara Rocha, a senior economist at
the ISO in London. The  International Monetary Fund  anticipates a
3.3 percent expansion in the global economy this year.  Prices will average 22 cents this quarter and the next and
21 cents in the final three months of the year, 9 percent less
than now, Deutsche Bank AG estimates. That compares with a five-
year average of 18.6 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Annual Advance  In other commodities, 19 of 26 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect gold to gain next week. Futures on
the Comex in  New York  increased 6.4 percent to $1,667.50 an
ounce this year, set for a 12th consecutive annual advance.  Twelve of 28 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect copper to gain next week and the same amount predicted a
drop. The metal for delivery in three months, the London Metal
Exchange’s benchmark contract, rose 5.1 percent to $7,990 a ton
this year.  Thirteen of 30 people surveyed anticipate lower corn prices
next week and five were neutral, while 17 of 31 said soybeans
will slide. Corn slipped 4.3 percent to $6.185 a bushel this
year as soybeans climbed 13 percent to $13.655 a bushel.  The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities fell to a two-month low
this week after a Labor Department report showed U.S. employers
added the fewest jobs in five months in March and on concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis may deepen. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao 
cut the nation’s economic growth target to 7.5 percent last
month, the lowest since 2004.  “Chinese indicators continue to point towards a continued
slowdown, even though the soft landing still looks like the most
probable alternative,” said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB
AB in  Stockholm . “There could be some way left to fall.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
