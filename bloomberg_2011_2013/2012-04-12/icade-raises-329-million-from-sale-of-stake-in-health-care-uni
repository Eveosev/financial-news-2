Icade SA (ICAD) , the company that’s
bidding to become France’s largest publicly traded office
landlord by taking over Silic SA, raised 250 million euros ($329
million) by selling a stake in its health-care unit to a group
of insurers.  The insurance divisions of  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP)  bought new shares equivalent to a 21 percent stake in
Icade Sante, according to a statement today from Icade, the
company’s Paris-based parent. Icade will retain a 69 percent
stake.  Icade Sante owns 44 properties, including homes for the
elderly, clinics and hospitals, leased by six medical operators.
The buildings are valued at more than 1.3 billion euros,
according to the statement.  Icade advanced 37 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 64.72 euros at
9:06 a.m. in Paris. That lifted the value of the company to 3.4
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
