(Corrects delivery month in fourth paragraph.)  Wheat rose on speculation that
demand for the grain by U.S. livestock feeders and overseas
buyers will increase.  Animal feedlots will use 180 million metric tons of the
grain in the 2011-12 season, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said on April 10. That’s up 24 percent from the government’s
estimate a month earlier. Exports of the grain may increase
after prices slipped this month, said Frank Cholly, a senior
commodities broker at RJO Futures in Chicago. Before today the
grain fell 4.1 percent in April.  “The market is in a sideways trading range, and we’re at
the lower end right now, so maybe we’ll see more feeding at
these  price levels ,” Cholly said in a telephone interview.
“It’s a market that is a little oversold, and we do see demand
pick up as the price drops.”  Wheat futures for July delivery climbed 2.1 percent to
$6.47 a bushel at 10:29 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. As
of yesterday, the most-active contract was down 2.9 percent this
year.  The price also gained on speculation that cold weather in
the northern U.S. Great Plains will slow development of plants.
The cold will delay germination of recently planted wheat and
hurt plants emerging from the ground, Telvent DTN said in a
report today. Cold weather in the Midwest including  Illinois 
“is not expected to be a significant problem,” according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
