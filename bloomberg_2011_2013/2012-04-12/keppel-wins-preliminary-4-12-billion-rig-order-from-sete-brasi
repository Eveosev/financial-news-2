Keppel Corp. (KEP) , the world’s biggest
builder of oil rigs, won a preliminary order worth about $4.12
billion from Sete Brasil Participacoes SA as Brazil’s state-
backed  oil company  develops new fields off the country’s coast  Sete Brasil, part-owned by  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , signed a
letter of intent to buy five semi-submersible rigs that will be
made in Brazil, according to a statement from Singapore-based
Keppel today. A final agreement may be signed within two months,
according to a spokesman who declined to be named citing company
policy.  Keppel is building its second yard in the South American
country as Petrobras works through plans to spend $224.7 on
equipment to support exploration in the largest crude discovery
in the Americas since 1976.  Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , the world’s
second-biggest rig maker, and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. have
also invested in Brazil because of demand from Petrobras.  Sete Brasil said it February it will spend $27 billion by
2020 on drilling units. The company ordered an $809 million
semi-submersible rig from Keppel in December and a drill ship
from Sembcorp in February.  Demand for offshore unit remains “hot” this year,
Keppel’s Chief Executive Officer Choo Chiau Beng said in
January, after the company won record orders totaling more than
S$10 billion ($8 billion) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
