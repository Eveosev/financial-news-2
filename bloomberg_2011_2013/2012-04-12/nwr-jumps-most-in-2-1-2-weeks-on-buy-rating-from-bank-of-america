New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the
biggest Czech coking-coal producer, gained the most in more than
two weeks after Bank of America Corp. recommended buying the
stock as the commodity’s rising price may boost earnings.  The shares rose 3.2 percent to 130.5 koruna at the close in
Prague, the biggest gain since March 26, and making NWR the best
performer in the 14-member  PX (PX)  index. In U.K. trading, NWR added
5.3 percent to 432 pence at 3:35 p.m. in London.  Bank of America analysts led by Jason Fairclough in London
upgraded NWR to buy from underperform with a 600 pence price
estimate for the London-traded shares in a report to clients
today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest producer of coking
coal, said this month it may miss deliveries from  Australia 
after strikes and flooding in Queensland affected output.  “NWR is a high-cost, financially geared coking-coal
producer and, in our view, is an ideal equity to express a
bullish directional view on coking coal,” Bank of America
analysts said. “The outlook for coking-coal pricing near term
is improving, mostly due to supply impacts in Queensland.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
