The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 0.8 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 19 billion cubic feet in the week ended April
6 to 2.498 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for May delivery rose 2.2 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.006 per million British thermal units on the New

by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
