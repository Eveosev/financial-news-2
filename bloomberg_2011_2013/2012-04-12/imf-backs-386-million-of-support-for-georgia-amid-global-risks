The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a two-year standby arrangement and a standby credit
facility for a combined $386 million to support Georgia’s
economy during the next two years.  “Economic performance in 2011 was stronger than envisaged,
inflation dropped to single digits, government debt declined,
and international reserves increased,” the fund said in a
statement from  Washington . “However, the unsettled global
economic and financial conditions have increased risks.”  Georgia’s $11.6 billion economy grew a preliminary 7
percent in 2011, according to the statistics office. The Black
Sea nation’s government is targeting 8 percent growth in 2012,
President Mikheil Saakashvili said March 19.
