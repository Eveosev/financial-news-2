     April 12 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average snapping its longest run of losses
since 2009, on optimism about U.S. earnings. Shares extended
gains after Bank of  Japan  Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  pledged to
continue to add monetary stimulus.  Furukawa Electric Co., which produces aluminum products,
jumped 3.9 percent after industry bellwether Alcoa Inc. opened
U.S. earnings season with an unexpected profit. Fanuc Corp.,
Japan’s biggest manufacturer of factory robotics, gained 2.7
percent after Citigroup recommended global industrial companies.
 Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  fell 2.3 percent on concern oil
cargoes from Iran won’t be covered by Japanese insurers because
of sanctions on the Islamic Republic.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 9,524.79 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo  after swinging between gains and losses at least
10 times. The gauge advanced for the first time in eight days,
the longest losing streak since July 2009. The broader Topix
Index added 0.5 percent to 809.88 with about two stocks rising
for each that fell.  “The market was ready for a rebound after falling seven
days,” said  Yutaka Miura , a senior technical analyst at Mizuho
Securities Co. After Alcoa reported results, “investors want to
see whether other companies’ earnings will beat or miss
estimates.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)   gained  13 percent this year on optimism the
Bank of Japan will introduce more measures to spur growth after
boosting its asset-purchase program in February and that
reconstruction after last year’s disasters will escalate. The
gauge pared gains since April 3 after the  Federal Reserve  damped
expectations for more monetary easing and rising borrowing costs
in  Europe  raised concern about the debt crisis.  Alcoa, Beige Book  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5
percent today. The gauge rose 0.7 percent in New York yesterday
after Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported an
unexpected profit, lifting expectations for earnings season. The
Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey showed the  U.S. economy 
maintained its expansion as manufacturing, hiring and retail
sales showed signs of strength in the face of higher fuel prices.  Furukawa Electric gained 3.9 percent to 211 yen. Nippon
Light Metal Co., an integrated aluminum producer, added 2.6
percent to 117 yen.  Spanish Yields Fall  Stocks also rose after Spanish yields retreated from this
year’s high, while the  European Central Bank  spurred speculation
it may buy Spanish bonds to help reduce borrowing costs.  Fanuc gained 2.7 percent to 14,600 yen after Citigroup
upgraded global industrial companies to overweight, maintaining
a buy rating on the Japanese firm.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Corp. (6305)   advanced 4.1 percent
to 1,800 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported its operating
profit for the year ending in March may rise to 80 billion yen,
beating expectations. The report cited sales of dump trucks and
excavators for coal mining for the projected rise.  Shipping companies fell the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups as tankers using Japan’s shipping-insurance
association to purchase coverage for Iranian crude cargoes will
be liable for any costs not recovered through reinsurance due to
sanctions against nation, according to the Japan Ship Owners’
Mutual P&I Association’s website.  Kawasaki Kisen, Japan’s third-biggest shipping line by
sales, fell 2.3 percent to 170 yen.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , the
sector leader, lost 1.2 percent to 239 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. (9104)  fell 4.2 percent to 317 yen.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at 0.99 times book value,
compared with 1.36 times for the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, 2.21
times for the S&P 500 and 1.39 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. A number below one means that investors can buy companies
for less than the value of their assets.  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index fell 4.1 percent to 20.26,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.8 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 12
percent below the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
