Investors should avoid bonds and
buy stocks in companies paying high dividends, and the  Federal
Reserve  should reconsider its low-interest-rate policy,
according to  Michael Steinhardt , whose hedge funds returned more
than 20 percent a year for almost three decades.  “Bonds are no place to be,” Steinhardt, 71, who is now
chairman of New York-based WisdomTree Investments Inc., said in
an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Money Moves”
with Carol Massar. “Equities are cheap by historic standards.
Equities that pay high dividends relative to bonds, relative to
the stock market, I think that’s a good place to be.”  Phone stocks and utilities offer the highest dividends
among 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
with yields exceeding 4.2 percent. That compared with a yield of
2.04 percent in 10-year Treasury notes and 2.02 percent for the
entire  S&P 500. (SPX)   The  S&P 500  rose 12 percent during the first three months
of this year for the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998 as
earnings beat analysts’ estimates for a 12th straight quarter.
The gauge is trading at 14.3 times reported earnings, below the
average since 1954 of 16.4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Treasuries slipped 1.3 percent in the first quarter
while corporate bonds increased 2.4 percent.  WisdomTree, started in 2005, offers equity ETFs based on
proprietary indexes that weight member companies according to
cash dividends or earnings. Indexes traditionally weight
securities according to market capitalization. The company also
offers currency, fixed-income and alternative ETFs.  Steinhardt Management  In 1967, the investor opened New York-based Steinhardt
Management Co., a hedge fund that produced returns averaging 24
percent a year for the next 28 years.  The Fed holding rates near zero hasn’t worked to spur
economic growth, Steinhardt said. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
has kept  interest rates  near zero since December 2008 and
expanded the central bank’s balance sheet with two rounds of
asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion. He has pledged to keep
borrowing costs low through at least late 2014.  The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.3 percent this year,
according to the median of 90 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey. While that’s up from 1.7 percent in 2011, it’s less than
the 3.7 percent average from 1983 to 2000.  “The economy is really going almost nowhere,” Steinhardt
said. “The low interest rates haven’t really accomplished what
you could have thought you might have,” he said. Fed policy
makers “need to revisit this historic logic that low rates are
good and high rates are not so good because it’s not working and
the economy can’t gain any zest, can’t gain any vigor and there
has been an enormous amount of stimulation,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
