The European Union said it may take
up to seven weeks to assess  Hungary ’s response to the EU’s
concerns that new laws limit the independence of its central
bank, judiciary and data-protection agency.  The European Commission, the EU executive in Brussels, is
performing a “rigorous analysis” of letters from the Hungarian
government on the issues, Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the
commission, told reporters today. Any of the commission’s weekly
meetings “between now and the course of May would be a good
opportunity” to decide on Hungary, he said.  “It is now for us to have a rigorous legal analysis of
these documents,” Bailly said. “We clearly stress that these
elements need to be clarified to ensure a safe and stable legal
environment that is necessary for any financial-assistance
program to be successful in any country.”  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  may meet with
commission President  Jose Barroso  when Orban visits Brussels to
give a speech on April 23, Bailly said. “There is a possibility
for a meeting with the president of the commission which is not
confirmed yet,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
