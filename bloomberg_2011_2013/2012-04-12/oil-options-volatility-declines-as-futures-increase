Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose after  Federal Reserve  and  Bank of Japan (8301) 
officials suggested the central banks would continue using
monetary policy to bolster economic growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.96 percent as of 2:56 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 28.24 percent yesterday.  Volatility has fallen for the past two days as crude has
surged 2.6 percent after touching $100.68 on April 10, the
lowest intraday price since Feb. 15.  “Crude got practically down to $100 a barrel and that
sounds like a bargain going into driving season,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
 Florida . “We have another leg up going into April, May and
June.”  Crude for May delivery rose 94 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $103.64  a barrel on the Nymex, the second consecutive
increase. May oil options and futures expire next week. The June
contract increased 92 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $104.10 a barrel
