The pound reached a three-month
high against the euro as Italian borrowing costs increased at a
debt sale, underpinning the appeal of U.K. assets as a haven
from the European debt crisis.  Sterling strengthened for a second day against the dollar
and the yen even after a U.K. report showed the  trade deficit 
widened in February more than economists predicted. Italy sold
securities due in 2015 at an average yield of 3.89 percent, up
from 2.76 percent at the previous auction last month. Gilts
declined as demand slipped at an auction of 20-year bonds.  “Sterling is considered a safe haven compared to the euro
as it’s in a better position,” said Jennifer Hau, a foreign-
exchange strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London .
“From a European perspective it’s probably the most attractive
place to invest, which is helping euro-sterling grind lower.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 82.36 pence per euro
at 12:03 p.m. London time after advancing to 82.27 pence, the
strongest level since Jan. 9. The U.K. currency gained 0.3
percent to $1.5959, and rose 0.5 percent to 129.22 yen.  Sterling has strengthened 2.2 percent over the past month,
the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro weakened 0.1
percent, and the dollar was little changed.  Italy sold 2.88 billion euros ($3.78 billion) of three-year
notes, less than its maximum target of 3 billion euros. The
Rome-based Treasury also sold 2 billion euros of bonds due in
2015, 2020 and 2023. The total of 4.88 billion euros fell short
of its target of 5 billion euros.  Trade Deficit  The U.K. trade deficit widened to 8.77 billion pounds from
a revised 7.88 billion pounds in January, the  Office for
National Statistics  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted a shortfall of 7.65 billion pounds.  The yield on the benchmark  10-year gilt  rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.08 percent. The 4 percent
bond due in March 2022 dropped 0.28, or 2.80 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 117.09.  Britain’s sale of 20-year bonds attracted bids for 1.39
times the amount on offer, down from a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.63 times at the previous auction. The country is due
to sell 3.5 billion pounds of bills tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.25 percent bonds maturing in June 2032
increased four basis points to 3.05 percent.  “It might just be that there’s limited demand at the low
yields, and nothing particularly more worrying than that,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London.  ‘Inherent’ Weakness  The euro may decline to the lowest in almost two years
against the pound, after failing to rise above a key level of
resistance, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  Europe ’s shared currency is poised to decline to 81.41
pence over the next month after being unable to strengthen above
82.87 pence this week, Steve Miley, London-based head of
foreign-exchange technical analysis, wrote in a note today.  An “inability to push above here highlights inherent
market weakness,” Miley wrote. “With the 21-day moving average
at 83.12 pence bearing down, the risks into April are firmly
seen lower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
