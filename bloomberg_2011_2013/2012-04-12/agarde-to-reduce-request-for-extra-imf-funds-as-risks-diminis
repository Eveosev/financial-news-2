International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said she will lower the
amount of additional resources she is seeking as risks to the
global economy diminish.  Lagarde, who had been trying to obtain an additional $500
billion in lending power, said that she hopes to make progress
on her request when IMF member countries meet next week. She
spoke in response to a question today after a speech at the
 Brookings Institution  in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
