Nordex SE (NDX1) , a Hamburg-based turbine
maker, won a contract to supply 10 of the machines to Bavaria’s
largest wind farm.  The company will deliver the turbines to the Zoeschingen
wind park for VenSol Neue Energien GmbH and Honold GmbH, it said
today in a  statement  on its website. The 24-megawatt project in
the Dillingen district of the German state will be completed by
the end of the year, according to the statement.  Nordex expects to place the project on its books as a firm
order in the third quarter. Terms were not disclosed.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
