Bureaucrats at the Bundesbank are
in the process of destroying the euro, billionaire investor
 George Soros  told  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  in an interview.  Soros added that the “rise and fall of Europe will be only
a financial bubble if the policy isn’t changed,” the newspaper
reported. He added that Europe is “saving itself until it goes
broke instead of doing something to promote growth,” SZ
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
