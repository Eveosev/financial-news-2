Finnish legislations will make it
easier to monitor and to limit foreign holdings in companies
deemed crucial for national security, the Employment and Economy
Ministry said.  The law will take effect on June 1 and foreign holdings
exceeding 10 percent in defense industry companies or companies
otherwise deemed essential to society will require approval from
the authorities, the ministry said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
