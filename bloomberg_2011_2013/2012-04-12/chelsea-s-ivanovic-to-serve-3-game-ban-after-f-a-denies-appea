Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic
will serve a three-match ban after the Football Association
denied his appeal of a violent conduct charge.  Ivanovic was cited by the F.A. for hitting Wigan’s Shaun
Maloney in the midsection during the Blues’ 2-1 win at Stamford
Bridge on April 7. The incident was not seen by the match
officials, but was caught on video, the F.A. said.  Ivanovic contested the charge, which the F.A. disciplinary
panel upheld after a hearing today, the governing body said in a
statement on its website.  He’ll sit out the F.A. Cup semifinal against Tottenham in
three days, along with league matches against Arsenal and Queens
Park Rangers. He will be eligible for Chelsea’s Champions League
semifinal games against Barcelona on April 18 and 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
