Authorities in  Iran  hanged 16 people
imprisoned for alleged links with anti-regime groups in
retaliation for the killing of 17 border guards in an ambush
near the boundary with Pakistani.  Those executed were “linked to terrorist and anti-regime
groups,” the state-owned Far News Agency quoted Mohammad
Marzieh, the attorney general of Sistan-Baluchistan province, as
saying. They were hanged “in response to the terrorist attack
which led to the martyrdom of a number of border guards.”  Seven soldiers were also wounded in the attack that took
place late yesterday in Saravan, on the south-eastern border
with  Pakistan , Fars cited Saravan’s member of parliament,
Hedayatollah Mir-Moradzehi as saying.  Iran has stepped up executions in recent months, with at
least 82 people killed in the weeks following President Hassan Rouhani’s election in June, Ahmed Shaheed, the United Nations
special investigator on human rights said in a report presented
to the General Assembly on Oct. 23. Shaheed said he’s “alarmed
by the spate of executions.”  Rouhani, who took office Aug. 4, has pardoned political
prisoners in a bid to promote a thaw with global powers over the
Islamic republic’s disputed nuclear program. International talks
in the country’s nuclear initiatives were held last week in
Geneva, as Rouhani’s government seeks relief from sanctions that
ave battered its economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
