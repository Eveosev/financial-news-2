Federal prosecutors said they will
offer into evidence “foreign intelligence information” in a
criminal case against a man accused of attempting to provide
support to an overseas terrorist organization.  U.S. Attorney  John Walsh  in Denver notified the federal
court and lawyers for Jamshid Muhtorov in a court filing today
that the government will introduce the information collected
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  The government “intends to offer into evidence or
otherwise use or disclose in proceedings” in the case
“information obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign
intelligence,” according to the filing.  The case against Muhtorov was filed last year. According to
a superseding indictment in March 2012, Muhtorov and others
conspired from January 2011 to January 2012 to provide support
for the Islamic Jihad Union while knowing it was a designated
terrorist organization.  Greg Holloway, a prosecutor in Walsh’s office, and Kathryn
J. Stimson, a lawyer representing Muhtorov, didn’t immediately
return calls after regular business hours seeking comment on the
filing.  The case is U.S. v. Jamshid Muhtorov, 12-cr-00033, U.S.
District Court, District of  Colorado  (Denver).  To contact the reporter on this story:
