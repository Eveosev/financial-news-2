Poland’s Football Association hired
Adam Nawalka as coach of the country’s national soccer team.  Nawalka replaces Waldemar Fornalik, who was fired Oct. 16
after Poland failed to qualify for next year’s  World Cup  in
 Brazil . The 56-year-old will start his job Nov. 1.  “The team’s and the new coach’s goal is obvious: to
qualify for the European championships in 2016 in  France ,”
Zbigniew Boniek, the head of the Polish F.A., said in a
statement published on the governing body’s website.  Nawalka, who played for Poland at the 1978 World Cup, has
coached Gornik Zabrze since Jan. 2010. The team tops the Polish
league by one point over Legia Warsaw, which has played one
fewer game.  Nawalka was most successful as coach of Wisla Krakow, the
club where he began his playing career. He guided the team to
the Polish championship and the league cup in the 2000-01
season, according to the Polish federation’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
