Switzerland’s Lara Gut won the
opening race of the World Cup skiing season at the women’s giant
slalom in Soelden,  Austria .  Gut had a combined time of 2 minutes, 25.16 seconds over
two runs today to claim her first victory in the discipline. The
22-year-old’s previous best giant slalom results were a pair of
third place finishes.  Austria’s Kathrin Zettel was  0.84 seconds  behind in second,
with Viktoria Rebensburg of  Germany  in third. It was Zettel’s
record fifth top-three finish in Soelden, tying the mark for
most podiums at a single venue.  Defending giant slalom and overall World Cup champion Tina Maze finished in 18th place, more than three seconds behind Gut.
The Slovenian won the giant slalom in Soelden last year and was
seeking her record-extending fourth victory there.  American Lindsey Vonn, the four-time overall World Cup
champion, did not race as she recovers from February knee
surgery resulting from a crash at the world championships.  The women will next race a slalom in Levi,  Finland , on Nov.
16. The men’s tour opens its season tomorrow with a giant slalom
in Soelden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
