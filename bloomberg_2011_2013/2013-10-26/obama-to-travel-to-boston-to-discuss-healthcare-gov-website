President  Barack Obama  will travel
to Boston Oct. 30 to speak about efforts to improve the
HealthCare.gov website, according to a White House official.  The website, home to the exchanges where Americans can buy
health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act of 2010, has been plagued by delays, error messages and
hang-ups since it opened Oct. 1.  The president will also discuss the experience in
Massachusetts, which passed its own health-care law in 2006, the
official said.  Obama will attend a Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee event later that day, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
