The U.K. government will delay
changes to the system of welfare payments for disabled people,
the British Broadcasting Corp. said today on its website.  The process of reassessing people claiming disability
allowance is taking longer than the government expected, the  BBC 
said, citing a written statement from Mike Penning, a work and
pensions minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
