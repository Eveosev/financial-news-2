Huishang Bank Corp., a lender in the
eastern Chinese province of Anhui, and its investors are seeking
as much as $1.3 billion from a  Hong Kong  initial public
offering, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The bank, based in Hefei city, and some of its shareholders
plan to offer 2.61 billion shares at HK$3.50 to HK$3.88 apiece,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. The offering includes 2.5 billion new
shares, they said.  Chinese lenders  are seeking to bolster their capital
through Hong Kong share sales as regulators maintain a freeze on
domestic initial public offerings. Huishang’s sale would be Hong
Kong’s biggest banking IPO in almost three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of Chongqing Co., based in  China ’s most populous city,
and some of its investors are seeking $593 million from a Hong
Kong IPO, according to a term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News 
on Oct. 23.  China Everbright Bank Co. (601818) , which is listed in
 Shanghai , said Oct. 16 it won regulatory approval to sell as
many as 12 billion shares overseas, paving the way for a first-time stock sale in Hong Kong.  Huishang will use IPO proceeds to strengthen its core
capital base, according to a term sheet on Oct. 21. The lender
plans to set a final price for its offering on Nov. 2, the terms
show.  A $1.3 billion deal would be the largest banking IPO in
Hong Kong since  Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank (3618)  Co. raised $1.7
billion in December 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A Hong Kong-based external spokeswoman for Huishang
couldn’t immediately comment on the  price range  when contacted
by phone today. Founded in December 2005, Huishang had about
5,500 employees and 190 outlets at the end of last year,
according to the lender’s  website .  Companies have raised $8.6 billion in Hong Kong IPOs this
year, more than double the amount for the same period of 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
