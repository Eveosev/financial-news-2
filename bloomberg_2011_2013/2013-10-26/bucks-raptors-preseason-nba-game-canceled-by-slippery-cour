The Milwaukee Bucks’ final home game
of the preseason was canceled after less than a quarter last
night when several players slipped on the court.  The Bucks were leading the  Toronto Raptors  14-9 when the
game was stopped with five minutes, 58 seconds remaining in the
first quarter at BMO Bradley Harris Center.  Officials spent 20 minutes discussing the situation before
announcing the game was over.  “We kept making eye contact out there and we saw the
players were having issues with traction,” NBA lead official
Danny Crawford said in an interview with a pool reporter. “Then
when we had a few guys go down, we figured we should have a
conference. And both teams wanted not to continue the game.”  Crawford said condensation was dismissed as the cause even
though the Bradley Center also hosts hockey games.  The Bucks, who finish their preseason schedule on Oct. 30
at the  New York Knicks , host the Raptors in their National
Basketball Association regular-season home opener on Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
