U.K. government bonds rose this week
along with Treasuries after a U.S. Labor Department report
showing employers added fewer jobs last month than economists
forecast fueled demand for the safest assets.  Benchmark  10-year gilt yields  dropped for a third week to
the lowest level in two months as the jobs data boosted
speculation the Federal Reserve will maintain asset purchases to
keep borrowing costs low. The U.K. Debt Management Office sold
more bonds maturing in 2068 via banks than planned this week.
The pound depreciated to the lowest level since August versus
the euro.  “Given what’s happened in U.S. yields with payrolls, it’s
driven gilt yields lower this week,” said Jason Simpson, a
fixed-income strategist at Banco Santander SA in London. “The
syndicated sale went well and the DMO probably allocated less
than the market would have wanted. That probably left a demand
hole that needed to be filled.”  Yields on  10-year gilts  fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, this week to 2.61 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday after dropping to 2.59 percent on Oct. 23, the
 lowest  since Aug. 27. The 2.25 percent bond maturing September
2023 climbed 0.855, or 8.55 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,616) face
amount, to 96.85.  The U.K. sold 20 percent more of its longest-maturity
government bonds than originally planned after receiving
“strong” demand at an offering of the securities via banks,
the London-based debt office said on Oct. 22.  Gilt Sale  The size of the 55-year gilt sale was increased by 750
million pounds to 4.5 billion pounds, DMO said in an e-mailed
statement. The bonds were sold at a yield of 3.555 percent, with
94 percent allocated to domestic investors, the DMO said.  U.S. employers added 148,000 workers in September, the
Labor Department said on Oct. 22. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 180,000.
Fed policy makers next meet on Oct. 29-30. The central bank will
maintain its bond purchases at $85 billion a month until March,
according to a separate Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Gilts lost 2.4 percent this year through Oct. 24, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries fell 1.9 percent and
German securities slid 1.5 percent.  The pound dropped 0.8 percent this week to 85.36 pence per
euro after depreciating to 85.55 pence on Oct. 24, the weakest
level since Aug. 29. The U.K. currency was little changed at
$1.6164 after climbing to $1.6257 on Oct. 23, the highest since
Oct. 1.  The pound strengthened 3 percent in the past three months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.8
percent, while the dollar fell 2.4 percent.  Economists said a report due on Nov. 1 will show U.K.
manufacturing expanded for a seventh month in October. A gauge
of output was at 56.5 compared with 56.7 in September, according
to the median estimate of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
