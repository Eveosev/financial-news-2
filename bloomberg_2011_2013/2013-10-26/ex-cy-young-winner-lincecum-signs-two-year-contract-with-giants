Two-time Cy Young Award winner  Tim Lincecum  signed a two-year contract extension with the  San
Francisco Giants , team General Manager Brian Sabean said.  The team declined to disclose financial terms. The deal is
worth $35 million with a full no-trade clause, the  Associated
Press  reported yesterday. He can earn an additional $250,000
each for 210 innings pitched and 220 innings.  Lincecum, 29, went 10-14 with a 4.37 earned-run average and
193 strikeouts in 32 starts last season, when he concluded a
two-year, $40.5 million contract.  The right-hander joined Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and
Kirk Rueter as the only pitchers in San Francisco-era history to
record at least 10 wins in six consecutive seasons.  As a member of the Giants for seven seasons, Lincecum has
gone 89-70 with a 3.46 ERA and nine complete games in 220
starts. He threw a no-hitter July 13 at  San Diego .  The four-time All-Star has recorded 1,510 career strikeouts
since his debut in 2007, placing him third behind Tom Seaver
(1,655) and Bert Blyleven (1,546) for the most in a pitcherâ€™s
first seven seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
