Blackstone Group LP (BX)  President  Tony James  this week sold about $88.6 million in company stock, at
least his third sale of the year, as shares trade near a six-year high.  James sold  3.25 million shares  between Oct. 23 and Oct. 25
at prices ranging from $26.71 to $27.85, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The sales were
through a company controlled by James, his spouse and a trust
for his children, the filing said.  Shares of Blackstone , the world’s biggest manager of
alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, fell
25 cents to $26.71 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading.
The stock is up 71% year to date. On Oct. 22, the stock closed
at $28.53, its highest price since 2007, the year the company
went public.  In two other sales this year, James sold 3.5 million
shares, valued at about $64.2 million, in February. Filings
indicate he sold 1.5 million shares, worth about $34.2 million,
in July.  Company officials weren’t immediately available for comment
outside of normal business hours.  On Oct. 17, Blackstone said assets under management rose
8.1 percent in the third quarter to an industry record of $248.1
billion as of Sept. 30. The firm has $41.4 billion in unspent
committed capital.  It also said that day profit for the period rose 3 percent
as gains in property holdings offset a decline in its buyout
unit.  For Related News and Information:
