Italy ’s government bonds fell for a
third week as reports showed the nation’s business confidence
worsened and euro-area services and manufacturing grew less than
economists forecast, sapping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation’s 10-year debt instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened for
the first week in a month amid signs the region’s recovery is
losing momentum. German bonds advanced for a second week as
investors sought the region’s safest investments. Italy is
scheduled to sell as much as 2.25 billion euros ($3.1 billion)
of two-year notes next week along with bills and bonds.  “Data that trailed forecasts and the fact that there will
be more Italian supply coming to the market next week caused
Italian bonds to lose ground,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Our view is that the economic recovery will
continue to improve, albeit at a slow pace, and that should keep
the Italian-German bond spread contained.”  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, this week to 4.22 percent after declining to
4.09 percent on Oct. 23, the lowest since June 5. The 4.5
percent bond due in March 2024 fell 0.49, or 4.90 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 102.655.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
securities instead of similar-maturity German bonds widened 13
basis points to 247 basis points, the first increase since the
week ended Sept. 27.  Confidence Declines  An index of Italian  consumer confidence  dropped to 97.3
this month, the least since June, from a revised 100.8 in
September, the statistics office said Oct. 24. A composite gauge
of euro-area manufacturing and services based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September, Markit
Economics said the same day.  The bonds of  Europe ’s lower-rated nations also
underperformed bunds as the  European Central Bank  said Oct. 23
the definition of capital it uses to stress test banks will be
stricter than that in an imminent review of their assets.  While the ECB confirmed it will require lenders to have a
capital ratio of 8 percent, what qualifies as capital will
change over the course of a three-part assessment, it said.  ‘Less Attractive’  “There is some expectation building up about the ECB’s
asset-quality review,” said  Michael Leister , a senior fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “Some are
worried that the result of the review may make it less
attractive for banks to hold government debt. Since Italian and
Spanish bonds are held primarily by their local banks, such a
result will hit them the most.”  Spanish bonds rose this week though pared gains after the
ECB statement. The nation’s  10-year yield  closed the week 10
basis points lower at 4.16 percent after dropping as much as 16
basis points.  German 10-year yield declined eight basis points to 1.76
percent after falling to 1.74 percent on Oct. 24, the lowest
level since Aug. 13.  Italy’s Treasury will sell two-year zero-coupon notes on
Oct. 28, 750 million euros of inflation-linked bonds the same
day, as well as bills on Oct. 29 and bonds the following day.  Italian bonds returned 6.4 percent this year through Oct.
24, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
securities rose 10 percent, while  Germany ’s lost 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
