European banks and Internet companies
are testing their ability to withstand cyber attacks today
following recent assaults on U.S. bank websites.  Internet service providers , telecommunications providers
and government agencies will take part in the exercise to see
how they’ll cope with more than 1,000 so-called distributed
denial-of-service attacks, the European Commission said in a
statement.  Cyber attacks last month on the biggest U.S. banks,
including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , breached
some of the country’s most advanced computer defenses and
exposed the vulnerability of their infrastructures, said
cybersecurity specialists tracking them, according to a U.S.
official who asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly.  The assault, which the official said was waged by a still-
unidentified group outside the U.S., flooded bank websites with
traffic, rendering them unavailable to consumers and disrupting
transactions for hours at a time. The attacks escalated last
week, directing 10 to 20 times more Internet traffic to the
sites than the typical denial-of-service attack, said Dmitri
Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of  Palo
Alto , California-based security firm CrowdStrike Inc.  Initial results of the European simulation will be
published within days by the EU’s network security agency,
ENISA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
