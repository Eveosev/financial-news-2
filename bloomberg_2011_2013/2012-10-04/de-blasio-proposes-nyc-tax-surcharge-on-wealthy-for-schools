New York City  Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, a probable Democratic candidate for mayor next year,
proposed a tax increase on residents earning more than $500,000
a year to pay for extended school hours.  De Blasio, 51, elected in 2009 to the watchdog post, told
the  Association for a Better New York  today that the surcharge
would raise $532 million for all-day prekindergarten classes and
extended hours in middle schools. He said the city needed to
boost education funding to keep pace with emerging nations such
as China and  India .  “Some of you might say this is an interesting place to
come and make this proposal,” de Blasio said as he  addressed 
the group of business executives in  Manhattan . “This is a room
full of people who know what smart, strategic investment looks
like, and this is the kind we need.”  The issue of expanding early education arose in
negotiations this year between Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  and the
city council. Both sides agreed to restore about $150 million
for child care that the mayor had cut from the 2013 budget. On
Sept. 24, Bloomberg announced the city would add 4,000 full-day
pre-K seats for the 2013-2014 school year.  De Blasio’s proposal received support from some child-
advocacy groups and rejection from  Kathryn Wylde , president of
the  Partnership for New York City , a group of more than 100
chief executives.  Future Foundation  Of the 68,000 4-year-olds in the city, only 20,000 attend
full-day pre-K, with another 38,000 enrolled in three-hour
programs, de Blasio said. Ten thousand students that age get no
pre-K education, the public advocate said.  “We have to get all 68,000 served if we want to lay a
foundation for our future,” de Blasio said.  De Blasio’s plan would impose “yet another tax on high
earners before we know how  Washington  will handle the federal
fiscal crisis, specifically the threatened elimination of state
and federal tax deductibility and the tax increase that is
scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1,” Wylde said in an e-
mail. “Hopefully there will be some more realistic ideas for
funding our education needs.”  Stephanie Gendell, a spokeswoman for the  Citizens Committee
for Children , described it as a “bold, expansive plan to ensure
quality,” and said her members would applaud de Blasio for it.  Five Years  The surcharge would run for five years, de Blasio said.
Residents with more than $500,000 in income would pay a tax rate
of 4.3 percent, up from 3.876 percent. Someone earning $750,000
a year would pay an additional $1,060; a $1 million earner would
see a $2,120 increase; and those making $2 million would pay
$6,360 more.  The tax would affect about 1 percent, or 44,200, of city
taxpayers, with an average income of $2.7 million, de Blasio’s
office said. To close budget deficits, the city imposed a
surcharge on incomes above $150,000 per household from 2003 to
2005 and increased property taxes 18.5 percent.  If approved by the City Council and state legislature, the
surcharge would provide $291 million for pre-K; $190 million for
extended middle-school classes and $50 million for leased space
and other expenses, de Blasio said.  Other potential candidates for mayor include council
Speaker Christine Quinn; former Comptroller  William Thompson ,
the 2009 Democratic nominee; Comptroller  John Liu ; and Manhattan
Borough President Scott Stringer. Liu’s office cited a June
proposal in which the comptroller called for higher tax rates on
the city’s wealthiest 1 percent, with reductions for the rest.  Bloomberg’s Response  The proposal, Liu said then, “is intended to promote
shared prosperity so that the benefits of economic recovery are
spread to the 99% more evenly than they were the last time
around.” Liu said the measure would raise $250 million to $1
billion in revenue.  The mayor is founder and majority owner Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP. His term ends next year.  “He wants to drive everybody out of the city, but that’s
OK; he’s a good guy,” Bloomberg said of de Blasio’s proposal
during a Brooklyn news conference today. “Every part of the
city you’d like to have more. The Department of Education is who
I’ll rely on to decide what we need.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
