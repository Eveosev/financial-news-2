Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell
to a record for a fourth day as speculation inflation slowed in
September boosted demand for the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 6.26 percent, according to the central bank, the
lowest level since the debt was first sold in 2009. The price
rose 0.182 centavo to 130.498 centavos per peso.  “Inflation will be the driver through the remainder of the
week,” said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota,
the nation’s second-biggest bank. “If it comes in too high,
people will read it as an argument for the central bank to
remain on hold. If it comes low, they’ll see it as an indication
there will be another cut.”  Annual inflation slowed to 2.95 percent in September,
according to the median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before tomorrow’s report. The central bank has an
inflation target of 2 percent to 4 percent.  Banco de la Republica kept the overnight lending rate at
4.75 percent on Sept. 28 after a reduction of a quarter-
percentage point in August.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,795.05 per  U.S.
dollar , extending its gain this year to 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
