Coffee exports from  Honduras , the
largest producer in Central America, may climb 3.6 percent in
the year that began Oct. 1 as output and yields increase,
according to the head of a domestic growers group.  Shipments may rise to 5.673 million bags from 5.478 million
a year earlier, boosting export income to $1.5 billion from
$1.44 billion, Victor Hugo Molina, the general manager of the
Honduran Coffee Institute, said yesterday in a telephone
interview from the capital, Tegucigalpa. Production may rise 2.6
percent to 5.98 million bags, he said.  Molina attributed the gains to improved farming practices,
more fertilization, technical assistance to growers and rising
investment in coffee plantations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
