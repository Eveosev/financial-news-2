A lawyer for Terra Firma Capital
Partners Ltd. and its Chairman Guy Hands asked an appeals court
today for a new trial on their $8.3 billion claim against
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  over the 2007 sale of EMI Group Ltd.  Citigroup won a verdict in  Manhattan  federal court in 2010,
successfully defending against Hands’s claim that the bank
tricked him into overpaying for EMI, the London-based music
company.  Hands claimed that a Citigroup banker,  David Wormsley , lied
to him in phone calls made the weekend before the EMI auction on
May 21, 2007, a Monday, leading the private-equity firm to
overbid in a deal that lost money for all involved.  Hands claimed Wormsley told him that Cerberus Capital
Management LP planned to submit a bid. Cerberus had in fact
decided to withdraw from the auction, leaving Terra Firma
without competition.  Much of the parties’ oral arguments today centered on Terra
Firma’s claim that U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who
presided over the trial, failed to instruct jurors properly that
Terra Firma was entitled to a presumption that it relied on
Citigroup misrepresentations.  Hands, who attended today’s court proceeding, declined to
comment on the case afterward.  The case is Terra Firma Investments (GP) 2 Ltd. v.
Citigroup, 11-126,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit,
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
