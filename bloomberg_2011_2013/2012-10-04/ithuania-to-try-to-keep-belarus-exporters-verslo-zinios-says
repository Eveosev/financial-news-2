Lithuania ’s government is calling for
ways to placate Belarusian exporters after a decision by oil
terminal Klaipedos Nafta AB to handle Belarusian products
through a Russian intermediary, Verslo Zinios reported.  Belarusian companies account for a third of the cargo
transported through Lithuania‘s Baltic Sea port of Klaipeda. If
they oppose new conditions for oil transit, they may redirect
exports such as fertilizers to competing ports elsewhere, the
newspaper cited Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis as saying.  As of Oct. 1, Klaipedos Nafta replaced a Belarusian
logistics company with OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit, which it says
offered better terms as a supplier of Belarusian oil, according
to Verslo Zinios.  The terminal will stay in constant contact with Belarusian
suppliers and handle their oil products as well when capacity is
available, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
