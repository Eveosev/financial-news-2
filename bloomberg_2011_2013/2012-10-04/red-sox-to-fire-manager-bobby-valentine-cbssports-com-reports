Boston Red Sox manager  Bobby Valentine  will be fired today or tomorrow,  CBSSports.com
reported , citing unidentified people familiar with the decision.  The Red Sox wrapped up a 69-93 Major League Baseball season
last night with a 14-2 loss to the New York Yankees. Boston
finished last in the five-team American League East, 26 games
behind the Yankees.  General Manager  Ben Cherington  said “no comment” when
asked about reports that Valentine, who replaced Terry Francona,
would be gone before the weekend, CBSSports.com said.  Valentine recently complained on a local radio show that
some of his coaches hadn’t been loyal, CBSSports.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
