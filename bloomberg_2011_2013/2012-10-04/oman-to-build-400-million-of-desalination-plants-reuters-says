Oman is planning to construct three
desalination plants in Duqm, Sur and Sohar for about $400
million, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a government
official close to the project.  The official, who wasn’t identified because he wasn’t
authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told the news agency
that Oman’s water consumption is rising 5 percent a year for the
estimated 3 million residents including foreign workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
