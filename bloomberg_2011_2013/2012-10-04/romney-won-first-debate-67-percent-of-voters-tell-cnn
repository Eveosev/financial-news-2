Republican  Mitt Romney  won tonight’s
first presidential debate with President  Barack Obama , according
to a  CNN /ORC International poll of registered voters who watched
the nationally televised event.  Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed said Romney fared
better, compared with 25 percent for Obama, according to results
aired on CNN after the match concluded. Forty-six percent said
they found Romney more likeable, compared with 45 percent for
Obama, CNN reported.  The CNN poll interviewed 430 Americans by telephone after
the debate and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.  During the 90-minute debate at the University of Denver in
 Colorado , Romney tried to paint Obama as a big-government
Democrat while Obama said Romney’s plans favored the rich at the
expense of the middle class.  Obama has held an edge over the former Massachusetts
governor in recent polls of likely voters. The president led
Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent, in a national NBC News/Wall
Street Journal poll released yesterday, down from 50 percent to
45 percent in a comparable survey two weeks earlier.  A NPR poll released today gave Obama a seven-point lead, 51
percent to 44 percent, among likely voters nationally. That
survey of 800 likely voters was conducted Sept. 26-30 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.  The next debate between the two candidates is scheduled for
Oct. 16 at Hofstra University in Hempstead,  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
