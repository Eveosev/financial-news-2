NuVasive Inc. (NUVA)  declined the most ever
after the maker of orthopedic devices said third-quarter revenue
was less than the company anticipated.  NuVasive fell 33 percent to $15.19 at the close of New York
trading, the biggest drop since May 2004. The San Diego-based
company has risen 21 percent this year.  Preliminary revenue was about $147 million, less than
company expectations for a similar level as the $154.4 million
posted in the second quarter, NuVasive said yesterday. Sales
were hurt by competitor discounts and increased delays and
denials of coverage by insurers, the device maker said.  “The miss was surprising and calls into question
NuVasive’s” growth prospects, said Richard Newitter, a New
York-based analyst for Leerink Swann & Co., in a note to
investors today. The third-quarter sales were “well short of
expectations,” he wrote.  Analysts at Brean Murray Carret & Co., BMO Capital Markets,
Wells Fargo Securities and RBC Capital Markets reduced their
ratings on NuVasive. Newitter has an outperform rating on the
shares.  Full results for the third quarter will be released Oct.
29, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
