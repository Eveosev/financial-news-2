Soybeans rose for second day in
 Chicago  on speculation import demand may strengthen after prices
fell from a record.  Soybeans have dropped 14 percent from the all-time high of
$17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4. Global exports will climb 4.1 percent
to a record 93.7 million metric tons in 2012-13, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture forecasts.  China  bought 110,000 
tons from U.S. exporters and another 180,000 tons, the USDA said
on Sept. 27 and Sept. 28.  “There have been some pretty heavy exports lately so some
demand is being met,” William Adams, a fund manager at
Resilience AG in Zurich, said today by phone. “If there is a
good season in  Australia  and South America, we could see some
more weakness.”  Soybeans for delivery in November climbed 0.9 percent to
$15.46 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 12:39 p.m. in
 London . The oilseed yesterday advanced 0.1 percent after
dropping 4.4 percent in two sessions.  Taiwan bought 60,000 tons of Brazilian soybeans from Bunge
Ltd. for delivery in February at a tender today, the Breakfast
Soybean Procurement Association-Taichung Group said by e-mail.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.6 percent to $7.6125 a
bushel and wheat for delivery in the same month was up 0.2
percent at $8.7475 a bushel. Milling wheat futures jumped 0.9
percent on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
