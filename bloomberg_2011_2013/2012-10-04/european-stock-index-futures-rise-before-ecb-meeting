European stocks  closed little changed
as the  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  left their
benchmark interest rates on hold.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  slid 4.3 percent as the health-
care company said a deteriorating Japanese market will hurt
full-year profit.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  gained 2.3 percent on a report
that Korean steelmaker Posco submitted a letter of intent for
its American unit.  Halfords Group Plc (HFD)  surged the most ever after
saying earnings will be in the upper half of its forecast.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  decreased less than 0.1 percent
to 271.33 at the close of trading, having fluctuated between
gains and losses at least 20 times. The gauge has still climbed
11 percent this year as ECB policy makers agreed on an unlimited
asset-purchase program to bring down borrowing costs in  Spain 
and Italy and the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of
quantitative easing.  “In the absence of any positive news from Spain, or any
news that might help set the direction, markets are languishing
a bit,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd. in London. “Looking ahead, we have the payrolls
from the U.S. tomorrow that might help.”  The ECB kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low of
0.75 percent, as predicted by 48 of 52 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The central bank is ready to start buying  government
bonds  as soon as the necessary conditions are fulfilled,
President  Mario Draghi  said today at a press conference in
Ljubljana, Slovenia.  The Bank of England maintained its bond-purchase target at
375 billion pounds ($604 billion) and held interest rates at 0.5
percent, as economists had forecast.  Spanish Bonds  Spain’s three-year borrowing costs increased at a debt
auction today, with the average yield rising to 3.956 percent
from 3.845 percent the last time the benchmark note was issued
on Sept. 20. Demand climbed to 1.98 times the amount sold,
compared with 1.56 times last month.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has refrained from seeking a
bailout for the indebted country, a month after the ECB
announced an unlimited bond-buying plan to preserve the euro.  In the U.S.,  initial jobless claims  increased to 367,000
last week from a revised 363,000 the prior period, a Labor
Department report showed. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
predicted a reading of 370,000.  A separate report showed  factory orders  declined 5.2
percent in August, following a revised 2.6 percent gain a month
earlier. Economists had predicted a 5.9 percent drop.  U.S. Payrolls  Government data tomorrow may show U.S. employers added
115,000 workers to payrolls in September, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 89 economists. The Fed
will release minutes from the latest policy meeting at 2 p.m.
 New York  time, after European markets close.  “The most important message will be from the employment
data from the U.S. on Friday,” Herbert Perus, who helps oversee
about $36 billion as head of equities at Raiffeisen in Vienna,
said in a phone interview. “This will be crucial.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX fell 0.2 percent and  France’s
CAC 40 declined 0.1 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 was little
changed while the Swiss Market Index rose 0.4 percent.  Nobel Biocare  Nobel Biocare retreated 4.3 percent to 9.03 Swiss francs
after saying a drop in the Japanese market in the third quarter
is “materially impacting” full-year sales and profit. The
world’s second-biggest maker of dental implants said annual
earnings before interest and taxes will be in the range of 67
million euros to 70 million euros. While Japan represents 13
percent of sales, it contributes “disproportionately high
profit,” the company said.  Straumann Holdings AG, the biggest maker of dental
implants, slid 3.3 percent to 119.90 francs.  Gerresheimer AG (GXI)  lost 2.3 percent to 39.79 euros. The German
producer of pharmaceutical and health-care equipment posted
third-quarter adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share, missing
the average analyst estimate of 70 cents.  SAP AG dropped 1.5 percent to 54.24 euros after peer
Informatica Corp. posted preliminary third-quarter earnings that
missed analyst estimates. The U.S. software vendor said its
performance in Europe accounted for most of the sales drop.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  lost 3 percent to 318.15 pence, the largest
decline in almost nine months. Citigroup Inc. and Exane BNP
Paribas lowered their price estimates on the shares and Natixis
cut its rating on the company to reduce from neutral a day after
U.K.’s biggest retailer posted its first profit drop in nearly
two decades.  ThyssenKrupp, Halfords  ThyssenKrupp advanced 2.3 percent to 17.38 euros after
MoneyToday said Posco submitted a letter of intent for the
German company’s Steel Americas unit on Sept. 28, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Halfords surged 14 percent to 303.5 pence, the most since
the company listed in 2004, after the company said it expects
2013 profit before tax in the upper half of its previously
forecast range of 62 million pounds to 70 million pounds. The
company also reported second-half same-store sales growth that
beat analyst estimates.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  added 3.2 percent to 59.76
euros after the German automaker said group sales in China rose
59 percent in September.  A gauge of carmakers was the best-performing group on the
Stoxx 600.  Fiat SpA (F)  gained 2.1 percent to 4.44 euros and  Daimler
AG (DAI)  climbed 1.2 percent to 38.51 euros. Preferred shares of
Volkswagen AG advanced 2.9 percent to 145.35 euros.  Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE)  added 1.9 percent to 687 pence after Credit
Suisse Holding AG raised its rating on the maker of low-calorie
sweetener Splenda to outperform from neutral. The new
recommendation is the equivalent of buy.  Banco Espirito Santo SA advanced 6.8 percent to 63 cents
and Banco BPI SA climbed 2.7 percent to 83.5 cents after Bank of
Portugal said they were among lenders that met the European
Banking Association’s capital requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
