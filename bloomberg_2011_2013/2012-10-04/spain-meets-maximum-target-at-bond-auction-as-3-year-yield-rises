 Spain’s three-year borrowing costs
rose today at an auction focusing on the type of short-term
notes that would be targeted by European Central-Bank debt
buying should the nation apply for a second European bailout.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 3.99 billion euros ($5.2) of
bonds, including a three-year benchmark at an average yield of
3.956 percent, up from 3.845 percent the last time it was issued
on Sept. 20. Securities maturing in October 2014 and July 2017
were priced to yield 3.282 percent and 4.766 percent
respectively.  Demand rose to 1.98 times the amount sold for the 2015
bonds, compared with 1.56 times last month. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.03 for the 2014 bonds and 2.47 for the 2017 bonds
compared with 1.9 and 2.06 in July.  “Yields are somewhat superior to what was expected even
though bid-to-cover ratios are positive,” Madrid-based Cortal
Consors analysts wrote in an e-mailed statement after the sale.  Spanish bonds have pared losses since the ECB first offered
to buy debt from cash-strapped nations on Aug. 2 on expectation
of central bank support. The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark
bond rose 6 basis points yesterday to 5.8 percent after Premier
Mariano Rajoy denied a bailout request was imminent. That
compares with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent on July 25 after
Spain clinched an agreement for as much as 100 billion euros in
European Union loans for its banks.  Maturing Debt  The 10-year yield was at 5.85 percent after the auction
while the spread with similar German maturities widened 4 basis
points to 4.41 percent. The yield on the three-year benchmark
was at 3.98 percent. The Treasury, which had covered 83.4
percent of its medium- and long-term debt issuance for 2012 by
Sept. 25, returns to the markets on Oct. 16 to raise funds to
cover 29 billion euros of maturing debt this month.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday that Spain
will consider all the consequences of taking a bailout or not
doing so, before making a decision on whether to trigger the
rescue.  Rajoy, who championed the idea of EU bond buying, has been
holding back from seeking the aid to avoid having to accept
strict economic and budget conditions in return. His People’s
Party faces two regional elections this month, in the northern
states of Galicia and in the Basque country. That’s followed by
a vote in Catalonia in November.  With signs that foreign investors shunning Spain, pressure
on Rajoy is mounting. Non-residents cut their holdings of
Spanish debt to 33 percent in August from 50 percent in
December, data from the Treasury show.  Spanish banks raised their share to 34 percent from 17
percent with the help of ECB financing. Their net borrowings
from the Frankfurt-based bank amounted to 389 billion euros in
August, compared with 70 billion a year earlier, Bank of Spain
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
