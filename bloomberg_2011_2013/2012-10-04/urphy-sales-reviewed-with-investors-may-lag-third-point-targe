Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR) , the Arkansas-based
petroleum company, said it’s “evaluating opportunities” after
meeting with investors including  Third Point  LLC, which is
calling for divestitures that it says could raise as much as
$8.4 billion.  That may be an over-estimate of the assets’ values, William A. Featherston, a New York-based analyst for UBS Investment
Research, wrote today in a note to clients. Several of the asset
sales proposed by Third Point, including separation of the U.S.
retail business and sale of its U.K. refinery, have been
previously contemplated and delayed by Murphy, Featherston said.  Third Point and others made suggestions about the company’s
holdings, El Dorado, Arkansas-based Murphy said today in a
statement. Third Point, in a letter  posted yesterday on its
website, said Murphy may be worth $94 a share after selected
divestitures.  The divestitures proposed by Third Point, which would also
include Canadian natural gas fields and a stake in an oil-sands
operation, would raise as little as $4.5 billion, and the $94 a
share estimate presumes Murphy would trade above historic ratios
to earnings, Featherston wrote.  Murphy shares rose 1.6 percent to $59.14 at 10:22 a.m. in
 New York , touching a six-month high for the second time in two
days. They’ve risen 5.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
