Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , the world’s
biggest producer in deep waters, is “close” to selling part of
its assets in the  Gulf of Mexico  for as much as $8 billion to
help finance investments in Brazil.  Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, has set up a team to
accelerate its divestiture program, Chief Executive Officer
Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters today in Sao Paulo.
Petrobras, which has 186 exploration blocks in the U.S. Gulf of
 Mexico , will raise at least $4 billion from the sale, she said.  Petrobras plans to procure $14.8 billion from asset sales
and cost cuts as it focuses on developing the largest
discoveries on Earth over the past decade in deep waters off the
coast of Brazil. The company is investing $236.5 billion in the
five years through 2016 to more than double output by 2020.  The company plans to complete the sale in the first quarter
of next year, Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa
said Sept. 17.  Petrobras rose 0.3 percent, to 22.44 reais in  Sao Paulo .
The stock is up 4.3 percent this year, more than the 3 percent
gain in Brazil’s benchmark stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
