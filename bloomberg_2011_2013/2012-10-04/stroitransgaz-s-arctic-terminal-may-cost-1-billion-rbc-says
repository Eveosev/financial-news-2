An Arctic oil terminal that OAO
Stroitransgaz will build for OAO Gazprom Neft’s Novoportovskoye
field may cost $1 billion,  RBC Daily  reported, citing several
analysts’ estimates.  Stroitransgaz  said  it won the contract as head of a group
of companies that includes shipper OAO Sovkomflot, Simferopol-
based Institute Shelf and Van Oord Offshore BV of the
Netherlands. Stroitransgaz didn’t specify the contract cost in a
statement on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
