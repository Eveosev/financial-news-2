India ’s rupee rose for a fifth day,
the longest winning streak since January, on speculation policy
changes announced last month by Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
will spur economic growth.  Global funds added $44 million to holdings of local shares
on Oct. 1, taking this year’s inflows to $16.2 billion, exchange
data show. Singh cut fuel subsidies, opened retailing and
airlines to foreign investors, and reduced a tax on local
companies’ overseas borrowing to 5 percent from 20 percent.
India still needs to achieve political consensus to implement
the measures, according to Credit Agricole CIB.  “The recent round of announcements has fueled hopes that
India could begin to build a backdrop more favorable to
productivity gains and a rebound in investment,” analysts at
Credit Agricole, including Paris-based Sebastien Barbe, wrote in
a report today. Although “in the medium term there could be
some caution about the rupee given the remaining uncertainties,
the tactical rally may continue in the short term.”  The rupee advanced 0.8 percent to 51.7450 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
51.6675 earlier, the strongest level since April 18. The
currency will appreciate toward 50 in the coming months,
according to  Credit Agricole . One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 20
basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 10.90 percent.  Indian ministers will consider today increasing the cap on
overseas investment in local insurance ventures and allowing for
the first time foreign direct investment of as much as 26
percent in pension funds.  The rupee also tracked gains in regional currencies after a
report showed yesterday that U.S. employers added 162,000 jobs
last month, topping the median forecast of 140,000 by economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 52.80 a dollar,
compared with 53.10 yesterday, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 52.57 from 52.94. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
