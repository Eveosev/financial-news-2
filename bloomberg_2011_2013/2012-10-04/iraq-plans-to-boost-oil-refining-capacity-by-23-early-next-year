Iraq ’s refining capacity will
increase by 23 percent to 760,000 barrels a day by early next
year once refineries are enlarged, according to Deputy Oil
Minister Ahmad al-Shamaa.  The expansions, particularly of the Daura facility in
 Baghdad  and the Basra plant in the south, will add 140,000
barrels a day to existing capacity, he said today in an
interview in the Iraqi capital. The enlargements are happening
as Iraq boosts crude production capacity, he said.  Iraq’s oil-processing facilities have been running below
capacity because of damage sustained since the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion. The country plans to build four refineries at a cost
of about $25 billion, including a 300,000 barrel-a-day plant in
Nasiriyah and a 140,000 barrel-a-day processing plant in
Karbala, both in the south, Shamaa said.  The Iraqi government plans to pay for the Karbala refinery
from its own budget and is preparing to seek bids for the
construction of the Nasiriyah plant as part of the contract to
develop the oil field of the same name, Shamaa said.  The nation holds the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to data from  BP Plc (BP/)  that include Canadian  oil sands .  To contact the reporter on this story:
