Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS,  Turkey ’s
largest bank by assets, plans to collect five metric tons of
gold to increase deposits by 2013 in co-operation with jeweler
Gulaylar Kuyumculuk, Isbank said.  “We’d like to get the gold that’s out there into the
financial system,” Isbank’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Erdal Acar told reporters at a news conference in Istanbul
today. “This will be an important tool in increasing the
tendency to save.”  About 5,000 tons of gold, valued at about $300 billion, is
believed to be “stashed under the mattress‘‘ in Turkey, which
has an economy of about $800 billion, according to Ozcan Halac,
head of the  Istanbul Gold Refinery . Banks diversified services
this year to attract the hidden gold to boost Turkey’s savings
rate, one of the lowest among major  emerging markets .  Customers will bring their gold coins or jewelry to
Gulaylar shops to be evaluated by experts and equivalent deposit
accounts will be opened at Isbank.  Isbank’s gold deposit accounts jumped 10-fold in the two
years to June 2012, Acar said. The lender has $1.4 billion of
gold deposit accounts, he said. Similar accounts in Turkey’s
banking industry grew 12 percent to more than $9 billion, while
volume of gold at Turkish banks climbed 23 percent to 179 tons
at end-June from end-2011,  according to banking regulator data.   To contact the reporter on this story:
