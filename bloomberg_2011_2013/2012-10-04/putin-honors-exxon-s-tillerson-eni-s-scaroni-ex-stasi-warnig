Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson and  Eni SpA (ENI)  CEO Paolo Scaroni were awarded
Orders of Friendship by Russian President  Vladimir Putin ,
according to a Kremlin decree.  Exxon and Eni have formed alliances to develop Arctic
resources and work jointly on overseas projects with state-run
OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer.  Matthias Warnig, who was named board chairman of United Co.
Rusal on Oct. 1, received the Order of Honor.  Warnig, a former East German Stasi agent who has known
Putin since at least 1991, is managing director of the OAO
Gazprom-led Nord Stream AG venture, which runs Russia’s only
direct natural gas pipeline to western Europe. He is a board
member at Rosneft and chairman of oil pipeline operator OAO
Transneft’s board.  The executives were among 12 people who received awards
under the decree, dated Sept. 30. Tillerson, Scaroni and
Warnig’s medals were in their roles in developing cooperation
with  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
