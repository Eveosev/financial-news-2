The approval of the conclusions from
the fifth quarterly review of Portugal’s aid program will be
discussed at a meeting of euro-area finance ministers on Oct. 8,
Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said in Parliament today.  The  Portuguese government  announced new austerity measures
yesterday to help narrow Portugal’s budget deficit after
scrapping a proposal to raise the social-security tax rate that
had been agreed with officials from the International Monetary
Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank last month.  The timing of the new measures announced yesterday has
helped Portugal avoid a new review, Passos Coelho said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
