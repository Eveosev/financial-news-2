Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  (DTE)’s agreement to combine T-Mobile USA with  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  (PCS) reveals how the value of its unit may have dropped by $13 billion amid client losses following a failed sale to  AT&T Inc. (T)  (T) last year.  T-Mobile USA is worth about $26 billion including debt, based on MetroPCS’s share price and analyst estimates.  Deutsche Telekom (DTE) ,  Germany ’s biggest phone company, last year dropped a plan to sell the mobile carrier to AT&T for $39 billion after opposition by regulators. T-Mobile USA has lost about 7.6 percent of its subscriber base since that attempt.  Deutsche Telekom said yesterday it will own 74 percent of a combined entity with MetroPCS to increase the size of its U.S. operations and challenge AT&T, Verizon Wireless and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  Rene Obermann, chief executive officer of the Bonn- based company, may be accepting a lower valuation to facilitate an exit from the U.S. in the future, said Frederic Boulan, an analyst at Nomura in  London .  “T-Mobile’s implied valuation is not as good as in the AT&T deal,” he said. “Still, the merger has the potential for synergies and if the new company delivers, there is a path for a profitable exit for Deutsche Telekom.”  Deutsche Telekom spokesman Andreas Leigers declined to comment on the value of T-Mobile USA. T-Mobile has stepped up investments to deploy a faster network in 2013, announced 2,800 job cuts and freed up cash by selling the right to operate its network of cellular towers.  Lower Value  Because T-Mobile USA isn’t publicly traded, the value may be derived from the price of MetroPCS shares, which  closed  at $12.24 in New York yesterday.  Based on that price and excluding expected dividends, the Richardson, Texas-based company’s equity is priced at about $3 billion, implying a value of about $8.4 billion for Deutsche Telekom’s 74 percent stake in the combined company. T-Mobile also brings debt of as much as $17.4 billion into the deal, resulting in an enterprise value of $25.8 billion minus some cash reserves.  Deutsche Telekom shares declined 4.1 percent to 9.36 euros at the close of trading in  Frankfurt , the steepest decline in 11 weeks.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, is in the early stages of evaluating a counter offer for MetroPCS, said three people familiar with the matter.  MetroPCS declined 1.7 percent to $12.03 at 12:57 p.m. in New York.  Impairment Loss  Deutsche Telekom has recognized the shrunken value of T- Mobile USA. The company recorded an impairment loss of 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) following the collapse of the AT&T agreement in the fourth quarter, and said yesterday it expects another writedown of 7 billion euros to 8 billion euros for the quarter ended Sept. 30.  “Falling subscriber numbers explain some of T-Mobile’s decline in value since the AT&T offer,” said Jan Goehmann, an analyst at Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Hanover. “But AT&T was also ready to pay a lot, as they expected big synergy gains. With MetroPCS and T-Mobile operating on different networks and being smaller in scale, the synergy gains are lower.”  The deal will generate annual cost savings of about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion as the companies combine their wireless networks and purchase handsets together, according to Deutsche Telekom.  When the AT&T deal failed, the German company received a breakup fee of $3 billion in cash plus wireless frequencies and lower fees for calls into the network of its U.S. peer.
