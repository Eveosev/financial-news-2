Commodities climbed the most in two
months as the euro rose against the dollar after the  European
Central Bank  said it’s ready to buy bonds once necessary
conditions are met.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
increased 2.5 percent to 665.19, the biggest gain since Aug. 3.
Oil futures in New York, which account for 30.25 percent of the
GSCI  index , rose 4.1 percent, the most since Aug. 3.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said the bank is ready to start
buying  government bonds  as soon as the conditions are fulfilled,
putting the onus on  Spain  to decide whether it wants a bailout.
ECB policy makers left the  benchmark rate  at a historic low of
0.75 percent.  “The primary reason for the rise in commodities is the
strength of the euro,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York-based energy hedge fund. “The ECB held
tough and didn’t further reduce rates or change conditions for
aid. They’re sticking to their guns with Spain, which is going
to send dollar-based commodities higher.”  Oil for November delivery climbed $3.57 to settle at $91.71
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures plunged
4.1 percent yesterday after the Energy Department reported U.S.
production climbed to the  highest level  in more than 15 years
while fuel demand decreased.  Brent oil for November rose $4.41, or 4.1 percent, to
settle at $112.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  The euro advanced 0.9 percent against the dollar. A
stronger common currency increases the appeal of investing in
dollar-denominated raw materials.  Jobless Claims  The gain in commodities came as American claims for
 unemployment benefits  climbed less than forecast. Applications
for  jobless benefits  increased 4,000 to 367,000 in the week
ended Sept. 29, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists forecast 370,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “We’re getting strength because economic data has been a
little less bad than expected,” Kilduff said. “The jobs
numbers point to stabilization.”  Other commodities also advanced. Gasoline for November
delivery rose 14.34 cents, or 5.1 percent, to end the session at
$2.9429 a gallon at in New York. November-delivery heating oil
advanced 12.2 cents, or 4 percent, to $3.1884 a gallon.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,796.50 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Earlier,
the price reached $1,797.70, the highest level for a most-active
contract since Nov. 9.  Soybean prices rose the most this week on signals of
increased demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter. Futures for November delivery jumped 1.3 percent to
$15.515 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain
since Sept. 28. The price reached a record $17.89 on Sept. 4
after a drought that the USDA said will cut output to the lowest
level in nine years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
