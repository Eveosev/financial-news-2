The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  closed

20 times, as central-bank policy makers kept borrowing costs at
record lows.  Next Plc (NXT)  and  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  led retailers higher, advancing
more than 1 percent.  Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE)  climbed 1.9 percent as
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation for the shares.

to support growth. The FTSE All-Share Index increased 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.3 percent.  “Europe in particular has reduced the tail risk that was
really threatening the investment environment,” Marino Valensise, chief investment officer at Baring Asset Management,
said on Bloomberg Television today. “Although it’s very
difficult to get excited because the macro situation hasn’t
changed all that much.”  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King ’s nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee today left their key interest rate at a record
low of 0.5 percent and maintained their bond-purchase target at
375 billion pounds ($604 billion), as forecast by all economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  BOE Stimulus  By next month’s meeting, they’ll have finished spending the
50 billion-pound round they started in July, forcing a decision
on whether more stimulus is needed.  The ECB left interest rates at 0.75 percent and President
 Mario Draghi  said the bank is ready to start buying government
bonds as soon as the necessary conditions are fulfilled.  U.S. economic data showed factory orders sank 5.2 percent
in August and claims for jobless benefits rose last week.  Retail stocks led gains in the FTSE 100 today. Next rallied
2.7 percent to 3,592 pence, Kingisher climbed 1.6 percent to
268.7 pence and  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  gained 1 percent to
365.5 pence.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  still declined the most in nearly nine months as
Natixis downgraded the U.K.’s largest retailer to reduce while
Citigroup Inc. reiterated its sell recommendion. The shares
dropped 3 percent to 318.15 pence, extending yesterday’s 2.6
percent selloff after the company posted its first drop in
profit in almost two decades.  Tate Upgrade  Tate & Lyle climbed 1.9 percent to 687 pence after Credit
Suisse upgraded the maker of low-calorie sweetener Splenda to
outperform, the equivalent of buy, and raised its price estimate
7.1 percent to 750 pence.  “Certainly it looks to us that the business is in better
shape and is being set up to deliver growth,” analyst Charlie Mills at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. “This is not
reflected in the share price.”  Carnival Plc, the world’s largest cruise operator, climbed
1.6 percent to 2,350 pence. The company’s U.S.-traded shares

rival Marriott International Inc. yesterday reported earnings
that beat estimates after demand for high-end brands increased.  Carillion Plc (CLLN)  gained 3 percent to 285.2 pence after the
