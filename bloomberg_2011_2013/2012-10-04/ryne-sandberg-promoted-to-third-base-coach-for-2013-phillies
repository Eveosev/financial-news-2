Hall of Fame player Ryne Sandberg
will be the  Philadelphia Phillies ’ third-base coach next season
after managing in the minor leagues for the past six.  Sandberg, a former second baseman who led the Phillies’
Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs this year, also will serve as an
infield instructor, the Major League Baseball team said in a
news release.  Phillies hitting coach Greg Gross, bench coach Pete Mackanin and first-base coach Sam Perlazzo were let go yesterday.  Third-base coach Juan Samuel will move to first, bullpen
coach Mick Billmeyer will instruct the catchers, Steve Henderson
will become hitting coach after working in the minors as a
hitting coordinator the past two years, and Rod Nichols will
coach the bullpen, also a promotion to the majors, the Phillies
said.  Sandberg, 53, went 439-409-1 managing in the Phillies’ and
 Chicago Cubs ’ minor-league systems from 2007-2012.  He made his major-league debut with the Phillies in 1981,
playing 13 games before being traded to the Cubs with Larry Bowa
for Ivan Dejesus. Sandberg went on to become a 10-time All-Star
and win the 1984 National League Most Valuable Player Award. He
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005.  Considered a possible successor to the Phillies’ 68-year-
old manager,  Charlie Manuel , Sandberg was passed over by the
Cubs and St.  Louis Cardinals  in recent managerial searches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
