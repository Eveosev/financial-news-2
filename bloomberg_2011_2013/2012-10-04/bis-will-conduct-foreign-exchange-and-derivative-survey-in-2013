The Bank for International
Settlements plans to run its ninth three-yearly central bank
survey on currency markets and derivatives next year, it said.  “More than 5,000 financial institutions worldwide are
expected to contribute,” the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said
in an e-mailed statement today. They will be questioned by 53
central banks, it said.  Data will be collected at the end of April and June 2013,
with preliminary results published in September and November,
the BIS said. The final report will be released by the end of
the year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
