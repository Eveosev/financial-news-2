Egyptian businessman Ahmed Ezz was
sentenced to seven years in prison for money laundering and
fined 19.28 billion pounds ($3.2 billion), Cairo’s criminal
court said today.  Ezz, a leading member of ousted president  Hosni Mubarak ’s
now-defunct National Democratic Party, was first referred to the
criminal court in November. He was charged with laundering 6.4
billion Egyptian pounds that he allegedly raised through illicit
profiteering and the illegal appropriation of public funds, the
court said in a faxed statement, citing Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud,
Egypt’s prosecutor-general.  Ezz, now in Tora Prison in southern Cairo, was dismissed in
May from his position as chairman of Ezz Dekheila, a subsidiary
of  Ezz Steel. (ESRS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
