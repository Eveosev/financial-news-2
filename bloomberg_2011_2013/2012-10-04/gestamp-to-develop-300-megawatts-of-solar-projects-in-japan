Gestamp Solar, a unit of Spanish
industrial company  Corporacion Gestamp , plans to develop 300
megawatts of solar power in  Japan  during a three-year period,
mainly on rooftops.  The company is projecting the cost at $5,000 per kilowatt,
Jorge Barredo, chief executive officer of Gestamp Solar, said
today in Tokyo. Investment would be $1.5 billion at that rate.  “As an investor, we believe Japan offers a good
environment and the Japanese market is one of our priority
markets,” he said through a translator at a news conference.  The company plans to use mainly Japanese panels, Barredo
said. “Japanese panels fit Japanese culture and we want to have
businesses with local suppliers,” Barredo said.  Gestamp Solar develops and operates utility-scale solar
plants. The company is among new entrants to Japan following the
introduction of an incentive program for renewable energy in
July to encourage investments in clean energy projects.  Included as part of the 300 megawatts, the company plans to
develop at least 30 megawatts of solar on rooftops with
 Environmental Management Strategy Research Institute Inc. , a
Japanese consulting agency on energy management, Gestamp said in
a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
