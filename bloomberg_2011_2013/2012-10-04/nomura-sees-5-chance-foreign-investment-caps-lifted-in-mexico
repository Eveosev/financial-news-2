Mexico probably won’t pass measures
in the short-term to ease foreign investment caps, including a
49 percent limit on holdings of land-line phone companies,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  Such a measure would have a 5 percent chance of passing in
the coming months, Nomura Latin America strategist  Benito Berber 
wrote in a note to clients today. It isn’t clear whether
outgoing President  Felipe Calderon ’s administration will send
the bill to Congress, even though a deputy economy minister said
in an interview that it would, Berber wrote.  Lifting caps doesn’t appear to be a priority of incoming
President Enrique Pena Nieto’s team, and Congress won’t have
time to discuss it this session ending in December as it’s
dealing with other priority bills, according to Berber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
