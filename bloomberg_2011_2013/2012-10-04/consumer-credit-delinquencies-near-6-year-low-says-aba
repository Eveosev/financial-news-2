U.S. consumer-loan delinquencies
dropped to their lowest level in nearly six years during the
second quarter of 2012 as households prioritized debt service
over spending increases, the  American Bankers Association  said.  Delinquencies across eight loan categories fell a total of
11 basis points to 2.24 percent of all accounts in the second
quarter, the best showing since the fourth quarter of 2006, when
the rate was 2.23 percent. The rate has now been below the 15-
year average of 2.40 percent for two consecutive quarters, the
ABA said in its  Consumer Credit Delinquency Bulletin .  “Consumers are saving more and borrowing less as they work
to pay down debt at a faster rate,”  James Chessen , the
Washington-based group’s chief economist, said in a statement.
“Economic uncertainty has made consumers hesitant to take on
new debt, and building a stronger financial base has become a
priority.”  Delinquencies on bank card debt fell from 3.08 percent of
all accounts in the first quarter to an 11-year low of 2.93
percent, and well below the 15-year average of 3.91 percent.  The ABA defines a delinquency as a payment that is 30 days
or more overdue.  The broad decline masked a rise in delinquencies in some
categories, including home equity loans and lines of credit, and
direct auto loans. Home equity loan delinquencies rose 9 basis
points to 4.09 percent over the first quarter, while those for
lines of credit spiked 13 basis points to 1.91 percent, and
direct auto loans climbed 6 basis points to 2.34 percent.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “The lack of broad-based improvement gives us pause about
the future,” Chessen said. “The economy experienced turbulence
in the second quarter. Slow job growth and continued uncertainty
means many consumers will face challenges managing their debt
going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
