The euro stayed higher versus the
dollar and yen after European Central Bank policy makers kept
their benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent.  The decision was forecast by 48 of 52 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News , with four predicting a 25 basis-point cut.
ECB President  Mario Draghi  will speak at a news conference to
explain the decision at 2:30 p.m. in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  “There is a reasonable minority that is looking for a rate
cut,”  Adam Cole , global head of foreign-exchange strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada in London, said before the decision. “We
don’t, but recognize there is a risk. To the extent that there
is that minority expectation, no change would probably be a
small positive for the euro.”  The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2957 at 12:45 p.m. London
time. The common currency advanced 0.6 percent to 101.86 yen.
Japan’s currency was little changed at 78.62 per dollar.  The 17-member currency strengthened 0.2 percent versus the
greenback after the ECB left the main refinancing rate unchanged
and agreed to an unlimited debt-purchase program at its previous
meeting on Sept. 6.  The euro has risen 2 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The yen fell 1.8
percent in the period, and the dollar dropped 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
