Repsol SA (REP) , the oil producer whose  YPF
SA (YPF)  unit was seized this year, sued the Argentine company in a
Spanish court for unlawful competition.  The suit, which says that YPF shouldn’t be a competitor
against Madrid-based Repsol and is illegally benefiting from
assets that belong to Repsol, was filed without seeking a
specific amount in compensation, spokesman Kristian Rix said.  Repsol is widening litigation as it seeks as much as $10
billion from the Argentine government, which nationalized 51
percent of YPF in April. Repsol has also filed suit in
Argentina, the U.S. and the International Court of Arbitration.
The company has said it’s ready to take legal action against
anyone who now invests in YPF assets.  “We’re not going to stand idly by,” Rix said.  YPF spokesman Alejandro Dilazzaro didn’t respond to
telephone calls or e-mails in  Buenos Aires .  YPF signed an agreement with  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  last month to
develop oil and natural gas in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale
formation, a Connecticut-size area in southern Argentina that
contains at least 23 billion barrels of oil. YPF is seeking
partners for its $37.2 billion business plan to boost
production.  Repsol still owns owns a 12 percent stake in YPF, making it
the second-biggest shareholder behind the Argentine government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
