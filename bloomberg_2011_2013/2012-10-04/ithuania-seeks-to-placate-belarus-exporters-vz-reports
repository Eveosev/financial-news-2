Lithuania ’s government wants to
placate Belarus exporters after a decision by oil terminal
 Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L)  to handle Belarusian products through a
Russian intermediary,  Verslo Zinios  reported.  Belarusian companies account for a third of the cargo
passing through Lithuania’s Baltic Sea port of Klaipeda, and
could redirect other exports such as fertilizer to ports
elsewhere, the newspaper cited Lithuanian Transport Minister
Eligijus Masiulis as saying.  As of Oct. 1, Klaipedos Nafta began using OAO Lukoil’s
Litasco unit as its supplier of Belarusian oil, replacing a
Belarusian logistics company, on the ground that Litasco offered
better terms, VZ reported. The terminal says it will stay in
contact with Belarusian suppliers and handle their oil products
when capacity is available, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
