SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,  Germany ’s
biggest solar company by market value, said it will supply
Japan’s largest solar plant with its products.  SMA will supply the 70-megawatt project operated by
Kagoshima Mega Solar Power Corp. in Kagoshima City in southern
Japan with inverters, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Construction started last month and is due to be
completed by the fall of 2013, SMA said.  “The introduction of a feed-in tariff for solar power
three months ago and the decision of the government to phase out
nuclear power by 2040 announced last month underline Japan’s
desire to establish itself as a major market for photovoltaics
worldwide,” Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon said.
“In the coming years, we expect strong growth in all market
segments.”  Japan  introduced the world’s highest feed-in tariff, or
fixed-premium rate, for power from solar plants in July to boost
output and accelerate the nation’s shift away from nuclear
following the Fukushima disaster. Inverters are devices that
convert the power generated by photovoltaic panels for use in
the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
