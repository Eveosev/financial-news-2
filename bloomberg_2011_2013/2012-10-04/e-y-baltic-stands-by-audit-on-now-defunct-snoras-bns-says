Ernst & Young Baltic UAB appealed a
ruling by Lithuanian authorities that auditing controls were
inadequate when it reviewed the financial reports of Bankas
Snoras AB,  Baltic News Service  reported.  A Vilnius court has agreed to hear the appeal of the June
20 decision by the Authority of Audit and Accounting, the
newswire said. Separately, Lithuanian prosecutors this week said
they would investigate whether Ernst & Young Baltic properly
conducted the audit of Snoras’s 2010 financial statements,
according to BNS.  Ernst & Young Baltic stands by its audit opinion given on
Mar. 10, 2011, and will continue to use all resources to defend
its work on the audit, according to BNS. The bank’s auditor,
Ramunas Bartasius, whose auditor’s license was canceled by
Lithuanian authorities in June, no longer works for Ernst &
Young Baltic, BNS said.  Lithuania’s central bank took over Snoras, then the
country’s third-biggest bank by deposits, in November 2011 after
discovering assets reported on the lender’s balance sheet were
missing. The bank was declared bankrupt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
