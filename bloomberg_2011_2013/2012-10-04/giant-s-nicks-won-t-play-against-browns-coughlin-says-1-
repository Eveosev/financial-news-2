(Corrects Nicks’s age in second paragraph.)  New York Giants receiver Hakeem Nicks
won’t play against the  Cleveland Browns  this weekend after
sitting out the past two National Football League games with
foot and knee injuries.  Nicks, 24, hasn’t played since injuring his right foot and
his left knee in the Giants’ 41-34 win over the  Tampa Bay
Buccaneers  on Sept. 16, a game in which he caught 10 passes.  Coach Tom Coughlin told reporters at practice that Nicks
wouldn’t play at MetLife Stadium in three days against the
Browns (0-4), the team said on Twitter. The Giants (2-2) lost to
the Philadelphia Eagles 19-17 last week.  Nicks’s 237 yards receiving are second on the Giants after
Victor Cruz’s 388. Nicks has caught 14 passes, one for a
touchdown, this season. He was the Giants’ first-round draft
pick in 2009 from North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
