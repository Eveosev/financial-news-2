Spain’s  Supreme Court  upheld an
“illegal association” ruling against members of the Latin
Kings, which is the Spanish arm of a street gang targeted in
many  criminal prosecutions in the U.S .  The refusal to accept the group’s appeal of a lower court
ruling was published today by the Madrid-based  high court .  The organization was founded in Spain in 2000, in the
middle-class neighborhood of Galapagar on the outskirts of
Madrid, by Eric Javier Velastegui Jara, also known as King
Wolverine, according to the court.  Velastegui Jara, now 35, formed the Sacred American Tribe
of Spain of the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation, according
to the high court. He adopted rules from an Ecuadorian street
gang in forming the Madrid group and calling himself
“Godfather,” the ruling said.  Born in Ecuador, Velastegui Jara was found guilty by a
Madrid provincial court and sentenced to four years in jail in a
decision that also gave jail sentences to other members of the
gang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
