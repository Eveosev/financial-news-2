Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s
second-biggest bank, said it plans to cut 78 jobs at its main
New York office.  The reductions will begin Oct. 15 at the firm’s Madison
Avenue location, the bank said today in a filing with the state
Department of Labor. The Zurich-based lender said in July it
planned to cut 138 jobs in the same building by Oct. 14.  Credit Suisse last year announced 3,500 job cuts to help it
save about 2 billion francs ($2.15 billion) annually and said in
July it would pursue an additional cost savings of 1 billion
francs by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
