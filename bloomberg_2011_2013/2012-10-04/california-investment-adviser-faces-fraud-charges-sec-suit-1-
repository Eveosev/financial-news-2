A San Francisco-based investment
adviser faces federal criminal charges and a civil lawsuit by
securities regulators for allegedly stealing more than $500,000
from an investor.  Hausmann-Alain Banet, chief executive officer of San
Francisco-based Lion Capital Management Group, was arrested
today and charged with wire and mail fraud and  money laundering ,
according to an indictment unsealed in federal court. He was
also sued today by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Banet, 49, allegedly took $544,000 from a client and
falsely claimed that he invested it in a hedge fund. He created
false account statements showing trading gains and spent the
money on personal and business expenses, prosecutors in San
Francisco said in an e-mail. Banet is in custody pending an Oct.
9 bail hearing, prosecutors said.  Jodi Linker, an attorney with the federal public defender’s
office in San Francisco representing Banet, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the cases.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Banet, 12-715, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ). The SEC
case is 12-5116, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
