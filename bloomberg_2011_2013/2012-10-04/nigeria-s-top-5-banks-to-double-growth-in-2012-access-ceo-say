Nigeria ’s five biggest lenders are
set to double growth this year as shared profits increase to
$1.6 billion from $400 million in 2005,  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  Chief
Executive Officer Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede said.  “The Nigerian banking system is poised for a new era of
competition,” he told an investor conference today in Lagos,
Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Access Bank last year acquired Intercontinental Bank Plc,
one of eight lenders bailed out by the central bank in 2009
after a debt crisis caused in part by loans to speculators in
equities.  The Lagos-based bank, which is the West African nation’s
fourth largest by market value, said Sept. 11 that net income in
the six months through June jumped to 26.3 billion naira ($168
million) from 8.05 billion naira a year earlier, as revenue
doubled to 108.7 billion naira.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc is Nigeria’s biggest bank by market
value, followed by Zenith Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Plc,
Access Bank and  United Bank  for Africa Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
