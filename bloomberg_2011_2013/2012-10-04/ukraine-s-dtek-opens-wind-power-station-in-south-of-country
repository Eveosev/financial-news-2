DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private coal
and power producer, opened a wind power station today in the
south of the country.  The first 19 wind power turbines have been installed in
Botievo in the region of Zaporizhzhya and 11 more will be added
before the end of 2012, Kiev-based DTEK said today in an e-
mailed statement. They will have a combined capacity of 90
megawatts, the company said. A further 110 megawatts will be
added by the end of 2013, according to the statement.  The Botievo wind power station will allow for the annual
reduction of carbon dioxide of 730,000 tons, Maxim Timchenko,
DTEK’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
