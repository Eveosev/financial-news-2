(Corrects location in second paragraph.)  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest producer of  wind turbines , is consolidating its U.S.
research-and-development operations into a single site in
Brighton, Colorado, as part of a global push to centralize
design efforts.  The company is closing facilities in Houston, Louisville,
Colorado, and Marlborough, Massachusetts, and affected employees
have the option of transferring to Brighton, Andrew Longeteig, a
spokesman for Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas, said today in an
interview.  The company is also closing R&D operations in Singapore and
Denmark in the next few weeks, and will consolidate at other
sites in Denmark, the U.S., the U.K., Germany and India, he
said.  “It’s a global change,” Longeteig said. “When it all
shakes out in the next six or seven months, we’ll have about six
R&D facilities worldwide.”  Vestas is cutting its global workforce about 16 percent
this year to 19,000 workers. The company in August fired about
120  Colorado  factory workers at the Brighton plant and in
Pueblo. It still has about 3,000 employees in the U.S. and
Canada, Longeteig said.  The U.S. consolidation was reported earlier by the Northern
Colorado Business Report.  Vestas fell 6.1 percent to 35.6 kroner in Copenhagen today
for its seventh straight decline, the longest losing streak
since Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
