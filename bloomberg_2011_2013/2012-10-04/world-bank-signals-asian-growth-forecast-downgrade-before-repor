The  World Bank  signaled it may lower
its economic forecasts for Asia next week as Europe’s protracted
sovereign-debt crisis, a faltering recovery in the U.S. and
slowing Chinese growth crimp the region’s prospects.  “In line with other people we are also looking at a
downgrade of the forecast,” Bert Hofman, the Washington-based
lender’s chief economist for the East Asia and Pacific region,
said in an interview in Singapore today. The bank will publish a
review of the region’s developing economies on Oct. 8.  Asia’s weakening outlook prompted the  Asian Development
Bank  to cut its 2012 regional growth estimate yesterday as
demand for the region’s goods weakens. Central banks in Japan,
 South Korea , Indonesia,  Thailand , India and the Philippines are
scheduled to meet this month to determine monetary policy as the
region gauges the need for more stimulus measures.  Growth in developing East Asia, which excludes Japan and
India, will probably ease to 7.6 percent this year from 8.2
percent in 2011, the World Bank said in May. In November, the
forecast for 2012 had been 7.8 percent.  “We continue to see the headwinds from Europe and to some
extent the United States, where the recovery is still not as
buoyant as one would like,” Hofman said. “We’re signaling that
we are also seeing a slowdown in the Asian economies.”  While the Chinese “see a further slowdown,” other
countries are showing “quite robust domestic demand,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
