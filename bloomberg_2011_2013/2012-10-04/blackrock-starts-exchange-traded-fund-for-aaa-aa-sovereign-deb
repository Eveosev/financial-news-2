BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  said it will start an
exchange-traded fund tracking AAA and AA rated sovereign bonds
to offer investors “high-quality government debt with global
diversification.”  The fund will invest in fixed-rate, local-currency bonds
rated AA3 or higher, based on the median of grades from Fitch
Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s,
BlackRock said today in an e-mailed statement.  No AAA country will account for more than 20 percent of the
fund and no AA rated nation’s debt will be more than 10 percent
of investments, BlackRock said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
