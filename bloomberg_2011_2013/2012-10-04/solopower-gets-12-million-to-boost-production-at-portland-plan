SoloPower Inc., a closely held maker
of thin-film solar panels, received a $12 million investment to
increase production at a manufacturing plant that opened last
week in Portland, Oregon.  The company disclosed the funding in a filing today that
didnâ€™t identify the four participating investors. The first line
may reach production capacity of 75 megawatts of panels a year
in 2013, John Keaten, a spokesman for  San Jose , California-based
SoloPower, said today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
