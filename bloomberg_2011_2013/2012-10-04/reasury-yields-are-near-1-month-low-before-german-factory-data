Treasury 10-year notes fell, snapping
four days of gains, before the Federal Reserve releases minutes
of its Sept. 12-13 meeting amid speculation monetary easing will
bolster the U.S. economy and stoke inflation.  Thirty-year bonds dropped for a second day. The yield
 spread  between 10-year notes and similar-maturity inflation-
linked bonds, a gauge of expectations for consumer prices, was
2.48 percent today, up from 1.95 percent at the end of last
year. The decline in Treasury prices was limited before a report
today that economists predict will show orders placed with U.S.
factories dropped in August.  “The U.S. economy may be subdued, but it’s not falling off
the cliff,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “As
investors become more confident that the central bank will
continue to ensure that we get out of this low-growth
environment, then they will probably focus on inflation risk
rather than deflation risk. This will reduce demand for longer-
dated Treasuries.”  The  yield  on 10-year notes rose two basis point, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 7:53 a.m. New York time,
after climbing to 1.64 percent. The 1.625 percent note due
August 2022 dropped 4/32, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
30/32. The 30-year yield added one basis point, to 2.83 percent.  The Fed unveiled a third round of so-called quantitative
easing last month with open-ended purchases of $40 billion a
month in mortgage-backed securities. Minutes of the Federal Open
Market Committee’s September meeting may hint at the
introduction of more steps, according strategists at  Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Additional Measures  “It is possible that the minutes may contain suggestions”
for some additional measures, which could be implemented at
future FOMC meetings, Credit Suisse strategists led by Michael Chang in New York, wrote in a research note yesterday.  The Fed’s own measure of inflation expectations, the five-
year, five-year forward break-even rate, was 2.68 percent today,
up from 2.46 percent at the start of the year. The gauge
projects the expected pace of consumer price increases over the
five-year period beginning 2017.  A Labor Department report due tomorrow will show the U.S.
jobless rate rose to 8.2 percent in September from 8.1 percent
the prior month, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Payrolls are forecast to have
increased by 115,000, less than the 139,000 average over the
first eight months of the year.  U.S. Jobs  The figures will follow a report from ADP Employer Services
yesterday that showed jobs gained by 162,000 last month,
compared with a revised 189,000 in August.  The U.S. Treasury will today announce the size of bond
auctions scheduled for next week. It will probably sell $32
billion of three-year notes on Oct. 9, $21 billion of 10-year
debt the next day and $13 billion of 30-year securities on Oct.
11, according to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory
company in Jersey City, New Jersey, that specializes in
government finance.  Demand for Treasuries was underpinned before data in  Europe 
tomorrow that may show factory orders in  Germany  dropped, adding
to evidence the euro bloc’s debt crisis is hurting the economy,
the region’s biggest.  Factory orders , adjusted for seasonal
swings and inflation, slid 0.5 percent in August from the
previous month, a separate survey of economists shows.  Europe Worsening  “The euro area’s core countries, such as Germany, have
supported the region’s growth, but their economies are getting
worse now,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of  Japan ’s
third-largest lender by market value. “Demand for Treasuries as
a safe asset remains strong.”  Spain sold 3.99 billion euros ($5.16 billion) of debt due
in 2015, 2014 and 2017. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on
Oct. 2 that he has no plans to ask for a bailout soon, damping
expectations that a request was imminent.  The European Central Bank meets today and is forecast to
keep its  benchmark  interest rate unchanged at a record low of
0.75 percent.  The Fed is  scheduled  to buy today as much as $2.25 billion
of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to August 2042 as part
of its  program  to replace shorter-term notes in its holdings
with longer-maturity debt.  Treasuries returned 2.4 percent this year, compared with a
1.86 percent gain from Japanese government bonds, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German bonds handed
investors a 3.2 percent return during the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
