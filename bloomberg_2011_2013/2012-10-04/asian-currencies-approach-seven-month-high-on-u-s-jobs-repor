Asian currencies climbed to a seven-
month high after a report showed U.S. jobs rose more than
economists estimated, tempering concern about a global slowdown
and bolstering appetite for riskier assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, touched 117.43, the highest
since March. India’s rupee rose to a level not seen since April
and the Philippine peso reached its strongest in more than two
weeks after data showed American employers added 162,000 jobs
last month, topping the median forecast of 140,000 by economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The  European Central Bank  meets
today to discuss ways to contain the region’s debt turmoil.  “Sentiment was boosted by the decent U.S. data, which
suggests the recovery may be gaining some traction,” said
 Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
Singapore. “However, price action so far is still muted ahead
of the ECB meeting tonight.”  The rupee jumped 0.7 percent to 51.8175 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
51.7375, the strongest level since April 19. The Philippines
peso gained 0.3 percent to 41.467, after touching 41.465, the
strongest since Sept. 17. The Malaysian ringgit appreciated 0.2
percent to 3.0538.  Asian stocks rose after services industries in the world’s
largest economy grew by the most in six months, according to the
Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index.
Growth in Asia excluding Japan will accelerate to 7.3 percent in
2013 from 6.3 percent this year, HSBC Holdings Plc’s Hong Kong-
based economists Qu Hongbin and  Frederic Neumann  wrote in a note
released today.  Global Stimulus  The ECB unveiled a plan last month for unlimited buying of
 government bonds , after which the  Federal Reserve  and the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  expanded their asset-purchase programs. The Fed
announced on Sept. 13 it will start open-ended purchases of $40
billion of mortgage debt per month, in a third round of so-
called quantitative easing.  “Following the QE3, any labor market data going forward
will affect” the peso, said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in Singapore.
“Overall, there’s a slight improvement in risk-taking.”  The baht touched a seven-month high as data from the Thai
Bond Market Association showed global investors  bought  $304
million more government notes than they sold in the first three
days of this week. The currency increased 0.3 percent to 30.57
after rising to 30.56 earlier, the highest since March 9.  China Tourism  The ringgit gained after Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib
Razak said in an interview with CNBC today that policy makers
are trying to develop a “very strong” domestic economy and
create more “growth industries.”  China’s tourism data from the Golden Week holiday that
started Oct. 1 supported bets that the economy is headed for a
soft landing, Lu Ting, a China economist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report today, saying worries over a
hard landing were ‘overdone.’  Tourist attractions’ sales in  Asia ’s biggest economy rose
25 percent from a year earlier, according to the report.
Financial markets in China are closed this week.  “We expect China data to improve this month and next month
as some of the fiscal spending kicks in,” said Cliff Tan, a
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in  Hong Kong . “That
will be enough to drive Asian currencies stronger.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah and Taiwanese dollar were
little changed at 9,587 per dollar and NT$29.388, respectively,
and the South Korean won weakened to 1,113.75 from 1,112.68 on
Oct. 2. Financial markets in Seoul were closed yesterday for a
holiday. Vietnam’s dong was steady at 20,890.  To contact the reporter on this story:
