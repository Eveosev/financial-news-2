Ceres (CWR)  Power Holdings Plc, a developer
of fuel cells generating power and heating for homes, slid the
most on record in London after saying it may close the business.  Ceres declined by 74 percent to 2.3 pence by 10:22 a.m. in
trading in the city, the steepest collapse since the Horsham,
England-based company first sold shares in November 2004.  The company “has been unsuccessful in securing sufficient
funding for the business,” it said today in a statement. Ceres
is exploring “a sale of the business, cancellation of the
listing, and in the absence of any alternative proposals
commencement of an orderly wind down of the business.”  The stock has fallen more than 93 percent since saying Oct.
12, 2011, that its products wouldn’t be commercially available
until the first half of 2014. The schedule was 2 1/2 years later
than planned and was itself scrapped in March when Ceres said it
would focus on a more advanced product to go on sale in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
