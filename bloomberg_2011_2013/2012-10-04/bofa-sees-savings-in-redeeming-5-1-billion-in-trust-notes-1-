Bank of America Corp.  will redeem
$5.1 billion in trust-preferred securities, its biggest single
such transaction in a campaign to trim pricey forms of debt, in
a move that shaves $350 million in interest costs through 2013.  The redemptions, scheduled for next month, will prompt a
$100 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement. The
securities paid rates as high as 7.8 percent, according to the
statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 52, is reducing
his firm’s long-term debt while raising capital to meet demands
from regulators for a larger cushion against losses. Trust-
preferred securities, which have characteristics of both equity
and debt, won’t count as Tier 1 common equity under coming rules
set by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision .  The lender retired $5.5 billion of debt and trust-preferred
securities in the second quarter and $4.9 billion in debt and
trust securities in the first quarter, according to earnings
statements.  Moynihan has said he is leaning more on federally insured
deposits to reduce interest costs. Bank of America pays about
$500 million a quarter in interest for its $1 trillion of
deposits compared with about $2.5 billion for $300 billion of
long-term debt, Moynihan said on a July 18 investor call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
