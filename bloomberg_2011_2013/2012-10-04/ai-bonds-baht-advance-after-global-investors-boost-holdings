Thailand ’s government bonds rose for
a fourth day and the baht advanced after foreign funds added to
their holdings of the nation’s sovereign debt that offers higher
yields than in developed nations.  The five-year yield dropped to its lowest level in almost a
month and the baht touched an almost seven-month high as data
from the Thai Bond Market Association showed global investors
 bought  $304 million more government notes than they sold in the
first three days of this week. Thailand’s 10-year rate is 3.49
percent, compared with 1.63 percent for similar-maturity
Treasuries and 0.77 percent for  Japan ’s securities. The U.S. is
due to release employment data on Oct. 5.  “Investors like to put money in Thailand but because risk
sentiment is not so strong, they prefer to put money into the
bond markets,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange
trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “We are waiting for non-farm
payroll data out of the U.S. this week.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.25 percent, as of
3:11 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the lowest level since Sept. 9.  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent to 30.57 per dollar and
reached 30.56 earlier, the most since March 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
