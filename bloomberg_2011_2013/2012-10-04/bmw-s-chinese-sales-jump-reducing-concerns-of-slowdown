Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s car
sales in China surged in September, easing investors’ concerns
that the world’s biggest automotive market is slowing and
sending the manufacturer’s shares to a two-week high.  Deliveries jumped 59 percent to 29,631 BMW- and Mini-brand
vehicles last month on demand for the extended version of the 3-
Series sedan and the X1 compact sport-utility vehicle, Linda Croissant, a spokeswoman at the Munich-based company, said by
telephone. In the first nine months of 2012, BMW’s Chinese sales
climbed 34 percent from a year earlier to 237,056 cars.  “This strength has legs to it,” said  David Arnold , an
auto-industry specialist with Credit Suisse in London. “China’s
still a growth market, but the market’s normalizing, which is
what we need.”  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi unit and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz,
which rank behind BMW in global luxury-car sales, also posted
stronger demand in September in China, even as the country’s
economy shows signs of cooling. China’s services industry
expanded at the slowest rate in more than a year in September,
and manufacturing has contracted for 11 consecutive months.  BMW  rose  3.2 percent to 59.76 euros in  Frankfurt , the
highest close since Sept. 21. Daimler  gained  1.2 percent to
38.505 euros, and VW  increased  2.9 percent to 145.35 euros.  Audi said yesterday that September sales in China advanced
20 percent to 35,512 vehicles. Deliveries by Stuttgart, Germany-
based Mercedes totaled 16,806 cars and SUVs in China, a gain of
10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
