BrokerCreditService ,  Russia ’s largest
stock trader by volume, said it hired Olga Naydenova, a senior
financial analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp.  Naydenova, who was also a macroeconomist at Otkritie,
started today in Moscow, BCS said in an e-mailed statement.
Prior to Otkritie, she worked at  Alfa Bank  for three years, the
company said.  BCS overtook Otkritie in August as the leading trader of
equities on the Russia’s benchmark Micex index, according to
 data  posted on the exchange’s website. The Moscow-based
brokerage firm, which is owned by Siberian banker Oleg Mikhasenko, has hired at least a dozen bankers this year from
Otkritie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
