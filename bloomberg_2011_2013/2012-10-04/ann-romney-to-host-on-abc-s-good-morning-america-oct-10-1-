Ann Romney , the wife of Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Romney, will guest-host ABC’s “Good
Morning America” on Oct. 10, the network said.  Romney will fill in during the 8 a.m. hour, Alison
Bridgman, a spokeswoman for the show, said today in an e-mail.
The Walt Disney Co.-owned network has lined up guest hosts
including Stephen Colbert and Jessica Simpson to substitute for
Robin Roberts, who is on medical leave.  The network is in discussions with First Lady  Michelle Obama  to also fill in on the show, according to a person with
knowledge of the situation. No time has yet been scheduled, the
person said.  “Good Morning America” won the morning show ratings race
in the  season premiere week  that ended Sept. 24 for the first
time in twenty years, the network said. The program drew almost
5 million total viewers, versus 4.1 million at NBC’s “Today”
show and 2.5 million at “CBS This Morning,” ABC said, citing
Nielsen data.  Last night’s debate between Romney and President Barack Obama averaged 67 million TV viewers, a 28 percent increase from
the first presidential face-off of the campaign four years ago.
ABC also claimed victory in its debate coverage last night,
drawing 11.3 million viewers for the Denver showdown.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC came in second with 11.1 million,
versus 10.6 million at  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s broadcast network and 10.4
million at  News Corp. (NWS) ’s Fox News.  The scheduling moves at “Good Morning America” were
reported earlier by the Hollywood Reporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
