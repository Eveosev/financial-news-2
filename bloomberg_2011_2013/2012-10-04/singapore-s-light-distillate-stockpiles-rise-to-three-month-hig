Singapore ’s stockpiles of light
distillates rose to the highest level in three months, according
to data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  light distillates  such as naphtha,
reformate and gasoline increased 6.9 percent to 10.4 million
barrels in the week ended Oct. 3,  International Enterprise
Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Supplies are at the highest level since July 4.  Stockpiles of  residues , a category that includes  fuel oil 
and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen, fell 3.4
percent to 17.9 million barrels, the lowest in five weeks.
 Middle distillates  such as gasoil and kerosene dropped 2.3
percent to 9.1 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
