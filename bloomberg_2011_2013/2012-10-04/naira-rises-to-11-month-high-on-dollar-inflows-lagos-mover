Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for a
second day, reaching its highest in 11 months as  oil companies 
sold dollars and the addition of the country’s debt to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. benchmark indexes attracted offshore funds.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer strengthened
0.4 percent to 156.55 per dollar as of 11:10 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. A close at this level will be its strongest
since Nov. 3, 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
naira has appreciated 3.7 percent this year, the best-performer
in Africa.  Debt maturing in March 2014, October 2019 and January 2022
will join JPMorgan’s indexes between Oct. 1 and Dec. 3, Giulia Pellegrini, the bank’s London-based sub-Saharan Africa
economist, wrote in a note Sept. 26. Oil producing companies,
which sell dollars at the end of the month to meet domestic
expenses, are the second-biggest source of the currency after
the  Central Bank of Nigeria . The nation’s  foreign-currency
reserves  rose to a more than two-year high of $41.3 billion on
Oct. 2, according to data from the Abuja-based central bank.  “The naira has firmed and reserves have increased,”
helped by offshore money from the inclusion of  government bonds 
into JP Morgan index, FBN Capital Ltd. analysts in London led by
Gregory Kronsten wrote in an e-mailed note today.  The market is expecting dollar sales from the local unit of
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  today while Chevron Corp.’s unit sold
yesterday, Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone today.  Yields on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent debt maturing January
2022 fell 16 basis points to 12.66 percent on Oct. 2, the first
trading day after their inclusion in the JPMorgan Chase & Co.
index, according to data on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website. It rose 8 basis points to 12.74 percent
yesterday. The yield on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds
due January 2021 fell one basis point to 4.778 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8945 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
