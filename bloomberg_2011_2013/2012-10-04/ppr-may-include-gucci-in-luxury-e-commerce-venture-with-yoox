PPR SA (PP)  may eventually include the
Gucci brand in its e-commerce luxury venture with  Yoox SpA (YOOX)  as it
seeks to get online sales of more than 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) by 2020, Managing Director Jean-Francois Palus said.  When the joint venture proves its full potential, “then we
will consider having Gucci join the platform,” Palus said today
at a presentation to reporters in Paris.  PPR agreed in May to set up a venture with Yoox for the
Paris-based company’s Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent,
 Alexander McQueen , Balenciaga, Stella McCartney and Sergio Rossi
brands. Gucci will continue to run its own e-commerce for now,
e-business senior vice-president Federico Barbieri said.  PPR may also develop a similar e-commerce venture for its
sports and lifestyle brands, which include Puma, Palus said. The
platform won’t necessarily be with Yoox, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
