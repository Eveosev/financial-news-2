Cyprus approved the creation of a new
company to handle sales of recently discovered natural-gas
reserves, Commerce Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis said.  The Cyprus Hydrocarbons State Company will be run as a
private entity, Sylikiotis said today, according to a  transcript 
of his comments on the Ministryâ€™s website. Revenue from the
company will be directed to a special fund for hydrocarbon
infrastructure investment as well as to the state budget and a
savings plan for future generations, he said.  The government also commissioned the  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology  to prepare a report on integrating
Cypriot hydrocarbon reserves into the national energy system.
The study, in addition, will focus on the commercialization and
distribution of hydrocarbons to European and international
markets, infrastructure issues and possible cooperation with
other countries in the southeastern Mediterranean, Sylikiotis
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
