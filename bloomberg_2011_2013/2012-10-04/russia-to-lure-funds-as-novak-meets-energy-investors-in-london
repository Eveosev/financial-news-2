Russian Energy Minister Alexander
Novak will meet with international investors in  London  on Oct. 9
as the world’s biggest oil and gas producing nation seeks funds
to develop increasingly challenging deposits.  Novak, a former deputy finance minister, will meet more
than 50 institutional investors managing more than $2.5
trillion, Dmitry Klokov, his spokesman, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  President  Vladimir Putin  has overseen oil alliances with
Exxon Mobil Corp., Eni SpA and Statoil ASA this year to help OAO
Rosneft with technology and financing to tap remote and complex
reserves as traditional fields deplete. Putin has called for
 Russia , which depends on oil and gas for half its budget
revenue, to keep crude output at more than 10 million barrels a
day, a post-Soviet high, for at least a decade.  Novak will explain to investors about tax incentives to
help develop new projects in eastern Siberia, offshore deposits,
and hard-to-recover reserves, Klokov said.  Russia needs as much as $1 trillion of total investment in
oil, gas and power to 2020, Novak said in an interview on Sept.
20. The London presentation will be followed by  New York  in
November, Novak said in September.  Igor Sechin , Rosneft’s chief executive officer, will meet
with investors in London tomorrow to explain the state-run
company’s strategy as it seeks to buy BP Plc’s half of TNK-BP,
the country’s third-biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
