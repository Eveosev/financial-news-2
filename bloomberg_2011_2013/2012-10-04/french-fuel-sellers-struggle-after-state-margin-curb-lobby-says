French retail fuel distributors are
struggling to survive a government measure to lower prices at
the pump, according to a lobby group.  “We made some people happy for a few euros and as a result
a lot could lose their jobs,” said Christian Roux, president of
the CNPA representing 5,500 independent fuel distributors across
 France . As many as half its small business members may fail to
survive the measures, which are hurting profit margins, he said.  Roux spoke after a meeting today between distributors and
ministers on measures announced Aug. 28 to cut fuel prices for
consumers. The country gave a 3 cent a liter tax rebate on fuel
for three months and got distributors to almost match the drop.  The decrease is “extremely satisfactory,” French Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said. Longer lasting measures would be
announced at the end of the three months that began Aug. 28.  The government has been under pressure to ameliorate prices
that had risen to a record for diesel after President  Francois
Hollande  promised a temporary freeze in his election campaign.
The country scrapped a freeze in favor of a tax rebate combined
with a lowering of profit margins made on distribution.  “People have to accept  oil prices  are global and they rise
and fall,” Roux said. “No election promise can change this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
