Burkina Faso  expects an increase in
gold mining, its biggest source of foreign currency, to boost
economic expansion to 7 percent next year, faster than the
International Monetary Fund’s forecast, said National Budget
Director Hamadou Sangare.  The outlook is part of the West African nation’s spending
and revenue plan for next year, which is currently being debated
by the National Assembly, he said by phone on Oct. 2 in
Ouagadougou, the capital.  Expansion in the landlocked country will outpace the
African average of 5.8 percent, according to the IMF, which
forecast growth of 6.4 percent for 2013 from 5 percent this
year. Gold production is expected to increase to 65 to 70 tons
by 2015, according to Mines, Quarries and Energy Minister Salif
Lamoussa Kabore.  Burkina Faso began mining gold for the first time in 12
years when Somita SA, a unit of High River Gold Mines Ltd.,
started its operation in 2007. The country has seven mines
currently, including Iamgold Corp.’s Essakane SA, Semafo Inc. of
Canada and Endeavour Mining Corp.  Mining is expected to bring revenue of 842 billion  CFA
francs  ($1.7 billion) to the country this year from 718 billion
francs in 2011, Kabore said in an interview on Oct. 1.  “Government wants to diversify the country’s mines,”
Kabore said. The  World Bank  is lending 15 billion francs to
compile a data bank of its natural resources, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
