France  could revise a planned
increase in  capital gains  tax to give more incentives to
startups, Le Monde reported, citing an interview with Digital-
Economy Delegate Minister Fleur Pellerin.  The government will discuss “refining” its taxation plans
with small-business owners, Pellerin said, according to the
newspaper. Adjustments could be made to how long an entrepreneur
has to hold a company before his capital gains tax rate is
lowered, she said.  “We want to tax capital gains from real-estate, stocks,
art,” Pellerin was quoted as saying in the French daily
newspaper. “We certainly don’t want to discourage
entrepreneurship and risk taking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
