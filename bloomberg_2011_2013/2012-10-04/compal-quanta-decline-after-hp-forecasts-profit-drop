Compal Electronics Co. (2324)  and  Quanta
Computer (2382)  Inc. lead Taiwan computer makers lower after customer
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  forecast 2013 profit that missed analyst
estimates, a sign demand is less than some had expected.  Compal fell 3.4 percent to NT$24.10, its lowest since April
3, 2009 on a closing basis, as of 12:09 p.m. in Taipei trading.
Quanta Computer fell 4 percent, the most in two months. The
benchmark Taiex index lost 0.1 percent.  Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman
yesterday forecast 2013 profit that missed estimates and said a
turnaround at the computer maker won’t happen soon. The PC
market will expand less than 1 percent this year, the worst
performance since it shrank in 2001, according to IDC.  Wistron Corp. (3231)  dropped 4.8 percent, the most since July 27.
 Inventec Corp. (2356)  declined 0.9 percent.  Wistron’s core notebook business faces a decline year on
year in 2013 “as notebook makers start to consolidate their
supplier base in an environment that has limited growth
prospects,” Citibank analyst Wei Chen said in a report dated
Oct. 3.  “Wistron appears to be losing orders from such key OEM
clients as HP, Dell and Lenovo,” Chen said. The three customers
make up 70 percent to 75 percent of the total notebook shipments
for Wistron in 2012, said Chen who has a new sell rating on the
shares with a target price of NT$29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
