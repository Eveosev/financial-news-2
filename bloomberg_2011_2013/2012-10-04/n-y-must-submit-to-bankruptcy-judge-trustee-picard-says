The liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s
firm said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman must
submit to bankruptcy law that bars him from completing a
$410 million settlement with  Ezra Merkin , one of the con man’s
former investors. Asking U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff not to
grant Schneiderman’s request that he review the case, trustee
 Irving Picard , who says only he can take Merkin’s money and
share it among Ponzi victims, said he “seeks to protect estate
assets from being dissipated,” according to a filing in federal
court in Manhattan.  The attorney general, who has said the settlement money
will go to investors not eligible for compensation by Picard,
told Rakoff that Picard is interfering with his ability to
enforce the law.  “Determination of this action will have broad ramifications
for the ability of state law enforcement and regulatory agencies
to exercise their authority to prosecute violations of state
laws,’’ he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
