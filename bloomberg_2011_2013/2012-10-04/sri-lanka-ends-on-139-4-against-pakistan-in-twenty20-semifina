Pakistan has a victory target of 140
runs after restricting host  Sri Lanka  to 139-4 in their
semifinal at the World Twenty20 cricket tournament in Colombo.  Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. Mahela
Jayawardene and  Tillakaratne Dilshan  started quickly, combining
for 63 before Jayawardene was caught by Raza Hasan off Shahid
Afridi.  Pakistan, the 2009 champion, brought in Umar Gul and Saeed
Ajmal to bowl the last few overs to put pressure on the batsmen.
The plan worked, keeping the Sri Lankans, who are trying for
their first Twenty20 world title, off balance until the final
over, which went for 16 runs.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The winner of today’s
match advances to the Oct. 7 final against the winner of
tomorrow’s semifinal between West Indies and  Australia .  The champions will pick up $1 million in prize money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
