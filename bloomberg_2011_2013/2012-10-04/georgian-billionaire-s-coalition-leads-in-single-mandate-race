Georgian billionaire Bidzina
Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition won 39 of 73 seats available
in the single-mandate race in Oct. 1 parliamentary elections,
Rustavi 2 reported, citing the Election Commission.  President Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement
took the other 34 seats, the Tbilisi-based television station
said today. Chiora Taktakishvili, a spokeswoman for UNM,
confirmed her party’s result. Election Commission officials
refused to comment until all votes are counted. Georgian Dream
press officials were not immediately available for comment.  With 99.7 percent of the ballots tallied, Georgia Dream had
54.9 percent versus 40.4 percent for UNM. No other parties
managed to overcome the 5 percent threshold needed for
representation. Another 77 seats in the legislature will be
allocated through voting for party lists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
