Lenders are becoming stronger
following calls from the U.K. financial watchdog to raise
capital, said  Andrew Bailey , head of banking supervision at the
Financial Services Authority.  Regulators “can see a picture of gradually improving
resilience in the banking system,” Bailey said in prepared
remarks for a speech in  Scotland  today. Lending growth has
remained slow, Bailey said, despite the FSA relaxing guidance on
how banks calculate liquidity buffers in June.  “It is too soon to assess the impact of all these changes
on the resilience of the financial system and on credit
creation,” Bailey said. “We will monitor the results of these
actions very carefully, and we will be prepared to amend our
judgments in the light of experience.”  The FSA has said it would include  Bank of England  liquidity
measures in calculations of banks’ liquid asset buffers giving
lenders more room to dip to into reserves. U.K. lenders have
built up liquidity buffers worth around 500 billion pounds ($807
billion) since the 2008 financial crisis, Andy Haldane, the
central bank’s director for financial stability, said in June.  The  Prudential Regulatory Authority  will be responsible for
bank oversight next year when the financial watchdog is
disbanded. The PRA will allow big banks to fail where the cost
to the wider financial system is limited, Bailey, who is CEO-
elect of the agency, said.  “I regard having the capacity to resolve failed large
banks, including the largest, as the Holy Grail of resolution,”
Bailey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
