Contec Holdings Ltd. , the cable-box
repair company owned by Bain Capital LLC, won court approval of
a bankruptcy recovery plan that will shed long-term debt by
about $300 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey approved the plan today
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Under the pre-packaged plan, long-term debt will be reduced
to about $52.5 million from about $350 million, if the exit
financing is fully drawn, court papers show.  Contec Holdings, based in Schenectady, New York, listed
debt of as much as $500 million and assets of as much as
$100 million in Chapter 11 documents filed Aug. 29.  Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential nominee, co-
founded Bain in 1984. Romney left Bain in 1999 to oversee the
Salt Lake City Olympics. He served as governor of Massachusetts
from 2003 to 2007.  Bain acquired Contec in 2008 from  American Capital Ltd. (ACAS) , a
Bethesda, Maryland-based asset manager, which said at the time
that it made $120 million from its two-year investment in
Contec, including dividends and profit from the sale.  Contec, founded in 1978, repairs millions of digital cable
set-top units, modems and satellite receivers each year,
according to its  website . It has repair plants in Schenectady,
Seattle, Mexico City and Matamoros, Mexico, where it opened a
240,000-square-foot facility in January 2009.  Bain, a Boston-based private-equity firm that manages
 $65 billion  in assets, has invested in companies such as Toys
“R” Us Inc. and  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN)   The case is In re  CHL Ltd. (CHL) , 12-12437, U.S. Bankruptcy
