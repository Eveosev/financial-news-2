Dana Davis, the  Memphis  Grizzlies’ vice president of basketball operations and team programs, was found dead in his apartment yesterday, the club said. He was 56.  Davis was set to begin his 13th season with the National Basketball Association team, where he oversaw player development through educational programs and one-on-one player mentoring, the Grizzlies said in a statement on their website.  The team said details surrounding Davis’s death weren’t available.  The  Commercial-Appeal , a Memphis newspaper, reported that Davis was found after team officials, suspicious when he didn’t show up for work yesterday, asked local police to search his apartment. Foul play isn’t suspected, according to the newspaper.  “Double-D was the most charitable and generous individual I have ever met,” Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley said in a statement. “What Dana couldn’t give in monetary donations, he more than made up for with the amount of time he gave to causes close to his and the Grizzlies’ hearts.”  One of the original members of the Grizzlies’ management team when the franchise moved to Memphis from  Vancouver  in 2001, Davis was also responsible for the team’s travel schedule, accommodations and security while on the road.  The Grizzlies went 41-25, and finished second to the  San Antonio Spurs  in the Southwest Division last year.
