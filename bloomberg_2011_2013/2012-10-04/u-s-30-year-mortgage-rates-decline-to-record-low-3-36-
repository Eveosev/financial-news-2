Rates for 30-year U.S. mortgages
declined to a record low for the second straight week, extending
a drop in borrowing costs after applications for home loans
jumped to a three-year high.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 3.36
percent in the week ended today from 3.4 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. It was the
lowest in data going back to 1971. The average 15-year rate
dropped to 2.69 percent, also a record, from 2.73 percent.  Rates have declined since the  Federal Reserve ’s September
announcement that it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed
securities a month to help support the housing market and
stimulate the economy. Home-loan  applications  climbed 16.6
percent in the week ended Sept. 28 to the highest level since
April 2009, according to the  Mortgage Bankers Association . An
index measuring  refinancing  surged 19.6 percent, while the
 purchase  gauge gained 3.9 percent, the Washington-based group
said yesterday.  “Applications for home purchase remain very low by
historic standards,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for
London-based Capital Economics Ltd., wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. “And with mortgage lending criteria as strict as
ever, many mortgage applicants may still find themselves being
turned down.”  Contracts to buy previously owned homes dropped 2.6 percent
in August after a revised 2.6 percent gain in July that was more
than initially reported, the National Association of Realtors
said last week.  Low borrowing costs are spurring mortgage prepayments,
which have soared to the highest level in seven years. Loans
were repaid in August at a pace that would erase 25 percent of
the debt in a year, according to  Lender Processing Services
Inc. (LPS) , a Jacksonville, Florida-based data provider that tracks 40
million mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
