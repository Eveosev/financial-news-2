Ecuadorean consumer prices rose the
most since 2008 in September, led by increases in food and
education costs as students returned to classes, the country’s
statistics agency reported today.  Prices in the Andean nation increased 1.12 percent in the
 month , the biggest jump since April 2008, and rose 5.22 percent
from a  year  earlier, the National Statistics and Census
Institute said in a report on its  website .  Rising wages and increased public spending, forecast by the
government to jump 9 percent in 2012, have boosted demand in
 South America ’s seventh-biggest economy, driving prices higher,
said Maria Herrera, an economics professor at the Universidad
Catolica in  Quito . Above-average rainfall and a volcano eruption
this year have also reduced output of food staples such as
potatoes and onions, she said.  “It’s demand inflation,” Herrera said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “Basically, it’s the government’s increase
in public spending that has directly affected wages, which means
there’s more demand.”  Prices rose the fastest year-on-year in the coastal city of
Manta, jumping 7.01 percent, while inflation was 4.48 percent in
the nation’s largest city, Guayaquil, the agency said. Ecuador,
a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
subsidizes fuel costs and the domestic use of natural gas.  Producer prices fell 0.28 percent from the previous month
and increased 1.72 percent from September 2011, the report said.  Consumer prices are forecast to gain an average 5.14
percent this year compared with 4.47 percent in 2011, according
to the  Finance Ministry ’s 2012 budget. That’s in line with the
median increase of 5 percent forecast by six economists in a
Sept. 27 survey by Bloomberg. The country’s central bank said in
July the economy may expand 4.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
