Telenor ASA (TEL)  and Russian billionaire
Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo may buy Viktor Pinchuk’s 6 percent
stake in mobile-phone operator  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  jointly to reach
parity,  Vedomosti  reported, citing Russia’s antitrust regulator.  An ideal solution to the feud between Telenor and Altimo
would be for the two investors to acquire Pinchuk’s shares
together, the Moscow-based newspaper cited  Igor Artemyev , head
of Russian Anti-Monopoly Service, as telling reporters. Telenor
and Altimo aren’t required to hold exactly the same stakes in
VimpelCom, but should have equal representation in the board of
directors, Vedomosti said, citing Artemyev.  The watchdog will seek to postpone a court hearing of its
claim versus Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor, which was scheduled
for Oct. 17, to give the parties time to reach an out-of-court
settlement, according to Vedomosti. Telenor now owns about 43
percent of the shares in VimpelCom, while Moscow-based Altimo
holds 40.5 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
