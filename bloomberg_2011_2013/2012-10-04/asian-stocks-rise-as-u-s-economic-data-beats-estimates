Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
benchmark index heading for its highest close in a week, as
reports on U.S. jobs and service industries beat expectations,
easing concern the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker by market
value, climbed 3 percent in  Tokyo . Fisher & Paykel Appliances
Holdings Ltd. advanced 3.7 percent in Wellington after directors
of the refrigerator maker rejected a bid from  China ’s Haier
Corp., saying it is too low. Swire Properties Ltd. fell 2.9
percent after the controlling shareholder of the Hong Kong
office landlord said it’s selling shares at a discount.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  increased 0.6 percent to 122.20
as of 6:05 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost two shares rising for each
that fell. The regional index gained 4 percent in September amid
speculation China will add to stimulus measures, following moves
by central banks in the U.S. and  Japan , to ease monetary policy
through so-called quantitative easing.  U.S. jobs data “was a little bit better than expectations
and that’s positive,” said George Boubouras, Melbourne-based
head of investment strategy at the Australian wealth-management
unit of UBS AG. The Swiss bank has about $1.5 trillion in assets
under management. “Stimulus is there for a reason.”  Central Bank Meetings  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  jumped 0.9 percent. The Bank
of Japan started a two-day policy meeting today after last month
boosting its asset-purchase program by to 55 trillion  yen ($700
billion). Political leadership changes and deepening pessimism
among manufacturers is compelling the central bank to do more to
combat deflation and spur economic growth.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England also hold
policy meetings today, after the Reserve Bank of  Australia 
unexpectedly cut interest rates on Oct. 2.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.1 percent, while South Korea’s
Kospi Index lost 0.2 percent. Markets in China remain closed
today for holidays.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The index gained 0.4 percent in New York
yesterday, when ADP Employer Services said companies added
162,000 jobs last month, exceeding the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a 140,000 advance. Service
industries in the U.S. expanded more than forecast in September.  Exporters Gain  Toyota climbed 3 percent to 3,095 yen in Tokyo.  Honda Motor
Co. (7267) , which gets about 44 percent of sales from North America,
increased 3.1 percent to 2,433 yen. James Hardie Industries SE,
a building-materials supplier that counts the U.S. as its
biggest market, jumped 4.2 percent to A$9.18 in Sydney.  Woongjin Coway Co., a South Korean maker of water
purifiers, jumped 14 percent to 34,400 won in  Seoul , the most on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Creditors of its parent Woongjin
Group, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month, are
backing private equity firm MBK Partners Ltd. in buying Woongjin
Coway, the Korea Economic Daily reported yesterday, citing an
unidentified bank official.  Fisher & Paykel gained 3.7 percent to NZ$1.25 in
Wellington. The company’s directors rejected a NZ$869 million
($711 million), or NZ$1.20 a share, offer by Haier, China’s
biggest appliance maker. The bid is less than a value range of
NZ$1.28 to NZ$1.57 a share determined by adviser Grant Samuel,
said the independent directors, led by Chairman Keith Turner.  Lee & Man Paper Manufacturing Ltd. (2314)  climbed 7.9 percent to
HK$3.68 in Hong Kong after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
rating on the stock to overweight from neutral, saying profit
margins will improve next year as the supplier of paper and
packaging products increases prices.  Swire, Billabong  Izumi Co. (8273) , a Japanese shopping-center operator, jumped 23
to 2,013 yen in Tokyo after announcing a share buyback and
raising its net-income forecast.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 6.7 percent this year
through yesterday as policy makers boosted stimulus measures to
counter a global economic slowdown and tame  Europe ’s debt
crisis. The Asian benchmark index  traded  at 12.8 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.8 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Among stocks that declined, Swire Properties fell 2.9
percent to HK$23.25. John Swire & Sons Ltd. said it’s selling
217 million of the company’s shares at HK$22.51 each, a 6
percent discount to yesterday’s closing price.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG)  slumped 18 percent to A$1.075
before trading was halted in Sydney. TPG International LLC is
considering withdrawing its bid for the surfwear maker, the
Australian Financial Review reported, citing unnamed people it
said were familiar with the situation. The company requested a
trading halt pending the release of a statement on the matter.  Computer makers declined after Hewlett-Packard Co. forecast
2013 profit that missed analyst estimates.  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382) ,
