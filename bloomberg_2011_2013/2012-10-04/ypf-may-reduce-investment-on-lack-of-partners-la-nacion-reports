YPF SA (YPF) , the nationalized Argentine
oil producer, may trim its 2013-2017 investment plan to as low
as $25 billion from $37 billion if it fails to attract partners,
La Nacion reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio.  Under its current plan, YPF is seeking partners that would
contribute $5 billion in the five-year period, while the company
would spend $32 billion, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper  said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
