The  New York Yankees  clinched the
American League East division title tonight when the  Baltimore
Orioles  lost 4-1 to the Tampa Bay Rays and had to settle for one
of the AL’s two wild-card spots.  The loss by the Orioles meant the Yankees (94-67), who are
playing at home against the Boston Red Sox, can do no worse than
finish the regular season with a one-game margin over the
Orioles (93-69) atop the AL East.  Evan Longoria hit three solo home runs for Tampa Bay.  Baltimore’s loss locked in more pieces of the AL playoff
puzzle. The Orioles will travel to the Texas Rangers on Oct. 5
in the wild-card playoff, with the winner advancing to a five-
game AL Division Series.  Earlier today, the  Oakland Athletics  (94-68) defeated the
Rangers 12-5 to win the AL West title and send Texas (93-69)
into the wild-card playoff. Texas gets to host the Orioles
because it won the season series against Baltimore.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
