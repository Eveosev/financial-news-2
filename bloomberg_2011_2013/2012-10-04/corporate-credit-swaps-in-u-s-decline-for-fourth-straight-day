A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell for the fourth straight day as the  European Central Bank 
announced that it will keep  interest rates  on hold.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, decreased 0.8 basis point to a mid-price of
95.2 basis points at 7:59 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The measure declined as ECB policy makers left the
benchmark rate at a historic low of 0.75 percent. The U.S. will
release weekly jobless claims figures today and September
payrolls tomorrow after ADP Employer Services showed better-
than-expected gains in employment yesterday. Signs of economic
growth may reassure investors that companiesâ€™ balance sheets are
improving, strengthening their ability to repay obligations.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
