The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 4 basis points to 219
as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge
is on track for the lowest close since Sept. 24, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 154 as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. The measure is on course for the lowest close since Sept.
21, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 to 131 as of 8:13 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show. The benchmark is
poised for its lowest close since Sept. 19, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
