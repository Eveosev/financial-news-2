Japanese  stocks  rose, with the Topix
Index gaining the most in three weeks, as U.S. jobs and  service
industries  data beat expectations. Shares extended gains after
the yen fell.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that depends on  North America 
for 44 percent of its sales, climbed 3.1 percent. Izumi Co.
soared 23 percent after the shopping-center operator announced a
share buyback and raised its net-income forecast. Computer-
printer maker  Canon Inc. (7751)  fell 2.2 percent after Hewlett-Packard
Co., the world’s largest manufacturer of personal computers,
projected 2013 profit that missed estimates.  The Topix advanced 1.1 percent to 735.38 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading, the biggest advance since Sept. 14. More than
two stocks rose for each that fell on the gauge. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.9 percent to 8,824.59, with trading
volume about 6 percent above the 30-day average.  “We are getting favorable indicators about the  U.S.
economy , and stocks are reacting,” said Takashi Ito, a
strategist equity market at Nomura Securities Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest brokerage. “Each nation has been easing policy to reach
their own targets. For the U.S. it’s employment, and that’s why
markets are bound to react to the jobs data. Another good thing
is the yen has weakened.”  The Topix has risen 0.9 percent this year as a wave of
stimulus measures countered a slowing global economy. Shares on
the gauge trade at about 0.88 times book value, compared with
2.25 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.51 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number lower than one means a company
can be bought for less than the value of its assets.  BOJ Meeting  The  Bank of Japan  is scheduled to end a two-day policy
meeting tomorrow after last month boosting its asset-purchase
program by 10 trillion yen to 55 trillion yen. Political
leadership changes and deepening pessimism among manufacturers
is pushing the central bank to do more to combat deflation and
spur growth.  “The bias is for the BOJ to add to easing measures as
political pressure mounts,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a  fund
manager  who helps oversee about 100 billion yen ($1.27 billion)
in domestic equities at T&D Asset Management Co. “There aren’t
many Japanese companies growing, while some are expanding
gradually. The yen’s level isn’t that favorable, Europe is
struggling, and China is slowing,” sapping capital flows into
Japanese equities.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.4 percent today. The index
gained 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday, when ADP Employer
Services said U.S. companies added 162,000 jobs last month,
exceeding the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Service industries in the U.S. also expanded more
than projected.  Employment Outlook  The  Federal Reserve  last month said it will buy $40 billion
of mortgage-backed securities each month until the U.S. labor
market recovers. The jobless rate in the U.S. probably rose to
8.2 percent last month from 8.1 percent in August, economists
said ahead of a government jobs report due tomorrow. Payrolls
probably increased by 115,000, economists predict.  Shares extended gains as Japan’s currency fell against all
16 of its major counterpart. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  Carmakers rose the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Honda added 3.1 percent to 2,433 yen, while  Nissan Motor
Co. (7201)  gained 5.1 percent to 679 yen.  Izumi surged 23 percent to 2,013 yen, its biggest gain
since at least 1987. The company plans to buy back as much as 8
billion yen in shares and raised its fiscal-year net-income
forecast to 16.5 billion yen from 14.5 billion yen.  Earnings season  starts this month with 131 companies on the
Topix set to report results on Oct. 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Canon Drops  Among stocks that fell, Canon dropped 2.2 percent to 2,500
yen after Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman 
said a turnaround at the computer maker won’t happen any time
soon. Earnings for the 2013 fiscal year will be $3.40 to $3.60 a
share, compared with an estimated $4.16 a share, according to a
Bloomberg survey. Hewlett-Packard plunged 13 percent to $14.91
yesterday, a 10-year low.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 4 percent
to 17.43, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
