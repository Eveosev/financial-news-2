Macau gambling revenue rose 12
percent in September, below the estimates of some analysts, as
Chinese visitors curbed spending amid a slowdown in the world’s
second-largest economy.  Revenue in the world’s largest gambling hub rose to 23.9
billion patacas ($3 billion) from 21.2 billion patacas a year
earlier, the city’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau
said in a statement today.  Shares of casino companies dropped after the data, which
was below the 15 percent to 20 percent growth predicted by Bank
of America Merrill Lynch and the 19 percent rise forecast by
Citigroup Inc. High-stake bettors have pulled back as  China’s
economy  has weakened, hurting growth at the former Portuguese
colony that counts on visitors from the mainland to drive
profits.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Asian unit of  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las
Vegas company, fell 3.5 percent to HK$27.40.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) 
fell 3.3 percent and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  dropped 3.5 percent.  Revenue in the gambling hub rose 5.5 percent in August.
Gaming revenue rose 1.5 percent in July, the slowest pace since
2009, after a typhoon and a pullback by high-stake gamblers hurt
spending in the territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
