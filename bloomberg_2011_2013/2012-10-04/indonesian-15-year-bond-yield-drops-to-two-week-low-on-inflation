Indonesia ’s bonds rose, pushing the
15-year yield to a two-week low, on speculation the central bank
will refrain from increasing interest rates after inflation
unexpectedly slowed.  Annual  consumer-price gains  declined to 4.31 percent last
month from 4.58 percent in August, compared with the 4.6 percent
pace predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank
Indonesia  will meet next week to decide on its benchmark rate,
unchanged for a seventh month in September. The Finance Ministry
plans to raise  5 trillion rupiah  ($521 million) from a debt
auction today, after the previous sale on Sept. 25 drew bids
that exceeded the amount offered by 2.4 times.  “We expect rates to hold steady considering the lower-
than-expected inflation last month,” said Dini Anggraeni, a
fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta, a unit
of the nation’s largest lender by assets. “Demand at the
auction will be moderate, with a higher bid-to-cover ratio than
the previous auction.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2027 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
6.30 percent as of 3:46 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since
Sept. 19, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,598 per dollar, the
biggest drop since Sept. 26, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
