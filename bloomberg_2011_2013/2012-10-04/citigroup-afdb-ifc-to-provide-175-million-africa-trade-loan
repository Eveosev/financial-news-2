The  African Development Bank ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , and International Finance Corp. agreed to
provide a $175 million credit line for trade finance in Africa.  The three-year financing is part of a program started in
July 2009 by the three lenders to support trades in developing
countries, Citigroup said in a statement.  “While the impact of the crisis is felt throughout the
global economy, the poorest are often those who are most
affected by reduced growth, income, and increased prices of
critical goods,” Georgina Baker, director of trade and supply
chain at IFC said in the statement.  Africa’s share of world trade is will rise to 7 percent in
2050 from 3 percent in 2010, according to forecasts of Citigroup
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
