Coffee futures fell the most in two
weeks as weather concerns eased in  Brazil , the world’s biggest
producer, and U.S. inventories climbed. Cocoa, cotton and orange
also slid, while sugar gained.  Somar Meteorologia, based in  Sao Paulo , said Brazil’s
coffee-growing areas may get rain after Oct. 10. Futures rallied
5.3 percent last month amid speculation that dry conditions
would hamper crop development. Stockpiles at warehouses
monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have surged 44 percent this year
to the highest since June 2010.  Rain “during flowering may turn out to be beneficial” for
Brazilian yields,  Andrey Kuznetsov , the president of Wild Bear
Capital, a broker in Moscow, said in an e-mail. “The market has
huge supplies.”  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery slumped 3.3
percent to settle at $1.7505 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Sept.
20. The price has dropped 23 percent this year.  Selling by producers “halted all rally attempts,” Joe Scaduto, the president of JPS Commodities LLC, a broker in New
York, said in a report.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$2,395 a metric ton on ICE. Earlier, the price touched $2,386,
the lowest since Aug. 24.  Cotton futures for December delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
72.09 cents a pound, snapping a three-day rally.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery dropped 0.4
percent to $1.155 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
21.6 cents a pound. Earlier, the price reached 21.77 cents, the
highest since Aug. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
