The Philippine peso and one-month
forwards touched two-week highs after a better-than-expected
U.S. jobs report eased concern a slowdown in the world’s largest
economy will damp the Asian nation’s exports. Bonds were steady.  Some 162,000 positions were added by companies in
September, figures from ADP Employer Services showed yesterday,
topping the median forecast of 140,000 by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The  Federal Reserve  said last month it would buy $40
billion of mortgage debt a month in a third round of so-called
quantitative easing. The U.S. was the Philippines’ third-largest
export market in July, official data show.  “Following the QE3, any labor market data going forward
will affect the currency,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of
foreign-exchange research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in Singapore.
“There’s a slight improvement in risk-taking activity.”  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 41.467 in  Manila , prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc show. The currency touched 41.465
earlier, the strongest level since Sept. 17. The peso has
appreciated 5.6 percent this year, the best performance in  Asia .
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.25 percent.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.4 percent to
41.52 per dollar, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts touched 41.47, the highest level since Sept. 18.  The  Asian Development Bank  raised its 2012 economic growth
forecast for the Philippines yesterday to 5.5 percent from 4.8
percent.  Consumer prices rose 3.8 percent in September from a year
earlier, matching the pace in August that was the fastest since
January, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News  survey  before a report due tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.75 percent notes due September 2022 held
at 4.75 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
