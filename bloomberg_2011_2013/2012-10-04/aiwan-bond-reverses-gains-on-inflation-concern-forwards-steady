Taiwan ’s government bonds reversed
earlier gains before data tomorrow which may show rises in
consumer prices persisted last month. The local dollar’s
forwards were little changed.  Consumer prices rose 2.77 percent in September from a year
earlier, following a 3.42 percent increase the previous month
that was the biggest in four years, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey before data tomorrow. Taiwan cut
its 2012 economic growth forecast last month to 1.66 percent
from 2.08 percent, after gross domestic product fell more than
estimated in the second quarter.  “It’s a scenario where rising consumer prices counter
slowing growth,” said Baker Tu, a bond trader at  Capital
Securities Corp. (6005)  in Taipei. “But in the long run, yields should
come down slowly as prices will eventually stabilize.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022
climbed one basis point to 1.144 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. It touched 1.129 percent earlier, close to an
all-time low of 1.125 percent reached on July 25.  ‘Adequately Loose’  Taiwan’s central bank is adopting an “adequately loose”
monetary policy, and will continue to use bill sales to control
liquidity in the financial system, Governor Perng Fai-nan said
in reply to lawmakers’ questions in parliament on Sept. 26.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.30, trading at a 0.3 percent premium to the spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.06 percent to NT$29.388 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached
NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since May 3. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was little changed at 3.9 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
