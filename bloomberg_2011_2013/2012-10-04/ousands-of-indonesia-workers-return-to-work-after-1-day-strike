Thousands of Indonesian factory
workers joined street protests across the country yesterday to
demand higher wages and an end to the outsourcing of labor.  Labor unions estimated as many as three million workers
walked off the job nationwide, said Koswara, chairman of the
Karya Utama workers federation. About 7,000 people rallied
peacefully outside regional parliament offices in Jakarta and
Bekasi, and 45,000 more joined protests outside the capital,
Rikwanto, a Jakarta police spokesman, said by telephone today.  The one-day strike underlines the challenges for
international companies operating in  Indonesia , where  Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  was forced to increase wages for
workers at its Grasberg mine in December after a three-month
strike crippled production.  Japanese companies have scrapped plans to invest as much as
$313 million in the nation’s garment industry because of concern
that labor protests may hamper production and spill over into
violence, the Jakarta Globe reported today, citing Suryadi
Sasmita, executive chairman of the Indonesian Association of
Garment and Accessories Suppliers.  Indonesia’s growth potential has spurred companies
including Toyota Motor Corp. to boost investments in the country
and prompted Standard Chartered Plc to predict the nation will
join China and  India  as the engine of the third global “super-
cycle.” The country may surpass  Germany  and the U.K. by 2030 to
be the world’s seventh-largest economy, McKinsey & Co. said in a
report last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
