Spending on grain imports by the
world’s poor, food-deficient countries is forecast to climb to a
record in the year through June on higher cereal prices, the
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization forecast.  Low-income food-deficient countries may pay $36.5 billion
in 2012-13 to buy grain from $35.2 billion a year earlier, the
third annual increase, the Rome-based United Nations agency
wrote in a  report . That compares with a food bill of $32.5
billion in the food-crisis year 2007-08, the data show.  The value of imports is forecast to rise even as bigger
harvests in Africa and  Asia  reduce the volume of purchases,
according to the report. The FAO’s  cereal-price index  rose to
262.6 points in September, the highest level since April last
year. The index for grain prices in July surged 17 percent, the
biggest jump since February 2008.  “Despite the overall decrease in import requirements, the
increase in international cereal prices will strengthen the food
import bills,” the FAO wrote.  The cost of poor countries’ wheat imports will climb to
$20.2 billion from $19.5 billion, while the bill for importing
coarse grains including corn and barley will jump to $5.61
billion from $5.37 billion, according to the FAO. Rice-import
costs will rise to $10.7 billion from $10.3 billion, it said.  By volume, grain-import requirements of low income, food-
deficient countries are forecast to drop to 84.4 million metric
tons from 88.5 million tons, the data show.  Grain-import needs for  Egypt , the world’s largest wheat
buyer, are forecast to decline to 16.3 million tons in 2012-13
from 18 million tons in the previous year, the FAO said.  Syrian Unrest  Syria ’s requirements in the 12 months through June are
forecast to climb to 5.21 million tons of cereals from 3.51
million tons in 2011-12, the FAO said. Iraq’s needs are seen at
5.26 million tons from 5.16 million tons the previous season.  “In the Syrian Arab Republic, the continued unrest since
early 2011 is hampering normal agricultural activities and is
responsible for a below-average harvest in 2012,” the FAO said.  Grain import requirements for  Indonesia , the world’s
fourth-most populous country, are expected to fall to 9.4
million tons from 11.1 million tons, based on the report. The
 Philippines  will need 4.29 million tons of imports, compared
with 5.3 million tons in 2011-12, the FAO wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
