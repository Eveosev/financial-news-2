Western Canada Select weakened before
the start of planned maintenance at U.S. midcontinent
refineries, which will reduce demand from plants that typically
process Alberta crudes.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana,  refinery , the Midwest’s largest,
will shut a crude unit known as Pipestill 12 starting Nov. 1 for
work scheduled to last 100 days, a person familiar with the
maintenance said April 19.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  will idle the 90,000-barrel-a-day West
plant in Tulsa,  Oklahoma , starting in November for work
scheduled to last about five weeks, a person with knowledge of
the repairs said June 28.  Western Canada Select for November traded at a $14 discount
to West Texas Intermediate, according to  Net Energy Inc ., a
Calgary-based trading system. Yesterday, the grade was at $11
below the U.S. benchmark, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  November Syncrude traded at a $7 premium to WTI, Net Energy
said. It was $10.75 above the U.S. benchmark yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. Bakken traded at a $3 premium to
WTI, Net Energy said.  U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium to WTI increased $1.30 to $21.15 a barrel as of 11:53
a.m.  New York  time, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
Light Louisiana Sweet added $1.10 to $19.95.  Poseidon’s  premium  widened $1 to $12.25. Mars Blend’s
increased 15 cents to $12.65 a barrel over WTI and Southern
Green Canyon was steady at $11.25.  The premium for Thunder Horse, a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 50 cents to $17.50 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
