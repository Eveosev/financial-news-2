Allied Technologies Ltd. (ALT) , a South
African manufacturer of television set-top boxes, said it’s
seeking a partner to help fund its operations in East Africa.  “We are at an advanced stage of seeking a partner with the
additional capital to be used for expanding the data center and
the regional network,” Tim Ellis, Altech’s chief executive
officer for the region, told reporters today in Nairobi,  Kenya ’s
capital.  Altech owns 60.8 percent of Altech KDN Ltd., a joint
venture with Sameer Group, a Kenyan investment company that owns
the remaining 39.2 percent.  “We have invested an estimated 3 billion shillings in the
operation and we are looking to further boost that with a deal
expected by year-end,” Ellis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
