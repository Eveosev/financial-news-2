Michael Schumacher , Formula One’s
seven-time champion, will quit the auto racing series after this
season.  Schumacher hasn’t won a race since making a comeback in
2010 with the Mercedes team, which said Sept. 28 it was hiring
 Lewis Hamilton  to replace him next season. Schumacher said  in a
statement  on his website today he won’t seek a berth on another
team.  “I have decided to retire from Formula One at the end of
the season, although I am still able to compete with the best
drivers of the world,” the 43-year-old said in the statement.
“This is something that makes me proud, and this is part of why
I never regretted my comeback.”  Schumacher won titles with the Benetton team in 1994 and
1995 and took five consecutive championships with Ferrari from
2000 to 2004. He is 12th in the standings after 14 of 20 races
this season, 50 points behind Mercedes teammate  Nico Rosberg ,
who is seventh overall.  There are six races left this season, with the next one in
Suzuka, Japan, on Oct. 7. Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  leads the
standings by 29 points from Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
