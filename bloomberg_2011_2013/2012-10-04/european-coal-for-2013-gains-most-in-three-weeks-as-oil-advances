European coal rose the most in almost
three weeks as crude advanced on the conflict in  Syria .  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp added as much as 0.8 percent to $96.90 a metric ton,
the biggest gain since Sept. 14, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract was at $96.85 at 2:05 p.m.
 London  time.  Brent oil for November settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London added as much as $1.96, or 1.8 percent, to
$110.13 a barrel as tensions between Syria and  Turkey  fanned
concern that exports from the Middle East may be reduced.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
