Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Schultz  said his company plans to add 1,000
stores in the U.S. in the next five years.  The locations, which will employ about 20 workers each,
could add a total of 20,000 jobs, Schultz said today in an
interview in Houston. Schultz, 59, also said he has no plans to
retire and still has a lot to accomplish at the company he has
been with for more than two decades.  Starbucks is working to attract customers concerned about
the economy by selling juice, energy drinks and better food
alongside its traditional coffee. The company cut its fourth-
quarter profit forecast in July, citing slowing sales growth in
the U.S. and the recession in  Europe .  The company has more than 17,400 locations worldwide
including about 10,800 in the U.S. and 740 in the U.K., its
largest market in Europe.  Schultz has been countering slowing growth in the U.S. with
expansions abroad and in September set the date of its first
store in India for this month. The CEO said today that the
company is on track to have 1,500 locations in  China  by 2015 and
that he is “very bullish” on the nation despite its recent
slowing growth.  Starbucks  fell  0.8 percent to $49.10 at the close in  New
York . The Seattle-based company’s shares have gained 6.7 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
