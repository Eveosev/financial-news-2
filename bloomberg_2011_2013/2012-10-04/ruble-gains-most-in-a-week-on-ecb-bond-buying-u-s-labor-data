The ruble gained the most in a week
as investor appetite for riskier assets increased after the
 European Central Bank  said its ready to buy  government bonds  to
stem the debt crisis and U.S. jobs data beat estimates.  The currency rose 0.6 percent to 31.00 per dollar as of 7
p.m. in Moscow and fell 0.2 percent versus the euro to 40.3140.
The ruble added 0.2 percent against the central bank’s euro-
dollar target basket.  The ECB is ready to undertake Outright Monetary
Transactions after “prerequisites” are in place, bank
President  Mario Draghi  said today. U.S. government data showed
jobless claims increased less than economists forecast last
week.  “The ruble reacted positively to U.S. labor data and the
ECB president’s statement,” Alexei Egorov, an analyst with
Moscow-based OAO Nomos Bank, said by e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.4852 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.6838 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 194,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell four basis points to
7.525 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
