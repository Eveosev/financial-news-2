Albert Einstein ’s musings about God
and religion, handwritten in a letter in 1954, will go up for
sale on EBay in an auction that will start at $3 million on Oct.
8, the online marketplace said on its  website .  “For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an
incarnation of the most childish superstitions,” translated
excerpts of the letter published on EBay said. “And the Jewish
people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a
deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other
people.”  The handwritten  letter  in German was sent in 1954 to Eric
B. Gutkind in response to his book “Chosen Life: The Biblical
Call to Revolt.”  The letter is stored at a professional academic institution
in a temperature, humidity and light controlled environment.  EBay (EBAY)  said on its site, without naming the seller, that the
authenticity of the letter has never been questioned and is
being sold with its original envelope, stamp and postmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
