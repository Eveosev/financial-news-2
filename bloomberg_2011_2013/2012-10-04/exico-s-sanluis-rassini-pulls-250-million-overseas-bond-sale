Sanluis Rassini SA, a Mexican auto
parts maker, postponed plans to sell $250 million of 10-year
bonds in international markets, said Juan Pablo Sanchez Kanter,
an investor relations official at the company.  “Market conditions weren’t in line with the company’s
expectations,” Sanchez Kanter said in a phone interview. It
wasn’t “because of a lack of demand.”   Sanluis Rassini was seeking to return to the  bond market 
two years after its holding company missed a debt payment and a
decade after its parent stopped servicing bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
