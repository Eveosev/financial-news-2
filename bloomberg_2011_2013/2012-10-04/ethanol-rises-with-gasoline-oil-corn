Ethanol futures capped the longest
streak of gains since July as gasoline, oil and corn climbed.  Prices jumped after gasoline surged as refinery and
pipeline shutdowns increased concern that supplies aren’t
adequate to meet demand. Crude rose the most in two months as
the euro gained on the dollar and Mideast tension threatened to
disrupt output. Corn, the primary ingredient used to make
ethanol in the U.S., advanced for the fourth time in five days.  “The strength in the energies and the strength in the corn
is really supporting ethanol,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 0.9 cent or
0.4 percent, to settle at $2.413 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The five-day increase was the longest streak of
consecutive gains since one ended July 18.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged
8.5 cents to $2.575 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
In the U.S. Gulf, the additive increased 7 cents to $2.49.
Ethanol in Chicago gained 6.25 cents to $2.425 a gallon, and, in
 New York , the biofuel advanced 4.5 cents to $2.50.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.25 cent to $7.57 a bushel
in Chicago.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 35 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t
include profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Crude oil for November delivery rose $3.57, or 4.1 percent,
to $91.71 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery climbed 14.34 cents, or 5.1
percent, to $2.9429 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
