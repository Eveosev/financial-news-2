Greek economic sentiment worsened in
September as the government failed to conclude talks with
international lenders on 13.5 billion euros ($17.5 billion) of
austerity measures for the next two years.  An index measuring short-term economic trends fell to 76.1
from 77 in August, the Athens-based  Foundation for Economic &
Industrial Research , known as IOBE, said in an e-mailed report
today.  Consumer confidence  fell to minus 75.6 from minus 65.2,
its lowest level since May, the foundation said.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has spent months trying to
reach an agreement on the measures with officials from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund , and the
political parties supporting his coalition government. The
package is key to the release of 31 billion euros under the
country’s bailouts, designed primarily to recapitalize  Greece ’s
banks in a bid to boost liquidity in a cash-starved economy.  “The drop in consumer confidence is expected and can be
explained by the fact that for at least two months people have
been receiving successive, often contradictory messages about
the contents of the fiscal package,” IOBE said in the
statement.  While sentiment worsened in retail and construction, there
were improvements in the services and industry, where the index
rose to a 13-month high of 80.9 from 77.1 in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
