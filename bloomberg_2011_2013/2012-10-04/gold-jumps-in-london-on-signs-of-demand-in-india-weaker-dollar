Gold futures jumped to the highest in
almost 11 months as the European Central Bank said it is ready
to start buying government bonds, boosting demand for the metal
as a store of value. Silver, platinum and palladium also gained.  The ECB will begin purchases “once all the prerequisites
are in place,” President Mario Draghi said today after policy
makers left the benchmark interest rate at a historic low of
0.75 percent. In the third quarter, gold gained 11 percent, the
most since June 2010, as the Federal Reserve announced a third
round of U.S. monetary stimulus.  “A global accommodative stance will continue to support
gold,” William O’Neill, a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper
Saddle River, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,796.50 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,797.70, the highest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 9.  UBS AG said in a report that its physical gold sales to
India yesterday were the highest since April as the rupee
strengthened against the dollar.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 1.2 percent
to $35.101 an ounce on the Comex, the highest settlement since
March 1.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose 1.8 percent to
$1,725.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
highest settlement since Sept. 21, 2011.  Palladium futures for December delivery jumped 2.6 percent
to $674.75 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest gain since Sept.
