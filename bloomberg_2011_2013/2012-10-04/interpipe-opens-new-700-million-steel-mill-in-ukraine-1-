Ukraine’s Interpipe Group, owned by
billionaire Victor Pinchuk, opened a $700 million electric steel
mill in Dnipropetrovsk with an annual output capacity of 1.32
million tons of steel for its seamless pipe production.  The Interpipe Steel plant will provide 90 percent of the
steel needed for pipe production by 2014, the company said in an
e-mailed statement today. The second phase of the steel plant
may increase output to 2 million tons a year.  “Should markets show a more or less stable demand for our
products, we will be able to quickly increase volumes of steel
production at our new plant,” Pinchuk said today in
Dnipropetrovsk. “All infrastructure necessary for the
construction of the second stage is in place,” he said.  Investment in the factory will be covered in three to four
years, Pinchuk said, adding that steel not needed for pipe
production may be exported to western  Europe .  Interpipe forecasts sales to the European Union will
increase 20 percent in the second half compared with the first
six months after the EU cut import tax for producers, Oleksandr
Kirichko, the company’s director general, told reporters in
Dnipropetrovsk.  Interpipe will ask the government to cut electricity prices
to the electric steel mill, according to Kirichko. The new plant
will allow Interpipe to replace open hearth steel production
with less energy consuming technologies, the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
