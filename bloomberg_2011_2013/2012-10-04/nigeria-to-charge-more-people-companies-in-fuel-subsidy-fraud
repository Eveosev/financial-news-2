Nigerian prosecutors will file
criminal proceedings against more individuals and companies
accused of receiving illegal fuel-subsidy payments of 1.1
trillion naira ($6.8 billion) in Lagos, the anti-graft agency
said.  Charges will be filed against a group of six individuals
and four companies tomorrow after 12 people and seven companies
were charged in July, the Abuja-based  Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission  said today in an e-mailed statement.  They are among several to be prosecuted over “dubious
subsidy claims,” said Wilson Uwujaren, a spokesman for the
agency, which is also known as the EFCC. More than 140
individuals and companies are being investigated over the
illegal payments.  A parliamentary inquiry published in April recommended that
gasoline importers including state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. refund 1.1 trillion naira in alleged illegal
fuel-subsidy payments made to them. The payments process was
fraught with “endemic corruption” and “entrenched
inefficiency,” according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
