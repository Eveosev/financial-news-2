Iran ’s police will crack down on shop
owners that go on strike,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing
senior police commander Khalili Helali.  The closure of shops in the bazaar “with a view to
creating economic disruption is unlawful,” Helali was quoted as
saying in a report published in the Tehran-based newspaper
today. If merchants go on strike, the police will seal their
shops with approval from the judiciary, he said.  Helali said a group of individuals had headed to the Grand
Bazaar and chanted slogans. He rejected reports that business
activity in the area had come to a halt, Donya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
