Miguel Cabrera of the  Detroit  Tigers
became Major League Baseball’s first Triple Crown winner since
Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, joining a group of eight Hall of
Famers who have achieved the feat in the American League.  Cabrera, a 29-year-old Venezuelan, went 0-2 and left in the
fourth inning in the Tigers’ 1-0 regular-season-ending win at
the Kansas City Royals last night. He finished with a .330
batting average, 44 home runs and 139 runs batted in, the
offensive statistics that make up the Triple Crown.  He led the Texas Rangers’ Josh Hamilton and New York
Yankees Curtis Granderson by one home run, while finishing with
11 RBIs more than Hamilton and 4 percentage points in front of
the Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Trout to win his second straight
batting title.  “Everybody said to me it was unbelievable,” Cabrera said
after the game. “They were excited to see this, enjoy this, be
a part of something big and, winning, I feel better.”  The Tigers won the AL Central division and will begin
postseason play at home on Oct. 6 against the Oakland Athletics,
who defeated Texas 12-5 last night to cap a 13-game comeback and
win the AL West title from the Rangers by one game.  Cabrera had to wait until Granderson, who hit two home runs
in the Yankees’ 14-2 win over the  Boston  Red Sox, was replaced
by a pinch-hitter.  Career Highs  “It was hard the last two days because everybody talked
about it,” said Cabrera. “I just had to focus, I had to go out
there and do the job. I said, ‘If we win the division,
everything would take care of itself.”’  The home run and RBI marks were career highs for Cabrera, a
seven-time All-Star who is in his fifth season in Detroit after
playing his first five for the Florida Marlins.  League Commissioner Bud Selig said winning the Triple Crown
is “a remarkable achievement that places him amongst an elite
few in all of baseball history.”  Cabrera, a third baseman who, with Trout, is a front-runner
for the AL Most Valuable Player Award, went 4-for-5 with a home
run on Oct. 1 as the Tigers clinched their second straight AL
Central Division title.  Yastrzemski was 28 when he batted .326 with 44 homers and
121 RBI for the Red Sox to win the Triple Crown. Ty Cobb was the
last Tigers’ player to win it, in 1909. Frank Robinson (1966),
Mickey Mantle (1956), Ted Williams (1942 and 1947), Lou Gehrig
(1934), Jimmie Foxx (1933), and Nap Lajoie (1901) -- like
Yastrzemski and Cobb, all Hall of Famers -- are the only other
AL players to sweep the three categories in the same season.  Yastrzemski Title  “Somebody’s got to do it, whether it’s Cabrera this year
or it’s going to be next year or the year after,” Yastrzemski
told reporters on Sept. 26 at Fenway Park in Boston. “I’m
surprised it’s gone this long, to be perfectly honest.”  The last National League Triple Crown winner was St. Louis
Cardinals left fielder Joe Medwick in 1937. Other NL winners
were Chuck Klein in 1933, Rogers Hornsby in 1922 and 1925,
Heinie Zimmerman in 1912, Hugh Duffy in 1894 and Paul Hines in
1878,  according to MLB.com . All but Zimmerman and Hines are Hall
of Fame members.  With nine straight years of at least 30 home runs, 100 RBI
and a .318 career batting average, Cabrera’s on-field
consistency has been shadowed by run-ins with the law.  In February 2011, he was arrested and charged with driving
under the influence and resisting arrest after police spotted
him drinking from a bottle of Scotch as he sat in his car
alongside a Florida road.  In March 2010, Cabrera said he was done drinking alcohol.
Five months earlier, Tigers General Manager Dave Dombrowski
picked him up at a police station after a fight between Cabrera
and his wife that followed a night of drinking, according to the
Associated Press.  Cabrera followed the 2011 arrest by hitting a career-
high .344 to claim the AL batting title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
