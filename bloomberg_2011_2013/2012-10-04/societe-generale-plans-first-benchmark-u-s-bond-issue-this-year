Societe Generale SA (GLE) , the second-
largest French lender, sold $1.25 billion of five-year notes in
its first benchmark dollar-denominated issue this year.  The bank, which has $16.2 billion of  bonds  maturing next
year, sold the 2.75 percent debt to yield 215 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.  The Paris-based company previously sold benchmark dollar
bonds in June 2011, issuing $850 million of floating-rate debt
that matured in August 2011 and paid 20 basis points more than
the bi-monthly London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data
show.  The new bonds may be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified, citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, and  Societe
Generale  managed the sale, Bloomberg data show. BNP Paribas SA
is France’s largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
