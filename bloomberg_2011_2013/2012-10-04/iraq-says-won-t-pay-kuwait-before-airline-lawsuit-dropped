Iraq will not pay Kuwait Airways
Corp. compensation for a debt dispute before Kuwait drops legal
claims against  Iraqi Airways , according to Ali al-Allaq, general
secretary of the Cabinet.  The two neighboring countries reached an agreement in March
to resolve the airline dispute under which Kuwait would abandon
all lawsuits against Iraqi Airways in return for Iraq paying
$500 million, he said in an interview in Baghdad today. Kuwait
has yet to drop the claims in court, he said.  State-run Kuwait Airways has been seeking $1.2 billion in
compensation for 10 aircraft taken during former Iraqi President
 Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
