Bonds of  General Electric Co. (GE)  rose
for a third day following a $7 billion three-part bond offering,
the parent company’s first in almost five years.  A $2 billion slice of 4.125 percent, 30-year bonds from the
biggest maker of power-generation equipment climbed 1.02 cents
to 105 cents on the dollar to yield 3.84 percent as of 11:17
a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
priced at 99.44 cents on Oct. 1.  GE’s $2 billion of 0.85 percent, three-year notes increased
0.03 cent to 100.36 cents on the dollar and its $3 billion of
2.7 percent, 10-year debt added 0.03 cent to 101.7 cents, Trace
data show.  GE last sold debt through the Fairfield, Connecticut-based
parent company in November 2007, issuing $4 billion of 5.25
percent bonds maturing in December 2017, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
