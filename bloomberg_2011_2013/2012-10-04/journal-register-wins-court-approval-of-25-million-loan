publisher that filed for bankruptcy a second time in September,

prenegotiated reorganization plan.  The company listed assets of $235 million and debt of
$268.6 million in Chapter 11 documents filed Sept. 5. Debt
includes about $13.2 million on a revolving credit owing to
Wells Fargo.  The companyâ€™s newspapers include the Delaware County Times
and the Trentonian near Philadelphia, the Oakland Press in
 Michigan , the Daily Freeman in Kingston, New York, the Register
Citizen in Connecticut and the News-Herald outside of Cleveland.  The case is In Re Journal Register Co., 12-13774,  U.S.
