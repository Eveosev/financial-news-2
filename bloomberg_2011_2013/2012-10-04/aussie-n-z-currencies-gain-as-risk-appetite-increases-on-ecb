The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose against their U.S. counterpart as risk appetite
grew after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the
bank is ready to buy bonds to curb Europe’s debt crisis.  The Aussie fell earlier to a four-week low after retail
sales grew more slowly than forecast, adding to bets the central
bank will cut  interest rates  in November for a second month. The
Aussie and New Zealand’s dollar rose versus the yen as the  Bank
of Japan  began a two-day meeting. Both South Pacific currencies
gained as stocks advanced after Draghi said the ECB could buy
 government bonds  as soon as the necessary conditions are met.  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.0241
yesterday in New York after falling as much as 0.3 percent
earlier to $1.0182, the lowest level since Sept. 6. It increased
0.2 percent to 80.37 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.3 percent
to 82.18 U.S. cents after earlier declining to 81.66 cents, the
least since Sept. 11. It gained 0.3 percent to 64.49 yen.  The kiwi has strengthened 3.6 percent this year, the
biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has fallen 2.3 percent, and the greenback is down 2.7 percent.  U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gaining 0.7 percent. The S&P GSCI index of raw materials climbed
2.5 percent.  The Australian statistics bureau said retail sales
increased 0.2 percent in August from the previous month,
advancing at half the pace predicted by a Bloomberg News survey.
The figure compared with a 0.8 percent decline in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
