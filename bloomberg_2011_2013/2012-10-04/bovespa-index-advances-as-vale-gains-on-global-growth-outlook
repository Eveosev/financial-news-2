The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index gained for the
first time in three days as Brazilian producers followed a
commodities rally amid optimism about the outlook for the global
recovery.  Vale SA (VALE3)  contributed most the gauge’s advance as a gain in
metal prices outweighed concern about production after the
mining company said it halted output at three plants. Oil
companies OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and Petroleo
Brasileiro SA followed crude higher.  The Bovespa gained 0.4 percent to 58,856.14 at 2:08 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Forty stocks rose on the index while 27 sank. The
real rose 0.2 percent to 2.0188 per U.S. dollar. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials added 1.6 percent after
American jobless claims increased less than economists estimated
and the European Central Bank said it is ready to buy government
bonds once necessary conditions are met.  “It’s good to see economic data that weren’t as bad as we
expected, and also  Europe  taking steps to deal with its
problems,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset
Management, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “All this news
helps to reduce risk aversion, giving some breathing room for
the Bovespa.”  Vale rose 1.5 percent to 35.21. The stock earlier dropped
as much as 1.5 percent after the company said it would
temporarily halt output at its Sao Luis, Tubarao 1 and Tubarao 2
plants.  Petrobras, OGX  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, advanced 0.7
percent to 22.49 reais. OGX added 0.9 percent to 5.91 reais.  The Bovespa has climbed 12 percent from this year’s low on
June 5 as stimulus from central banks around the world eased
economic concerns and borrowing costs at a record low in  Brazil 
boosted demand for equities. The index trades at 13.4 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters, which
compares with the ratio of 11.4 times for MSCI Inc.’s measure of
21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Trading volume was 5.75 billion reais ($2.84 billion) in
stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday, which compares with a daily
average of 7.31 billion reais this year through Oct. 2,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
