S&T System Integration & Technology
Distribution AG (SNT)  advanced in Vienna trading after the Austrian IT
company agreed to merge with rival Quanmax AG.  S&T rose 3.9 percent to 2.65 euros in the Austrian capital,
climbing for a second day.  The companies said yesterday after markets closed that S&T
holders would get 259 Quanmax shares for 200 S&T shares, valuing
S&T at 8.35 euros a share and Quanmax at 6.45 euros a share. The
companies see non-recurring and restructuring costs at less than
1 million euros and savings in 2013 at 3 million euros, they
said. The merger is expected to close this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
