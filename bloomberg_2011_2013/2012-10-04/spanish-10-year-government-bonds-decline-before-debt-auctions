Spanish bonds declined before the
country’s sale of securities due between 2014 and 2017.  The declines pushed the 10-year yield up by five basis
points to 5.86 percent at 8:47 a.m. London time, while two-year
yields were 10 basis points higher at 3.33 percent.  Italy’s two-year note yield increased for a second day,
rising one basis point to 2.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
