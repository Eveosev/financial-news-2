Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
bank by market value, named Jim Hays to oversee financial
advisers in branches and wealth-management offices in a bid for
growth and greater cooperation with the brokerage unit.  Hays, most recently president of the bank’s private-client
group, will oversee 3,800 advisers and other employees providing
brokerage services to wealth-management clients, the San
Francisco-based lender said today in a statement. He will also
lead an effort to sell investment products and services through
branches and work closely with the retail brokerage, the third-
largest in the U.S., the bank said.  Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , 59, is seeking to
expand wealth, brokerage and retirement, the division headed by
 David Carroll  and the smallest of the company’s three main
business units. In December 2010, Stumpf said the business was
“sub-optimized” and last year the wealth-management unit
shuffled regional managers, cutting the number to seven from 12.  As head of the private-client group since 2005, Hays grew
credit originations by $9 billion annually and increased
clients’ usage of planning tools, according to the statement. He
spent 18 years at Merrill Lynch & Co. before joining a Wells
Fargo predecessor.  Wells Fargo’s brokerage business had more than 3,200
licensed bankers and 15,170 advisers at the end of June.  Wells Fargo rose 1.1 percent to $35.82 at 1:32 p.m. in New
York. The shares have climbed 30 percent this year, about equal
to the performance of the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
