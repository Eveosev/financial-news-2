Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
appointed a new chief of defense staff and replaced heads of the
country’s  air force  and navy, presidency spokesman Reuben Abati
said.  Army chief Lieutenant-General O.A. Ihejirika retained his
position in the changes that had Vice Admiral O.S. Ibrahim
appointed chief of defense staff, Abati said today in an e-
mailed statement. Rear Admiral D.J. Ezeoba will head the navy
while Air Vice Marshal A.S. Badeh will take charge of the air
force, according to the statement. No reasons were given for the
changes.  Nigeria , Africa’s largest-oil producer, is fighting an
insurgency by the Boko Haram Islamist group, which has carried
out bomb and gun attacks in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja,
the capital, in which hundreds of people have died this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
