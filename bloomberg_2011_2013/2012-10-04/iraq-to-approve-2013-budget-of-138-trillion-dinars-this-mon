Iraqâ€™s government plans to adopt a
2013  federal budget  of 138 trillion dinars ($118.5 billion) by
the end of this month, according to Ali al-Allaq, general
secretary of the cabinet.  The cabinet held a first discussion about the 2013 budget
after receiving the draft from the finance ministry, he said in
