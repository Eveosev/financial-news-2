Standard & Poor’s  said  Canada ’s
economy will expand at a “subdued” pace of 2.1 percent in 2012
and 1.9 percent in 2013 as a weaker global economy will sap
demand for Canadian exports and stifle growth.  “The fragile position of the global recovery, impairment
in international trade, and the high value of the Canadian
dollar will continue to dampen business for Canadian
exporters,” the New York-based ratings firm said in a report.  A stuttering recovery in the U.S. and recession in  Europe ,
Canada’s two main markets responsible for more than 80 percent
of export demand, will weigh on hiring and limit income growth,
S&P said.  “We don’t expect Europe to emerge from recession until
later in 2013, while for the U.S. we see subpar growth of about
2 percent continuing through the end of 2013,” according to the
report by S&P analyst Robert Palombi.  Canada’s economy will grow by 2.1 percent in 2013,
according to Bloomberg economist forecasts. Gross domestic
product expanded at a 1.9 percent annualized pace between April
and June,  Statistics Canada  said Oct. 1 in Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
