Nigeria  has the scope for at least
$400 billion of spending in the oil, gas and power industries
provided the environment for investment improves, said Bernard
Bos,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s (RDSA)  vice president for finance and
strategy in sub-Saharan Africa.  The lack of attractive terms for investment means money
that should have come to Nigeria is going to other African
countries and Australia, Bos said at an investment conference
today in Lagos, the commercial capital.  “Many in the industry are worried about what the petroleum
industry bill will do,” he said, referring to legislation to
reform the regulation and funding of Nigeria’s oil and gas
industry. “We need to try and unleash that investment.”  Nigeria is  Africa ’s top oil producer and has the world’s
seventh-largest natural gas-reserves of more than 184 trillion
cubic feet, according to the Petroleum Ministry. Shell is the
biggest oil and gas operator in Nigeria, providing 40 percent of
gas used by power stations and generating 20 percent of the
country’s electricity, according to Bos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
