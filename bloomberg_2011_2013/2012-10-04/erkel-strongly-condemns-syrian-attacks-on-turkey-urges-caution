German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
condemned attacks on Turkey by Syrian forces that killed five
Turkish nationals, urging restraint from both sides.  “We strongly condemn the Syrian attacks on Turkey,”
Merkel told reporters in Berlin after a meeting with Yemeni
President Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi. “We stand at Turkey’s side.”  Turkey’s parliament is set to vote today on a motion
allowing Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government to
order military action in Syria, after a mortar bomb fired across
the border killed five Turks yesterday. Syria’s uprising has
become a civil war that’s spilling across its borders, with
shells and gunfire now following tens of thousands of refugees
into Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.  Germany’s condemnation of  Syria  is “completely clear,”
Merkel said, while calling on all parties involved to show great
caution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
