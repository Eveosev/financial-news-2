More U.K. banks are prepared to lend
money for real estate developments than they were a year ago on
expectations that the British  economy  will recover more quickly
than elsewhere in  Europe .  U.K. lenders saying they are likely to provide development
project finance in the coming five years rose to 66 percent from
just over half of respondents a year earlier, according to an
annual survey published today by construction consultant  EC
Harris . In mainland Europe, there was a 7-point drop from last
year to 48 percent because of concerns over the euro regionâ€™s
sovereign-debt crisis.  Banks account for 94 percent of real estate lending in
Europe, or 2.4 trillion euros ($3.1 trillion), and may reduce
loans by as much a 25 percent in the next three to five years to
meet tougher capital rules, Morgan Stanley estimates. Just 17
percent of respondents in the EC Harris survey said they
increased real estate lending in the past 12 months, while 48
percent reduced their loan books.  The research indicates that fewer banks are willing to
finance projects outside their home market, EC Harris said. The
exception is  Spain , it said.  Few banks would be willing to provide loans for projects
without a tenant commitment to lease part or all of a proposed
development. Seventy-four percent said they would lend for real
estate planned by developers that have backing from established
investors, such as money managers or sovereign-wealth funds.  EC Harris, a unit of  Arcadis NV, (ARCAD)  surveyed 29 banks that
provide loans backed by real estate in eight European countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
