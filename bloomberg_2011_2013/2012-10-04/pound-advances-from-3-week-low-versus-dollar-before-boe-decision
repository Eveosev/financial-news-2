The pound strengthened against the
dollar, rising the most in almost two weeks, as the  Bank of
England  kept its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds
($605 billion) at a meeting today.  Sterling fell for a fifth day versus the euro after the
 European Central Bank  kept its  main refinancing rate  at a
record-low 0.75 percent. The median year-end estimate for the
pound versus the dollar is at the highest since Nov. 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bank of England is
likely to boost its bond-buying program next month, ING Groep NV
said. Gilts declined, pushing the 10-year yield up the most in
almost two weeks.  “Sterling has been a bit soggy recently,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at FxPro Group Ltd. in London. “There’s
a little bit of a recovery today. I don’t think any particular
positions were taken ahead of the Bank of England meeting.”  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.6135 as of 3:06 p.m.
 London  time, after climbing as much as 0.5 percent, the most
since Sept. 21. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to 80.47 pence per
euro, after touching 80.52 pence, the weakest since Sept. 19.  The median forecast for the pound against the dollar of 49
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg rose to $1.60 on Sept. 28, up
from $1.55 on Sept. 14. FxPro’s Derks said the pound may weaken
toward $1.59 this month and reach $1.57 by year-end.  Rate Decision  The Bank of England decision was predicted by all 40
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The central bank also
kept its key  interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent, in line
with all 50 estimates in a separate survey.  “There was zero expectation for any further printing
today,”  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London, said before the announcement,
referring to the policy of bond purchases. “It is already
priced in, so I would not expect there to be any major rally in
the pound.”  Sterling has strengthened 0.9 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 1.1
percent, while the dollar weakened 2.9 percent.  The pound may decline as much as 1.2 percent against the
dollar if it breaks through a key level of so-called support,
 Standard Chartered  Plc said, citing trading patterns.  A break below $1.6064, the 23.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the currency’s appreciation between June 1 and
Sept. 21, will open up a decline to $1.5912, the 38.2 percent
retracement of that move, Callum Henderson, the Singapore-based
global head of currency research at Standard Chartered, wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  Rate Decision  The Bank of England will increase its asset-purchase target
by 50 billion pounds in November because U.K. growth is
“unlikely to improve,”  James Knightley , a senior economist at
ING in London, wrote in an e-mailed comment.  U.K. house prices fell for a third month in September and
will probably remain little changed into 2013 as the uncertain
economic outlook constrains property demand, according to
Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  Fitch Ratings  said Sept. 28 that U.K. government debt will
peak at a higher level and later than it previously predicted.
The company affirmed Britain’s AAA credit level and kept the
nation on negative outlook, adding that it doesn’t expect to
resolve the question mark hanging over the top grade until 2014.  Fiscal Credibility  “Growth is still elusive,”  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, said in
an interview today on Bloomberg TV’s “Countdown” with  Mark
Barton . “It means the triple-A rating and the fiscal
credibility coming into question. The danger of the U.K. losing
its rating is growing. Appetite for gilts may start to wane.”  The 10-year gilt yield was two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, higher at 1.71 percent, after climbing as much
as five basis points, the most since Sept. 21. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 dropped 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount to 100.395.  Gilts returned 3.5 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
