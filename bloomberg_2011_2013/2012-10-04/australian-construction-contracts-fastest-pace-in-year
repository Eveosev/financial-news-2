Australia’s building  industry shrank
in September by the most in 12 months, led by a deepening
downturn in residential and commercial construction, a private
gauge showed.  The construction performance index fell to 30.9 last month
from 32.2 in August, a survey by the Australian Industry Group
and the Housing Industry Association released in Sydney today
showed. A reading below 50 represents a contraction.  Australia ’s housing industry is struggling even after the
 Reserve Bank  lowered its benchmark borrowing cost by a total of
1.25 percentage points from November to June. Governor  Glenn Stevens  acknowledged this week when he reduced the key rate by
another quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent that a mining
boom driving economic growth is likely to peak next year at a
lower level than expected.  “The capital-intensive activity under way at present in
mining-related engineering construction work in some states is
simply not filling the gap left by the severe national downturn
in residential and commercial construction,” Julie Toth, AIG
chief economist, said in a statement. “This is particularly
apparent in the new orders and employment measures, which are
yet to show a meaningful turning point but which should
hopefully be supported by this week’s welcome rate cut.”  House building fell 3 points to 28.5 and commercial
construction dropped 4.4 points to 29.6, today’s report showed.
Construction of apartments gained 3.9 points to 26 while
engineering slid 3 points to 32.7,  New orders rose 1 point to 29.1, while a gauge of
employment fell 2.4 points to 33 last month, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
