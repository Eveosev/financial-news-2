Gasoline strengthened in the  Gulf
Coast , reversing a two-day decline, after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut
a unit at its Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and Colonial Pipeline
Co. shut two lines that carry the fuel.  Exxon shut a diesel hydrotreater after a fire at Baytown,
the largest U.S. oil refinery. Colonial lines 19 and 20, which
move products from Atlanta to Nashville, were shut yesterday
after an odor was detected. Line 19 may have leaked 500 gallons
of gasoline, said  Steve Baker , a spokesman for the Alpharetta,
Georgia-based company.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast increased 1 cent to 6.25 cents versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:02 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 9.81 cents to
$2.9501 a gallon.  Exxon’s 584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown plant accounts for
almost 7 percent of Gulf Coast production, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Colonial, operator of the largest conduit
between Gulf Coast oil refiners and East Coast makers, delivers
an average 100 million gallons a day of refined products to
shipping terminals in 13 states.  Refinery maintenance began this week at Citgo Petroleum
Corp.’s East and West plants in  Corpus Christi  and at a shut
section of a crude unit at Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Convent,
Louisiana, refinery. The Citgo and Motiva facilities account for
a combined capacity of 420,000 barrels per day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
