Serbia’s telecommunications
regulator may introduce price caps for mobile-phone services if
 Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  gains more than two-thirds of the market
through an acquisition of Telekom Srbija AD,  Danas  newspaper
reported, citing an unidentified government official.  Telekom Austria already controls 14 percent of the market
through its  VIP Mobile  and recently made the sole bid for state-
run Telekom Srbija, whose market share is nearly 60 percent. The
third provider is the local unit of  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   The acquisition hinges on purchase price and on the issue
of market concentration, which may be resolved through price
caps by Serbia’s  Agency for Electronic Communications  in order
to protect consumers and reduce the risk of price-fixing, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
