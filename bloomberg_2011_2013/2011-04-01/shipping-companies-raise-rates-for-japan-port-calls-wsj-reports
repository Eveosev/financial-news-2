International shipping companies are
raising rates for making calls at Japanese ports amid concern
that vessels could be exposed to radiation from a tsunami-
damaged nuclear power plant north of  Tokyo , the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing traders and shipbrokers it didn’t name.
 Fleet operators are also seeking contract clauses allowing them
to forgo delivery if radiation risks are present and to divert
vessels away from  Japan  at their own discretion should they
decide radiation levels are too high, according to the report on
the newspaper’s website.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
