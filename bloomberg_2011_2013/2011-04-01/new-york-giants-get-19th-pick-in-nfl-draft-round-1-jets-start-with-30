(Corrects team name in second paragraph.)  The  New York Giants  will get the
19th selection in the first round of the National Football
League draft, while the  New York  Jets have the 30th pick.  The Carolina Panthers have the first overall selection,
followed by the Denver Broncos,  Buffalo Bills , Cincinnati
Bengals and Arizona Cardinals. The Super Bowl champion Green Bay
Packers end round one, which begins April 28 in New York.  The Jets have six selections; the Giants have seven.  The Jets traded their second-round pick to the San Diego
Chargers when they acquired cornerback Antonio Cromartie last
season. The team’s other selections are 94 (third round), 126
(fourth), 161 (fifth), 194 (sixth) and 208 (seventh).  The Jets got the seventh round pick when the team traded
Kerry Rhodes to  Arizona .  The Giants’ picks are 52 (second round), 83 (third), 117
(fourth), 185 and 198 (sixth) and 221 (seventh).  The NFL awarded 32 compensatory picks to 23 teams who lost
more players during free agency than they signed in the previous
year.  The NFL, in issuing its updated draft order, reinstated the
seventh-round choice of the  Detroit Lions , who had appealed the
loss of the pick in a tampering case lodged by the Kansas City
Chiefs.  “Detroit will retain its seventh-round pick in 2011
(obtained from Denver), which is the second pick of the seventh
round, and will instead forfeit a selection in next year’s
draft,” the NFL said in a statement issued last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
