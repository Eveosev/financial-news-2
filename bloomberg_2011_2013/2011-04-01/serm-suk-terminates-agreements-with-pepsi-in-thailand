Serm Suk Pcl (SSC) , a Thai bottler of
PepsiCo Inc. beverages, said it plans to terminate an accord
with the U.S. company after they failed to agree on terms of a
new contract.  PepsiCo, which holds a 42 percent stake in Serm Suk, agreed
last month to amend its agreement with the Bangkok-based bottler.
PepsiCo’s proposal included terms that were unacceptable to the
Thai company’s minority shareholders, Serm Suk said in a
regulatory filing today.  PepsiCo, based in Purchase,  New York , failed in a bid last
year to buy the shares it didn’t already own in Serm Suk. The
acquisition faced opposition from SS National Logistics Co., a
closely held Thai company that made its own offer for Serm Suk
in November and now owns 32.6 percent of the company.  PepsiCo said today that it agreed to meet key demands made
by Serm Suk following a meeting of shareholders in February.  “But there are a number of unreasonable conditions we
believe strongly are too significant to the ongoing interest of
PepsiCo and indeed the partnership with Serm Suk to concede,”
the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Serm Suk shares fell 4.2 percent to 46.25 baht after the
announcement, the biggest decline since Dec. 1.  PepsiCo said its final proposal was fair and transparent,
and “‘meets all of the key conditions voted for by Serm Suk
shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
