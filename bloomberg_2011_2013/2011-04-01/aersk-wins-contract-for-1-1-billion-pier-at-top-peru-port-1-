A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world’s
largest container shipping line, won a contract to build and
operate a $1.1 billion pier at  Peru ’s largest port, the Andean
nation’s government said.  Copenhagen-based Maersk’s APM Terminals unit beat out Hong
Kong-based  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  by offering a bigger discount
for services at the  Muelle Norte  pier at the Callao port, state
investment promotion agency Proinversion said today at a
ceremony in Lima. The concession, which comes before April 10
presidential elections, will reduce costs at Callao, which
handles 45 percent of the country’s cargo.  “Investors feel that the next government will have to
respect their rights,” Finance Minister Ismael Benavides told
reporters in Lima. “Peru’s trailing the region in port
modernization as everybody’s awarding concessions.”  Maersk and the $600 million Muelle Sur pier operated by  DP
World Ltd. (DPW)  will compete to handle grain imports and exports of
metals, natural gas, fishmeal and coffee, according to
Proinversion. Peru is the world’s second-largest copper producer
and No. 1 in silver.  The concession was awarded as opposition presidential
candidate Ollanta Humala widened his lead in a poll released
today. Humala said in a March 23 interview that he opposed the
pier concession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
