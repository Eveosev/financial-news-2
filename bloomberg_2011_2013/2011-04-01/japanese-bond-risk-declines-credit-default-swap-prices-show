The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  decreased 1.5 basis points to 143
basis points as of 9:49 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup
Inc. The benchmark rose to a nine-month high of 147 basis points
on March 16, according to data provider CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 0.5 basis point to
106.5 basis points as of 11:37 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
SA prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan rose 0.5 basis point to 108 as of
8:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
