Taiwan’s government bonds fell by
the most in nine days after the central bank lifted  interest
rates  on certificates of deposit and signaled it may further
increase borrowing costs to tame inflation.  The Central Bank of the Republic of  China  (Taiwan) raised
the discount rate on 10-day loans to banks by 0.125 percentage
point to 1.75 percent yesterday. Governor Perng Fai-nan
emphasized after the decision that the government’s 2 percent
forecast for consumer-price growth this year exceeds the level
of the benchmark rate.  “The rise in rates of certificates of deposit was more
than last time, and was a bit unexpected,” said Artie Yao, a
debt trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Our view is
the central bank will continue to raise its rate when the board
meets again in June.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded government security, increased one basis point to
1.365 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market, the island’s biggest exchange for debt.
That’s the biggest rise since March 22. The rate advanced one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week.  A government report next week will show consumer prices
rose 1.7 percent in March, after a 1.3 percent gain in February,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The central bank raised the rates for 30-day certificates
of deposit by seven basis points to 0.81 percent, increased the
rate on 91-day debt by eight basis points to 0.86 percent and
lifted the 182-day bills by nine basis points to 0.97 percent,
the Taipei Interbank Money Center said today. That compares with
a five-basis point increase for all three securities when the
monetary authority last raised borrowing costs by 12.5 basis
points on Dec. 31.  The  Taiwan  dollar strengthened 0.3 percent for the day and
0.6 percent for the week to NT$29.320 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.240 earlier, the strongest
level since Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
