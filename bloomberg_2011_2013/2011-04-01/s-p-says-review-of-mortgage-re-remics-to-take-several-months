Standard & Poor’s  said it will take
“several” more months to complete reviews of 1,196 securities
tied to U.S. residential mortgages, after saying in December it
had “incorrectly analyzed” the debt.  Most of the bonds were created last year in 129
transactions called re-remics, which are formed by repackaging
existing home-loan securities, New York-based S&P said in a Dec.
15 statement.  The company outlined the approach it will use in the
reviews regarding “interest shortfalls,” in a statement today,
and said that it would incorporate an update this month to its
loss projections for the underlying loans.  “We intend to resolve our Dec. 15, 2010, CreditWatch
placements over the next several months,” S&P said. “We will
release our updated ratings on the affected transactions
periodically during this time as our analysis proceeds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
