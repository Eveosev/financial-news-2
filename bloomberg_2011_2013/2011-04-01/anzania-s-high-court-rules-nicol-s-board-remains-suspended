Tanzania’s  High Court  ruled that
National Investment Co.’s board and chief executive officer
should remain suspended pending a further hearing on April 14,
the Capital Markets and Securities Authority said.  Nicol, as it is known, is challenging the suspensions
ordered by the regulator last month over the company’s
“unsatisfactory” asset portfolio. No one answered the phone at
Nicol when Bloomberg called three times today seeking comment.
The company also didn’t respond to e-mailed questions.  “Pending the determination of the application, the High
Court has ordered that the status quo, i.e. the suspension,
should continue until the matter is finally determined,” said
the statement from the Dar es Salaam-based regulator.  Nicol is Tanzania’s biggest mutual fund, according to its
website. The company racked up losses totalling about 10 billion
Tanzania shillings ($6.66 million) after failing to invest using
“acceptable investment principles,” the CMCA said in a statement
on March 14. The company also hasn’t ensured that feasibility
and due-diligence have been conducted, and doesn’t involve an
independent investment committee and  fund manager  before
committing funds, the regulator said.  “This has resulted in Nicol making losses and thereby
denying its shareholders the opportunity to receive dividend
payments,” it said.  Nicol, which began trading on the  Dar es Salaam  Stock
Exchange in May 2008, hasn’t published financial statements
since 2009, according to the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
