The international monetary system
needs reform because, though it didn’t cause the current
instability in the global economy, it hasn’t effectively tackled
it,  Joseph Stiglitz  wrote in the Financial Times.  Stiglitz, who won the 2001  Nobel Prize  for economics and is
a professor at Columbia University, said the Group of 20 nations
must take the lead in expanding the system of International
Monetary Fund special drawing rights.  Issuing as much as $390 billion of new SDRs a year for the
next three years would enable central banks to exchange SDRs for
hard currency such as dollars or euros, and use it to finance
higher imports; it would reduce countries’ need to accumulate
foreign-exchange reserves; and by doing that, it would help to
correct global imbalances, Stiglitz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
