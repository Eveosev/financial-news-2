The  World Bank  agreed to lend  Ghana 
$295 million to support land administration, skills development
and local governance, the Washington-based institution said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The West African nation, which is opening offices for land
registration in regional cities, will use $50 million to
strengthen the process, according to the statement.  “One of the main constraints to agriculture in Ghana is
land, but better legislation and management will make a big
difference on growth and jobs,” Ishac Diwan, World Bank country
director, said in the statement.  Ghana, which has already reduced the amount of time it
takes to obtain a land deed to three months from more than 36,
aims to shorten that period further to a maximum of one month,
the World Bank said. The government will spend another $70
million of the funds on modernizing the system of vocational
training by upgrading the skills of service providers.  The other $175 million will be used to help local
authorities to manage  Ghana ’s rapid urbanization.  The funds are zero rated credit facilities and repayable
after 35 years including a 10-year grace period, Kennedy Fosu,
spokesman for the World Bank’s local office, said in answer to
e-mailed questions today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
