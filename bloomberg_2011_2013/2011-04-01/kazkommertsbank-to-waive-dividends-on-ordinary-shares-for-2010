Kazkommertsbank,  Kazakhstan ’s
largest lender by assets, plans to waive dividends for holders
of ordinary shares for 2010 to boost capital reserves.  Kazakommertsbank should increase its capital reserves by
10.45 billion tenge ($72 million) from 50 billion tenge on March
1 to meet new regulatory requirements, the Almaty-based lender
said in a statement on its  website  today. The increase will come
from net income.  Kazkommertsbank said yesterday profit rose 16 percent last
year to 22 billion tenge. The lender expects net income growth
to slow to as little as 10 percent this year.  The government’s National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna
bought stakes in Kazkommertsbank and Halyk Bank and took control
of BTA Bank in early 2009 after credit markets froze and the
country’s property bubble burst. Kazkommertsbank delayed a
planned sale of as much as $750 million of five-year bonds in
dollars on Nov. 2.  The bank is monitoring market prices for opportunities to
sell bonds, Sergei Mokrousov, a managing director at
Kazkommertsbank, told reporters in Almaty today. The lender
doesn’t plan “large borrowing” domestically, he said.  Kazkommertsbank is ready to buy back Samruk-Kazyna’s 21
percent stake if other shareholders decline to exercise their
right to do so, Mokrousov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
