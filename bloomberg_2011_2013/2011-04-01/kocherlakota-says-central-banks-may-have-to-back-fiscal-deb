Federal  Reserve Bank  of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota said it may be “optimal” for
central banks to back government debts in certain situations,
without referring to the U.S.  “I suspect that it may be optimal for central banks to
guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations,” the bank
president, who votes on monetary policy this year, said in the
text of a speech today in Philadelphia. He did not comment on
monetary policy or the U.S. economy in his remarks.  The regional chief voted with the rest of the  Federal Open
Market Committee  at its March meeting to keep in place the Fed’s
second round of large-scale Treasury purchases to stimulate
growth and reduce unemployment.  Kocherlakota said last month that the  U.S. economy  would
have to “worsen materially” for the Fed to consider extending
bond purchases past June.  Kocherlakota, 47, has led the Minneapolis Fed since October
2009 and is former chairman of the economics department at the
University of Minnesota. Kocherlakota earned his bachelor’s
degree in mathematics from  Princeton University  and his
doctorate from the University of Chicago.  The bank president, in an interview published by the Wall
Street Journal today, said policy makers may need to lift the
target rate for overnight loans between banks by more than 50
basis points later this year if his inflation forecast holds
out. He said he is expecting a “big upward movement” in
inflation, excluding food and energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
