Ford Motor Co. (F)  outsold  General
Motors Co. (GM)  for the first time in more than a year in March as GM
offered smaller discounts and Ford boosted sales of new or
refreshed models.  Ford’s light-vehicle deliveries in the month climbed to
212,295, topping GM’s sales of 206,621, the companies said
today. GM’s 9.6 percent sales increase trailed five analysts’
average estimate for a 20 percent gain. Ford, beating GM for the
second time in the past 13 years, reported a 16 percent increase
that topped the average estimate for a 13 percent advance.  GM reduced discounts by $600 to $800 per vehicle in March
from February, dropping them below the industry average of about
10 percent of selling prices,  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president
of U.S. sales, said yesterday. Ford, which doubled sales of the
redesigned Explorer sport-utility vehicle, last beat GM’s sales
in February 2010 and during a GM strike in August 1998.  “Ford is clearly winning the overall war here,” said
Mitchell Stapley, who helps oversee $17.7 billion as chief
fixed-income officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in  Grand
Rapids , Michigan. “GM hasn’t had the organic sales growth
without rebates that they need to be able to say they’ve
regained momentum from Ford.”  Industrywide light-vehicle sales ran at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 13.1 million in March, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. That topped the 12.9 million average
estimate of nine analysts. The sales pace accelerated from 11.7
million a year earlier and slowed from 13.4 million in February,
according to the  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based researcher.  Ford Fleet Sales  GM said it outsold Ford during the month on a retail basis,
which excludes deliveries to corporate, government and rental-
car company buyers. Ford had 75,280 fleet sales in March, or a
35 percent share of its deliveries, while GM sold 56,465
vehicles to fleet buyers, a 27 percent share.  The margin that Ford beat GM by was “larger than we
expected,” Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com,
said today in an interview. “Ford has a lot of momentum right
now, and GM is suffering a hangover from the aggressive
incentives they offered in January and February.”  GM still leads for the year, 592,545 to 495,508, Autodata
said.  GM rose $1.38, or 4.5 percent, to $32.41 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ford gained 25 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $15.16.  Chrysler Group LLC, the third-largest U.S. automaker,
reported a 31 percent increase in sales for the month, beating
the 20 percent average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Toyota Sales Drop  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest automaker, said
deliveries of Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands fell 5.7 percent to
176,222 vehicles. The drop, led by fewer sales of its Camry
sedan and RAV4 SUV, was bigger than the 3.6 percent average
estimate of four analysts.  Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest Japanese automaker,
increased deliveries 27 percent, topping four analysts’ average
estimate of 16 percent. Honda Motor Co., the third-largest, said
its sales in the U.S. rose 23 percent last month to 133,650
Honda and Acura brand cars and light trucks, trailing four
analysts’ average estimate for a 24 percent gain.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s largest automaker, said
deliveries rose 32 percent to 61,873 vehicles, a record for its
U.S. sales in March.  The March 11  Japan  earthquake that shut factories of auto
manufacturers and their suppliers may not have a “significant”
impact on industry sales, GM’s Johnson said today. He repeated
GM’s forecast from earlier this year that U.S. auto sales may
rise to 13 million to 13.5 million in 2011, including medium-and
heavy-duty vehicles.  No ‘Significant’ Slowdown  “Based on everything I see now, I just don’t see a
significant slowdown happening,” Johnson said on a conference
call.  Ford said today in a regulatory filing that the earthquake
may “adversely affect” its financial condition. The
automaker’s truck plant in Louisville,  Kentucky , will be closed
next week due to a parts shortage, Ford said today on a
conference call. The factory makes F-Series pickups and the
Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs, according to its
website.  Global automakers may have lost production of 585,000 light
vehicles in March including 550,000 in Japan, according to IHS
Automotive in Lexington,  Massachusetts . Automakers may
eventually lose as much as 100,000 units of production in  North
America  beginning in April that likely would be made up by the
end of the year, according to J.D. Power & Associates in Troy,
 Michigan .  GM Inventory  GM ended March with inventory of about 574,000 vehicles,
57,000 more than a month earlier, according to today’s
statement. The automaker’s increased sales of the Chevrolet
Cruze helped double GM’s share in the compact-car segment to
more than 11 percent in the first quarter, from 5.4 percent in
the same period a year earlier.  Ford’s sales of the Explorer climbed to 12,482, while the
new Fiesta small car set a monthly record of 9,787 deliveries.
Sales of the Fusion sedan climbed 21 percent to 27,566.  Higher demand for small cars such as the Fiesta and Focus
“pinched” inventories, Pipas said. The Fiesta has about a 40-
days supply, from 60 days at the beginning of March, and Focus
inventory also declined, he said.  “Most likely, lean small-car inventories will be a
headwind on the industry’s sales rates as we began this month,”
Pipas said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
