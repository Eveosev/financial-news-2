Peter Gardener and Rodney Mitchell,
the former joint chief executive officers of Leisurenet Ltd.,
have started their seven-year prison sentences at  Cape Town ’s
Pollsmor Prison, the Cape Times  reported  today, citing Jeremy
Tyfield, the pair’s lawyer.  Leisurenet was declared bankrupt in 2000. In 2007 the  High
Court  found Gardener and Mitchell guilty of having defrauded the
company of 12 million rand ($1.8 million), the newspaper, based
in the city, said.  The company owned the Health & Racquet gym club,  South
Africa ’s biggest health-club chain at the time, the Planet
Hollywood restaurant and the Imax theater at the V&A Waterfront
in Cape Town, the Cape Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
