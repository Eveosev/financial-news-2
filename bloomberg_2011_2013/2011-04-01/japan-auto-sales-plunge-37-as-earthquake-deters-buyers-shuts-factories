Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  led a record drop
in Japan’s March auto sales after the nation’s biggest
earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis deterred buyers and forced
automakers to shut factories.  Sales of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars, fell
37 percent from a year earlier to 279,389 vehicles last month,
the  Japan Automobile Dealers Association  said in a statement
today. Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, sold 110,667 units
excluding Lexus-brand cars, down 46 percent.  The magnitude-9 earthquake that struck March 11 off the
coast of northeast Japan and the subsequent tsunami left more
than 28,000 people dead or missing and forced Japan’s automakers
to close factories due to shortages of parts and electricity.
The disaster may further depress demand for autos after a
government subsidy for fuel-efficient cars ended in September.  “Rough sales figures will continue until at least June,”
said  Satoru Takada , an analyst at TIW Inc. in Tokyo. “ Consumer
confidence  is falling all across Japan, not only in the areas
hit by the quake. Sales were on a downward trend to begin with,
and the quake just made it even more difficult to predict what
will happen.”  Monthly deliveries at Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, fell 38 percent to 45,700, and sales at Honda
Motor Co., the third-largest, dropped 28 percent to 43,329. The
37 percent industrywide decline was the largest for March since
1968, when the auto dealers association began collecting data.  End of Incentives  Toyota rose 0.2 percent to 3,355 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo . The shares have dropped 8.1 percent since the
day before the earthquake. Nissan declined 1.2 percent today,
and Honda fell 2.4 percent.  Japan’s auto sales rose 11 percent last year to 3.23
million as government incentives boosted demand for fuel-
efficient models. In 2011, sales may drop 13 percent to 2.8
million, according to the dealers association. For the 12 months
ended March 31, vehicle sales excluding minicars fell 6.6
percent to 2.97 million, the association said.  Losses from Japan’s natural disaster may total $200 billion to
$300 billion, according to Risk Management Solutions Inc., which
advises insurers and is based in  Newark ,  California .  Toyota Profit  Toyota President  Akio Toyoda  said today the carmaker’s
earnings will be reduced as a result of disruptions from the
earthquake and tsunami. He declined to say how much profit may
be cut.  Toyota’s operating profit may be reduced by at least 100
billion yen ($1.2 billion) in the fiscal year ended yesterday
and as much as 200 billion yen this fiscal year, said  Koji Endo ,
an analyst at Advanced Research Japan. Any impact on production
overseas will further damp earnings, he said earlier this week.  The automaker has said the company lost 140,000 units of
production from March 14 to March 26, citing a shortage of
electronic parts, rubber and plastics.  The carmaker resumed output of three models at two
factories on March 24, prioritizing hybrids including the Prius.
All 18 plants in  Japan  were halted until then. Toyota built 3.28
million cars in Japan in 2010.  Toyota may delay the production of at least 500,000
vehicles in Japan because of a shortage of parts and electricity
after the earthquake, Endo said.  Nissan said it lost 55,000 units of production last month.
The Yokohama-based carmaker is supplying its factories in Japan
with some automobile components from overseas as local suppliers
were affected by the earthquake and tsunami.  Tokyo-based Honda has said it will lose 46,600 units of
auto production from March 14 to April 3.  Globally, automakers may give up production of 600,000
vehicles by the end of this month, and manufacturing at plants
in  North America  may be affected when parts supplies start
running out as soon as early April,  Michael Robinet , vice
president of Lexington, Massachusetts-based IHS Automotive, said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
