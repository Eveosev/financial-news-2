Portugal ’s port of Sines is
scheduled to receive a shipment of liquefied natural gas from
 Nigeria  at about 7 a.m. tomorrow.  The LNG Enugu is sailing from Bonny in Nigeria, according
to the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA , the port’s
management company. The vessel has a capacity of 145,926 cubic
meters, according to AISLive data on Bloomberg.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from Algeria
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and  Spain . Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Ce-Merapi, a tanker
carrying crude that’s sailing from Ceyhan in Turkey and is
scheduled to arrive on April 5. Sines is one of the European
Union’s biggest deepwater harbors, according to the port’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
