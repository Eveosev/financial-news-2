The pound strengthened after rising
stocks boosted demand for sterling-denominated assets and
investors anticipated data that’s forecast to show an index of
U.K. manufacturing stayed near a record high last month.  U.K. government bonds declined. A gauge of factory output
was probably 60.9 in March, near last month’s 61.5 reading,
according to the median forecast of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The manufacturing index is scheduled for release
by Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  at 9:30 a.m. in London. The U.K.’s
benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100, rose 0.6 percent.  “The PMI number is a bright spot for the U.K. economy,”
said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “It’s always a number that
does have the capacity to move the market, so if it is a good
number today, sterling is likely to see some support.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.6065 as of 8:30 a.m.
Sterling was 0.2 percent stronger at 88.13 pence per euro and
advanced 0.8 percent to 134.36 yen.  Sterling has fluctuated between $1.60 and $1.64 for two
months as  Bank of England  policy makers disagree as to whether
the economy is strong enough to withstand higher borrowing
costs.  Benchmark gilts dropped, pushing the 10-year yield up four
basis points to 3.73 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2020 fell 0.32, or 3.2 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,613)
face amount, to 100.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
