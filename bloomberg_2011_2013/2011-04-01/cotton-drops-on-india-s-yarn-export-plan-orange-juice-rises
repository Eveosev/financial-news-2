Cotton declined for the fifth time
in six sessions after  India , the world’s second-biggest
producer, lifted restrictions on yarn exports. Orange juice
gained.  The trade ministry yesterday said overseas yarn shipments
no longer needed government permission. On Dec. 1, India said it
was capping such exports at 720,000 metric tons in the year
ending Sept. 30 to bolster domestic supplies.  “This definitely is bringing the market down,” said Louis Barbera, a broker at VIP Commodities in  New York .  Cotton for May delivery declined 4.68 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $1.9555 a pound at 2:39 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The commodity dropped 4.4 percent this
week, the third decline in four weeks.  India is the second-biggest cotton exporter, behind the
U.S. China is the largest producer.  Orange-juice  futures for May delivery rose 0.1 cent to
$1.629 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
