Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households fell for a fourth day on forecasts for higher
temperatures from  Illinois  to Georgia that may reduce demand for
the heating fuel.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and
Canada shows shipments fell 10.9 percent to 30.5 million
dekatherms (29.7 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Residences in the Southeast region, which takes in most of
Illinois and excludes Florida, were to receive 4.66 million
dekatherms, down 20.1 percent, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 10
percent to 11.9 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in New Orleans early today was 56
degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius), which is normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The overnight low
may be 59 degrees, 3 degrees above normal.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 0.98 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $4.3236 per million British
thermal units as of 1:32 p.m. New York time on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
