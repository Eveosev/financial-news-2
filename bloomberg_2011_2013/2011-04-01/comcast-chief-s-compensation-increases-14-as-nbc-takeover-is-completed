Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  Chief Executive
Officer Brian Roberts received 14 percent more in compensation
last year, earning $31.1 million as he led the company’s
takeover of NBC Universal.  Roberts earned $2.8 million in base salary, $11.2 million
in stock and option awards and $10.9 million in cash bonuses,
Comcast said today in a  regulatory filing . Comcast also requires
Roberts use company aircraft for personal travel for security
reasons, which added $195,767 to his compensation.  Comcast, the largest U.S. cable-TV carrier, acquired 51
percent of NBC Universal from General Electric Co. for $13.8
billion in cash and assets to expand in programming. The U.S.
Federal Communications Commission approved the deal in January.  Roberts and other executives “successfully managed the
many challenges of advancing the  NBC Universal  transaction from
its signing in December 2009 to its closing in January 2011,”
Philadelphia-based Comcast said today.  Stephen Burke, Comcast executive vice president and CEO of
NBC Universal, made more than Roberts for the second consecutive
year, earning $34.7 million.  Comcast rose 49 cents to $25.21 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 15 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
