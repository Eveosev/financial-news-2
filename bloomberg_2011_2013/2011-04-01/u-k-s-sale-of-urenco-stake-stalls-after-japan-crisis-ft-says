The U.K. government’s plans to sell
its one-third stake in Urenco, a nuclear fuel manufacturer that
it owns jointly with the Dutch government and  RWE AG (RWE)  and  E.ON
AG (EOAN) , have stalled following  Japan ’s Fukushima nuclear plant
disaster, the Financial Times reported, without attribution.  The U.K. Treasury confirmed a sale wasn’t imminent, the FT
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
