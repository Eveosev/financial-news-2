German household heating oil storage
tanks were filled at 50 percent of capacity at the end of
February, down from the previous month, according to  Credit
Agricole  CIB.  Domestic tanks were 52 percent full at the end of January,
London-based oil analyst Christophe Barret said today by phone.  Traders and analysts watch this figure as an indicator of
future demand in  Europe ’s largest market for gasoil. Supplies at
German tanks have fallen from 57 percent full at the end of
December, according to Credit Agricole.  Europe’s gasoil futures market in  London  has been in
backwardation for three weeks, meaning the contract expiring
soonest is trading for more than the contract maturing in the
following month. Backwardation usually signals rising demand, or
decreased supply, for products available for immediate delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
