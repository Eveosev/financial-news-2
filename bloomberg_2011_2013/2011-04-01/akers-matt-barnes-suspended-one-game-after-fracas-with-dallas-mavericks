Los Angeles  Lakers forward Matt
Barnes was suspended one game without pay for “escalating an
on-court altercation and actions following his ejection,”
National Basketball Association Executive Vice President Stu
Jackson said today in a statement released by the league.  Barnes was one of five players ejected from the Lakers’
110-82 victory against the  Dallas Mavericks  last night in Los
Angeles. He will serve his suspension tonight when the Lakers
visit the Utah Jazz, the NBA said.  Barnes intervened in a shoving match between the Lakers’
Steve Blake and Jason Terry of the Mavericks.   “This is a family here,” Barnes said last night. “So if
someone comes and hits your brother, pushes your brother, then
you definitely have their back. And that’s the case here.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
