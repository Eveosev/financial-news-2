India ’s Uttar Pradesh state is
seeking to buy 100 megawatts of power from solar plants to meet
government-set clean energy targets.  Uttar Pradesh Power Corp. , the bulk electricity supplier to
the northern state’s five distribution utilities, will pay a
maximum of 4.74 rupees ($0.11) a kilowatt-hour, it said in a
tender notice in today’s Economic Times.  For the financial year starting today, state electricity
distribution utilities are required to purchase  5 percent  of
their power from clean sources, 0.5 percent from solar and the
remainder from wind, biomass and others, according to an order
posted on the website of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity
Regulatory Commission.  That obligation rises to 6 percent the following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
