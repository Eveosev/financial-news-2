Mexico ’s Congress voted today to
summon the nation’s energy minister to explain new legislation
planned by President Felipe Calderon to modernize state  oil
company   Petroleos Mexicanos .  The permanent commission, which represents Congress during
the recess periods, said Energy Minister Jose Antonio Meade must
testify before lawmakers to provide details about the
legislation.  Calderon said on May 10 in an interview with Bloomberg
television in  New York  he wants to remake Pemex, as the oil
company is known, along the lines of Brazil’s  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  or Norway’s  Statoil ASA (STL) , and he may introduce
legislation in the next congressional period. Congress
reconvenes in September.  Pemex, Latin America’s largest oil producer, plans to
invest about $23 billion this year to boost output. Production
fell to 2.576 million barrels a day in 2010, from a daily
average of 3.4 million when Calderon was energy minister in
2004.  The Senate in April voted to summon Pemex Chief Executive
Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
