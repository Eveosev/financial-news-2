Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
lifted force majeure on shipments at their Collahuasi copper
mine in northern Chile, more than three months after a port
accident disrupted some exports.  Force majeure, a legal clause invoked when companies can’t
meet supply obligations because of circumstances beyond their
control, was lifted as of today, mine operator Cia. Minera Dona
Ines de Collahuasi SCM said in an e-mailed statement.  Collahuasi declared force majeure on shipments on Dec. 20
after a ship-loader at Chile’s Patache port collapsed, killing
three workers. Repairs at the port will be completed this
quarter, according to today’s statement.  Shipments have gradually increased this year as the company
negotiated alternative routes with local ports. Anglo and
Xstrata used ports in northern  Chile  to ship copper from
Collahuasi, the world’s third-largest copper mine.  Collahuasi produced about 3 percent of the world’s copper
last year. Anglo and Xstrata each own a 44 percent share in the
mine, and a group led by Mitsui & Co. holds the remainder.  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida in Chile and Freeport McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg in  Indonesia  are the world’s
largest and second-largest copper mines, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
