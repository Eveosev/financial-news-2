Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  workers in
Zambia ended a strike over pay after reaching agreement with the
company, said Seth Paradza, general secretary of the National
Union of Commercial and Industry Workers.  A decision to fire all the striking workers except
management staff was reversed, Paradza said by phone today from
Lusaka, the capital.  “We have addressed our workers this afternoon and asked
them to resume work after reaching an amicable agreement with
management at a meeting chaired by the ministry of labor and
social security today,” he said.  Employees at Shoprite,  Africa ’s largest food retailer that
operates 18 stores in the southern African country, started a
strike on March 28 to demand an increase in the minimum monthly
wage, a better pension and for workers to be given permanent
jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
