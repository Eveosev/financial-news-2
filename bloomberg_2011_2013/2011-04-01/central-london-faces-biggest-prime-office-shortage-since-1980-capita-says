The biggest shortage of prime office
space in central  London  since at least 1980 will cause rents to
jump in the next two years,  Capita Symonds Ltd.  said.  Rents in the  West End  may rise to 100 pounds ($161) a
square foot from 70 pounds by 2013, the London-based property
broker said in a statement today. In the City of London
financial district, rents may increase to 65 pounds a square
foot from 55 pounds.  “Two years ago, this situation would have been
unthinkable,” James Gillett, a director of Capita Symonds, said
in the statement. “Those who took the plunge and invested in
the central London office market over the last 18 months have
good cause to celebrate.”  Available  office space  has declined in nearly every part of
central London in the last year because of a dearth of new
developments, Capita Symonds said. Only 12 deals in excess of
20,000 square feet (1,900 square meters) took place there in the
first three months of the year, down from 39 a year earlier,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
