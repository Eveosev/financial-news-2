Thousands of people gathered in
Tahrir Square, the site of mass demonstrations that toppled
 Hosni Mubarak , to voice demands including the prosecution of the
former president’s associates.  The Alliance of the Youths’ Revolution, a coalition of
groups that led 18 days of mass demonstrations that resulted in
Mubarak’s ouster, called for the rallies, dubbing today “The
Friday of Rescuing the Revolution.”  In a statement on its Facebook page, the group called for
the trial of symbols of Mubarak’s regime, particularly Safwat el-Sherif, former speaker of the upper house of parliament;
Fathi Sorour, ex-speaker of the lower house of parliament; and
Zakaria Azmy, former chief of the presidential staff.  The three are “pillars of the former regime,” Nasser
Abdel Hamid, a member of the alliance who took part in today’s
protests, said by telephone. “The fact that they haven’t been
tried yet is strange.”  Egypt  banned the three men from travel amid allegations of
corruption, Al-Ahram newspaper reported today, citing Deputy
Justice Minister Assem el-Gohary. Officials have received
complaints accusing the men of exploiting their positions to
enrich themselves, Al-Ahram said.  Demonstrators are demanding legal action against symbols of
corruption and punishment of those responsible for the killing
of protesters during the unrest.  Mubarak ceded interim authority to the Supreme Council of
the Armed Forces on Feb. 11. The military rulers said this week
that parliamentary elections will be held in September and a
presidential vote within the following two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
