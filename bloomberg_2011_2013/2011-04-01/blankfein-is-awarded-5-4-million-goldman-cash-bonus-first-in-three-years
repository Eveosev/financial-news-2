Lloyd C. Blankfein,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) ’s chairman and chief executive officer, was awarded a
$5.4 million cash bonus for 2010, his first in three years.  The award was disclosed in the New York-based firm’s proxy
statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today. The company reported in January that it paid Blankfein a
$12.6 million restricted-stock bonus for 2010 and will raise his
annual salary to $2 million salary this year from $600,000.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
increased Blankfein’s compensation even though earnings dropped
38 percent and the stock price was little changed from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
