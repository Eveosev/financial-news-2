PAT Galnaftogaz, a Ukrainian
operator of filling stations, said profit more than doubled in
2010 as the company increased sales and cut costs.  Net income soared to 306 million hryvnia ($38.377 million)
from 132.1 million hryvnia a year earlier under International
accounting standards, Lviv-based Galnaftogaz said today in a
statement on its  website .  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBIDTA, rose 42.1 percent to 653.3 million
hryvnia, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
