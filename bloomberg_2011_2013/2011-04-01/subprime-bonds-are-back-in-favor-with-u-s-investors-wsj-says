Subprime home-mortgage bonds of the
kind that helped to cause the financial crisis are back in favor
with U.S. investors, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Prices on a representative segment of the subprime  bond
market  have risen from 30 cents on the dollar at the low point
of the crisis to about 60 cents, the newspaper said.  The attraction of bonds underpinned by subprime mortgages
lies in their substantial yields, the Journal said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
