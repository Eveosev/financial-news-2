President Jeffrey Lacker said the U.S. central bank may need to
tighten monetary policy later this year in response to a growing
economy and rising inflation.  “It wouldn’t surprise me if we need to act before the end
of the year,” Lacker said today in a CNBC television interview.
“Inflation is the bigger risk this year. That is what you have
to keep your eye on.”  Lacker said today’s employment report showed “strong
private sector growth” that is consistent with “pretty strong
momentum in the economy right now.”  The  U.S. economy  added 216,000 workers last month, more
than forecast, and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined
to a two-year low of 8.8 percent, figures from the Labor
Department showed today.  Lacker said tightening policy could include deciding not to
reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage-backed securities,
selling assets and raising the Fed’s target interest rate from
near zero. He said both asset sales and interest rate hikes
“could be warranted this year.”  “The exact sequence of that is something we are hashing
out and trying to think through,” Lacker said in the televised
interview, adding “I haven’t made up my mind yet” on whether
the Fed should reduce its plan to purchase $600 billion in U.S.
Treasuries through June.  “I think it deserves very careful reconsideration,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
