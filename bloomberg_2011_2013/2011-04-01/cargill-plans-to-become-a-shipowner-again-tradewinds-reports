Cargill Ocean Transportation  plans
to become a shipowner again, a decade after selling its last
vessel, TradeWinds reported, citing company President Gert-Jan
van den Akker.  An excess of ships will cut freight rates, consequently
lowering vessel prices, the shipping-industry newspaper today
cited him as saying. That will give Cargill an opportunity to
buy vessels and also pave the way for the industry to recover as
scrapping of aging ships reduces the glut, he said, according to
 TradeWinds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
