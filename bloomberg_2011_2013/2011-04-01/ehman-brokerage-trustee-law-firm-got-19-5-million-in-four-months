$19.5 million for four months’ work plus expenses, according to

the 24 months from the Lehman brokerage’s September 2008
bankruptcy through September 2010, according to the audit
report. As of Sept. 30, total administrative fees for the
bankrupt brokerage, including for accountants and consultants,
were $420 million, it said.  Parent Company  Separately, the Lehman parent company spent more than $1.2
