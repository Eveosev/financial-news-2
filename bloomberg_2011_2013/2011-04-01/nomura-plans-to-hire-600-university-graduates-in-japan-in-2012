Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  plans to hire
the same number of university graduates in Japan next fiscal
year even after a record earthquake struck the nation.  About 600 local college graduates will join Nomura
Securities Co., the main brokerage unit, in April 2012, said
Keiko Sugai, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman. The firm hired 604
graduates for the fiscal year that started today.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
also aim to keep hiring levels little changed next year, the
companies said today. The plans suggest investment banks expect
business to withstand a likely drop in economic output following
the quake and ensuing tsunami that left more than 28,000 people
dead or missing and crippled a nuclear power plant.  “Now is the time to show  Japan ’s fundamental power,”
Nomura Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe told new
employees today via video linkup. The brokerage “will work
together toward the revitalization of the Japanese economy.”  Nomura, Japan’s biggest securities group, canceled its
traditional ceremony for new staff following the March 11
catastrophe.  Honda Motor Co. and Sony Corp. are among manufacturers that
halted production after the disaster. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s biggest automaker, expects earnings will be reduced,
President  Akio Toyoda  said.  Daiwa Securities , Japan’s second-largest brokerage, said it
aims to hire 490 graduates next year, up from 446 who joined the
brokerage today. SMBC Nikko Securities plans to recruit 430
graduates, compared with 493 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
