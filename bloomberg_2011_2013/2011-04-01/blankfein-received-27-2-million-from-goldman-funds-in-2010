Lloyd C. Blankfein,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) ’s chairman and chief executive officer, received
$27.2 million from his investments in funds managed by the firm
last year, 43 percent more than his annual compensation.  The payments, which included profits and any return of
capital from the employee funds, were disclosed in the firm’s
annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The filing also showed the New York-based
company awarded Blankfein, 56, $19 million in compensation for
2010, including a $5.4 million cash bonus and $12.6 million in
restricted stock.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets,
allows employees to invest in private equity and hedge funds
that are managed by the company. Today’s filing showed Blankfein
and eight deputies reaped about $125 million from their fund
investments during the year.  In addition to Blankfein, the largest fund distributions
were $23.3 million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2
million to President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
50; $16.7 million to Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
55, and $13.7 million to Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans, 53.  The others disclosed in the filing today were $10.9 million
to Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to
Vice Chairman John S. Weinberg, 54, and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of
compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
