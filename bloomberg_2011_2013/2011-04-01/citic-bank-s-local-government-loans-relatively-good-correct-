(Corrects title of executive in first paragraph.)  China Citic Bank Corp.’s loans to
the financing vehicles of local governments have “relatively
good” quality, President Chen Xiaoxian said at a briefing in
Beijing today.  More than 90 percent of Citic Bank’s loans to the financing
vehicles of local governments are fully or “basically” covered
by cash flows, Chen said. Not a single loan was overdue as of
Dec. 31 and interest payments were all normal, Chen said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
