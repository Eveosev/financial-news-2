Alaskan crude-oil production slipped
5.9 percent in March from last year in a natural decline of the
state’s North Slope fields that has curbed output for almost a
decade.  “This was in the range of the projected decline of
production we are receiving,” Matt Carle, spokesman for Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., the pipeline operator, said in telephone
interview. “Without new fields coming online and production,
the throughput from the North Slope will continue to decline.”  Production in March averaged 646,617 barrels a day, a
decline from 687,796 a year earlier, according to the  Alaska Tax
Division . Output increased by 1,850 barrels from the previous
month.  Oil inventories in the state finished the month at 1.8
million barrels, after dropping as low as 529,272 barrels on
March 27, according to the tax division.  The 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) system that runs from
 Prudhoe Bay  on the North Slope to Valdez, the northernmost ice-
free port in the U.S., was started after a bypass was installed
around a leak at Pump Station 1.  Alaska production has declined every year since 2002, U.S.
Energy Department  figures  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
