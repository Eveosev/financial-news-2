AS Baltika, the third-largest Baltic
clothing company, said revenue rose 6.5 percent in March from a
year earlier, led by rising retail sales in Latvia and  Estonia .  Revenue increased to 3.9 million euros ($5.5 million) from
3.7 million a year ago, the Tallinn-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. Retail sales increased 26 percent in
Latvia and 18 percent in Estonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
