Private-equity firms raised $42.3
billion in the first quarter, the lowest amount in almost eight
years, researcher Preqin Ltd. said.  U.S. firms raised the most, with 45 funds getting $25.9
billion of commitments, London-based Preqin said today in an e-
mailed statement. The first-quarter total may increase as Preqin
collects more data, according to the statement.  Institutional investors stung by the financial crisis have
been slow to commit to new buyout funds, which raised $211.7
billion in the second quarter of 2007, considered the peak of
the leveraged-buyout boom. The freeze in credit markets in 2008
slowed the pace of deals, leaving private-equity managers with
larger-than-expected pools they still needed to spend.  “The private-equity fundraising market is currently in a
transitional period,” Preqin said in the statement. “Although
overall figures are disappointing, there are signs of increasing
investor confidence.”  The quarter was the weakest for fundraising since the final
three months of 2003, when fund managers raised $38 billion,
according to Preqin.  The research firm pointed to interim closes during the
first quarter of 2011, which totaled $26.3 billion across 110
funds. That’s an indication that private-equity firms are
actively seeking more money, and getting it, which should be
reflected in future studies.  More than half of investors surveyed by Preqin in December
said they expected to commit more to private equity this year
than in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
