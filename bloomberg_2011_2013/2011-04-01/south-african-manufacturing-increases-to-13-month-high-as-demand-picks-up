South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
index rose to a 13-month high in March as  interest rates  at a
30-year low spurred consumer demand and exports picked up,
 Kagiso Securities Ltd.  said.  The seasonally adjusted index advanced to 57.2 from 54.8 in
February, Johannesburg-based Kagiso said in an e-mailed
statement today. The PMI has been above 50, which indicates an
expansion in factory production, for five consecutive months.  The recovery in manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of
the economy, is strengthening after the central bank cut its
benchmark rate three times last year to 5.5 percent to help
support  consumer spending . Rising global demand for vehicles has
also boosted exports, which climbed 17 percent in February, the
South African Revenue Service said yesterday.  The business activity sub-index jumped 8.1 points to 59.7,
indicating “a ramp-up of manufacturing production in March,
possibly as a reaction to previous indications of improved
demand conditions,” Kagiso consultant Theo Vorster said in the
statement.  The index measuring new sales orders increased to 62 from
59 in the previous month, while the price sub-index climbed to
88, its highest level since 2008, Kagiso said.  Manufacturers probably shed jobs in March, with the
employment sub-index dropping to 46.9, after rising above 50 in
February.  The  Bureau for Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
