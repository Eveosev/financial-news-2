Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  completed
maintenance on a hydrocracker, a sat gas plant and a hydrogen
unit at its refinery in Torrance,  California , and the plant is
back to normal operations, said Aarti Ramachandran, a
spokeswoman at the refinery.  “The turnaround is complete and we’re back to normal
operations,” Ramachandran said in an e-mail today.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The refinery has a capacity of 155,800 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
