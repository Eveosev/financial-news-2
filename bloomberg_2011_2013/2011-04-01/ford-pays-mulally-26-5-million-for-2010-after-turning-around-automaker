Ford Motor Co. (F)  raised Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally’s compensation 48 percent to
$26.5 million for 2010 as the automaker posted its largest
annual profit in more than a decade.  Mulally received $1.4 million in salary, $9.45 million in
bonus and $15.7 million in stock, option awards and other pay,
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said today in a filing. Executive
Chairman  Bill Ford , who hadn’t accepted compensation since the
first quarter of 2005, got $4.8 million in salary, $2.7 million
in bonus and about $19 million in stock, option awards and other
pay. His total reflects compensation he has forgone since 2008.  Ford last month gave Mulally $56.5 million in stock and
Bill Ford $42.4 million as a reward for the automaker’s
turnaround. Ford’s shares rose 68 percent in 2010 as new models
such as the Fiesta small car helped the automaker gain U.S.
market share for the second year in a row. Mulally, who joined
Ford in 2006 from  Boeing Co. (BA) , halted three years of losses and
led Ford to $9.28 billion in net income in the last two years.  “It is deserved, but it is going to be a talking point
because the average guy on the street will think that’s a whole
lot of money,” said  Bernie McGinn , president of McGinn
Investment Management in Alexandria,  Virginia , which owns
330,000 Ford common shares. “I’m a little concerned the union
will come back and legitimately say, ‘We gave it up when you
needed it and now we want ours.’”  UAW Negotiations  United Auto Workers President  Bob King  will negotiate new
contracts this year with Ford,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler
Group LLC. While the agreements don’t expire until September,
King has said workers must be rewarded for the $7,000 to $30,000
in concessions they each gave up since 2005 to help the
automakers survive.  “ Alan Mulally  is a great CEO, but I don’t think any human
being in the world deserves that much money,” King said March
22 of Mulally’s $56.5 million stock award. “It’s outrageous.”  Ford said in the filing that it achieved 44 percent to 200
percent of its 2010 performance and bonus targets for pretax
profit,  cash flow , cost cuts, market share and vehicle quality.
Ford’s $6.56 billion profit in 2010 was its largest since 1999.  “Alan Mulally’s leadership during 2010 has been widely
recognized as extraordinary,” said  John Stoll , a Ford
spokesman. “His compensation reflects Ford’s goal of retaining
a world-class CEO.”  Salaried Workers  Ford told its 20,000 U.S. salaried workers on Jan. 13 they
won’t receive raises this year because their compensation is
commensurate with other large U.S. companies. The automaker,
which restored salary raises last year, said it will continue to
pay bonuses this year.  Ford borrowed $23.4 billion in late 2006 after Mulally, 65,
took over as CEO, putting up assets including its blue oval logo
as collateral. That helped the automaker stay out of bankruptcy
in 2009 as the predecessors of GM and Chrysler sought court
protection and reorganized with U.S. aid.  GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson was given a $9
million compensation package when he took the job, the company
said in a Sept. 10 regulatory filing. Akerson, whose pay is
subject to federal review, receives $1.7 million in annual
salary, $5.3 million in stock that pays out over three years,
and $2 million in restricted stock, the company said.  Counterparts’ Pay  Sergio Marchionne , Chrysler’s CEO, last year received so-
called deferred phantom shares valued at $2.87 million as of
Dec. 31 for his three-year term on the board, the automaker said
Feb. 25. He didn’t receive a salary from Chrysler, which is
operated by Fiat SpA. Marchionne’s total compensation at Fiat,
where he’s also CEO, was $4.77 million last year.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the world’s most profitable automaker, paid
CEO Martin Winterkorn $12.9 million in compensation for 2010,
the company said March 10.  Mulally’s 2009 compensation totaled $17.9 million,
including $1.4 million in salary and $16.5 million in stock,
option awards and other compensation. Bill Ford’s delayed
compensation for 2009 was $16.8 million. He began receiving
compensation in 2010 because the company’s auto operations
returned to profitability on an annual basis, Ford has said.  To win concessions from the  UAW  in 2009, Mulally and Bill
Ford agreed to 30 percent cuts in their 2009 and 2010 salaries
and to forgo bonuses for 2008 and 2009. Mulally and Bill Ford
will each receive a salary of $2 million this year, the company
said in the filing.  Ford rose 25 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $15.16 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have lost
9.7 percent this year.  Booth’s Compensation  Chief Financial Officer  Lewis Booth  received $8.2 million
in total compensation for 2010, more than double the $3.83
million he received a year earlier, the company said. Booth’s
2010 compensation included a $1.24 million salary, $3 million in
bonus and $3.96 million in  stock options  and other share-based
awards.  Mark Fields , the company’s president of the Americas, got
total compensation of $8.82 million, more than double the $3.98
million he received a year earlier, Ford said.  The company plans to hold its annual  shareholders’ meeting 
May 12 in Wilmington,  Delaware .  To contact the reporter on this story:
