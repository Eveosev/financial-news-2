Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 11:30 a.m. Jakarta-time break.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  gained 28.56 points, or 0.8
percent, to 3,707.23, rising for a third day. The gauge is on
course for a 2.8 percent increase this week. It sank 0.7 percent
in the first quarter of this year.  Financing companies: PT Mandala Multifinance (MFIN IJ), the
nation’s third-biggest specialty finance company, advanced 7.5
percent to 500 rupiah and PT Clipan Finance Indonesia (CFIN IJ),
the fourth largest, gained 3.6 percent to 580 rupiah.  Indonesia’s March consumer prices fell 0.32 percent from a
month earlier, more than the median estimate of a 0.02 percent
drop by 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Slower
inflation eases pressure on the central bank to raise borrowing
costs.  PT Bank Rakyat  Indonesia  (BBRI IJ), Indonesia’s second-
largest bank by assets, advanced 2.6 percent to 5,900 rupiah.
Bank Rakyat had its rating raised to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG, which raised its
forecasts for the company’s earnings growth.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ), the nation’s largest coal
producer, gained 1.5 percent to 3,400 rupiah. Bumi’s 2010 net
income climbed to $311.18 million from $190.45 million a year
earlier, it said yesterday. That compares with a mean estimate
of $276.29 million of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  PT Sorini Agro Asia Corporindo (SOBI IJ), a sorbitol
producer, rose 2.2 percent to 3,450 rupiah. Cargill Inc. has
offered to buy the remaining shares of Sorini it doesn’t already
own at 3,500 rupiah each through a tender offer starting today
until April 29, Cargill said in a statement published in  Bisnis
Indonesia  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
