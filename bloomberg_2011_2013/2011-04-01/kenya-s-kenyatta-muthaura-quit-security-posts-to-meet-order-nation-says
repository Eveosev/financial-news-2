Kenyan Finance Minister  Uhuru
Kenyatta  and Francis Muthaura, the head of the public service,
resigned from key security posts to comply with an International
Criminal Court request, the  Daily Nation  reported.  Kenyatta quit the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Security and
Foreign Relations and said he would no longer attend its
meetings, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing a March 23
letter. He also resigned his position as a member of the Witness
Protection Advisory Board, it said.  Muthaura stepped down as chairman of the National Security
Advisory Committee and won’t take part in discussions by the
panel, the newspaper said.  The two men’s decisions come after International Criminal
Court Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo demanded to know
whether Muthaura’s position as head of the public service
granted him access to the state’s security apparatus in a way
that might interfere with witnesses, amid an investigation into
post-election violence in  Kenya , it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
