The Czech Republic’s public finance
deficit narrowed to 4.7 percent of economic output last year,
totaling less than the initial estimates showed, the country’s
statistics office said.  The Czech Finance Ministry initially estimated the public
sector deficit, which is the fiscal yardstick for assessing a
 European Union  member’s readiness to join the euro area, at 4.8
percent of gross domestic product. The deficit was 5.8 percent
in 2009.  Czech public-sector debt, another condition for euro
adoption, rose to 38.5 percent of GDP, from 35.3 percent in the
previous year, the statistics office said in a statement posted
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
