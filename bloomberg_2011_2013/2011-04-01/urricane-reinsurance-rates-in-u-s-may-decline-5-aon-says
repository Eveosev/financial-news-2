U.S. hurricane reinsurance prices
may decline as much as 5 percent in June and July because firms
hold enough capital to compete for business even as they pay
claims on earthquakes in  New Zealand  and  Japan ,  Aon Corp. (AON)  said.  “The reinsurance market remains functional with its
existing capital base,” Bryon Ehrhart, chairman of the
insurance broker’s Aon Benfield Analytics business, said today
in a statement. “We do not anticipate the need for material new
capital flows into the reinsurance market to satisfy insurer
demand for catastrophe reinsurance based upon the global events
to date.”  Rates for U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance that
includes hurricane protection fell 5 to 10 percent in the
quarter ended April 1, said Aon, the world’s largest insurance
broker. Supply of funds to backstop insurers may outstrip
demand, Aon said. Reinsurers help protect primary carriers such
as  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  Axa SA (CS)  against the cost of major claims from
hurricanes and earthquakes.  Global prices for reinsurance coverage have fallen on high
levels of capital available in the industry, according to Guy
Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance brokerage of New York-based
Marsh & McLennan Cos. The June-through-November U.S. hurricane
season hasn’t resulted in major damages for two consecutive
years after  Hurricane Ike  hit the U.S. in 2008 and cost insurers
$18.5 billion, according to  estimates  by  Munich Re , the biggest
reinsurer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
