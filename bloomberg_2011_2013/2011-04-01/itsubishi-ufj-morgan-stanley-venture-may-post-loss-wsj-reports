Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
Securities Co. may post a loss of about 80 billion yen ($960
million) for the fiscal year, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The joint venture between Japan’s  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306)  and Morgan Stanley recorded unrealized losses from
bond trading, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. Mitsubishi UFJ owns 60 percent of the
venture and New York-based Morgan Stanley the rest, the
newspaper said.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities may try to raise
capital by selling new shares to Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
Holdings Co., the parent of Mitsubishi UFJ’s brokerage units,
the newspaper reported.  Susumu Taroura, a spokesman for Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities in  Tokyo  declined to comment on the report. A
