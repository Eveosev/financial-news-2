The  Baltic Exchange ’s Baltex
electronic system for trading dry-bulk shipping derivatives will
start operating next month, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Penn
said.  “We expect that to be in May,” Penn told a Coaltrans
conference in Geneva today. “It will meet requirements of
traders for a more transparent marketplace.”  Traders of the contracts, known as forward freight
agreements, had been concerned about the time taken to develop
Baltex, according to a Feb. 8 letter to the exchange from the
Freight Market Information Users’ Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
