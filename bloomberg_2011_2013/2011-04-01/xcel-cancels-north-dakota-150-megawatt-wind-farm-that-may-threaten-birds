Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) , a Minneapolis-
based utility, canceled plans to build a 150-megawatt wind farm
in southeastern North Dakota after determining that minimizing
its impact on wildlife may run up costs.  The decision was based on “the adverse impact this project
could have on endangered or threatened species protected by
federal law, and uncertainty in the cost and timing in
mitigating this impact,” Xcel said today in a regulatory
filing.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service had expressed concern that
certain bird species were at risk, Xcel said in an e-mailed
statement.  The $400 million Merricourt project was expected to go into
operation this year, according to the filing. It was to be built
in partnership with EnXco Inc., the U.S. project development
unit of Paris-based  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA. (EEN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
