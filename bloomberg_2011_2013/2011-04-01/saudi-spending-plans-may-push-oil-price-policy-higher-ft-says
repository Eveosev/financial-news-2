Saudi Arabia  may need the oil price
to rise to more than $100 a barrel by 2015 to be able to fulfill
its plans to increase public spending, the Financial Times
reported, citing new estimates by the  Institute of International
Finance .  The break-even oil price for the Saudi Arabian government
to balance its budget was $68 a barrel last year, $88 this year,
and will increase to $110 in 2015, the IIF said, according to
the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
