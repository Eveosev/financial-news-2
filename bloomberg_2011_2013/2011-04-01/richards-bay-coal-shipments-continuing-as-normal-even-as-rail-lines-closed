Shipments from  Richards Bay Coal
Terminal ,  Africa ’s biggest coal export facility, will continue
as normal after both rail lines carrying fuel to the operation
were closed following a derailment.  “We’re operating as normal,” RBCT spokeswoman Zama Luthuli said by mobile phone today. “We have 3 million tons of
stock on the ground.” She declined to say how much tonnage will
be delayed by the derailment.  Transnet Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-owned ports and freight
rail operator, yesterday closed both lines carrying coal to the
east coast terminal after a derailment at Camden.  One of the lines reopened earlier today, Transnet spokesman
Sandile Simelane said by phone. The utility is working on the
other line and plans to give an update on operations on April 4,
he said. An investigation into what caused the train to derail
is continuing, Simelane said.  While RBCT is capable of shipping 91 million metric tons of
coal a year, it exported 63.4 million tons in 2010, Chief
Executive Officer Raymond Chirwa said on March 30. Deliveries to
the terminal were hindered by derailments and strikes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
