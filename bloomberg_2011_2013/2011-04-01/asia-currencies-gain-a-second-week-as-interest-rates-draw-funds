South Korea ’s won led a second week
of gains among Asian currencies as overseas investors poured
funds into the region to benefit from higher  interest rates 
compared with those in developed nations.  Taiwan’s central bank raised borrowing costs on March 31,
joining Thailand, South  Korea ,  India , Indonesia, and the
Philippines in tightening policy this year to counter rising
consumer prices. The inflation rate in Korea climbed to 4.7
percent in March, the highest since October 2008, the statistics
department reported yesterday. Benchmark interest rates in
Indonesia and India are 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent, versus 1
percent in Europe and a maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S.  “Most central banks in  Asia  are still inclined to raise
rates in the coming quarter,” said Christy Tan, a foreign-
exchange strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in
 Singapore . “That’s supportive for Asian currencies.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies, advanced 0.6 percent this
week to 117.61, the highest level since 1997. The won rose 2.1
percent over the five days to 1,091.20 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Taiwan dollar
gained 0.7 percent to NT$29.320.  Foreign investors increased holdings of South Korean shares
for a 12th day, the longest run of net purchases this year.
Funds based abroad plowed $2.3 billion into equities in Korea,
 Indonesia , Taiwan and Thailand this week as of March 31, stock
exchange data show. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index climbed 0.8
percent from a week ago.  Economic Improvement  “Global stocks, including South Korea’s, have been
performing well on expectations for an economic improvement,”
said Ha Jun Woo, a currency dealer at Daegu Bank in Seoul.  Malaysia’s ringgit climbed to the strongest level in more
than 13 years after a central bank report on March 31 showed
international investors raised holdings of local-currency debt
to a record. Purchasing Managers’ Indexes of manufacturing
published in  China  yesterday showed an expansion in factory
output, while data from the U.S. Labor Department showed the
unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to a two-year low of 8.8
percent in March as employers created more jobs than forecast.  Malaysia’s “bond inflows suggest risk appetite among
foreign investors is still strong,” said Akira Banno, a
treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur . “The authorities are trying to stabilize the market but
there is still room for the ringgit to appreciate.”  The ringgit was little changed at 3.0255 compared with
3.0235 a week ago. It reached 3.0190 yesterday, the strongest
level since October 1997, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 1.3 percent last quarter.  Elsewhere, China’s yuan gained 0.2 percent this week to
6.5479 per dollar, Indonesia’s rupiah climbed 0.2 percent to
8,700 and the Indian rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 44.5875.
 Thailand ’s baht was little changed at 30.28, the Philippine peso
weakened 0.1 percent to 43.36 and the Singapore dollar was at
S$1.2624.  To contact the reporter on this story:
