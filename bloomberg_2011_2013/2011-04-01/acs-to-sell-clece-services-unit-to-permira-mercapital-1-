Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA agreed to sell its Clece services unit to a joint
venture formed by Permira Advisers LLP and Mercapital to pay
down debt and fund future projects.  The agreement, which is subject to Permira and Mercapital
obtaining financing and to gaining permission from competition
authorities, values  Clece  at 608 million euros ($857.8 million),
ACS said in a regulatory filing.  “The operation is a continuation of ACS’s strategy to
dispose of assets to reduce debt and continue raising its stakes
in Iberdrola and Hochtief,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at
Interbrokers in Barcelona.  ACS,  Spain ’s biggest construction company by sales, is
selling assets to tackle its  8 billion euros  of debt. Disposals
coincide with plans to boost stakes in Spanish energy company
 Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and  Germany ’s Hochtief AG.  Last year, ACS sold its Dragados SPL ports unit for 720
million euros and its 25.8 percent stake in Abertis
Infraestructuras SA to funds controlled by itself and CVC
Capital Partners Ltd.  In November, ACS put 1.76 gigawatts of wind farms and
solar-thermal plants up for sale and it has non-binding offers
for the assets, Chief Executive Officer Florentino Perez said
during a webcast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
