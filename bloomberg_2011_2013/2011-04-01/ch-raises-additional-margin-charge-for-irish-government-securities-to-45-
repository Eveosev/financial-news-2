LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s largest
clearing house, increased the extra deposit it charges clients
to trade Irish  government bonds  to 45 percent from 35 percent
after yields rose relative to a benchmark of AAA securities.  The additional fee will be reflected in a margin call
today, LCH said in a statement on its  website . It applies to
“long” positions, while “short positions will pay a
proportionally lower margin,” the company said. The amount will
also be adjusted for the price of the bond, it said.  The clearing house increased the deposit for the securities
to 35 percent from 30 percent on March 24 as yields soared to
more than 600 basis points above the Bloomberg Fair Value
benchmark of AAA euro-region sovereign debt. The yield spread
reached 664 basis points as of 8:03 a.m. in  London  today. Irish
10-year bonds were little changed, leaving the yield on the
securities at 10.22 percent.  Clearing houses such as LCH guarantee investors’ trades are
completed by standing in the middle of two counterparties, and
raise margin requirements to protect themselves against losses
should one side of the trade fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
