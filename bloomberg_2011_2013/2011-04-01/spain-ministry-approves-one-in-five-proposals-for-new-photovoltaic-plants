Spain â€™s Industry Ministry approved
923 solar photovoltaic projects this quarter, or one in five
applications for the last set of permits before tariffs are
reduced by as much as 45 percent.  The Industry Ministry allocated feed-in tariffs to projects
with 116 megawatts in total out of the 4,718 applications for
the first three months of 2011, it said in a statement. Projects
applying for permits allocated in the second quarter will be
subject to the cuts approved last November, it said yesterday.  The country has approved 1.1 gigawatts of solar parks since
it started a system of quarterly allocations of permits through
a centralized registry in 2009, according to government figures.
The system was put in place to limit new installations each year
to 500 megawatts and curb growth in the industry.  Link to statement:  http://www.mityc.es/en -
