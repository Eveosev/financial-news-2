The pound erased advances against
the euro and the dollar after an index of U.K. manufacturing
growth fell more than economists estimated.  The British currency was little changed at 88.32 pence per
euro as of 9:33 a.m. in  London  after strengthening as much as
0.3 percent. Against the dollar it was also little changed, at
$1.6035.  The index of manufacturing growth fell to 57.1 in March,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said today, falling short of the median forecast of 22
economists in a Bloomberg News survey for 60.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
