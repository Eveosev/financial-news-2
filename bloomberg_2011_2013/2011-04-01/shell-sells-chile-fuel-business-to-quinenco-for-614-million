Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold most of
its fuel business in Chile to Quinenco for $614 million as it
focuses on increasing global production.  The sale will cover Shell’s retail, commercial fuels,
bitumen and chemicals businesses, the Hague-based company said
in a statement today. The disposal is part of plans to operate
in fewer and larger markets for the half of the business that
brings fuel to consumers, it said.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  last month pledged $1
billion of extra cost cuts in refining and marketing as the
company tries to accelerate output growth through 2014. Voser is
targeting $5 billion in asset sales this year.  “This deal is consistent with our strategy to concentrate
our downstream footprint and I strongly believe it is in the
best possible interests of staff, Shell shareholders and our
customers,” said  Mark Williams , head of Shell’s downstream
business. “Quinenco will continue to provide the high quality
Shell products that our Chilean customers have come to trust and
rely on over many decades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
