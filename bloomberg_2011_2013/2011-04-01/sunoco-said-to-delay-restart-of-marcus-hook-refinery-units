Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  won’t return units to
service at its Marcus Hook refinery in  Pennsylvania  until it can
repair and restart a fluid catalytic cracker, a person familiar
with refinery operations said.  Sunoco’s goal is to have the catalytic cracker restarted on
April 5, said the person, who declined to be identified because
he isn’t authorized to speak for the refinery. Until then, the
plant’s production units will remain on circulation, he said.  The refinery lost power temporarily on March 28, Lynda Rebarchak, a spokeswoman for the southeast regional office of
the  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection , said in
an e-mail. At 8:30 p.m. that day, Sunoco informed the department
that “all units were coming back online.”  The  power failure  occurred when a transmission customer was
performing work, Karen Muldoon Geus, a spokeswoman for PECO
Energy, a subsidiary of  Exelon Corp. (EXC) , said in an e-mail.  Thomas Golembeski, a company spokesman in Philadelphia, did
not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The refinery has a capacity of 194,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The refinery supplies
fuel to New York Harbor, the delivery point for gasoline and
heating oil futures, and shutdowns at the plant can increase
spot and futures prices.  Since the power failure, the discount to futures for
immediate delivery regular gasoline in New York Harbor has
narrowed to 9.5 cents from 16 cents on March 25  To contact the reporter on this story:
