Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the
world’s biggest maker of computer mice, fell the most in more
than seven years in Zurich trading after the company lowered its
full-year sales and profit forecasts.  The shares plunged as much as 3.59 Swiss francs, or 22
percent, their biggest intraday decline since July 2003.
Logitech traded at 13.42 francs, down 19 percent, at 9:42 local
time. The Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland-based company now has
a market value of 2.6 billion francs ($2.8 billion).  “Projected shortfalls” in sales and profitability for the
fiscal year ended yesterday are mainly due to “weakness” in
the company’s  Europe , Middle East and Africa retail sales
region, Logitech said in a statement last night. The company has
seen lower-than-expected demand for retail products in the
region from both distribution partners and consumers.  “This announcement is a clear setback to our investment
case,” Michael Foeth, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a
note today. “The company had so far delivered consistently on
its strategic plan.”  Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating on Logitech to
“neutral” from “outperform,” citing “cyclical weakness that
could persist.”  The company now expects full-year sales in a range of $2.35
billion to $2.37 billion, compared with a previous range of $2.4
billion to $2.42 billion. Operating income is now forecast in a
range of $140 million to $150 million, down from the previous
range of $170 million to $180 million.  Logitech plans to announce fiscal-year results on April 27
at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
