(Corrects name of newspaper in first, second paragraphs.)  Romarco Minerals Inc. (R)  dropped the
most in more than two years in Toronto trading after The State
reported that the Environmental Protection Agency opposed the
company’s plan for the Haile gold mine in  South Carolina .  The EPA urged regulators to deny a permit to excavate
wetlands, The State reported, citing a letter from the agency.
The EPA may reconsider the mine plan if further studies are
undertaken, the newspaper said.  Romarco fell 38 cents to C$1.84 as of 9:58 a.m. on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares earlier declined 19 percent
to C$1.80, the biggest intraday slide since January 2009.  Dan Symons, a spokesman for Romarco at its Toronto
headquarters, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
