Chile ’s peso, the weakest Latin
American currency last quarter, posted a second weekly gain
after breaching its previous trading range as mining companies
bought pesos.  The currency gained 0.3 percent today to a three-week high
of 475.85 per U.S. dollar from 477.45 yesterday. It strengthened
0.7 percent this week.  The currency yesterday broke out of a 478-485 range it had
traded in for more than a week as mining companies sold dollars
to meet payments in pesos. The currency looks set to establish a
new range of 472 to 478, said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency
forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  “We have had 10 days of stable markets and that is
reflected in the Chilean peso, which has a natural tendency to
appreciate in moments of calm,” he said. “Yesterday it broke
the 479 support level. There had been a lot of bets, especially
from foreign banks, that the dollar would keep rising on the
weakness of copper, but there was some heavy dollar selling
yesterday from mining companies and pension funds.”  Foreign investors in the forwards market trimmed bets
against the peso to $2.1 billion on March 30, the lowest since
March 14, according to the latest central bank data.  The yield on Chilean 10-year bonds in pesos rose 5 basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.45 percent. The spread
between five-year and 10-year central bank bonds fell to zero
yesterday as both bonds yielded 6.4 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chile’s central bank bought $50 million at an average of
477.57 pesos per  U.S. dollar  today as part of a $12 billion plan
to weaken the peso, according to a statement on its website.  Copper, Chile’s largest export, dropped 1.2 percent to
$4.2575 a pound in New York futures trading, extending a decline
this week to 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
