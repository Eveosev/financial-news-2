The National Association of
Homebuilders and the National Association of Realtors asked
House Republicans to delay a vote on a package of bills to
reduce the dominance of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .  “The piecemeal approach represented by the eight bills
would further damage the already fragile housing market and
impede economic recovery,” the groups wrote today in a letter
to Representatives  Scott Garrett , the New Jersey Republican
leading the legislative effort, and Maxine Waters, a California
Democrat. The trade groups called instead for a “comprehensive
plan” to wind down the government-sponsored enterprises.  The House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee,
led by Garrett, is scheduled to send the bills to the full
committee on Tuesday.  “We’re a go for Tuesday,” Garrett spokesman Ben Veghte
said today.  The measures would wind down the firms in phases as policy
makers work on a broader overhaul of the mortgage market. The
bills seek to cut the value of the companies’ combined $1.5
trillion loan portfolio, raise the fees they charge to guarantee
loans and reduce  executive compensation .  Representative  Jeb Hensarling  of Texas is pushing a
comprehensive plan to phase out the two companies in five years.  Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of McLean,
Virginia, have been relying on a promise of unlimited government
aid since 2008, when they were taken under conservatorship amid
mounting losses on subprime loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
