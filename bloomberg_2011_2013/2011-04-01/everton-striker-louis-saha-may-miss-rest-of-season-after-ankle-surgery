Everton striker  Louis Saha  may miss
the rest of the season after undergoing ankle surgery, manager
David Moyes said on the club’s website.  Saha was injured in the 2-1 win over Fulham on March 19. He
leads the Toffees with 10 goals, with nine coming since the
start of January.  “We have a lot of injuries,” Moyes  said . “Louis has had
an operation this week which will probably rule him out for the
season.”  Midfielders Tim Cahill and Jack Rodwell, along with
defender Seamus Coleman, may also miss tomorrow’s Premier League
game with Aston Villa after withdrawing from recent
international team duties with injuries. Playmaker Mikel Arteta
and midfielder Marouane Fellaini also remain sidelined by
injury.  “It is football isn’t it? You pick up injuries and we try
not to talk too much about them but we have a spate of them at
this present time,” Moyes said.  Everton is unbeaten in its last five games to move up to
eighth place with 40 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
