Ten hospital directors have been
removed from their positions at Greek state hospitals and 20
more have been threatened with expulsion for not adhering to
budget targets, Ta Nea reported, citing comments from Health
Minister Andreas Loverdos to a parliamentary committee.  Loverdos told the committee progress is being made to cut
hospital costs, saying expenses for pharmaceuticals and medical
products at state hospitals decreased by 26 percent in the first
two months of 2011 compared to the same period last year, the
Athens-based daily said.  Reigning in expenses at state hospitals is one of the
conditions put forward by the  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Union, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
