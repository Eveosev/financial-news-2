Dominion Resources Inc.’s electric
distribution unit in  Virginia  plans to convert three coal-fired
 power plants  in the state to use biomass instead, providing a
boost to Virginia’s economy of as much as $350 million in the
next three decades and reducing  carbon emissions .  Dominion Virginia Power will convert the three 63-megawatt
peaking plants, which only operate at peak demand, in  Altavista,
Hopewell and Southampton  counties to 50-megawatt plants that
operate on an almost continuous basis, Richmond, Virginia-based
Dominion Resources said today in a statement. The plants would
provide power for about 37,500 homes, the company said.  The plants, which are identical and went into operation in
1992, would begin burning fuel from timbering operations wood
waste in 2013 if the conversions are approved by local
governments. The plants will help Dominion meet Virginia’s
voluntary goal of sourcing  15 percent  of the company’s
generation from renewable sources by 2025.  Dominion said yesterday it will begin studying the
construction of a high-voltage underwater transmission line from
 Virginia Beach  into the Atlantic Ocean to potentially support
multiple offshore wind farms.  Dominion was little changed at $44.70 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 3:53 p.m. New York time. It has
gained 4.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
