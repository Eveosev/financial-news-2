U.S. nuclear-power output fell 0.9
percent as  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  shut the Seabrook reactor in New
Hampshire, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 770 megawatts from
yesterday to 82,992 megawatts, or 82 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Seventeen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  NextEra closed its 1,295-megawatt Seabrook reactor, which
is 13 miles (21 kilometers) south of Portsmouth. Seabrook was
operating at 100 percent of output yesterday.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  started its 1,151-
megawatt  Diablo Canyon  Unit 2 reactor in California after
shutting it on March 28. The unit is operating at 35 percent of
capacity.  Another reactor, the 1,149-megawatt Unit 1, is operating at
full power at the site, about 160 miles northwest of  Los
Angeles .  Southern Co. (SO)  switched on the 1,109-megawatt Vogtle 1
reactor in Georgia after shutting it on March 7. The unit is
operating at 2 percent of capacity.  The plant is located 26 miles southeast of Augusta, on the
Savannah River bordering South Carolina near Waynesboro. Another
plant at the site, the 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2, is operating at
full capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
