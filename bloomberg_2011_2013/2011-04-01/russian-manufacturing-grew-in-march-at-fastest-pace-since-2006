Russia ’s manufacturing growth jumped
last month to the highest level since August 2006 as improving
domestic demand boosted new orders and offset slowing exports.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 55.6 from 55.2 in
February, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report today, citing data
compiled by  Markit Economics , a financial information services
company. The survey-based index indicates a contraction when
below 50 and growth with a figure above 50.  The pickup in manufacturing is helping lift the economy of
world’s biggest energy supplier. Gross domestic product expanded
an annual 4.4 percent in February, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said on March 24. GDP grew 4 percent in 2010 after
shrinking 7.8 percent a year earlier.  “Domestic demand significantly increased, spurring
manufacturers to continue actively hiring personnel,”  Alexander Morozov , HSBC’s chief economist for Russia and the CIS, wrote in
the report. The index “paints an encouraging picture, with
quickly rising production having trouble catching up with rising
demand, growing employment and falling inventories.”  Russian sales of new cars and light trucks advanced 80
percent in February from the same month last year, the
Association of European Businesses said on March 9.  Increases in new orders were the most in three years, HSBC
said. The gauge posted the highest average quarterly growth in
the first three months of the year since the first quarter of
2008, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
