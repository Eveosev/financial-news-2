Pakistan raised domestic fuel prices
as much as 13 percent to bring them in line with international
 oil prices .  The government increased the price of gasoline to 83.56
rupees (98 cents) a liter from 76.58 and light-diesel oil to
78.98 rupees from 69.91, the Islamabad-based  Oil & Gas
Regulatory Authority  said in a statement on its website. The
price of kerosene increased to 84.10 rupees a liter from 74.45,
the statement said.  The government reduced its price increase by half in March
after the Karachi-based Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a government
ally, rejected the raise. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had
rolled back a January increase in prices after the MQM ended its
support over the issue, robbing the government of its majority
in parliament.  Oil rose to the highest in 30 months in  New York  on concern
the conflict in Libya, Africaâ€™s third-largest exporter, will
prolong production cuts and spread to Middle East producers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
