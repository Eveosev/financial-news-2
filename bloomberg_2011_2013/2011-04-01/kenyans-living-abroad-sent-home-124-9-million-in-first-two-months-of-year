Kenyans living abroad sent home
$124.9 million in the first two months of 2011, compared with
$91.5 million in the same period a year earlier, the central
bank said.  The amount of remittances in February surged 31 percent to
$60.8 million as economic growth in source markets improved, the
Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said on its website
yesterday.  North America  contributes about 53 percent and  Europe  27
percent of total remittances to the East African nation, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
