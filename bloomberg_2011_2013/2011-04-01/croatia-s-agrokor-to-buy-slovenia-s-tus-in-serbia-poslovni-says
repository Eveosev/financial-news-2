Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s biggest
company, is interested in acquiring the Serbian network of
Slovenia’s retail chain  Tus ,  Poslovni Dnevnik  said.  Agrokor’s Serbian retail unit  Idea d.d . may take over a
string of Tus supermarkets in the capital Belgrade and
elsewhere, with a value estimated at 50 million euros ($70
million), Poslovni reported. Like Agrokor, Ljubljana-based Tus
is privately owned, according to Poslovni.  Agrokor, the largest company in the former  Yugoslavia , said
in January it plans to invest 1.5 billion kuna ($267 million) in
its retail and food-producing operations in Croatia and the
region. Idea’s retail and wholesale operations were founded in
1992 and acquired by Agrokor in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
