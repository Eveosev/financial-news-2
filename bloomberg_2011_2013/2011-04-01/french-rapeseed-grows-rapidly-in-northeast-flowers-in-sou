French rapeseed is growing “very
rapidly” in the country’s northeast amid favorable conditions
and is flowering in the south,  France ’s technical center for
oilseed crops said.  Rapeseed development in the northeast, which accounts for
about 60 percent of France’s production of the oilseed, is about
a week ahead of last year, the Paris-based center, known as
Cetiom, said in a report on its website today.  Conditions are “globally very satisfactory” for rapeseed
in the main growing region, and expected rain will allow the
crop to “ideally” benefit from applied nitrogen and sulfur
fertilizer, Cetiom said.  French rapeseed production is forecast to rise to 4.9
million metric tons this year from 4.77 million tons in 2010,
according to European farmers’ organization Copa-Cogeca. The
organization estimated the sunflower crop would be 1.66 million
tons, little changed from last year.  Sunflower planting has started in the northeast, Cetiom
said. Farmers have entered the optimal time for sowing and
should plant the crop in the next two weeks, with planting after
April 15 expected to result in yield losses, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
