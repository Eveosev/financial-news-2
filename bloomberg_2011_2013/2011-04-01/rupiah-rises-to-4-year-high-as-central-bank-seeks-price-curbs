Indonesia ’s rupiah rose to the
strongest level in almost four years after the central bank said
it will allow the currency to appreciate to control inflation.  The currency headed for a third weekly advance after stock
exchange data showed overseas investors purchased $139 million
more local shares than they sold in the first four days of this
week. Consumer prices climbed 6.65 percent in March from a year
earlier, compared with a 6.84 percent gain the previous month,
according to government data issued today. The inflation rate
was less than the 6.99 percent median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg survey.  “Bank Indonesia has reiterated it’s going to use the
rupiah to curb imported price pressures, so that is one thing
supporting the currency,” said Joanna Tan, a Singapore-based
economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. “Equities have been
buoyant with quite a bit of inflows.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent this week to 8,702
against the dollar as of 9:48 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 8,698, the highest
level since May 2007.  Bank Indonesia  aims to reduce imported inflation by
allowing appreciation in the currency, Perry Warjiyo, director
of economic research, said March 25.  Indonesia last raised its benchmark interest rate by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75 percent in
February, the first increase since October 2008. Policy makers
next meet on April 12 to review the  reference rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
