European Union carbon allowances
rose to their highest price in more than two weeks before the
release of 2010 emissions data from factories and power stations
in the bloc’s cap-and-trade system.  December futures gained as much as 1 percent to 17.45 euros
($24.69) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  and were at 17.31 euros as of 10:30 a.m. They rose 21
percent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since the three
months ended June 30, 2008.  The EU may say in a report scheduled to be released at noon
in Brussels that emissions in the cap-and-trade program rose to
1.94 billion metric tons last year, the first increase in three
years, according to the median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed this month. Emissions in 2011 will probably increase to
2 billion tons, the survey found.  Germany ’s CO2 emissions in the program climbed by about 6
percent last year to 450 million metrics tons, Reuters reported,
citing government sources. A spokesman in the nation’s
 Environment Ministry  contacted by Bloomberg News declined to
comment and said a press conference is scheduled for later
today.  U.K. greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.8 percent in 2010, the
biggest gain in at least two decades, as homes used more heating
fuel in a year with record cold.  Preliminary U.K. data show output of the six  greenhouse
gases  covered by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol climate protection
treaty rose to 582.4 million tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent
from 566.3 million in 2009, the Department for Energy and
Climate Change said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. That was
the biggest percentage gain in a series starting in 1990.  Emissions from British homes rose 13 percent as they burned
more natural gas for heating in 2010, the department said. The
U.K. had its coolest year since 1986, and December was the
coldest since at least 1910, when records started, with
temperatures averaging minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees
Fahrenheit), according to the government weather forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
