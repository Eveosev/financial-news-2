Parmalat SpA (PLT) ,  Italy ’s largest dairy
company, will delay its shareholders meeting, two board members
said today, giving Italian investors time to challenge an
attempt by  France ’s Groupe Lactalis’s to control the company.  Shareholders will meet in June rather than mid-April, board
member Carlo Secchi said in Milan.  Italy’s government has asked domestic investors, including
lender  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , to assemble a group to challenge
Lactalis, which last month bought 29 percent of the dairy
company, making it the biggest shareholder.  Delaying Parmalat’s annual meeting would give Italian
investors more time to prepare a defense and block Lactalis from
making changes to the dairy company’s board.  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Cabinet yesterday
authorized the state to buy stakes in businesses considered
strategic, including Parmalat. Lactalis acquired shares from a
group of investors who were pressuring Parmalat Chief Executive
Officer Enrico Bondi to use the company’s cash pile to make
acquisitions or pay out bigger dividends.  A spokeswoman for Lactalis didn’t have an immediate
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
