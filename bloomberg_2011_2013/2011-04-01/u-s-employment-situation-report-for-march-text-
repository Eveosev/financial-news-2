Following is the text of the March
employment report from the Labor Department.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 216,000 in March, and
the unemployment rate was little changed at 8.8 percent, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Job gains
occurred in professional and business services, health care,
leisure and hospitality, and mining. Employment in
manufacturing continued to trend up.  Household Survey Data  The number of unemployed persons (13.5 million) and the
unemployment rate (8.8 percent) changed little in March. The
labor force also was little changed over the month. Since
November 2010, the jobless rate has declined by 1.0 percentage
point. (See table A-1.)  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men (8.6 percent), adult women (7.7 percent), teenagers
(24.5 percent), whites (7.9 percent), blacks (15.5 percent),
and Hispanics (11.3 percent) showed little change in March.
The jobless rate for Asians was 7.1 percent, not seasonally
adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)  The number of job losers and persons who completed temporary
jobs, at 8.2 million, was little changed in March but has
fallen by 1.3 million since November 2010. The number of long-
term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was 6.1
million in March; their share of the unemployed increased from
43.9 to 45.5 percent over the month. (See tables A-11 and A-
12.)  In March, the civilian  labor force  participation rate held at
64.2 percent, and the employment-population ratio, at 58.5
percent, changed little. (See table A-1.)  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons
(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was
little changed in March, at 8.4 million. These individuals
were working part time because their hours had been cut back
or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See
table A-8.)  In March, 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the
labor force, up slightly from a year earlier. (These data are
not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the
labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had
looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were
not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for
work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)  Among the marginally attached, there were 921,000 discouraged
workers in March, little changed from a year earlier. (These
data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are
persons not currently looking for work because they believe no
jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons
marginally attached to the labor force in March had not
searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for
reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.
(See table A-16.)  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 216,000 in
March. Job gains occurred in several service-providing
industries and in mining, and manufacturing employment
continued to trend up. Since a recent low in February 2010,
total payroll employment has grown by 1.5 million. (See table
B-1.)  In March, employment in the service-providing sector continued
to expand, led by a gain of 78,000 in professional and
business services. Most of the gain occurred in temporary help
services (+29,000) and in professional and technical services
(+35,000).  Health care employment continued to increase in March
(+37,000). Over the last 12 months, health care has added
283,000 jobs, or an average of 24,000 jobs per month.  Employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 37,000 over the
month, with more than two-thirds of the increase in food
services and drinking places (+27,000).  Manufacturing employment continued to trend up in March
(+17,000). Job gains were concentrated in two durable goods
industries--fabricated metal products (+8,000) and machinery
(+5,000). Employment in durable goods manufacturing has risen
by 243,000 since its most recent low in December 2009.  In March, employment in mining increased by 14,000, with much
of the gain occurring in support activities for mining
(+9,000).  Employment in local government continued to trend down over
the month. Local government has lost 416,000 jobs since an
employment peak in September 2008.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls was unchanged at 34.3 hours in March. The
manufacturing workweek for all employees edged down by 0.1
hour to 40.5 hours, while factory overtime was unchanged at
3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and
nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased
by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)  In March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private
nonfarm payrolls were unchanged at $22.87. Over the past 12
months, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.7 percent.
Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and
nonsupervisory employees edged down by 2 cents over the month
to $19.30. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was
revised from +63,000 to +68,000, and the change for February
was revised from +192,000 to +194,000.  The Employment Situation for April is scheduled to be released
on Friday, May 6, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Tanzi in
