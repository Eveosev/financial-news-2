The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development agreed to lend $10 million to Nadezhda, a
Ukrainian wholesale and retail distributor of liquefied
petroleum gas, which is upgrading and buying stations across the
country.  Nadezhda will also use the funds to double the capacity of
its liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, terminal near the border
with the European Union, the London-based bank said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The EBRD has invested $8.3 billion in 264 projects in
Ukraine and is the largest financial investor in the former
Soviet state, according to the press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
