Serbian teachers agreed to end 70
days of protests after the government pledged to raise their
wages more than planned under this year’s budget.  The government promised to raise teachers’ wages more than
2.95 percent in April and more than 7.2 percent in October,
according to a copy of the agreement handed out at a press
conference with Education Minister Zarko Obradovic in Belgrade
today.  The agreement with trade unions was “necessary,” he said,
declining to assess the impact of the wage increases on the 2011
budget as the government waits for new data to make exact
calculations on the cost.  Serbia  pledged last month to refrain from excessive public
wage increases to meet its own spending rules and a pledge to
the  International Monetary Fund  to keep the 2011 fiscal gap less
than 4.1 percent of economic output.  Serbia, which wants to become a candidate for European
Union membership by the end of this year, has relied on a 3
billion-euro ($4.1 billion) bailout loan from the IMF since mid-
2009 to offset external liquidity pressures amid capital flight
triggered by the global financial turmoil that hurt the country
in late 2008.  The IMF’s board of directors will discuss Serbia on April 8
and Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic ’s government hopes to have
the staff-level agreement on completion of a new loan accord
approved.  According to the Teachers’ Union of Serbia, the Balkan
country has around 70,000 teachers, with an average monthly net
wage of 40,000 dinars ($549), or nearly 400 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
