The Philippine peso dropped this
week on concern inflation will accelerate and interest-rate
increases aimed at slowing price gains will cool economic growth.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may review its policy rate
should the inflation outlook “become more unfavorable,” Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday. A government report on
April 5 may show consumer prices rose 4.6 percent last month
from a year earlier, the most since April 2009, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Inflation will be negative on growth and the peso,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “If
they tighten too fast, it’s going to be negative for
consumption.”  The peso declined 0.2 percent this week to 43.375 per
dollar at the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to prices from
inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency rose 0.1
percent today.  Inflation may exceed 5 percent in some months this year and
may peak in the second or third quarter, central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said on March 29. Policy makers raised the rate
paid to lenders for overnight deposits to 4.25 percent on March
24, the first increase since August 2008.  Philippine three-year  government bonds  dropped this week,
with the yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014
increasing one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.035
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate was
little changed today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
