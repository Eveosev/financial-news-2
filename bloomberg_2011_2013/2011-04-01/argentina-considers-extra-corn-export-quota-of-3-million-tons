Argentina , the world’s second-
biggest exporter of corn, may allow growers to ship an
additional 3 million metric tons of the grain this year,
Agricultural Undersecretary Oscar Solis said.  The new quota may be authorized once the agricultural,
economy and industry ministers set up a system to issue export
permits after the agency that previously handled those was
dismantled earlier this year, Solis said today in a telephone
interview from Buenos Aires, without providing a time-frame. As
of March 31, exporters had been granted approval to ship 5.3
million tons of corn this year,  according  to ministry data.  Farmers are currently harvesting the 2010-2011 corn crop,
which will total 19.5 million tons, according to forecasts by
the  Buenos Aires  Cereals Exchange. The government requires
growers to earmark 8 million tons for domestic consumption.  Agricultural Minister Julian Dominguez said earlier this
week that exports will be authorized in the next few days.
Dominguez is working with the industry and economy ministers to
find a way to issue permits for the shipments, Solis said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporter of corn.  -- Editors: Jessica Brice, Dale Crofts  To contact the reporter on this story:
