Nouriel Roubini , the New York
University economics professor who predicted the financial
crisis, said the Irish government’s rescue package aimed at
saving its banks risks deepening the country’s debt crisis.  “Taking all of the losses of the banking system and
putting them on the balance sheet of the government doesn’t make
sense,” Roubini, co-founder of Roubini Global Economics LLC,
said today in an interview from Cernobbio,  Italy , with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse”. “Eventually,
the back of the government will be broken.”  Ireland is trying to convince investors at home and abroad
that it’s finally plugged all the holes in the banking system,
whose collapse crippled what was once  Europe ’s most dynamic
economy. The Irish central bank instructed four lenders
yesterday to raise 24 billion euros ($34 billion) and announced
plans to merge two of them, taking the bill to clean up Europe’s
worst banking crisis to as much as 100 billion euros. That
equates to about two-thirds the size of the Irish economy.  Roubini said that a better solution would be to take the
senior secured and unsecured debt of the banks “reduce it,
convert it into equity so you recapitalize the banks that way
and you’re not adding further losses to the balance sheet of the
government. Otherwise, you’re going to have not only a banking
crisis, but also a sovereign debt crisis.”  “At some point, we need to recognize that these are not
liquidity problems of government or banks, but solvency issues,
and where there are solvency issues, all the market-orientated
but coercive restructurings of public and private financial debt
is necessary to avoid this insolvency,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
