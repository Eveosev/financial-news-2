Power blackouts that struck
 Venezuela  this week stem from an economic growth pace that may
reach between 4 percent and 5 percent this year, Electricity
Minister Ali Rodriguez said.  The government plans to buy electricity from  Colombia  while
it resolves the shortage, Rodriguez said in an interview on
state television. The state has restored 1,033 megawatts of
power generation lost during the outages as it works to
stabilize the electrical grid, Rodriguez said.  “When the economy grows -- industry, commercial activity
and telecommunications -- energy demand goes up, which is
starting to play a role,” Rodriguez said. A recent heat wave
that prompted Venezuelans to use their air conditioners, has
also increased consumption of power, Rodriguez said.  Venezuela needs $3 billion of investment in power this
year, Rodriguez said. The country will use $6 billion from a
joint development fund it set up with  China  to invest in
electricity generation projects in western Venezuela, Finance
Minister  Jorge Giordani  said in a statement on Jan. 18.  President  Hugo Chavez ’s government rationed electricity
last year after a drought lowered water levels at the country’s
hydroelectric plants, which produce more than two-thirds of the
country’s power supply.  The Termozulia plant, which Vice President Elias Jaua
blamed for outages around the country March 29, has restored 174
megawatts of capacity after receiving gas supplies from state-
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, Rodriguez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
