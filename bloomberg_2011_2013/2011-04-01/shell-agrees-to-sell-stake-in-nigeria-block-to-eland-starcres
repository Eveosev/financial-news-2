Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  agreed to sell
a stake in a Nigerian oil field to two companies in an auction,
the first of four potential disposals in the country this year.  A venture between  Eland Oil & Gas Ltd.  said  Starcrest
Nigeria Energy Ltd.  will buy a 45 percent interest in the OML 40
block from Shell, Total SA and Agip, a subsidiary of Eni SpA,
Eland and Starcrest said in a statement in  London  today. The
financial terms weren’t disclosed. The Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. holds the remaining 55 percent interest in the
field.  Shell is selling stakes in four fields in  Nigeria  as part
of Chief Executive Peter Voser’s plan to divest $5 billion in
assets this year. Shell also sold four blocks last year. It will
keep another 30 blocks in the African nation that stretch over
an area bigger than  Belgium , Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry
said Feb. 3.  Eland CEO Les Blair worked for over a decade in Nigeria for
Addax Petroleum, a position he left after the company was
acquired by China Petroleum Corp. in 2009. Starcrest, a
subsidiary of Chrome Group, is an indigenous Nigerian company.  The transaction is still subject to approval by the
Nigerian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
