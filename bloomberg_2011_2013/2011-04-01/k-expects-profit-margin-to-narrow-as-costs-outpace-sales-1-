OAO TMK,  Russia ’s largest producer
of pipes for the oil and gas industry, expects its profit margin
to narrow in the first half as steel costs grow faster than
sales prices.  “The recent spike in steel prices will adversely affect
the margins in the first half of 2011,” even after TMK
increased pipe prices by 10 percent to 15 percent, the Moscow-
based company said today in a regulatory filing.  TMK’s global depositary receipts traded little changed at
$21.10 at the close in  London . The GDRs earlier fell as much as
2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
