Somali Prime Minister Mohamed
Abdullahi Mohamed said his government extended its mandate by a
year to finish the war with Islamic insurgents and set up a
stable system of governance,  Agence France-Presse  reported.  The Somali transitional government’s term is scheduled to
end in August, the Paris-based  news agency  said today. The
administration now plans to leave office in August 2012, it
said. Somali authorities plan to enact a proposed new
constitution and organize credible elections, AFP said.  Somali lawmakers in February unilaterally approved a three-
year extension to their mandate, the news agency said.  The government, supported by a 9,000-strong African Union
peacekeeping force, controls sections of the capital, Mogadishu,
while Islamic militants hold almost all of south and central
Somalia, AFP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
