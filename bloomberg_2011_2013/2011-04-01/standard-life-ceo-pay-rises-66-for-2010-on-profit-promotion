Standard Life Plc (SL/) ,  Scotland ’s
biggest insurer, awarded Chief Executive Officer David Nish a 66
percent pay increase last year as profit and assets under
management rose.  Nish, 51, who took over as CEO in January 2010, received
1.97 million pounds ($3.2 million) in salary, bonus and benefits
last year compared with 1.19 million pounds in 2009, when he was
finance director. Standard Life’s shares declined 0.2 percent in
the 12 months to Dec. 31.  “In March, we announced higher net flows, an increase in
the value of assets and revenue, and growth in profit,”
Crawford Gillies, head of Standard Life’s compensation
committee, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The insurer’s pay policy rests on four areas of financial
performance including operating profit, dividend and assets
under administration, the annual report said. All those measures
climbed at least 6 percent in 2010. Nish’s pay increase follows
a 41 percent rise in earnings for Tidjane Thiam, CEO of
 Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest insurer by market value,
which was announced yesterday.  Prudential, which last year failed to buy AIA Group Ltd.
for $35.5 billion, will put all its directors up for re-election
at its annual general meeting, scheduled for May 19 in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
