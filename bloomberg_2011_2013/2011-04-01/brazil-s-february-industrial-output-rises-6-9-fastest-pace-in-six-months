Brazil ’s industrial production rose
at the fastest pace in 11 months in February, suggesting that
Latin America’s biggest economy may be slowing less than the
central bank expected.  Output rose 1.9 percent in February from January and 6.9
percent from the same month a year earlier, the national
statistics agency said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a monthly gain of 0.9 percent and an annual rise of 5.0
percent. February’s output results compare with January’s 0.2
percent monthly gain and 2.5 percent year-on-year rise.  The faster-than-expected expansion runs counter to the
central bank’s view that the economy is cooling, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in
 Sao Paulo .  “It’s a sign that the Brazilian economy remains quite
strong,” Serrano said, speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo.  Espirito Santo is sticking to its forecast that policy
makers will raise borrowing costs 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, this month, Serrano said.  The central bank cut its forecast for 2011 economic growth
to 4 percent, from 4.5 percent, in its quarterly inflation
report published March 30. Economists covering the Brazilian
economy cut their 2011 growth forecast to 4 percent in a central
bank survey published March 28, down from 4.6 percent at the
start of February.  The yield the interest-rate future contract due January
2012, the most traded today in Sao Paulo, rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.16 percent at 8:53 a.m.
New York time. The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.6257 per  U.S.
dollar .  Data published March 16 show Brazil’s economy may be
cooling more slowly than analysts had expected. Brazil’s
economic activity index rose at its fastest pace in nine months
in January.  Brazil’s economy grew 7.5 percent last year, the fastest
expansion since 1986. Policy makers have raised borrowing costs
twice this year, pushing the Selic rate to 11.75 percent from
10.75 percent in December, to prevent the economy from
overheating.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to
12 percent at its April 19-20 policy meeting, interest-rate
futures contracts show.  Brazil’s government plans to cut taxes on domestically
manufactured tablet computers as part of a new industrial policy
aimed at boosting production of high-end consumer technology
goods, Communications Minister  Paulo Bernardo  said on March 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
