Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures after the U.S. government said domestic inventories fell
to a four-year low. The soybean basis declined as demand shifted
to supplies from  South America .  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered next
month at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 50 cents to 58 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 50 cents to 55 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The average cash-corn
price rose to the highest since June 2008. The soybean basis
fell to 47 cents to 60 cents a bushel from 48 cents to 60 cents.  “People need corn, and farmer deliveries in April are
smaller than they were from December to March,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser for Toay Commodity Futures
Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . The “soybean harvest is just
hitting its stride in South America, and that means there’s over
a billion bushels of soybeans that will be competing with U.S.
supplies over the next six weeks.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 42.75 cents, or 6.2
percent, to $7.36 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest gain since June.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 16.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $13.9375 a bushel, snapping a three-day rally.  On March 1, corn inventories dropped 15 percent from a year
earlier to 6.523 billion bushels, the USDA said yesterday.
Supplies held by farmers fell 26 percent from a year ago and
represented 52 percent of total U.S. stockpiles, the smallest
since 1973, Marshall said.  Soybean consumption in the quarter ended Feb. 28 fell 3.8
percent to 1.029 billion bushels, the USDA said. Farmer
inventories on March 1 fell 17 percent from a year earlier.  “Farmers have sold more of last year’s crop” than people
expected, Marshall said. “Supplies are going to be very tight”
before the harvest begins in September, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
