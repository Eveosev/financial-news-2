The dollar extended its biggest
weekly gain versus the yen in more than a year after U.S.
employers added more jobs than forecast in March, signaling a
faster pace of U.S. economic growth.  Japan ’s currency posted its biggest weekly drop since
December 2009 against the dollar amid concern the nation’s
economy will be hampered by the aftermath of the March 11
earthquake and tsunami. The dollar weakened against the euro
after New York Federal Reserve President  William Dudley  said not
to be “overly optimistic about the growth outlook.” Currencies
linked to U.S. growth, such as the Mexican peso and Canadian
dollar, were the best performers against the dollar.  “Yen weakness is still the biggest story of the week,”
said  Greg Anderson , a currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. in
New York. “We kind of turned around on euro when Dudley spoke
and I would attribute the bounce-back 100 percent to that.”  The dollar, extending its longest winning streak since
2005, rose 1.1 percent to 84.06 per yen at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
from 83.13 yesterday. It headed for a weekly gain of 3.3
percent, the most since the week ended Dec. 4, 2009. It touched
84.73, the strongest since Sept. 24.  The U.S. currency weakened 0.6 percent to $1.4237 per euro,
from $1.4158, after gaining as much as 0.7 percent. The 17-
nation currency added 1.7 percent to 119.66 yen, the highest
level since May 10, 2010.  Jobs Report  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 216,000 in March and unemployment
fell to a two-year low. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
forecast a gain of 190,000 jobs. The  unemployment rate  fell to
8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in February.  “Overall it’s slightly better number but not something to
get too excited about,” said David Mann, the New York-based
head of research in the Americas for  Standard Chartered . “It’s
important to note the participation rate at 64.2 percent,
staying low, which means that ultimately we still have a major
challenge long term.  Group of Seven nations sold about $25 billion of yen on
March 18 after the surge in the Japanese currency to a record
high versus the dollar threatened to hurt the nation’s recovery
efforts from the deadly earthquake, Bank of America Corp.
strategists estimate.  Dollar Index  The dollar traded above its 200-day moving average against
the yen for the first time since June, which may signal further
gains. The greenback dropped 5.5 percent against the euro in the
first quarter as investors bet the  European Central Bank  will
raise  interest rates  at the April 7 meeting and the Fed will
fully carry out the $600 billion asset buying program through
June.  Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said a
stronger rebound in inflation or growth could require the
central bank to begin withdrawing record monetary stimulus. He
spoke in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania  today.  The dollar erased gains against the euro after Fed Bank of
New York’s Dudley released the text of remarks in  San Juan ,
 Puerto Rico  today.  “We must not be overly optimistic about the growth
outlook,” Dudley said. “A stronger recovery with more rapid
progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been
seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.”  Central Banking  The Fed has kept the U.S. benchmark at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008 and there is a 37.1 percent chance the U.S.
central bank will raise rates in December, compared with a 35
percent chance yesterday, according to CME Group Inc. exchange
futures.  The ECB has kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent since May
2009 and the implied yield on the three-month Euribor contract
expiring in December rose three basis points to 2.125 percent
today.  The Swiss franc extended a decline after the SVME
Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 59.3 for March from 63.5 in
February when adjusted for seasonal swings, according to Zurich-
based Credit Suisse Group AG. That’s the lowest since February
2010.  The franc depreciated 0.5 percent versus the dollar to
92.38 centimes and 1.1 percent to 1.3153 per euro.  Canada  Trend  Canada’s dollar reached the strongest level in more than
three years against the  U.S. dollar , on signs of sustained
growth in its biggest trading partner.  Canada’s currency, appreciated 0.8 percent to 96.32 cents,
from 97.06 cents yesterday. It touched 96.26 cents, the
strongest level since November 2007.  Mexico ’s peso rose as much as 0.7 percent to 11.8276 per
