Teldafax Holding AG is no longer
allowed to deliver gas to its 8,400 customers in Berlin because
it didn’t pay its bill to grid company Netzgesellschaft Berlin-
Brandenburg, Tagesspiegel reported, citing an interview.  Teldafax failed to pay 600,000 euros ($852,960) due on
March 31, Carsten Doering, a spokesman for Netzgesellschaft, was
quoted as saying. The grid company is considering a lawsuit
against Teldafax, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
