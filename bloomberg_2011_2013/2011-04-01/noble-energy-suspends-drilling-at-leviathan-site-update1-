Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  suspended drilling
of its first well in the Leviathan natural-gas field off  Israel ,
its biggest find ever, to replace a worn wellbore casing.  The size and type of pipe needed to resume drilling isn’t
available in Israel, spokesman David Larson said today in an
interview. The Sedco Express rig will move from Leviathan to
drill a development well in Noble’s Tamar field, also off
Israel, the Houston-based company said today in a statement.  Drilling will resume when the new casing pipe is delivered
and depends upon rig schedules, Larson said.  Leviathan, estimated to hold 16 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable fuel, is the largest deep-water natural-gas field
discovered in the past decade, Gideon Tadmor, chairman of Delek
Drilling-LP said in December. Delek and  Avner Oil Exploration
LLP (AVNRL)  each hold 23 percent stakes, Noble operates the field with
40 percent and Ratio Oil Exploration holds 15 percent.  Noble is drilling the Leviathan 1 well to determine whether
two rock formations about 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) below the
initial discovery hold oil or gas, Larson said. Geologists have
put the odds of commercial discovery at 17 percent for one
formation and 8 percent for the other, he said.  Noble operates and holds a 36 percent stake in Tamar, still
scheduled for production in early 2013, Larson said. Isramco
Negev 2 LP owns 29 percent, Delek and Avner have 16 percent each
and Dor Gas Exploration has 4 percent.  Noble’s shares fell 96 cents to $95.69 at 9:59 a.m. in
composite trading on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
