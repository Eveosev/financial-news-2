Denmark ’s manufacturing growth
slowed last month as the pace of production and orders eased.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index slipped to 65.3 from 66.1 in
February, the Copenhagen-based Danish Purchasing and Logistics
Forum said today in an e-mailed report. A reading above 50
signals growth.  The sub-index measuring production slipped to 60 from 66.1,
while the index gauging new orders eased to 74.8 from 80.4, the
forum said.  The index is based on a survey of purchasing managers at
companies representing about 10 percent of Denmark’s industrial
production. The forum started compiling data in January 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
