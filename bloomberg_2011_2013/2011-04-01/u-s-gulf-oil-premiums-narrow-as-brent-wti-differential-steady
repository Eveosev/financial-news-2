U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
against West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s premium to the
U.S. benchmark was little changed.  The gap between May-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, widened 1 cent to $10.65 a barrel at 2:15
p.m. in  New York . A narrower gap between Brent and WTI weakens
the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West
African oil priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 25 cents to
$13 a barrel at 2:08 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened
55 cents to $13.20 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
narrowed 35 cents to $6.80 a barrel over the benchmark.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed 50 cents to $6.75.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 35 cents to $6.25.
Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed 35 cents to $10.80 a barrel
over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $3.30 a barrel.
WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $12.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$15.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
