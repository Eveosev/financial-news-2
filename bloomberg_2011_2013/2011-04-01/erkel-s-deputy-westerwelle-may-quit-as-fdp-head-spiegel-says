Guido Westerwelle , Chancellor Angela Merkel’s deputy in Germany’s ruling coalition, is considering
resigning as head of his Free Democratic Party, Der Spiegel
said, citing people close to the party it didn’t identify.  Westerwelle, who is also foreign minister, faces growing
pressure to quit his party post after the FDP lost votes in two
German state elections on March 27, the magazine reported on its
website today. Westerwelle may make a decision as early as April
3, after he returns from a trip to  China , the  report  said.  Possible successors as FDP leader include Health Minister
Philipp Roesler, Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser- Schnarrenberger and Christian Lindner, the party’s general
secretary, according to  Der Spiegel . Westerwelle aims to remain
vice chancellor and foreign minister, the magazine said.  The FDP entered government in 2009 as junior coalition
partner to Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  and their CSU Bavarian
allies after Westerwelle steered the party to its best-ever
election result, winning almost 15 percent of the vote. Support
collapsed last year and has held at about 5 percent since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
