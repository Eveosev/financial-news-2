Gold declined the most in two weeks
on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will tighten U.S.
monetary policy, curbing demand for the precious metals as
alternative investments.  U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast in March and
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to a two-year low, a
government report showed today. The improving economy encouraged
Fed policy makers last month to signal they probably won’t
extend bond purchases beyond June.  “We will most likely see mounting pressure on the Fed to
start curbing liquidity should macro data continue improving,”
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in
a report. “Rising interest rates increase the opportunity cost
of holding non-interest-bearing bullion.”  Gold futures for June delivery dropped $11, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $1,428.90 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop since March 15.  Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said
yesterday that the central bank should review reducing its
planned purchase of $600 billion in Treasuries because of
improving economic data.  Gold fell on “better-than-expected non-farm payrolls,
which signal improving economic conditions,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,
 Switzerland .  Haven Demand  Last week, gold climbed to a record of $1,448.60 as
fighting in Libya,  Japan ’s nuclear crisis and European-debt
concerns boosted demand for an investment haven. In the first
quarter, the price climbed 1.3 percent, marking the 10th straight
gain, the longest rally since at least 1975. The metal has
advanced 27 percent in the past 12 months.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 15.6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $37.732 an ounce. The price has more than doubled in
the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $7.15, or 0.9
percent, to $775.05 an ounce, the fourth straight gain. The
price has climbed 58 percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for July delivery declined $6.30, or 0.4
percent, to $ 1,776.90 an ounce. The price has advanced 6
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
