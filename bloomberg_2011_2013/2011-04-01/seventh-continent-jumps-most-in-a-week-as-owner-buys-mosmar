OAO  Seventh Continent (SCON)  advanced to
its highest in a week after Alexander Zanadvorov, the Russian
supermarket chain’s owner, bought retailer Mosmart from OAO
Sberbank.  The stock climbed as much as 2.4 percent and closed 0.3
percent higher at 261.49 rubles as of 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, its
highest since March 25.  Sberbank plans to provide “long-term financing” to
companies owned by Zanadvorov as part of a plan to help
restructure their debts, according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday from the lender. The statement did not give a price.
Russia’s largest bank acquired control of Mosmart during the
global credit squeeze after the chain failed to repay its loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
