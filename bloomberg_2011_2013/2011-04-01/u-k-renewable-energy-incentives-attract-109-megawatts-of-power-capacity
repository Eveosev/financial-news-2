U.K. guaranteed prices for
electricity from renewable sources attracted 109 megawatts of
generating capacity in the program’s first year, figures from
the energy regulator Ofgem show.  Most installations that registered to receive the feed-in
tariffs from the plan’s start on April 1, 2010, to today came
from solar photovoltaic panels with almost 78 megawatts,
statistics on Ofgem’s  website  show. That compares with 4
megawatts of solar for 2009, when the incentives didn’t exist.  Introduction of the tariffs, guaranteeing as much as 12
times the market for power from the sun, led to a surge in
installations as households put solar panels on their roofs. At
the same time, developers rushed to plan ground-based solar
farms, prompting the government in February to say it’ll review
the incentives for larger solar installations.  The government last month proposed cuts of as much as 72
percent in the incentives while companies including Osaka-based
panelmaker Sharp Corp. and the U.K.’s clean electricity retailer
 Good Energy Group Plc (GEGP)  and Low Carbon Solar Ltd. say the price
review is killing off a nascent industry.  Almost 20 megawatts of small-scale wind power and 11
megawatts of hydropower have registered for the tariffs,
according to Ofgem.  To contact the reporters on this story:
