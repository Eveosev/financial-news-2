Xstrata Plc (XTA)  agreed to sell
Australian thermal coal to Chugoku Electric Power Co. for 12
months starting today at $129.80 a metric ton, according to a
Dow Jones Newswires report published by Fox Business on its
website.  Dow cited a person familiar with the matter that it didn’t
identify for the pricing in its report, and gave no figure for
the volumes to be supplied by Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata,
the world’s biggest exporter of coal for power stations.  Toru Umeda, a spokesman for Hiroshima, Japan-based Chugoku
Electric, declined to comment.  James Rickards , a spokesman for
Xstrata in Sydney, didn’t immediately return a message left on
his mobile phone seeking comment.  Prices for the year starting April 1 may increase to
between $125 and $133 a ton, analysts from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., Citigroup Inc. and National
Australia Bank Ltd. told Bloomberg News in February as utilities
and mining companies began talks. Japanese power companies
agreed to pay Xstrata $98 a ton for the 12 months starting April
1, 2010, the company said in August.  For Related News and Information:  Click here for web link  To contact the reporters on this story:
