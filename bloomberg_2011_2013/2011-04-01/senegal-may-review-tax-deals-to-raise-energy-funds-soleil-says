Senegal will review its tax
arrangements with the most profitable companies in the West
African nation to raise funds for an electricity program, le
Soleil reported, citing the minister of energy, Karim Wade.  The government’s 650 billion-CFA franc ($1.4-billion)
program will end the country’s energy crisis by 2014, Wade said,
according to the Dakar-based newspaper.  Power outages in the former French colony have inspired
protests in Dakar, the capital, as the nation prepares for its
February 2012 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
