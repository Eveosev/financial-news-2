Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  led $34.4
billion of U.S. company bond sales this week, driving issuance
for the quarter to $399.9 billion, the most in at least a
decade.  Home Depot issued $2 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds on
March 28 to rebuild its cash stockpile and finance share
buybacks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Time Warner,
the New York-based owner of the Warner Bros. film studio, sold
$2 billion of notes in its first offering since July.  Sales rebounded in the last two weeks, after plunging in
the five days ended March 18, as companies take advantage of
borrowing costs at about record lows. Even as an earthquake in
 Japan  and tumult in  Libya  roiled credit markets last month,
relative yields on U.S. corporate debt have fallen 25 basis
points from year-end to 226 basis points, or 2.26 percentage
points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  “A lot of issuers still are taking advantage of where
rates are,” said  Rajeev Sharma , a money manager in New York at
First Investors Management Co., where he helps oversee $1.5
billion of investment-grade debt. “A lot of deals that had
earlier been pulled after what was happening in Japan and
Libya” finally came to market, he said.  U.S. corporate bond sales were the highest for any quarter
in records dating to 1999, eclipsing the $385.1 billion for the
first three months of 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Narrowing Spreads  Spreads on corporate debt narrowed this week after widening
in the middle of March as workers battled to prevent a nuclear
meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant north of  Tokyo . Relative
yields this month ranged between 221 basis points on March 3 to
239 basis points on March 16, five days after the 9.0-magnitude
quake struck Japan, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master Index.  Absolute yields rose 4 basis points from last week to 4.88
percent, the data show. Yields touched 4.44 percent on Nov. 4,
their lowest in records dating to 1996.  Home Depot’s debt sale included $1 billion of 4.4 percent
notes due April 2021 that yield 97 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The Atlanta-
based retailer will use proceeds to replace $1 billion of 5.2
percent notes issued in 2006 that matured March 1 and to buy
back its own stock, it said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.  Time Warner Bonds  Proceeds from Time Warner’s $2 billion offering, including
$1 billion of 4.75 percent, 10-year notes, will be used for
general corporate purposes, including mergers and acquisitions
and share repurchases, according to a statement from  Fitch
Ratings . The media company increased its stock buyback program
in January to $5 billion from $1 billion at the end of 2010,
according to a Feb. 2 statement.  “Corporations don’t really know what to do with all this
capital that’s being thrown at them, so they’re reaching for the
lowest common denominator, which is buying back stock,” said
 Christopher Garman , president of Orinda, California-based Garman
Research LLC.  Bond sales in the U.S. have climbed as economic reports
buoyed stocks and showed that the global recovery could
withstand a civil war in Libya and a slowdown in Japan’s economy
after the March 11 earthquake.  The number of applications for unemployment insurance
payments fell by 6,000 to 388,000 in the week ended March 26, a
one-month low, Labor Department figures showed yesterday in
 Washington . The  S&P 500  advanced 5.4 through yesterday for its
biggest first-quarter gain since 1998.  Uncertainty and Unrest  The corporate  bond market  has “priced in” uncertainty
over Japan and the unrest in the Middle East, said  William Larkin , a fixed-income portfolio manager in Salem,
 Massachusetts , at Cabot Money Management, which oversees $500
million. “Those risks are falling,” he said.  Investment-grade issuance was $28.2 billion, compared with
an average of $23.7 billion a week in 2011. Sales of high-risk,
high-yield, or junk bonds, were $6.19 billion this week compared
with an average of $7.07 billion this year, Bloomberg data show.
High-yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by
 Standard & Poor’s .  Spreads on speculative-grade debt fell 2 basis points to
477 basis points yesterday, compared with 479 basis points on
March 25, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
High Yield Master II Index. Spreads on investment-grade debt
were unchanged at 150 basis points, the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index shows.  Sizzling Platter LLC, the operator of the Red Robin Gourmet
Burgers fast-food chain, may sell $150 million of five-year
senior secured notes, according to a March 30 note from S&P.
Printing-services provider Sheridan Group Inc. plans to sell
$150 million of three-year notes to refinance outstanding debt,
the company said in a March 30 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
