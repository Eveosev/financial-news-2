The Confederation of Norwegian
Enterprise and the country’s umbrella labor group reached an
agreement late yesterday for a wage increase of about 3.65
percent in this year’s collective bargaining round.  “The parties are satisfied that they have reached an
agreement in the settlement through negotiations,” John Bernander, managing director at the business group known as NHO,
said in a statement on the confederation’s  website .  The accord, which covers about 200,000 workers, has to be
ratified by the executive boards of the involved parties. The
agreement raised hourly wages by 2 kroner and gives 1 krone
extra an hour to low-wage earners, the groups said.  The “first Norwegian wage agreements suggest accelerating
wage growth in 2011,” Stein Bruun, chief economist at SEB AB in
Oslo, said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil and gas
output and shipping, will grow 3.25 percent this year, according
to the central bank, as exports rebound amid recoveries in the
country’s key trading partners.  Europe ’s lowest unemployment
rate and low borrowing costs have spurred  consumer spending  in
the world’s second-richest nation per capita.  Norges Bank said last month it may raise its rate in May or
June, after keeping it unchanged at 2 percent since May. Policy
makers next meet on May 12 to decide on borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
