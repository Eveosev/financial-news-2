Four companies have abandoned plans
to build a mobile phone network for  London ’s subway system, the
Tube, in time for the 2012 Olympics because of the complexity of
the project and the shortage of time to complete it, the London-
based Times reported.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s O2,  Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. (13) ’s 3 unit and Everything Everywhere, the merger of the U.K.
mobile divisions of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and France Telecom AG,
have spent several million pounds on preliminary work, the
newspaper said. The project, which included French engineering
company  Thales SA (HO) , was canceled last night during contract
negotiations with London authorities, the Times said.  A Vodafone spokesman confirmed the cancellation, according
to the newspaper.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
