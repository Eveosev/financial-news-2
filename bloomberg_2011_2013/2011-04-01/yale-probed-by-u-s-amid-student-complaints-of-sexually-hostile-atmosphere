Yale University  is being
investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s civil rights
office after complaints from students about a sexually hostile
environment.  Yale, in  New Haven ,  Connecticut , was contacted yesterday by
the department regarding the complaint, which it hasn’t yet seen,
Tom Conroy, a spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  Sixteen Yale students and recent graduates filed a
complaint accusing Yale of allowing an atmosphere hostile to
women to flourish, Hannah Zeavin, one of the signatories of the
complaint, said in a phone interview yesterday. She cited
incidents of harassment including members of fraternities
chanting sexist slogans such as “No Means Yes” and holding
signs with sexist remarks, she said.  “We believe there is a hostile environment here at Yale
University that is precluding women from having the same
opportunity for an education as Yale men,” Zeavin, 20, said.  Yale will cooperate with the investigation, Conroy said.  “Yale takes extremely seriously all allegations of sexual
harassment and sexual misconduct, including allegations of a
‘hostile environment,’” he said.  The  Office of Civil Rights  received a complaint urging an
investigation March 15,  Justin Hamilton , an Education Department
spokesman, said in an e-mail today. The office receives about
7,000 total complaints a year and investigates a third of them,
Hamilton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
