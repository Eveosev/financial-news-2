Stoxx Ltd., the index provider owned
by  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and Six Group AG, said it solved technical
issues that caused calculation discrepancies for some gauges,
including the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Stoxx 600 rapidly pared its gains just after 1 p.m.
London time today before surging at about 2:25 p.m., Bloomberg
data show. The equities measure was 1.2 percent higher at 279.07
as of 3 p.m.  “Our input data and index calculation have been affected
by data dissemination problems with London Stock Exchange
data,” said Andrea Weidemann, a spokeswoman for Stoxx in
Zurich. “We’ve just run a correction, which explains the
spike.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
