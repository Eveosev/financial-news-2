  Portugal ’s long-term foreign and
local currency issuer default ratings were cut to ‘BBB-,’ or the
lowest investment grade rating, from ’A-’ and its short-term
issuer default rating to ’F3’ from ’F2’ by Fitch Ratings. Fitch
said it maintained the rating watch negative on these ratings,
meaning they may be cut further.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
