Japanese stocks fell, driving down
benchmark indexes for the first time in three days, as surging
 oil prices  threatened companies with higher energy costs.  All Nippon Airways Co.,  Asia ’s biggest listed carrier by
sales, and Honda Motor Co., Japan’s No. 2 carmaker by market
value, both lost 2.4 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
operator of a nuclear plant crippled after an earthquake and
tsunami on March 11, dropped 3.7 percent as speculation grew the
company will be nationalized.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest oil
explorer, advanced 4.3 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.5 percent to
9,708.39 as of the close of trading in Tokyo, after swinging
between gains and losses more than 10 times. The gauge closed at
its highest level since March 11 yesterday and gained 1.8
percent this week, a second consecutive weekly advance. The
broader Topix index sank 0.8 percent to 862.62 today, with more
than four shares declining for each that advanced.  “Basically, any company with manufacturing bases in Japan
will be negatively affected by higher oil prices,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a  fund manager  in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management
Co., which oversees $6 billion. “We’ll likely see economic
indicators that come out from here on that are quite bad, so on
the whole, we probably won’t see the market being bought.”  Crude Oil Climbs  Pulp and paper makers retreated the most today as a group,
followed by utilities and airlines. Oji Paper Co., Japan’s
biggest maker of paper and forest products, dropped 3.8 percent
to 380 yen. All Nippon Airways lost 2.4 percent to 242 yen.
 Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world’s largest tiremarker by market
value, declined 1.4 percent to 1,719 yen. Honda fell 2.4 percent
to 3,050 yen.  Oil companies  advanced the most among the 33 industry
groups in the Topix. Inpex rose 4.3 percent to 658,000 yen.
 Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  increased 1 percent to 4,200
yen.  JX Holdings Inc. (5020) , Japan’s No. 1 refiner, gained 1.4 percent
to 568 yen.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest commodities
trader, rose 0.7 percent to 2,324.  “There are more listed companies in Japan that feel the
negative effects of higher oil prices since they cannot pass on
costs, than companies that benefit,” said Takero Inaizumi, head
of equity research in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors Securities Co.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 2.4 percent to $106.72 a
barrel yesterday in  New York , the highest settlement since Sept.
26, 2008, amid concern that the Libyan conflict will prolong
production cuts.  Annual Decline  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  declined 12 percent in the Japanese fiscal
year that finished yesterday, and dropped 4.6 percent last
quarter. Among the Topix’s groups,  utility companies  including
Tokyo Electric Power tumbled the most last year, followed by
brokerages, while oil refiners led gains.  Tokyo Electric Power, known as Tepco, fell 3.7 percent to
449 yen today, paring a 14 percent drop intraday. The Japanese
government will acquire a stake in the utility to influence
management and ensure a steady electricity supply, the Mainichi
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified government official.
The stake won’t exceed 50 percent, the report said. Japan’s
government hasn’t ruled out the possibility of investing in
Tokyo Electric, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said.  Kansai Electric Power Co.,  Japan ’s biggest utility by
market value, fell 1.4 percent to 1,785 yen. Chubu Electric
Power Co., the No. 2, dropped 2.9 percent to 1,796 yen.  Japan’s quarterly Tankan index of sentiment among big
manufacturers climbed to 6 in March from 5 in December, the  Bank
of Japan  said today, noting that 72 percent of responses came by
the day of the quake. The bank on April 4 will release a
breakdown of pre-quake and post-quake responses, offering a
gauge of the magnitude of the hit to business confidence.  Other reports this week showed Japan’s industrial
production unexpectedly climbed in February, the  unemployment
rate  fell to 4.6 percent that month and retail sales rose 0.1
percent in from a year earlier.  The Tankan with post-quake responses “will likely show a
big decline,” Shinkin Asset’s Yamashita said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
