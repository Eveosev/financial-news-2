Fertilizer sales in  France , the
European Union’s biggest agricultural producer, rose through
January as deliveries of potassium jumped 83 percent, the
country’s fertilizer-industry association said.  Potassium shipments climbed to 402,000 metric tons in the
May-January period from 219,000 tons a year earlier, Paris-based
Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales of phosphorus
fertilizer gained 41 percent to 381,000 tons from 270,000 tons.  French deliveries of nitrogen in fertilizer from July
through January increased 19 percent to 1.42 million tons, the
most in at least four years, from 1.19 million tons, the report
showed.  France is the EU’s largest fertilizer user, according to
the International Fertilizer Industry Association.  Unifa tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a year that
starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium and
phosphorus starts May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
