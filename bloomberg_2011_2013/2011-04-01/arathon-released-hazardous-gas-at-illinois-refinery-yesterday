Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  depressurized a
unit after an upset yesterday at its Robinson refinery in
Illinois, according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency.  More than 500 pounds of material including sulfur dioxide
was released, according to the filing.  “Depressured unit to fix problem and then will be
pressured up once fixed,” it said.  Shane Pochard, a spokesman for Marathon, declined to
comment.  The refinery has a capacity of 215,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
