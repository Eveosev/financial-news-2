Spain ’s government said it will sell
as many as 26 blocks of radio spectrum to provide more data
capacity to mobile-phone operators in transactions that may
raise as much as 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion).  Frequencies on offer will be distributed among the 800-MHz,
900-MHz, 1.8-gigahertz and 2.6 GHz bands, the Industry Ministry
said today in a  statement . The bandwidth is becoming available
from now through 2015 as the regulator reallocates portions of
the spectrum from other uses, it said.  Carriers across  Europe  are seeking more transmission
capacity to cope with surging demand for data as consumers watch
films and surf the Web on smartphones including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone and handsets using Google Inc.’s Android system. U.K.
regulator Ofcom said last month that an auction in the country
scheduled for the first quarter of 2012 will sell frequencies
equivalent to three-quarters of the spectrum currently being
used by mobile-phone operators.  The Spanish bandwidth will be distributed mainly through
auctions, the ministry said today.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD) , the market leaders, will be restricted from some of
the frequency allocations in an effort to promote competition,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
