Copper fell to a two-week low in New
York on signs that  China , the world’s biggest buyer of
industrial metals, may take more steps to restrain the economy
and cool inflation.  China’s manufacturing expanded in March from February, a
report showed today. The central bank will boost  interest rates 
again this quarter, according to all 20 economists in a
Bloomberg survey on March 22. Copper futures in New York fell
for the sixth time in seven sessions.  The market is “caught by fears of the Chinese government
further tightening its monetary policies,” said  Frank McGhee ,
the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .
“That will put a cap on copper prices.”  Copper futures for May delivery fell 4.9 cents, or 1.1
percent, to close at $4.2585 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . Earlier, the price touched $4.212, the lowest for a
most-active contract since March 17.  China has boosted rates three times since mid-October.
Imports of refined copper slid to a two-year low in February,
figures showed last week. Inventories monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange have jumped 23 percent this year.  Copper may drop to $3.95 in 10 days if the price falls
below $4.21, McGhee said. In the first quarter, the metal
declined 3.1 percent after climbing to a record of $4.6575 on
Feb. 15. The metal is down 3.6 percent for the week.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $68, or 0.7 percent, to $9,360 a metric ton
($4.25 a pound). Aluminum, tin, and nickel also declined. Lead
and zinc rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
