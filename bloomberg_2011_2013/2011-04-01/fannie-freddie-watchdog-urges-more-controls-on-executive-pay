Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, the
mortgage lenders rescued by the U.S. government, paid more than
$35 million to top executives in the past two years and should
be subject to tighter compensation limits, a watchdog said.  Steve A. Linick, inspector general for the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, said the regulator should consider the lower pay
scales at government agencies when approving compensation at
Fannie and Freddie. Linick issued his first two reports today
after joining the FHFA’s Office of Inspector General in
September.  “FHFA has a responsibility to Congress and taxpayers to
efficiently, consistently, and reliably ensure that the
compensation paid to Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s senior
executives is reasonable,” Linick said in a written statement.
“This is especially true when you realize that the  U.S.
Treasury  has invested close to $154 billion to stabilize Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.”  Fannie Mae, based in  Washington , and McLean, Virginia-based
Freddie Mac have been sustained by Treasury funds since they
were seized in September 2008. They have a combined loan
portfolio valued at $1.5 trillion, and own or guarantee more
than half of U.S. mortgages. Republicans in the U.S. House of
Representatives have introduced legislation to wind down the
firms and reduce  executive compensation .  FHFA Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco said no government
agency is able to manage the Fannie and Freddie portfolios.  “Government pay levels are not useful benchmarks for
evaluating enterprise pay,” he said in a written response to
the reports.
