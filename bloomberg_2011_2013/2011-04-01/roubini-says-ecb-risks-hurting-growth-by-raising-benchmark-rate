Nouriel Roubini , the economist who
predicted the financial crisis, said the  European Central Bank 
threatens to hurt the euro region’s periphery states by raising
borrowing costs next week.  “They’re going to likely raise rates in April and then
continue for a few times this year,” Roubini said in an
interview today from Cernobbio,  Italy , with Maryam Nemazee on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.” “But you have five
countries in the periphery where there’s almost no growth or
contraction, where you have severe banking problems, where
you’ve had a loss of competitiveness, where there is a need to
restore economic growth.”  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  has signaled the bank is
ready to raise the benchmark rate from a record low of 1 percent
when policy makers meet on April 7 to fight increasing inflation
pressures, even as governments from Ireland to Portugal struggle
to lower their budget deficits. Roubini said at a press
conference he expects the central bank to raise borrowing costs
three times to 1.75 percent this year.  “I fear that an early hike is going to increase the growth
fragility, the worsening of competitiveness,” said Roubini, who
also co-founded Roubini Global Economics LLC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
