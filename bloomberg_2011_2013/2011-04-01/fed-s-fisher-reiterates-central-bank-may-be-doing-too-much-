The  Federal Reserve ’s emergency
programs in response to the financial crisis were successful in
helping the economy and now the central bank is at risk of
overdoing it, said  Dallas  Fed President Richard W. Fisher.  The central bank “opened the floodgates” and “it
worked,” the regional bank chief, who votes on monetary policy
this year, said during a speech today in Dallas. “We re-
liquefied the economy. In my opinion, we might have done too
much.”  Fisher, 62, reiterated a point he’s made in the past week
that the Fed may be going too far, even as he defended the
central bank’s initial decisions.  “Someone had to step into the breach” when panic ensued,
Fisher said in remarks made as part of the Real Estate Council
Speaker Series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
