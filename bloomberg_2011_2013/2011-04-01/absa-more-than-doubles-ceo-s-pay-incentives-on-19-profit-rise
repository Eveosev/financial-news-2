Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , more than doubled Chief
Executive Officer Maria Ramos’s pay and incentives in 2010 after
the lender’s profit rose 19 percent.  Ramos’s total package of 27.5 million rand ($4.1 million)
included guaranteed pay of 6.52 million rand, a performance
bonus of 4.6 million rand, a deferred bonus of 8.45 million rand
and a new “key leaders” award equivalent to 8 million rand,
the Johannesburg-based lender said in its  annual report  released
on March 30. Ramos received total compensation of 13.5 million
rand in 2009.  Absa,  South Africa ’s largest retail bank, said in February
it aims to keep cost growth below 10 percent this year after
wages increased at more than twice the pace of inflation in
2010. The bank’s profit rose to 8.12 billion rand last year,
helped by declining bad loans.  “Absa is accountable to a range of stakeholders and
incentives should reflect the effort required and the value that
is being added,” Chairman Garth Griffin wrote in the annual
report. “Sometimes, this results in individual incentives that
appear high, but we remain comfortable that such incentives have
been subject to due process within an effective system.”  Absa’s 2010 deferred bonus award plan is subject to
performance conditions and begins to pay recipients one-third of
the total amount owing over three years starting from next year,
according to the bank. The “key leaders” plan, worth 8 million
rand to Ramos, may vest in 2013, depending on performance, and
will pay out half in cash and half linked to so-called phantom
shares, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
