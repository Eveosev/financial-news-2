CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  shares fell as
Evercore Partners Inc. cut the stock’s rating, saying a pickup
in mergers among exchanges left “no potential buyers” for the
owner of the largest U.S. equity derivatives exchange.  “We believe recent exchange deal activity has left a
dearth of potential buyers for CBOE, which should result in the
takeout premium fading from the stock,” Chris Allen, a New
York-based analyst with Evercore, wrote in a note, downgrading
the stock to “underweight” from “equal-weight” and cutting
his price estimate to $22.50 from $29.50.  Shares of the Chicago-based options exchange operator
slipped 5 percent to $27.51 at 4 p.m. New York time in the
biggest decline since March 10. The stock has rallied 20 percent
this year.  More than $20 billion of exchange acquisitions have been
announced in the past five months as venues in North America,
Europe and Asia try to cut costs and offset declining profits
from equity trading with options, futures and derivatives.
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  today
made an unsolicited bid of about $11.3 billion for  NYSE
Euronext (NYX) , trying to snatch the owner of the New York Stock
Exchange away from  Deutsche Boerse AG. (DB1)   NYSE rallied 13 percent to $39.60, while Nasdaq rose 9.3
percent to $28.23. ICE declined 3.1 percent to $119.75.  Evercore is serving as a financial adviser to Nasdaq in its
joint bid for NYSE Euronext.  To contact the reporters on this story:
