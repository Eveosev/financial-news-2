Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN)  shareholders will
vote May 6 on a proposal by the board to change the French
drugmaker’s name to “Sanofi.”  The goal is to simplify the name, said Jean-Marc Podvin, a
spokesman for the Paris-based company. A six-syllable name is
difficult to pronounce in some countries, such as China, he said
by e-mail.  The board decided March 9 to propose the change, Podvin
said. The proposal was among the items in the meeting agenda
published by the company March 16 in BALO, a French official
bulletin of legal announcements.  Les Echos  reported it earlier
today.  The Aventis name has been used since the 1999 merger of
Germany’s Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA of  France . The
combined company, Aventis SA, was acquired by Sanofi-Synthelabo
SA in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
