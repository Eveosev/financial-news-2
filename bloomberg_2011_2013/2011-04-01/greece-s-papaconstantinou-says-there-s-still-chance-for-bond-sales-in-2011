Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said his country may still return to bond
markets this year if conditions improve.  Greece ’s 10-year bond yields 12.8 percent, more than three
times the yield on comparable German debt, almost a year after
Greece accepted a European-Union led bailout that allowed it to
forego debt sales.  “If the situation improves before the end of 2011, we
might give it a crack then, but it’s all up to market
conditions,” Papaconstantinou said in an interview today in
Cernobbio,  Italy . “We hope to be able to go to the market next
year.”  Greece’s financing needs for 2011 total 58 billion euros
and are fully covered by the 110 billion-euro bailout package
from the EU and International Monetary Fund and sales of
Treasury bills. If the country is unable to tap debt markets for
27 billion euros ($38.3 billion) of its 66 billion-euro 2012
funding needs, it can seek more EU funds following a March 11
decision by euro-region leaders in Brussels.  The country’s 2010 budget deficit may be more than the
government’s initial 9.4 percent projection as the recession
last year was deeper than forecast, Papaconstantinou said. He
said lagging revenue in the first two months of 2011 will not
continue for the rest of the year.  Papaconstantinou said final figures on the country’s
deficit will come from  Eurostat , the European statistics agency,
toward the end of the month. Greece’s economic performance could
be stronger than expected this year, he said. The government
forecasts a contraction of 3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
