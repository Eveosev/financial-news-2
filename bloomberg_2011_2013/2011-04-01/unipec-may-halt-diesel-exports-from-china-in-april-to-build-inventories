China  International United Petroleum
& Chemical Corp., the nation’s biggest oil trader, may halt
diesel exports this month to build inventories, said two company
officials with knowledge of the plan.  Unipec, as China International is known, has been cutting
exports to meet domestic demand, said the officials, who
declined to be identified because of company rules. The trading
company reduced diesel exports to 70,000 tons in March from
80,000 tons in February.  Domestic supplies have fallen after some refineries cut
processing because of higher costs and sellers hoarded the fuel
amid expectations the government will approve a price increase.  China is expected to raise gasoline and diesel prices after
the gain in global  crude oil  exceeded 4 percent, the trigger
point for an adjustment. The last increase was in February.  China’s diesel stockpiles surged 28 percent in February
after a 25 percent increase in January, according to data from
the official Xinhua News Agency.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Jane, Ching Shen Lee, John Viljoen  To contact the reporter on this story:
