South Africa  collected more  tax
revenue  than expected in the fiscal year that ended yesterday,
while local councils underspent on their budgets, easing the
budget deficit to 5 percent of gross domestic product.  The government collected 674.2 billion rand ($100 billion)
in tax revenue, 2 billion rand more than targeted, Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  told reporters in  Pretoria  today, citing
preliminary figures. He had forecast a deficit of 5.3 percent of
GDP for the fiscal year.  Gordhan said in his budget speech on Feb. 23 that he plans
to narrow the deficit more slowly than originally planned over
the next three years because of subdued growth in revenue and as
the government maintains spending on roads, schools and
hospitals. The deficit is projected to be 5.3 percent of GDP in
the current fiscal year through March 2012, 4.8 percent in
fiscal 2013 and 3.8 percent in the year after that.  “This remarkable performance indicates the economy is
recovering and employment is improving,” Gordhan said.  Expenditure was 891.3 billion rand in the year through
March, down from the 897.4 billion rand budgeted, he said.  Gordhan added that there are “good indications” the
economy may grow faster this year than the 3.4 percent he
predicted in the February budget, helping to ease the  budget
deficit  further. The South African Revenue Service is also
“flexing its muscles” to boost tax collections, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
