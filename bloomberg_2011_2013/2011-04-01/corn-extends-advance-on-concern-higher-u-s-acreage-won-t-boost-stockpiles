Corn rose to the highest price in
almost a month in  Chicago , extending yesterday’s jump, on
concern increased plantings in the U.S. will fail to rebuild
global inventories.  U.S. stockpiles on March 1 dropped to 6.52 billion bushels,
the lowest for the date since 2007, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. Higher profits will spur farmers to
sow corn on about 92.178 million acres, the second-largest area
since 1944, at the same time that increasing food and biofuel
demand cuts world inventories, the USDA said.  “Corn is very much supported by cattle feed, but also by
ethanol in the U.S.,” said Jonathan Bouchet, an analyst at
OTCex Group in Geneva. “Corn is still a needed commodity. It
has the consumption behind it.”  May-delivery corn gained 35 cents, or 5 percent, to $7.2825
a bushel at 11:13 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The grain touched $7.34, the highest level for the most-
active contract since March 4. Corn is set for a 5.6 percent
advance this week after climbing yesterday by the maximum
allowed by the exchange.  Global food costs increased to a record in February, the
 United Nations  has said. Higher food prices contributed to
unrest in the Arab world this year, triggering the ouster of
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt . The U.S. is the biggest exporter
of corn, soybeans and wheat.  Dwindling Stockpiles  Even with the expansion in acreage, which may take the U.S.
corn harvest to a record, the nation’s stocks-to-use ratio in
the 2011-12 season will still be the second-lowest since 1995-
96, Rabobank Agri Commodity Markets Research said in a report e-
mailed today.  “While the increase in area could be seen as bearish, the
figure was overshadowed by the shock in the grain stocks
report,” Rabobank said. “The new crops are not expected to
replenish inventories to any meaningful extent, keeping prices
in the new season high.”  The U.S. is estimated to account for 39 percent of the
global corn harvest in the 2010-11 season, according to a USDA
 estimate  on March 10.  Soybeans for May delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $14.0375 a bushel after advancing 2.8 percent yesterday. The
oilseed is set for a 3.3 percent advance this week.  Soybean Harvest  U.S. farmers will cut soybean acres by 1 percent to 76.609
million, the USDA said, near analysts’ expectations. The nation
is estimated to represent 35 percent of the global soybean
harvest in the current season, USDA  data  last month showed.
Inventories as of March 1 dropped 1.7 percent from a year
earlier to 1.249 billion bushels, the USDA said.  Wheat for May delivery declined 3.75 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.595 a bushel after surging 5 percent yesterday. The grain
is set for a 3.6 percent gain this week.  Total wheat acres in the U.S. may expand 8.2 percent from
last year to 58.021 million, compared with analysts’
expectations of 57.239 million. About 14.427 million acres will
be planted with spring wheat, up 5.3 percent from last year, the
USDA said.  Milling wheat for May delivery added 2 euros, or 0.8
percent, to 242 euros ($342.57) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in
Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
