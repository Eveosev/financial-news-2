Honam Petrochemical Corp. (011170) ,  South
Korea â€™s fourth-largest petrochemicals maker, said it plans to
build a plant in the U.S. to produce plastics for auto and
electronics parts.  A wholly owned U.S. unit, HPM Alabama Corp., aims to
complete the construction of the plant in Auburn City, Alabama,
by the end of this year, the unit of Lotte Group said in an  e-
mailed  statement today.  The plant will have an annual output capacity of 15,000
metric tons of plastics such as long-chip and long-fiber
thermoplastics when it begins full operation in 2013, according
to the statement. Long-fiber thermoplastics are used to make
auto and electronic parts.  Honam Petrochemical rose as much as 1.7 percent to 394,000
won in  Seoul  trading today, compared with the 0.2 percent
increase in the benchmark Kospi stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
