China ’s crude oil consumption will
rise 14 percent by 2015 compared with last year as additional
refining capacity makes it more dependent on imports, according
to PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest producer.  “The demand of crude oil in 2015 is projected to break
through 500 million metric tons and it will reach 600 million
tons in 2020,” according to a presentation yesterday by the
company’s research department at the ARTC conference in
 Singapore . “Import dependence is expected to grow from 53.8
percent in 2010 to 62 percent in 2020.”  China consumed 439 million tons of crude last year and
imported 236 million tons, according to the presentation. Oil
imports are typically high-sulfur and heavy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
