The U.S. Agency for International
Development “soon” will send a team into rebel-held territory
in Libya to provide humanitarian relief, a top official said.  “The planning is well advanced for moving them inside”
Benghazi, the unofficial capital of the opponents of Muammar Qaddafi’s regime, said  Mark Ward , the agency’s deputy assistant
administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and
Humanitarian Assistance.  One of the team’s first tasks will be to contact those
opposed to Qaddafi, including the National Transitional Council,
to coordinate the delivery of relief, Ward said at a news
conference in  Washington .  “The local forces, the local opposition, is going to know
a lot about access through ports, they’re going to know a lot
about what we can bring in by air, and they’re going to know a
lot about which roads are open, which ones are safe, for the
delivery of humanitarian commodity,” he said.  Ward said the agency already is in contact with the
opposition members in eastern  Libya . He wouldn’t specify when
the U.S. team will enter the country, or how many personnel will
be involved. A disaster assistance response team, or DART, can
have two to two dozen members, or more, he said.  There will be no security personnel accompanying the team,
Ward said. “My DART wears shoes, not boots,” he said.  The agency said March 14 that its plans to send a team into
Benghazi had been delayed.  400,000 Fled  More than 400,000 people, including medical personnel such
as doctors and nurses, have fled the country since the fighting
began, Ward said.  The U.S. has pledged almost $50 million in humanitarian
assistance, Ward said. Much of the funding has gone toward
evacuating citizens and helping migrants, he said.  The agency has helped non-government organizations that are
positioning food and medical supplies outside embattled cities
so they can be distributed when security improves, a tactic that
quickly improved conditions in Ajdabiya, Ward said.  In cities in the east, “the food situation is good. The
water situation is good. They do have access to medical care,”
he said. “Sadly, that is not the case in cities to the west.”  Misrata, which Ward described as under siege, “is the city
that we are most concerned about in terms of a population in
need of humanitarian assistance,” he said. “The casualties
there are a more urgent need” because of the fighting, he said.  The  United Nations , the U.K.,  Turkey  and other countries
are helping to provide medical assistance in Libya, Ward said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
