U.S. stocks pared gains amid
speculation funds that track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
were selling to raise money to purchase shares of  BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) , the $39 billion asset manager that’s being added to the
gauge after the close of trading.  The S&P 500 climbed 3.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to
1,329.49 at 3:16 p.m. in  New York  after rallying as much as 0.9
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 33.3
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,353.03 after surging 100 points
earlier.    “That 4 point gap down in the SPX a few minutes ago --
‘hearing’ that since BLK is getting added to the SPX after the
close that Indexers are out there raising cash,”  Dave Lutz , head of exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a note to clients,
using the ticker symbols for the  S&P 500  and BlackRock.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
