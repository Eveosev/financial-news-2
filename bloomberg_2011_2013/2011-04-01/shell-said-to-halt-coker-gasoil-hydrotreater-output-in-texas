Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  was forced to
stop production on a coker and gasoil hydrotreater yesterday at
its refinery in Deer Park, Texas, after a vapor leak caused the
shutdown of a crude unit, two people familiar with refinery
operations said.  There is no estimate when production on the units will
resume, said the people who declined to be identified because
they are not authorized to speak for the refinery.  Ted Rolfvondenbaumen, a Shell spokesman, declined to
comment.  Shell shut the distillation 2 unit to isolate a light
naphtha leak, according to a  filing  with state environmental
regulators today.  The Deer Park refinery has a capacity of 340,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
