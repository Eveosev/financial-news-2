Vattenfall AB said a meeting with
the German state of Schleswig-Holstein on the future of its
Brunsbuettel reactor has been delayed, pending the findings of a
nationwide safety review for nuclear energy.  The talks were scheduled for today, Barbara Meyer-Bukow, a
Hamburg-based Vattenfall spokeswoman, said by phone. She
declined to specify a new date for the talks between the state
and Germany’s fourth-largest utility on the 771-megawatt plant.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest power market, put its nuclear
 energy policy  under review in a three-month moratorium in March
after explosions at reactors in  Japan  stoked safety concerns.
The government ordered checks at the country’s seven oldest
nuclear stations, including Brunsbuettel, in that period. The
plant has been shut since a 2007 short circuit in a nearby power
network.  Separately, Meyer-Bukow said Swedish state-owned Vattenfall
is continuing talks with  E.ON AG (EOAN) , which owns 33 percent of
Brunsbuettel, on planning the facility’s restart. The companies
said in December that E.ON, Germany’s largest utility, may
become the operator of Vattenfall’s two reactors in the country
as part of the preparations to resume service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
