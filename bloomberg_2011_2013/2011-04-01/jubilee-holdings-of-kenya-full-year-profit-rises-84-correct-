Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) , a Kenyan
insurer, said profit climbed 84 percent in the year through
December as premiums advanced.  Pretax profit climbed to 2.53 billion shillings ($30.4
million) from 1.6 billion shillings, Chairman Nizar Juma told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. Gross premiums grew 25
percent to “more than 10 billion shillings,” Juma said,
without being more specific.  The insurer opened offices in Mauritius and Burundi at the
start of the year, adding to its businesses in Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania, Juma said. The company declared a dividend of 5.5
shillings a share and will issue a bonus share for every 10
already held, he said.  “By 2014 we will be altogether in 14 countries,” he said.  The stock rallied to the highest in a week, closing 2.9
percent higher at 180 shillings, paring its drop this year to
2.2 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
