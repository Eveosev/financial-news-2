The Russian government will sell
about 1.5 million metric tons of grain from state stockpiles by
June, compared with a planned 2.5 million tons, on weakening
domestic demand, according to the  Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies .  “Demand dropped harshly for grain in general and for
stockpiled cereals in particular,” Dmitry Rylko, the
institute’s general director, said by phone from Moscow.  Some 6,480 tons of grains were sold from inventories
yesterday, the smallest daily amount since the sales started on
Feb. 4. In total, 815,189 tons have been sold since then, with
the highest amount, 100,898 tons, on Feb. 15. The auctions are
part of an effort to control food price inflation after  Russia ’s
worst drought in a half century damaged crops last year.  Demand dropped because large traders, concerned that the
government will extend a grains-shipments ban beyond July 1,
avoided amassing stockpiles for export, said Rylko. Animal
farmers chose to wait for fixed-price distributions of grains
from state inventories rather than tap the market, he said.  In addition to the regular sales, the government also plans
to distribute 2.39 million tons of feed grain to the country’s
regions. About 1.4 million tons of the fifth-grade feed wheat
and 982,000 tons of feed barley will be provided at 4,550 rubles
($158) and 4,200 rubles a ton respectively, the government said
this week.  The government banned grain exports Aug. 15 last year until
July 1, as the drought cut the grains harvest by 37 percent to
60.9 million tons. On March 25, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said the government will maintain its ban until after
this year’s harvest in September or October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
