Vietnam ’s government bonds fell this
week, sending the benchmark five-year yield to the highest level
in 11 months, after the central bank raised borrowing costs to
curb inflation from a 25-month high.  The yield on the notes surged 11 basis points this week to
11.98 percent, the highest since May 10, 2010, according to a
daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  State Bank of Vietnam  raised its refinancing rate to 13
percent from 12 percent today, according to its website. The
seven-day repurchase rate was lifted to 13 percent from 12
percent. Policy makers also increased the overnight rate for
inter-bank electronic payments and the rate on loans to finance
clearing transactions between the central bank and commercial
banks to 13 percent.  “Investors demanded higher bond yields as borrowing costs
increased,” said Pham Phuong Lan, Hanoi-based head of the fixed
income and currency trading desk at Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam. “Bond yields are on an uptrend.”  Vietnam’s consumer prices increased 13.89 percent in March
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February 2009,
according to preliminary estimate released by the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi.  The dong traded at 20,880 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. local
time in Hanoi, compared with 20,895 yesterday, and 20,875 at the
end of last week, according to prices from banks, compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,708 today,
the highest level since Feb. 14, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
