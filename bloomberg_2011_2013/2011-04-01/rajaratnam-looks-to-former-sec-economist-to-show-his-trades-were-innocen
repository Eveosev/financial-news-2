Natural gas futures gained for the
fourth time in five days in  New York  as forecasts of warmer-
than-normal weather signaled stronger demand.  Gas futures advanced 0.4 percent after forecasters
including MDA EarthSat Weather predicted above-normal
temperatures in the Northeast and South from May 23 through May
27. Prices dropped yesterday on a report showing U.S. industrial
production unexpectedly stalled in April.  “The weather is a little supportive for the key regions of
the Southeast and Northeast, but it’s just elevating
temperatures slightly above neutral,” said  Matt Smith , a
commodities analyst with Summit Energy in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“We’re getting a bit of a bounce after yesterday’s sell-off on
the industrial production number.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 1.6 cents to settle at
$4.198 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 4.7 percent this
year.  “We’re seeing some short covering,” said Ed Kennedy, a
trader at INTL Hencorp Futures in Miami. “Traders tried to
break prices down below $4.16, but there’s nothing but buying
under that level.”  The high temperature in New York on May 26 may be 84
degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 10 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The high in Houston may be 89 degrees.  Hot and Humid  “Next week’s warm-up should deliver widespread 80s and
enhanced humidity levels to the Midwest and East, with 90s in
the South,”  Matt Rogers , a forecaster with Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a report.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  The department may say tomorrow that gas stockpiles rose 90
billion cubic feet in the week ended May 13, according to the
median of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average change for the week is an increase of 91 billion.  The stockpile estimates ranged from gains of 85 billion to
95 billion cubic feet. The department is scheduled to release
its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Stockpiles rose 70 billion cubic feet to 1.827 trillion in
the week ended May 6, the department reported last week.
Inventories were 12 percent lower than the level a year earlier.  The number of gas drilling rigs declined 16 to 874 last
week in the U.S., the lowest level since Jan. 29, 2010,
according to Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. Fewer rigs signal
reduced gas production.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
165,683 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 307,000. Volume was 275,100 yesterday. Open interest was
956,074 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
