The highest-paid U.S. hedge fund
managers at some of the biggest and best-performing funds got
slightly over $22 billion in pay last year, the New York Times
reported, citing an annual ranking by AR Magazine.  That compares with ten years ago, when the best-paid 25
managers earned a combined $5 billion, the newspaper said.  Much of the earnings by hedge fund managers came from fees
that were charged whether there was a loss or a profit, the
newspaper said.   Hedge funds  didn’t perform better than the stock market and
had a median gain of 8 percent according to the Hedge Fund
Intelligence Global Composite Index, compared with an 11.7
percent rise in the MSCI World Index of stocks and 12.7 percent
rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the newspaper
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
