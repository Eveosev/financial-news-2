South Africa ’s new  Companies Act  has
been delayed and will not go into effect today, after almost a
decade of debate and refinement, according to the  Department of
Trade & Industry .  “Yes, it is not in force,” Sidwell Medupe, spokesman for
the Pretoria-based department, said in a phone interview today.  The Companies Act of 2008, which is designed to replace the
Act of 1973, aims to boost transparency, make it easier for
small businesses to operate, facilitate empowerment deals which
involve the transfer of assets to black shareholders, and
introduce the concept of business rescue which would protect
bankrupt companies from creditors.  “The parliamentary process in regard to the adoption of
the Companies Amendment Bill was only finalized on March 24,
following a rigorous and inclusive consultative process.” the
department said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The
parliamentary process took slightly longer than anticipated.”  South African President  Jacob Zuma  had not sent a signed
copy of the Act to the trade & industry department by the close
of business yesterday, according to the department’s head of
communication Clement Manoko.  A new date for the implementation of the Act has not yet
been set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
