Canadian mills processed 2.7 percent
less canola and 1.8 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended
March 30 from a week earlier, an industry group said.  Mills crushed 124,819 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 28,684 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
