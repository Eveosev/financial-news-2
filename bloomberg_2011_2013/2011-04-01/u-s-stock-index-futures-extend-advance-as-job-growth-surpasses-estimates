U.S. stock futures rose, a day after
the biggest first-quarter rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index in 13 years, as faster-than-forecast growth in jobs
bolstered optimism about the economy.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in June gained 0.5 percent
to 1,328 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures increased 0.5 percent to 12,316 and Nasdaq 100 Index
futures climbed 0.5 percent to 2,348.5.  Payrolls increased by 216,000 workers last month after a
revised 194,000 gain the prior month, the Labor Department said
today in  Washington . Economists projected a March gain of
190,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The jobless rate dropped from 8.9 percent in February,
the fourth straight decrease.  The S&P 500 advanced 5.4 percent in January through March,
the biggest first-quarter gain since 1998, as investors
speculated the global economic expansion can withstand  Japan ’s
worst earthquake on record and revolts in the Middle East and
North Africa.  Separate data may show U.S. manufacturing expanded in March
at about the same pace as in February, which was the strongest
month in almost seven years. The Institute for Supply
Management’s purchasers’ factory index is scheduled for release
at 10 a.m. in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
