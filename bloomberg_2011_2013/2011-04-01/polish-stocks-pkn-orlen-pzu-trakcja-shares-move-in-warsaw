Poland’s WIG20 Index climbed for a
second day, adding 16.90, or 0.6 percent, to 2,833.86 at 10:10
a.m. in Warsaw. The measure has increased 0.7 percent this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
1.35 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 54 zloty. Oil rose to the highest
in 30 months in  New York  on concern the conflict in  Libya ,
Africa’s third-largest exporter, will prolong production cuts
and spread to Middle East producers.  PZU SA (PZU PW) rose for a second day, adding 8.4 zloty, or
2.4 percent, to 364.4 zloty. Poland’s biggest insurer may raise
its dividend payout to 100 percent of profit in coming years, up
from a current top range of 45 percent, Chief Executive Officer
Andrzej Klesyk said in an interview with Radio Pin today.  Trakcja Polska SA (TRK)   rallied 0.24 zloty, or 6.9
percent, to 3.72 zloty, heading for the highest close in more
than a month. The Polish railway builder’s agreement to merge
with Tiltra Group AB of Lithuania expired after a protest from a
shareholder kept the Polish company from fulfilling the
conditions of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
