The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.3 percent to 3,231.51.  China Citic Bank Corp. (601998 CH), the banking unit of the
nation’s largest investment firm, rose 1.1 percent to 5.73 yuan

largest lender, added 1.4 percent to 14.28 yuan after saying
profit rose 41 percent to 25.8 billion yuan in 2010 as lending

biggest insurer, gained 1.2 percent to 50.03 yuan, the most in a
