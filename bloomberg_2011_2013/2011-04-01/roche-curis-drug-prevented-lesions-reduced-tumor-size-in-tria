Roche Holding AG (ROG)  and  Curis Inc. (CRIS) ’s
experimental drug shrank tumors and prevented new lesions in a
clinical trial of skin-cancer patients with a rare inheritable
disease.  Patients given the medicine, known as vismodegib or GDC-
0449, had fewer basal cell carcinomas than those who received a
placebo, according to a statement from the American Association
for Cancer Research conference in Orlando, Florida. The size of
existing tumors “decreased significantly” for those getting
the drug, while carcinomas were “essentially unchanged” for
patients who got placebo, researchers said.  The 41 patients in the trial had  basal cell nevus syndrome ,
a disease that leads to a higher risk of skin cancers. Side
effects, including loss of taste, muscle cramps and  weight loss ,
caused 20 percent of patients to discontinue the drug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
