Asian collectors snapped up cases of
Burgundy such as Romanee Conti and Montrachet as  Sotheby’s (BID)  sold
HK$136.5 million ($17.5 million) of wine in three days at the
start of its Hong Kong marathon.  All three auctions were sold out, with a case of 1990
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti fetching HK$1.8 million to become
the top lot. Bottles of 1982  Chateau Petrus  made $6,500 each on
the first day. Haut-Brion, Latour, Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild
were also in demand.  “Prices are up at least 20 percent on the October
auction,” said S.K. Yu, a Hong Kong wine collector. “To those
on the mainland, even though the final bid price is 30 percent
higher than it should be, the item can still be sold for twice
as much in  China .”  Hong Kong  eclipsed the U.S. in 2010 as the No. 1 wine
auction market, based on research by the  Wine Spectator
Magazine . Sales in the former U.K. colony were $165 million, 40
percent of the global total. Hong Kong scrapped wine duties in
February 2008, spurring demand.  Yu, 41, brought with him an iPad and computer to cross-
check the market prices of the goods during the auction.  Sotheby’s raised $14.6 million in a two-day wine auction in
January and HK$410.4 million in 2010, 60 percent of its global
total and more than  New York  and  London  combined, it said in
January. The three-day sale series brought the combined total of
Sotheby’s Hong Kong wine sales series in 2011 to HK$250 million.  “There’s an auction fever that is almost contagious,”
Jeannie Cho Lee, a  Master of Wine , said before the sale. “The
buyers are more and more mainland Chinese. Iconic brands seem to
sell better because brand is especially important where there is
a culture of giving and the importance of face.”  First Sale  The 3,600-lot spring sale is part of Hong Kong’s first
major auction of the year and had a presale estimate of HK$2.4
billion, said New York-based Sotheby’s, the world’s biggest
publicly traded auction company.  The weekend wine sales are followed by Modern and
Contemporary Asian Art, traditional Chinese paintings, antiques,
jewelry, watches and ceramics through April 8. The highlights
are two private European collections of ceramics and Chinese
contemporary art, including an 18th-century Qing vase worth more
than $23 million.  Guy Ullens, founder of Beijing’s largest private art
museum, sold 106 works of Chinese contemporary art today that
Sotheby’s estimated would raise as much as HK$130 million.  Potential buyers who aren’t represented at the  Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Centre  sale can bid via Sotheby’s
 online bidding system .  --Billy Chan and Bei Hu in Hong Kong. Editors: Mark Beech, Farah Nayeri.  To contact the writer on the story:
