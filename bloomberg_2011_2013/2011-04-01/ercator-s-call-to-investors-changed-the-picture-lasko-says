Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. said a
call by  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. to investors to sell a
majority stake in the Balkan retailer “has somewhat changed the
picture,”  TV Slovenija  reported, citing Dusan Zorko,
Pivovarna’s chairman.  The Slovenian drinks company is selling assets to repay
some 400 million euros ($567 million) of debt, Zorko told the
public broadcaster.  “Pivovarna Lasko needs fresh capital and selling assets is
only one part of the story,” Zorko told the Ljubljana-based
channel. “If banks that own large chunks of our company could
reprogram loans, this could be a successful story.”  Pivovarna’s sale of a 23 percent holding in Mercator has
attracted bids from Agrokor d.d., which Zorko said the company
still considers “serious”, and from Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid
Europa Partners Ltd.  -- Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
