D’Ieteren SA (DIE) , Belgium’s biggest car
dealer, increased deliveries of new cars by 15 percent in the
first quarter, or almost three times as fast as the market’s
expansion, as Volkswagen AG models gained share.  New-car registrations rose 5.3 percent to 169,904 in the
first quarter, Brussels-based trade group Febiac said today in a
statement. D’Ieteren’s deliveries advanced to 34,699 and its
share of the Belgian new-car market widened to 20.4 percent in
the three-month period from about 18.8 percent a year earlier,
Bloomberg calculations based on Febiac figures showed.  D’Ieteren, which last year got 21 percent of pretax profit
excluding one-time costs from its Belgian dealership, said on
Feb. 28 it expects new-car registrations in the country to
retreat to 530,000 from a record 547,347 a year earlier and
reiterated a goal of expanding its market share. D’Ieteren
Auto’s share of the Belgian registrations widened to 20.1
percent in 2010, the highest in a decade, from 19.3 percent a
year earlier.  Following are the market shares of the brands for which
