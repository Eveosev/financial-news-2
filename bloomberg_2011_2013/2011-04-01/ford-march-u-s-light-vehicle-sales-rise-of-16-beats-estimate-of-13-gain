Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s March U.S. light-
vehicle sales rose 16 percent.  The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a 13 percent increase.  The figure accounts for how Ford owned the Volvo car brand
in the year-ago period. Ford has since sold Volvo. Ford excludes
Volvo from its auto sales release. Ford has also discontinued
its Mercury brand. Year-ago Mercury results are included in
Ford’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
