Wilmington Trust Co., the Delaware
bank founded by the du Pont family and being bought by  M&T Bank
Corp. (MTB) , sued three former company vice presidents who defected to
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , allegedly with proprietary data.  The Wilmington, Delaware-based trust firm contends in the
suit that Barbara McCollum, Robert Rosenberg and  Paul Gordon ,
each of whom worked in wealth-management, will be using
information related to former clients in their new jobs at
Citigroup.  The three worked on a team “that serviced high net worth
clients,” and are familiar with “client revenue, fee
projections, investment strategies,” according to a complaint
filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  They “engaged in a concerted effort to remove voluminous,
important proprietary and confidential information from
Wilmington Trust Co. so they could use it at Citi,” the civil
lawsuit contends.  Wilmington Trust, which expects the buyout to be completed
by midyear, is asking a judge for an injunction to stop the
three from unfairly using the information, to make them return
the data they allegedly took and to pay the bank’s legal fees.  Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. Phone calls to the homes of Robert
Rosenberg and Paul T. Gordon seeking comment weren’t immediately
returned. McCollum’s phone had been disconnected and she
couldn’t immediately be located.  The case is Wilmington Trust Co. v. McCollum, Rosenberg and
Gordon, CA6334, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
