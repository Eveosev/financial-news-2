Cocoa rebounded from an 11-week low
as violence persisted in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
producer. Coffee declined, and sugar rose.  Fighters loyal to Ivory Coast President-elect Alassane Ouattara have attacked the residence of  Laurent Gbagbo , who
refused to step down after a November election. Prices jumped as
much as 35 percent since the vote.  “Enough questions remain about Ivory Coast to prevent more
aggressive selling,” said Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country
Hedging in  St. Paul , Minnesota. “Traders may be factoring in
long-term concerns,” as the unrest could cause infrastructure-
related delays for exports, he said.  Cocoa for May delivery jumped $59, or 2 percent, to settle
at $3,011 a metric ton at 12:17 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price touched $2,925, the lowest for a most-
active contract since Jan. 13. The commodity dropped 7.1 percent
this week.  Estimated open interest, the aggregate number of contracts
outstanding, was 168,846, the highest since March 2008.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery dropped 4.25 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.599 a pound in New York. The price climbed
9.8 percent in the first quarter, the ninth straight increase.  “People may be concerned that demand will diminish” after
the rally, said Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodity brokerage in Medford, Oregon. “We’ll have
new supplies shortly, as we are going into the Brazil harvest
next month.”  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery gained 0.33 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 27.44 cents a pound in New York.  On  London ’s NYSE Liffe, cocoa and refined sugar advanced,
while robusta coffee slumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
