Libya ’s rebels will accept a cease-
fire with Muammar Qaddafi’s forces if their demands for freedoms
are met, said Mustafa Abdel Jalil, head of the rebel National
Transitional Council, during a news conference televised today
from their stronghold of Benghazi.  The rebels are seeking a prisoner swap with Qaddafi’s
forces, Abdel Jalil said in the joint briefing with a United
Nations special envoy who arrived in the eastern city today.  The anti-Qaddafi fighters captured 42 members of Qaddafi’s
military and handed them back to their families in the east, the
rebel leader said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
