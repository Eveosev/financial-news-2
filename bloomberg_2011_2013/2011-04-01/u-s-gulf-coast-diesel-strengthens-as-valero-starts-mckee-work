The premium for ultra-low-sulfur
diesel fuel in the Gulf Coast widened for the first time in a
week as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  started work on a hydrocracker at
its McKee refinery in Texas.  The turnaround on the 30,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker is
scheduled to last 24 days, the company said in February.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf Coast
versus heating oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  widened 0.63 cent to 3.38 cents a gallon at 2:14 p.m.
in New York. The premium last gained on March 25. Prompt
delivery rose 0.75 cent to $3.1583 a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor was unchanged at 11.5 cents below gasoline futures
on the exchange. Prompt delivery rose 2.72 cents to $3.0198 a
gallon.  The fuel reversed an earlier 1.75-cent gain as  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) 
was said to plan the start of a fluid catalytic cracker and a
crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery next week, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
