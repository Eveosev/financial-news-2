Goodrich Corp. (GR)  said it will buy
Microtecnica S.r.l. for 330 million euros ($468 million) to add

and regional aircraft.  Microtecnica, owned by SSCP Aero Holdings S.C.A., employs
about 700 people at sites in Turin, Luserna San Giovanni and

Co., a provider of seating, furniture, veneers and cabin
management systems for the business jet market, for about $280
million. It also acquired U.K.-based Crompton Technology Group
Ltd., a composite products maker, for an undisclosed sum.  “This acquisition supports our business model and fits
with our strategy by increasing Goodrich’s exposure to three
growth markets,” Goodrich Chief Executive Officer Marshall Larsen said in today’s statement  Microtecnica’s customers include Finmeccanica SpA’s
AugustaWestland helicopter unit and Alenia Aeronautica division,
Bombardier Inc. and European Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co.’s
Eurocopter business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
